Although the steps of substrate capture and product release are essential in the enzymatic process, complete atomic-level descriptions of these steps are difficult to obtain because of the transient nature of the intermediate conformations, which makes them largely inaccessible to standard structure determination methods. We describe here the determination of the structure of a low-population intermediate in the product release process by human lysozyme through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. We validate this structure by rationally designing two mutations, the first engineered to destabilise the intermediate and the second to stabilise it, thus slowing down or speeding up, respectively, product release. These results illustrate how product release by an enzyme can be facilitated by the presence of a metastable intermediate with transient weak interactions between the enzyme and product.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02777.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02777.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Enzymes are proteins that catalyse biochemical reactions. They bind to their target molecules—known as substrates—and help to change them to make ‘products’. Afterwards, the products are released and the enzymes are free to bind to the next molecules. To perform this activity, an enzyme can change its structure several times, but it has been challenging to characterise the intermediate shapes because of their transient nature.</p><p>De Simone et al. took advantage of a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to get a better look at the structures adopted by the human enzyme lysozyme. This enzyme helps to protect us from bacterial infections because it breaks the links between peptidoglycan molecules, which make up the wall that surrounds bacterial cells.</p><p>The experiments show that two ‘arms’ in the lysozyme structure move to create an intermediate shape during the final step—the release of the product—in the chemical reaction. This type of flexibility gives the enzyme the ability to tightly bind the peptidoglycan at the start and to let go of the product when the chemical reaction is complete.</p><p>Next, to confirm their findings, De Simone et al. examined what happened when they introduced particular mutations in the gene that makes lysozyme. The first mutation was meant to destabilise the intermediate shape of the enzyme, which resulted in the enzyme binding more tightly to the peptidoglycan in the final step and releasing it more slowly. A second mutation was made to stabilize the structure of the intermediate shape, which, as expected, allowed lysozyme to release the peptidoglycan more quickly.</p><p>De Simone et al.'s findings explain how intermediate shapes can be involved in the release of the product from lysozyme and other enzymes. The next challenges will be to characterise the structure of the intermediate shape that binds to the substrate and, more generally, to extend this type of approach to other enzymes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02777.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02777.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>NMR spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>residual dipolar coupling</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Simone</surname><given-names>Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Simone</surname><given-names>Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Simone</surname><given-names>Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vendruscolo</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vendruscolo</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Product release from human lysozyme is mediated by an intermediate state with transient weak interactions between the product and enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As it is becoming increasingly clear that proteins populate a variety of ‘intermediate’ states during their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>), it is essential to determine the structures of such states in addition to defining the native conformations. Protein intermediates are involved in folding, misfolding, and aggregation processes, as well as in events associated with molecular recognition, catalysis, and allostery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2013</xref>). These species are transient in nature and as such they have been difficult to characterise. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has emerged in this context as a powerful technique to define such states as exemplified by the characterisation of the structures of species involved in folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korzhnev et al., 2010</xref>), molecular recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2006</xref>), and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neudecker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the present paper, we describe a study of the mechanism involved in the process by which an enzyme releases its products. This is one of the three major steps in an enzymatic catalysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fersht, 1999</xref>). In the first step, the enzyme forms a complex with the substrate. In the second step, the transition state of the reaction is reached within the favourable environment provided by the catalytic site enabling the conversion of the substrate into product. In the third step, which is often rate-limiting, the product is released and the enzyme returns to its original state. Each of these steps is usually rather complex and involves reaction intermediates, which are transient in nature and difficult to characterise.</p><p>In order to investigate the third step, we have studied here lysozyme, the first enzyme to be crystallised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 1965</xref>), and whose structural properties have been characterised in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artymiuk and Blake, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radford et al., 1992</xref>). The native structure of this enzyme is divided into a α domain (residues 1 to 38, and 86 to 130) and β domain (residues 39 to 85), containing primarily α-helical and β-sheet secondary structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artymiuk and Blake, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radford et al., 1992</xref>). This enzyme degrades bacterial cell walls by catalysing the hydrolysis of the 1,4-β-linkages of the cell wall peptidoglycans, with a reaction that has been the object of intense scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chipman and Sharon, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warshel and Levitt, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Post et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vocadlo et al., 2001</xref>). According to the mechanism originally proposed by Phillips on the basis of his structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips, 1967</xref>), lysozyme binds to a peptidoglycan molecule in the binding site within the cleft between its two domains thus causing the substrate to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state of the hydrolysis. Here, we study the product release process. To this end, we used a well-characterised oligosaccharide product having an inhibitory effect on the enzyme, N,N',N“-triacetylchitotriose (triNAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turner and Howell, 1995</xref>), which has been frequently used for studying lysozyme–product interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Post et al., 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In order to define the structural populations of human lysozyme in the presence and in the absence of an inhibitor, we measured <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tjandra and Bax, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tolman et al., 1997</xref>) in the ligand-free and ligand-bound states (see ‘Materials and methods’) and used them as structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Simone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montalvao et al., 2011</xref>). In this way, we determined two ensembles of structures of the enzyme representing, respectively, the ligand-free and the ligand-bound states of this protein. Our results indicate that large-scale concerted motions between the α and β domains of the enzyme generate an intermediate state involved in the release of the product.</p><p>The use of RDCs as structural restraints assists the conformational sampling in molecular dynamics simulations in order to estimate the free-energy landscape of a protein, as recently shown with hen lysozyme for which a large body of experimental data were used for validation purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2013b</xref>). This approach enables the translation of the experimental measurements into structures according to the principle of maximum entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pitera and Chodera, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roux and Weare, 2013</xref>). A number of methods to employ NMR measurements of RDCs for the characterisation of the structure and dynamics of proteins have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clore and Schwieters, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouvignies et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). Since these approaches have generally been used to assess dynamic events of relatively small amplitude, it was necessary to derive a means of extending these methods to enable the description of the large conformational interconversions associated with the function of many protein molecules.</p><p>The strategy that we have used for this purpose relies on the ability to extract from time and spatially averaged data the contributions to the experimental observables that come from the low-population states present as a result of conformational fluctuations. Intermediate states determined in this way have been already described using paramagnetic resonance enhancement (PRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2006</xref>) and RDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Simone et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2013b</xref>) measurements, complementing approaches in which NMR parameters specific for these states are obtained directly, in particular by relaxation–dispersion methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korzhnev et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouvignies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neudecker et al., 2012</xref>). By applying this approach using RDCs to human lysozyme, we generated a structural ensemble representing the free state of this enzyme that reveals large breathing motions between the α and β domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2</xref>). This motion, which influences the mutual orientation of the two domains thereby altering the structure of the catalytic pocket at their interface, can be accounted for by defining a ‘breathing’ angle θ between the α-domain, the hinge region and the β-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2013b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the free-energy landscapes of human lysozyme in the free state (<bold>A</bold>) and in the bound state with triNAG (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>The bound state exhibits a ground state (the ‘locked state’) and an additional local minimum with about 13% population (the ‘unlocked state’), which represents an intermediate in the release of the product of the enzymatic reaction.

The unlocked state is a compact conformation that differs from the locked state by a global motion in which the α and β subunits become closer, with a θ value of about 49° in the centre of the basin. This motion generates particularly distorted structures with global RMSD values of about 1.5 Å from the X-ray structure. The angle θ provides a simple and effective reaction coordinate to describe the effect of triNAG binding on the energy landscape of human lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which clearly illustrates how the protein is able to explore closed conformations (i.e., θ &lt; 50°) upon ligand binding.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the interactions that stabilise the intermediate state in the release of the product (the ‘unlocked state’).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Free-energy landscape as a function of the angle θ.

A comparison between the locked and unlocked conformations indicates that this difference corresponds to specific interactions between the substrate and the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which include hydrophobic interactions between a methyl group of triNAG and the side-chain of W109, as well as hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the main chain amide group of N60 and the side chains of W64 and Q104. These interactions are present in essentially all the structures in the ensemble representing the locked state, while they are absent in the structures in the ensemble of the unlocked state. Indeed, because of a partial displacement of the ligand from the binding pocket, the unlocked conformations lose the tight interactions that are stabilised in the locked state and gain new interactions on the external surface of the protein. These interactions, which mainly involve hydrogen bonds between donor and acceptor groups from the ligand and the protein surface, are highly variable and heterogeneous in the unlocked conformations.</p><p>Overall, this analysis of the structural ensembles of human lysozyme suggests that, as a consequence of a concerted conformational transition, the enzyme explores conformations in which the specific and tight intermolecular interactions with the substrate in its locked state are largely lost in favour of the formation of weak and non-specific interactions in its unlocked state. This transition is favoured by large-scale conformational motions in which the α and β domains become closer, thus suggesting that these motions are employed by the enzyme to modulate the affinity with the ligand. The unlocked state therefore represents an intermediate state for product release. In this view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the enzyme product complex (EP) populates transiently an intermediate state (EP*) that favours the release of the product (E + P). Thus, the analysis of the structural ensembles that we have determined provides evidence that large-scale conformational transitions are employed by enzymes along their catalytic cycles including key events in the product release step, which often represents the rate-limiting step that governs the turnover of the enzyme. The difficulty for enzymes to release the products can arise from the fact that typically the latter have similar physico-chemical characteristics to the substrates and therefore maintain a significant affinity for the enzyme.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the process of product release.</title><p>The product (P) is released by the enzyme (E) in a process that begins in the ground (or ‘locked’) state of the complex (EP), visits a metastable (or ‘unlocked’) intermediate state (EP*) and reaches the unbound state (E + P).

These two residues are too far away from each other in the locked state to form a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and therefore this interaction is characteristic only of the unlocked conformation. This finding suggests that this hydrogen bond provides a specific interaction by which one could selectively target the stability of the EP* intermediate. To this end, we rationally designed the N44A single-amino acid mutation to verify if the ability of the enzyme to release the products is indeed altered by preventing the formation of the hydrogen bond that stabilises the unlocked state.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Experimental assessment of the role of the intermediate state determined in this work in the product release process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the unlocked state illustrating the hydrogen bond between side chains of N44 and E35 that stabilises this intermediate species.

This result was expected as the mutation does not modify interactions present in the native state but was designed explicitly to perturb a hydrogen bond in the intermediate state. The ability of the N44A variant to release triNAG from its bound state was assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By using a double-referenced single chain model (see ‘Materials and methods’), we estimated that the destabilisation of the intermediate in the N44A mutant reduces the k<sub>off</sub> by a factor 3, while changing the K<sub>d</sub> by a factor 1/3. The variation of a factor 2 of the k<sub>on</sub> suggests that the pathways of capture and release are not completely distinct and thus perturbing the pathway for release affects in part also that of capture. These results are consistent with our prediction that the N44A mutation affects the stability of the EP* intermediate, that is, of the unlocked state. Finally, we tested the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type and N44A mutant by using a cellular assay (see ‘Materials and methods’), and compared these results with those obtained for an inactive mutational variant lacking the catalytic residue (E35D). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) show that the N44A variant has an intermediate activity between wild type and the totally inactive control E35D variant, which is again consistent with the prediction that the mutation of asparagine to alanine of residue 44 would reduce the efficiency of the product release in such a way to affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Finally, to verify that the N44A modified the free-energy landscape of lysozyme by reducing the population of the unlocked state, we performed <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H RDC measurements on the N44A mutant and carried out restrained molecular dynamics simulations to determine its free-energy landscape. The results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) demonstrate that the unlocked state is not appreciably populated in the N44A mutant.</p><p>To further validate the conclusion that the structure that we have determined of the unlocked state represents a release intermediate, we designed a second mutational variant to stabilise the unlocked state, rather than destabilising it as the N44A mutation. In the new mutant, N46Q/V110Q, a strong glutamine–glutamine interaction is inserted with the purpose to stabilise the ‘unlocked’ state in its conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We have verified the folding of the mutant by NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and measured the binding constants of the ligand for the unlocked state by SPR to show that it corresponds to a weaker binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). While the K<sub>d</sub> of the wild type is about 9 μM, the K<sub>d</sub> of the N46Q/V110Q mutant is high almost beyond detection, indicating that the mutant essentially does not bind the substrate. These experimentally measured binding constants are consistent with the observation that, considering that the free energy of the free state is the same, the binding free energy of the locked state is larger than that of the unlocked state because the free energy of the former is lower than that of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have presented the atomic resolution structure of an intermediate associated with the product release in an enzymatic reaction. We have validated this structure by identifying a distinctive structural characteristic of this state, a transient hydrogen bond between the side-chains of residues N44 and E35. As this interaction stabilises the intermediate state but not the ground state, we introduced a mutational variant (N44A) that, by removing specifically the hydrogen bond, reduces the stability of the intermediate state but not that of the ground state and thus inhibits the release process. Our results provide an illustration of the manner in which conformational fluctuations can play a central role in enzymatic reactions by creating low-population intermediate states that facilitate the challenging step of release of the products of the catalytic reaction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Human lysozyme was expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> and purified on an ion exchange column, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and et al., 2005</xref>). <sup>15</sup>N ammonium sulfate and <sup>13</sup>C methanol were used to <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C label the protein, respectively.

We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalli et al., 2013</xref>), however, that it is possible to effectively achieve this limit even if the values of <italic>M</italic> and <italic>α</italic> remain relatively small and thus obtain conformational ensembles that provide a good agreement between experimental and calculated observables. Following these procedures, we used here <italic>M = 16</italic> and for the weight, <italic>α</italic>, we first carried out an initial equilibration simulation at 310 K, during which the agreement between the calculated and experimental data was allowed to converge by gradually raising α to the largest possible value that did not generate numerical instabilities. Subsequently, we performed a series of 50 cycles of simulated annealing between 310 and 500 K to sample the conformational space. Each cycle was carried out for a total of 250 ps (125,000 molecular dynamics steps). For each cycle, we collected 24,000 structures (1 per ps in the final 50 ps of the final 30 cycles of each of the 16 replicas). These structures were employed for the analyses reported in this study.</p><p>The alignment tensor is calculated from the shape and charge of the protein molecule using a procedure recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montalvao et al., 2011</xref>). We adopted such an approach here rather than the more commonly used singular value decomposition (SVD) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clore and Schwieters, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clore and Schwieters, 2004a</xref>) because in the presence of conformational fluctuations of relatively large amplitude, such as those exhibited by hen lysozyme, the SVD method, when used in combination with the replica-averaging procedure of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equations 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">5</xref>, is less effective in capturing the motions of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2013b</xref>). The reason is that the SVD method does not necessarily provide the actual alignment tensor of a given structure but rather the alignment tensor that generates the RDC values in the closest agreement with the experimental ones and hence is less well suited in describing the specific differences between the structures considered in the averaging procedure in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation (3)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montalvao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Simone et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>This structure-based method was used here to calculate the orientations of lysozyme in two alignment media, one steric (DMPC/DHPC) and one electrostatic (DMPC/DHPC/CTAB). The Q factors for the refined ensembles of the free and bound states of human lysozyme were 0.10 in both cases.</p><p>In addition to the previous extensive benchmarks performed on the structural ensembles of the hen egg white lysozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Simone et al., 2013a</xref>), which were obtained using the same protocol employed in this work, we performed here a set of additional validations based on NMR measurements not used as restraints in the simulations and by comparing the resulting experimental values with those back-calculated from our ensemble of human lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Mutagenesis</title><p>N44A mutation and E35D or D53N (control mutations) were introduced into the pPIC9/HuLys wt by using <italic>QuikChange</italic> XL II mutagenesis kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands).

Your article has been handled by John Kuriyan (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three additional reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a fine piece of work that is overall very well performed and the conclusions logically drawn. The results further highlight the importance of characterizing lowly populated conformational states. Nevertheless, the reviewers are also in agreement that some additional data would be needed to make the conclusions more compelling. We ask that you respond by email to the points raised below, paying particular attention to the major points. Your response should tell us how you could address these issues in a realistic timeframe. A final decision on your paper will be made after the reviewers have considered your response.</p><p>Ensembles of structures of the enzyme lysozyme were determined by combining NMR-detected RDCs and MD simulations to structurally characterize an intermediate species along the enzymatic pathway. In particular, the paper analyzes NMR data using a method called ensemble-average molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis was carried out on the ligand-free and the ligand-bound states of the enzyme. The data show that the ground state (∼87%) exists in the locked state (the one wherein the product is still bound to the enzyme) and in equilibrium with an energetically excited state (populated ∼13% of the time), which allows product release (termed the unlocked state). The two states are related by an opening/closure of the ligand-binding cleft by ∼10 degrees.</p><p>The unlocked state with the bound ligand is a compact conformation that differs from the locked state by a global motion, with global RMSD values of about 1.5 Å relative to the X-ray structure. The unlocked conformations lose the tight interactions that are stabilized in the locked state and gain new interactions on the external surface of the protein. These interactions, which mainly involve hydrogen bonds between donors and acceptors groups from the ligand and the protein surface, are highly variable and heterogeneous in the unlocked conformations. It is hypothesized that the unlocked state represents an intermediate state that is critical for fast product release. The authors then identified a stabilizing hydrogen bond that can be formed only in the unlocked state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which involves side-chain atoms of residue N44 E35. The ability of the N44A variant to release triNAG from its bound state was assessed by SPR. The dissociation constants of the wild-type and the N44A variant to be, respectively, 4.19 sec-1 and 1.31 sec-1. This provides a degree of cross-validation that this state is in fact important for release.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) One weakness identified by the reviewers is that it is only a speculation that the ligand is more loosely bound in the “unlocked” state. The authors provide no firm basis for this assertion. The paper provides only one mutant to test the key concept that there is an unlocked state. Based on the available information, it seems that one should be able to design a mutant that stabilizes the unlocked state. If so, then one could: (1) confirm the existence of the state directly by NMR, (2) measure the binding constants (kinetics and equilibrium) of the ligand for the unlocked state by SPR to show that it is indeed faster and with a weaker binding affinity. From a computational point of view, it should be possible to calculate the binding free energy of the ligand for the locked and unlocked state, and show that the affinity is reduced in the latter. Doing this additional work is substantial, but it would really demonstrate that the conclusions are correct.</p><p>2) It might be thought that the RDC approach for detecting rare states would be inferior to other approaches, like relaxation dispersion or PREs. In the case of relaxation dispersion one relies on the fact that the minor state is only transiently formed so that its effective linewidth is very large. Thus, the exchange process gives rise to a net increased linewidth in the ground state that can be detected. In a similar manner, as long as the excited state brings the NMR probes close to the spin label, a PRE effect is observed in the ground state. By contrast, however, RDCs contain information about each state and it is unlikely that the rare state has RDCs that are so different relative to the ground state, making this approach potentially less sensitive. Can the authors comment on the sensitivity of their method in general to studies of rare conformations? How much lower than 15% can one go and how robust are the states that are determined?</p><p>3) In this regard, the authors do address the robustness with their N44A mutant and this is an important control. It would be very interesting to record RDC on this mutant (free form) and show that the same profile as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is observed. Second, it would then be of great interest to add the product to the N44A mutant, measure RDC and repeat the calculations. One would predict that the rare conformer would become less populated, less than 15%, and that would provide further important proof of the methodology that jives with the functional (release) studies that they perform. These controls are not particularly onerous but they would be very convincing. At issue here to some extent is the reliability of RDCs for dynamics, and there has been much debate in the literature about this (especially when one considers the fact that methods for estimating RDCs from structure are only approximate, especially for electrostatic alignment, or methods for dealing with the effects of averaging between multi-states again can be complex). This work opens up an approach for looking at rare states, and further evidence of utility is important.</p><p>4) Although not necessary, have the authors considered experiments to show that the initial binding step of substrate is unaffected by the N44A mutation, as would be predicted since the ground state is unaffected?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02777.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One weakness identified by the reviewers is that it is only a speculation that the ligand is more loosely bound in the “unlocked” state.

To take account of them, we have used the structure of the intermediate that we calculated to rationally design a new mutant meant to stabilise the unlocked state. In the new mutant, N46Q/V110Q, a strong glutamine-glutamine interaction is inserted with the purpose to effectively block the ‘unlocked’ state in its conformation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>We have verified the folding of the new mutant by NMR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3B</xref>) and measured the binding constants of the ligand for the unlocked state by SPR to show that it corresponds to a weaker binding affinity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3C</xref>).<table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>k<sub>on</sub> (M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>)</th><th>St. Err</th><th>k<sub>off</sub> (s<sup>-1</sup>)</th><th>St. Err</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WT</td><td>75</td><td>1</td><td>6.7E-04</td><td>2E-05</td></tr><tr><td>N46Q/V110Q</td><td>13</td><td>nd</td><td>1.4E+04</td><td>nd</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>While the Kd of the wild type is about 9 uM, the Kd of the N46Q/V110Q mutant is high almost beyond detection, indicating that the mutant essentially does not bind the substrate. These experimentally measured binding constants are consistent with the observation that, considering that the free energy of the free state is the same, the binding free energy of the locked state is larger than that of the unlocked state because the free energy of the former is lower than that of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to validate the design procedure of the mutational variants with modified stability of the unlocked state, we have performed new RDC measurements of the N44A variant and used them to determine the corresponding free energy landscape (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). We have not repeated this NMR analysis for the N46Q/V110Q mutant since the measurements of the binding constants provided already clear indications of the success of the design procedure. If the editors, however, believe that we should perform the additional NMR analysis also on the second mutant we will be happy to do so.</p><p><italic>2) It might be thought that the RDC approach for detecting rare states would be inferior to other approaches, like relaxation dispersion or PREs.

In the revised version of the manuscript we have addressed the issue of the sensitivity of the approach that we have used, and briefly reviewed previous publications in which we have demonstrated that it can be employed to characterise populations as low as those studied here (De Simone et al., JACS 131, 3810-3811, 2009; J. Chem., Theor. Comput., 7, 4189-4195, 2011; Biochemistry 52, 6684-6694, 2013; Biochemistry 52, 6480-6486, 2013).</p><p><italic>3) In this regard, the authors do address the robustness with their N44A mutant and this is an important control.

The new results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2a</xref>) demonstrate that the unlocked state is not populated in the N44A mutant, as expected from its rational design and the measurement of the binding constants reported in the original version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) Although not necessary, have the authors considered experiments to show that the initial binding step of substrate is unaffected by the N44A mutation, as would be predicted since the ground state is unaffected</italic>?</p><p>We have checked whether the binding step is affected by the N44A mutation.<table-wrap id="tblu2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>k<sub>on</sub> (M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>)</th><th>St. Err</th><th>k<sub>off</sub> (s<sup>-1</sup>)</th><th>St. Err</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>WT</td><td>75</td><td>1</td><td>6.7E-04</td><td>2E-05</td></tr><tr><td>N44A</td><td>38.7</td><td>0.7</td><td>2.5E-04</td><td>3E-05</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The destabilisation of the intermediate in the N44A mutant brings down the k<sub>off</sub> by a factor 3, while changing the K<sub>d</sub> by a factor 1/3.
