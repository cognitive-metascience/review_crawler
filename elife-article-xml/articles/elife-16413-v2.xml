changing environmental conditions, while destruction of foreign RNA is an important mechanism to prevent host infection. We have identified a virus-encoded protein termed gp37/Dip, which directly binds and inhibits the RNA degradation machinery of its bacterial host. Encoded by giant phage фKZ, this protein associates with two RNA binding sites of the RNase E component of the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> RNA degradosome, occluding them from substrates and resulting in effective inhibition of RNA degradation and processing. The 2.2 Å crystal structure reveals that this novel homo-dimeric protein has no identifiable structural homologues. Our biochemical data indicate that acidic patches on the convex outer surface bind RNase E. Through the activity of Dip, фKZ has evolved a unique mechanism to down regulate a key metabolic process of its host to allow accumulation of viral RNA in infected cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16413.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16413.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</kwd><kwd>RNA degradosome</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>RNA metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0599.11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van den Bossche</surname><given-names>An</given-names></name><name><surname>Ceyssens</surname><given-names>Pieter-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Hendrix</surname><given-names>Hanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavigne</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003132</institution-id><institution>Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBO 100042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van den Bossche</surname><given-names>An</given-names></name><name><surname>Ceyssens</surname><given-names>Pieter-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavigne</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van den Bossche</surname><given-names>An</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hardwick</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name><name><surname>Luisi</surname><given-names>Ben F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004497</institution-id><institution>Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GOA Bacteriophage Biosystems</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aertsen</surname><given-names>Abram</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavigne</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name><name><surname>De Maeyer</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004497</institution-id><institution>Onderzoeksraad, KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREA/09/017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aertsen</surname><given-names>Abram</given-names></name><name><surname>Lavigne</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A bacteriophage remodels the RNA metabolism machinery of a bacterial host to sequentially clear host transcripts and then stabilize the viral RNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of RNA turnover following transcription is vital in the regulation and quality control of gene expression. In γ-proteobacteria, several key constituents of the mRNA decay machinery are assembled in the membrane-associated RNA degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aït-Bara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marcaida et al., 2006</xref>). In the paradigm <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA degradosome, this complex is built around the hydrolytic endoribonuclease RNase E, which initiates the rate-limiting step in RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Campo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McDowall et al., 1995</xref>). Subsequent degradation is carried out by the 3’-5’ phosphorolytic exoribonuclease PNPase (polynucleotide phosphorylase) assisted by the ATP-dependent helicase RhlB (both of which are components of the degradosome assembly) and is completed by an oligo-ribonuclease which is not associated to the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evguenieva-Hackenberg and Klug, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Górna et al., 2012</xref>). The protein composition of the RNA degradosome varies among proteobacteria and during various stages of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carabetta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>RNase E, a member of the RNase E/G family, is a tetrameric enzyme and can be broadly divided into two functional halves. The N-terminal half (NTH) comprises the catalytic domain, while the non-conserved C-terminal half (CTH) is natively unstructured and acts as a scaffold to assemble the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aït-Bara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaghan et al., 2005</xref>). Despite the predicted lack of structure within the scaffold domain, several short segments having structural propensity were identified in the <italic>E. coli</italic> CTH that mediate the interaction between RNase E and the cell membrane, enolase and PNPase. Moreover, the CTH contains two arginine-rich regions that have been shown to bind RNA: the RNA binding domain (RBD)/Arginine-rich region 1 (AR1) and AR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callaghan et al., 2004</xref>). The activity and specificity of the RNA degradosome is under complex regulation and is influenced by several factors including riboregulation by small, non-coding RNAs (sRNA) and proteins RraA and RraB (‘Regulators of RNase Activity A and B’) that inhibit the activity of RNase E by binding to the CTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Górna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>During infection, lytic bacteriophages create a favourable environment for the generation of progeny by influencing the activity and specificity of host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roucourt and Lavigne, 2009</xref>). Three cases have been reported in which the machinery of RNA decay is a target of phage effector proteins. In one, <italic>E. coli</italic> phage T7 heavily phosphorylates the CTH of RNase E and RhlB, leading to the inhibition of RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>). In a second example, the Srd protein encoded by <italic>E. coli</italic> phage T4 was found to increase the activity of RNase E on host mRNA by binding to the catalytic NTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). This may account for earlier observations that, during infection by phage T4, the host mRNA was destabilized while the phage mRNA was stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ueno and Yonesaki, 2004</xref>). Finally, an increase in the expression of RNase E was observed during the infection of <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> MED4 by cyanophage P-SSP7, due to elevated levels of an RNase E mRNA variant lacking the 5’UTR responsible for the negative feedback regulation of the gene. In parallel, antisense RNAs derived from the phage sequester the P-SSP7 transcriptome to form dsRNA, which is subsequently protected from degradation by RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sesto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stazic et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2011</xref>).</p><p>Being one of seven known genera of lytic phages infecting <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, giant ‘фKZ-like’ bacteriophages form a remote branch of myoviruses. The фKZ virus type possesses an unusually large 280 kb genome with little evolutionary relation to other known genera. Its genomic G/C content is remarkably low (36.3%) in comparison to its host <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, implying a short history of co-evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mesyanzhinov et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, фKZ infection causes more than five-fold increase in total cellular RNA, suggesting that the phage affects <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RNA biogenesis and breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceyssens et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to understand the фKZ infection process and its impact on RNA metabolism, we identified potential interaction targets of viral proteins in the opportunistic pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceyssens et al., 2014</xref>). By performing a screen based on affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we observed that a previously uncharacterised phage protein specifically binds to two RNA binding sites within the CTH of RNase E, and by doing so efficiently inhibits the RNA binding and degradation activity of the degradosome assembly. We have determined the structure of this protein (termed Dip, ‘degradosome interacting protein’) by X-ray crystallography and show that it forms an open-clamp like homo-dimeric structure, and binding of Dip to RNA binding regions within RNase E is characterized functionally and structurally. To our knowledge, Dip is the first known viral protein which effectively inhibits the RNA degradation activity of its host via a direct protein:protein interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A φKZ protein co-purifies with the RNA degradosome</title><p>To identify potential phage proteins that interact with the host RNA degradation machinery, a pull down experiment was designed in which a <italic>Strep</italic>-tag II was fused on the C-terminus of RNase E of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA01.

Two fragments (delineating the region 583–607 of RNase E) yielded a positive signal on selective medium for one vector combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, fragments A and E). However, this signal could not be confirmed using Miller assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For three other fragments (all-encompassing residues 756–835 of RNase E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> fragments C, F and I), a strong signal was produced for all vector combinations and could be positively confirmed in subsequent Miller assays (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B–C</xref>, fragments C, F and I). Combining these results, a clear interaction site can be defined within residues 756 to 835, while a weak second interaction site may be present within residues 583–607. These binding sites were subsequently verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> demonstrates that the mobility of Dip is altered upon addition of increasing concentrations of 583–607 (fused to a GST-tag), with all of the Dip being shifted at an approximate 10-fold excess of the RNase E fragment. When using a slightly larger fragment of RNase E (residues 583–636), Dip is shifted completely by only a four-fold excess of the GST-fusion protein. This suggests that efficient Dip binding requires a larger region of RNase E than the first defined segment of residues 583–607.

Since no shift of the RNA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we conclude that Dip is not an RNA binding protein.

Secondary structure prediction of this RNase E peptide in isolation suggested a high propensity towards a helical conformation. Therefore, this helical form of the peptide was used in a docking experiment intended to scan the complete surface of Dip with the DOT docking program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). The best energetically ranked complexes show binding of the peptide to a negatively charged patch on the outer surface of the Dip-dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B–C</xref>).</p><p>To verify the in-silico docking results Dip was co-crystallized with the 756–775 peptide of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RNase E. Hexagonal crystals of Dip were obtained containing an apparent ring-like hexamer of Dip formed through crystallographic symmetry. Discontinuous density was observed on the surface of Dip in the DOT docking predicted acidic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Processing the X-ray diffraction data in the lower symmetry P1 space group visibly improved the density for the RNase E peptide, and we were able to cautiously model eight amino acids of the peptide into this density. The model of Dip bound to the short RNase E recognition peptide (Dip:RNaseE<sub>756-775</sub>) indicated significant contacts are made between residues Asp 137, Asp138, Glu 214 and Glu 222 of Dip and the RNase E peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). To confirm the importance of these residues in the interaction between the two proteins, several mutants of Dip were generated where the acidic residues on the surface of Dip were substituted for alanine. A double mutation of Glu 214 and Glu 222 to alanine was sufficient to completely abolish the interaction with both Dip binding sites on RNase E when assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Moreover, the in vivo expression of the Dip-E214A/E222A mutant using the pHERD20T vector restored the wild type phenotype compared to the curly morphology obtained by in vivo Dip expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, electron density for an unknown small molecule ligand can be seen in this region in the structure of apo-Dip, which we have modelled as a single arginine amino acid. The E214A-E222A mutant of Dip was subsequently crystallized in the same P2<sub>1</sub> space group as the wild type Dip protein, and amino acid mutations were confirmed by the absence of electron density for glutamate side chains at positions 214 and 222 in the 2.2 angstrom resolution map. There were no other significant alterations to the local or overall structure of Dip (data not shown). These data show that the acidic patch on the outer surface of Dip is crucial for the interaction with RNase E, and both of the RNA binding segments of RNase E engage Dip via this region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The RNA degradosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) plays a pivotal role in bacterial post-transcriptional gene regulation, ensuring efficient transcript degradation and processing. In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells infected with giant phage фKZ, we have identified a viral protein ‘gp37/Dip’ which binds to the putative RNA degradosome assembly. The binding targets of this <underline>d</underline>egradosome <underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein could be clearly defined as two RNA-binding sites within the C-terminus of RNase E (residues 583–636 and 756–775). Our in vitro assays indicate that RNAs bound to these two RNA binding sites are displaced by Dip. Thus, the interaction of Dip with these segments inhibits the activity of the RNA degradosome in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first viral protein identified which uses a direct interaction with the RNA degradosome to inhibit its function. Therefore, Dip can be considered as a viral functional equivalent of the bacterial RraA and RraB (‘regulators of RNase activity’) proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which inhibit the activity of RNase E by binding to specific regions of the CTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Górna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16413.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the working mechanism of Dip.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The wild type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> degradsome consisting of the RNase E subunit (blue), the ATP-dependent RNA helicase RhlB (red) and the PNPase (beige).

The unique structure of this protein resembles a partially opened scroll or a clamp, and it is tempting to imagine that the two protomers of Dip could act as pincers to capture a binding partner at the dimer interface. However, through a combination of structural, biochemical and bioinformatics analyses we can conclude that the binding site for RNase E is actually on the outer surfaces of the Dip dimer, and not within the “clamp”.</p><p>Since one dimer of Dip possesses two binding sites on its surface, several possible RNase E binding models can be envisaged. In one scenario, two independent dimers might each bind to a RNA binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) or alternatively a single dimer may engage both sites at the same time, although the latter would require the two RNA binding segments to be in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Finally, the possibility that a single Dip dimer may bind to two separate RNase E protomers cannot be dismissed, especially considering that RNase E is a tetrameric enzyme, and the four protomers may be in proximity in a single degradosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>The question arises as to why the binding of Dip to the RNA-binding sites in the non-catalytic C-terminal region of RNase E should have a significant effect on the RNA processing and degrading activities of the catalytic N-terminal region of the enzyme. Our preferred explanation for these findings is that the RNA binding sites found in the CTH are particularly important for the recognition of RNA substrates that harbour secondary structure elements. Potentially these substrates require unwinding by an RNA helicase bound close to these regions of RNase E prior to cleavage by the NTH of RNase E. Therefore, the binding of structured RNAs to the RNA binding sites of the scaffold domain of RNase E can be crucial for efficient processing. In this respect phage φKZ and Dip act in a similar manner to phage T7 which phosphorylates the scaffold domain of RNase E to protect its transcripts from degradation by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Taking together our in vitro and in vivo results, it could be expected that the levels of RNA during a φKZ infection would be high, since both degradation of bacterial and phage RNA by the RNA degradosome are affected. Indeed, RNAseq data show that the total amount of cellular RNA extracted increased over five-fold during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ceyssens et al., 2014</xref>). However, it was found that 35 min after the start of infection, 98.5% of the non-rRNA and non-tRNA could be mapped to the phage genome, suggesting a decrease of host RNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that at the start of infection by φKZ the bacterial RNA might be actively degraded. The mechanism for this is unclear, but could involve inhibition of the host RNA polymerase to impede nascent transcript genesis, and in parallel, the acceleration of host RNA decay by a yet uncharacterized enzyme of φKZ or a φKZ encoded activator of the hosts RNA degradation machinery. The production of the degradosome activating protein Srd by phage T4 has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2015</xref>), and although a homologue of Srd cannot be identified in the φKZ genome it is plausible that a functionally equivalent protein may be produced during the early stage of infection. Subsequently, Dip is produced to inhibit the activity of the RNA degradosome and protect the newly synthesized phage RNA. Since Western blot analyses indicate that Dip persists once it is produced, the stability of phage RNA can be maintained during the entire infection cycle. It remains to be determined whether the production of Dip is essential for efficient infection by phage φKZ.</p><p>Dip is the third phage protein reported that has independently evolved to influence the activity of the RNA degradosome of its host, the others being gp0.7 of phage T7 which phosphorylates the scaffold domain of RNase E to protect its transcripts from degradation by the host, and Srd of phage T4 which enhances the activity of RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). The function of these proteins opens the possibility that the modulation of RNA degradosome activity might be a recurrent strategy of bacteriophages to support efficient phage infection. The inhibition of bacterial host nucleases by phage encoded proteins may be a more common strategy than had previously been appreciated. Recently it has been shown that the CRISPR-Cas system of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can be inhibited by several phage encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bondy-denomy et al., 2015</xref>), two of which act by binding and blocking DNA binding sites on the CRISPR-cas machinery, reminiscent of the mode of action of Dip. Moreover, the observation that Dip also has an inhibitory effect on the RNA degradosome of <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggests that the RNA binding sites within the CTD of RNase E are more conserved (either at sequence or structure level) than had previously been thought. Therefore, it can be speculated that there may exist functional homologues of Dip in other phages that target host machinery of RNA metabolism. Finally, the identification and biological understanding of the function of Dip opens the possibility of developing of new biotechnological tools to modulate RNA turn over and regulation in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, phages and media</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was used during all manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stover et al., 2000</xref>).

Detection was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vitro RNA degradation assay</title><p>A mixture of 0.05 µM RNA degradosome and 0.5 µM Dip in reaction buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.5U/ml of RNaseOUT) was incubated for 7 min at 37°C. Subsequently, the appropriate RNA fragment was added and incubated at 37°C. At certain time points, 10 µl aliquots were taken and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl proteinase K buffer (200 mM Tris pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 mg/ml Tritirachium album Proteinase K) and incubation at 50°C for 30 min. 10 µl RNA loading dye was added and the samples were boiled for 5 min at 95°C. Samples were loaded on an 8% denaturing 7 M urea 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel and run in TBE buffer for 1 hr in an electric field of 200 V. RNA was visualized with SYBR gold stain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Quantitative real-time PCR assays were carried out on a Rotor-Gene centrifugal real-time cycler (Qiagen) and analysis were performed on 3 µl of each sample in a total reaction volume of 15 µl using Absolute QPCR SYBR Green mix (Thermo Scientific) and 300 nM of both primers (Forward: GACGTACACGCGAAAGACCTG, Reverse: CTCGCCCAGAGCCATATTGTA). Thermocycles consisted of an initial 15 min denaturation at 95°C and 40 amplification cycles with an annealing temperature of 55.5°C according the manufacturer instructions. Quantification of the template was calculated from standard curves generated from a tenfold dilution series of genomic DNA, using the Rotor-Gene 6000 Series Software 1.7 (Qiagen). The data were normalized to the total RNA content of the samples and plotted in a semi-logaritmic graph. RNA half-lifes were calculated as the ln2/k, presuming first-order kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Expression of phage proteins in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>Dip was cloned into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to a pHERD20T-GW <italic>E. coli - P. aeruginosa</italic> shuttle vector using the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen).

The study, which includes a 2.2Å structure of Dip, is very complete and reveals yet another interesting mechanism by which bacteriophage proteins can interfere with the host cell.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the in vitro data are strong, the study would be more compelling with additional documentation that Dip affects RNA stability in vivo and/or further information about Dip activity throughout the infection cycle. Thus, the authors should carry out RNAseq normalized to the DNA content to show global RNA reduction following Dip expression. Carrying out such assays at several point during the infection cycle by a wt phage versus Dip deletion mutant would be a better than exogenous Dip expression from a plasmid.</p><p>2) One other experiment that could put the &quot;icing on the cake&quot; is to use the point mutants in Dip that reduce interaction with RNase E, and show that the mutant no longer exerts DIP's core functions.

Carrying out such assays at several point during the infection cycle by a wt phage versus Dip deletion mutant would be a better than exogenous Dip expression from a plasmid.</italic></p><p>We agree that more information about Dip activity in vivo throughout the infection cycle would be desirable, and as such we have now raised an antibody specific to Dip and have included a Western blot figure to show the levels of Dip protein persist during the phage infection cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Carrying out RNAseq analyses during φKZ infection is practically not feasible due to the difficulties in normalizing results. As demonstrated by Ceyssens et al. 2014, in parallel to the decay of host RNA, host DNA is degraded during infection by φKZ so that it is not possible to normalize data to the DNA content. Also, experiments comparing wild-type phage to a Dip deletion mutant are not currently possible because there are no readily available approaches to genetically manipulate phiKZ phages, hence the requirement of expression of exogenous Dip from a plasmid. An antisense RNA expression inhibition approach proved unsuccessful.</p><p> <italic>2) One other experiment that could put the &quot;icing on the cake&quot; is to use the point mutants in Dip that reduce interaction with RNase E, and show that the mutant no longer exerts DIP's core functions. Such a mutation would serve as an additional and possibly informative control, and bring the story &quot;full circle&quot;. If the authors have such data, if would be terrific to include.</italic></p><p>This is a very good suggestion. We have now performed experiments to over-express the Dip mutants that are no longer capable of binding to RNase E in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Cells expressing the mutants no longer have the crescent-shape morphology that follows expression of the wild type protein.
