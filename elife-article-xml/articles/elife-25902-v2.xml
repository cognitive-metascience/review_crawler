Here we report a novel principle of vertebrate cartilage growth that is based on introducing transversally-oriented clones into pre-existing cartilage. This mechanism of growth uncouples the lateral expansion of curved cartilaginous sheets from the control of cartilage thickness, a process which might be the evolutionary mechanism underlying adaptations of facial shape. In rod-shaped cartilage structures (Meckel, ribs and skeletal elements in developing limbs), the transverse integration of clonal columns determines the well-defined diameter and resulting rod-like morphology. We were able to alter cartilage shape by experimentally manipulating clonal geometries. Using in silico modeling, we discovered that anisotropic proliferation might explain cartilage bending and groove formation at the macro-scale.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25902.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25902.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chondrocranium</kwd><kwd>scaling and shaping</kwd><kwd>facial cartilage growth</kwd><kwd>mouse mutants</kwd><kwd>mathematical and material modelling</kwd><kwd>Wnt/PCP</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd><kwd>GSalpha</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 216-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaucka</surname><given-names>Marketa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003748</institution-id><institution>Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaucka</surname><given-names>Marketa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hellander</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Phillip T</given-names></name><name><surname>Chagin</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Kaj</given-names></name><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Phillip T</given-names></name><name><surname>Chagin</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Kaj</given-names></name><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006516</institution-id><institution>Bertil Hållstens Forskningsstiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Åke Wiberg Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adameyko</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The clonal oriented cell dynamics enables directional expansion and accurate scaling of sheet-like or rod-like cartilaginous elements and uncouples the mechanisms of elongation from thickness or diameter control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cartilage is an essential skeletal and supportive tissue in our body. The shape and size of each cartilage element results from complex developmental processes; mesenchymal cells initially condensate, differentiate into chondrocytes, and then an orchestrated growth of the entire structure occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldring et al., 2006</xref>). Often, cartilage plays an important role as a developmental intermediate, such as during the endochondral growth of the long-bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>). Cartilage elements vary widely in their shapes: they may be simple shapes like rods or bars (Meckel, cartilage templates of the future long bones and ribs) or sheet-like structures (in the head), but can be extremely complicated with a huge number of irregular shapes (for instance, in the inner ear or pelvis). The geometrical properties of cartilage elements must be fine-tuned during the growth because cartilage provides indispensable structural support to the body during development. Yet, how this is achieved despite drastic changes in size is unclear.</p><p>After early cartilage forms from mesenchymal condensations, growth typically occurs in all dimensions. However, the diversity of cell dynamics controlling precise early growth and shaping is not well studied. At the same time, the late growth of long rod-shaped cartilage elements in limbs is achieved through a mechanism of endochondral ossification that includes oriented cell dynamics in growth plate-like zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vortkamp et al., 1996</xref>). In the germinal zone of a growth plate, chondrocytes proliferate and produce progenies that form long streams oriented along the main axis of the forming skeletal element. Inside such streams, chondrocytes undergo flattening, oriented cell divisions and hypertrophy before dissipating and giving place to the forming bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nilsson et al., 2005</xref>), a process which is controlled by many signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>). This cell dynamic enables efficient extension of the skeletal element in a specific direction that coincides with the orientation of cell divisions in the proliferative zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2002</xref>). Growth plate disorders may result in dwarfism and other illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Luca, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Some parts of the cartilaginous skull (<italic>e.g.</italic> the basisphenoid of the chondrocranium) also undergo endochondrial ossification in synchondroses, and significant growth of the cranial base is achieved through a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wealthall and Herring, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Synchondroses are mirror-image growth plates arising in the cranial base, which primarily facilitate growth in the anterio-posterior direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kettunen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laurita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagayama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Young et al., 2006</xref>). Disorders in the development of synchondroses severely impact the elongation of the cranial base and often result in short-faced mutants and a general decrease of the cranial length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ford-Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma and Lozanoff, 1999</xref>). Insufficient or abnormal development of a cartilage element is one of the reasons for human craniofacial pathologies, providing a connection between the chondrocranium and facial bone geometry, size and placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The growth mechanism operating in growth plates and synchondroses involves the transformation of the cartilage into the bone. Since growth plates or synchondroses are oriented towards a specific direction, the expansion of a cartilage in other dimensions is not clear from the mechanistic point of view and requires further investigation. For example, although it is well known that the mouse chondrocranium develops as 14 independent pairs of cartilage elements that form one united structure, the logic behind further shaping and scaling remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hari et al., 2012</xref>). How these initially separated large cartilaginous elements form, grow and fine-tune their geometry, thickness and smoothness during development is still not completely understood. We hypothesized that accurate cartilage growth might require alternative cell dynamics that do not involve hypertrophy, ossification or growth plates.</p><p>Such alternative cell dynamics may also contribute to the accuracy of scaling during cartilage growth. Scaling is a process of growth that maintains both the shape and the proportions of the overall structure. In nature, scaling often involves sophisticated principles of directional growth and a number of feedback mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, during bird development, the diversity in beak shape is constrained by the dynamics of proliferative zones in the anterior face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritz et al., 2014</xref>).

Specifically, we found a complete absence of synchondroses and other endochondrial ossifications in the growing nasal capsule, even at the earliest postnatal stages, while membranous ossifications appeared well developed. The stereotypical clonal cell dynamics found in synchondroses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>) did not appear during the development of the nasal capsule. Therefore, during the entire embryonic development, chondrocranium growth and shaping is largely aided by additional and unknown mechanisms of growth.</p><p>To investigate another possible mechanism of growth, we examined the apical growth zone of the nasal capsule. To understand growth dynamics there, we birth-dated different regions of the facial cartilage using genetic tracing in <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> and <italic>Sox10-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2</italic> and <italic>Sox10-CreERT2</italic> lines recombine in committed chondrocyte progenitors and in mature chondrocytes. 3D analysis following tamoxifen injections at different developmental stages allowed us to identify the parts of the cartilage that develop from pre-existing chondrocytes and the regions generated from other cellular sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As an example, after genetic recombination induced at E12.5, locations with high amount of traced cells show structures that come from pre-existing cartilage, whereas areas comprising from non-traced cells present structures originating from de novo mesenchymal condensations. We discovered that important and relatively large geometrical features are produced from waves of fresh mesenchymal condensations induced directly adjacent to larger pre-laid cartilage elements between E13.5 and E17.5: this includes the frontal nasal cartilage, nasal concha, labyrinth of ethmoid and, consistent with previous suggestions, cribriform plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–K</xref>). These results cannot be safely inferred from 2D traditional histological atlases because of the complex geometry. Our results are complementary to the findings of McBratney-Owen and Morris-Key with coworkers, who demonstrated that the complete chondrocranium (including skull base) develops from 14 pairs of early independently induced large cartilaginous elements that fuse together during later development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McBratney-Owen et al., 2008</xref>).

We wanted to test if some of these labelled mesenchymal patches can undergo chondrogenesis independently and much later than most of the chondrocranium structure. If that would be the case, we could expect the formation of very sharp borders between the labelled and non-labelled cartilage due to the fusion of newly produced labelled cartilage with the old unlabeled one. If the local cartilage would form from labelled and unlabeled mesenchyme at the same time, the border would not form due to mesenchymal clone mixing that we observe when we label early neural crest.

Our μ-CT results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) show that various parts of the chondrocranium develop due to the growth of pre-existing cartilage not involving ossifications, while only additional features are induced in waves as de novo mesenchymal condensations that fuse with the main element during their maturation or expand in the process of ossification.</p><p>We further focused on the developing nasal capsule because its growth does not involve synchondroses while the apical growth zone and adjoining mesenchymal condensation only partly provide for the growth and shaping modifications.</p><p>The results obtained from comparisons of cartilaginous nasal capsules from different developmental stages showed that the shape of the structure is generally established by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Clonal analysis and color-coding of neural crest-derived chondrogenic and non-chondrogenic ectomesenchyme showed intense mixing of neural crest-derived clones in any given location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaucka et al., 2016</xref>).

Next, analysis of neural crest progeny in established cartilage highlighted the presence of perpendicularly oriented clonal doublets and columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Further analysis of EdU incorporation and genetic tracing with chondrocyte-specific <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> and <italic>Sox10-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic> lines confirmed the existence of transversely oriented products of cell proliferation in the mature (E14.5-E17.5) cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> for EdU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for lineage tracing). These results imply that cells in the sheet-shaped cartilage do not allocate daughter cells in lateral (longitudinal) dimensions as would be intuitively expected.</p><p>Thus, simple lateral or unidirectional proliferation cannot account for the accurate scaling of the sheet-shaped cartilage in the face. Instead, the cartilage development from chondrogenic condensations is achieved by a cellular mechanism that involves intercalation of columnar clonal units.</p><p>It was unclear to us why column-like structures, and no other shapes, are integrated into the sheet-shaped cartilage and how the fine surface is maintained during this mechanism of growth. To better understand possible mechanisms of accurate sheet-shaped cartilage surface development we modelled individual cell dynamics, in silico in 4D (3D + time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hellander, 2015</xref>). We used this modelling to address two questions: firstly, under what conditions are clonal columns observed? Secondly, how is the sheet-like shape achieved by polarized or non-polarized cell divisions of single-cell thick layers and what are the controlling mechanisms? We tested a group of variables including: cell division speed, allocation of daughter cells in random- or defined directions, orientation cues in the tissue (equivalent to molecule gradients), as well as pushing/intercalating of the daughter cells during proliferation. We qualitatively compared the results from in silico simulations to our experimental clonal analysis from various genetic tracing experiments, in order to identify conditions in the model that were compatible with patterns observed in vivo.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mathematical model of cell dynamics during sheet-shaped cartilage development and growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transversal (along z-axis) clipping plane showing conceptual arrangements of modelled cells within the layer as a result of a typical simulation.

At the same time, some yet to be identified mechanism controls the average number of cell divisions in a column, further controlling columnar height and undoubtedly regulating the local thickness of the cartilage. Combined with the observed introduction of the transverse clonal columns, oriented cell proliferation can provide fine surface generation and scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, the model highlighted the elegance of cartilage design involving transverse columnar clones in the sheet-shaped elements: this logic enables the uncoupling of thickness control (depends on cell numbers within a clone) and lateral expansion (depends on the number of initiated clones), which are likely two molecularly unrelated processes in vivo. The absence of a gradient during in silico simulations led to the generation of 3D asymmetrical clusters instead of straight columns (even in conditions of highly synchronized cell divisions, and starting from a laterally space-constrained initial configuration - suggesting the promotion of vertical growth due to space-exclusion in the lateral direction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). This, in turn, led to the formation of surface irregularities in the cartilage with subsequent loss of local flatness (heat-map diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, lineage tracing also showed that for cartilaginous structures in the head with asymmetrical or complex irregular geometries, such as areas where several sheet-shaped cartilage elements were merged, clones were not constructed to perpendicular columns. In such locations, we identified irregular clonal clusters or randomly oriented clonal doublets, in accordance with the modelling results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–J</xref>).

We discovered that activation of ACVR1 (BMP type one receptor, ALK2) in developing cartilage leads to a phenotype with targeted clonal micro-geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–P,R</xref>). We utilized a constitutively activated caALK2 transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukuda et al., 2006</xref>) together with genetic tracing in a way that every GFP-expressing cell is carrying constitutively active ACVR1. This experiment revealed a dramatic change of the shape of clonal envelopes, changing from straight perpendicular columns to disorganized spherical clusters inside the sheet-shaped cartilages of transgenic <italic>Sox10-CreERT2/R26caALK2-IRES-GFP</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–N</xref>). The ectopically activated ACVR1 resulted in the presence of clonal spherical clusters that interfered with the cartilage borders and caused the formation of ectopic bumps, swellings and other abnormal local shapes - in accordance with the mathematical modelling predictions (substantially resembling the condition with no gradient, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O–P</xref>). All recombined cells in this caALK2 experiment became Sox9<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes. There were no other cell types found to be GFP<sup>+</sup>, including perichondrial cells. This result indicates that BMP family ligands either produce the gradient that directs the orientated behavior of chondrocytes inside of the cartilage or, alternatively, that an experimental increase of BMP signaling renders the cells insensitive to the gradient established by other molecules. In any case, ACVR1 mutation can be used as a tool to change columnar arrangements into clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N,R</xref>). The activation of ACVR1 by <italic>Sox10-CreERT2</italic> starting from E12.5 occurred both in perichondrial cells and in chondrocytes (based on our genetic tracing results using <italic>Sox10-CreERT2/R26Confetti</italic>). This later coincided with clonal bumps and bulging regions positioned mainly at the surface of sheet-shaped cartilaginous sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L,N,P</xref>). These data also support the hypothesis that integration of clonal chondrocyte clusters into existing cartilaginous sheets likely depends on clonal shape and originates from the periphery of the cartilage. When this column-inserting process fails, the progeny of cells at the periphery of the cartilage forms ectopic bumps outside of the normal cartilage borders, and disrupts the flatness and straightness of cartilage surfaces.</p><p>Next, we attempted to block the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway to challenge the system and disrupt the formation of perpendicular columns in the flat or curved cartilaginous sheets. To do this we performed µ-CT and EdU-incorporation analysis on Wnt/PCP mutants. Wnt/PCP pathway is well known for driving the cell and tissue polarity, and distinct facial phenotypes have appeared in Ror2, Vangl2 and Wnt5a homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). When EdU was administered 24 hr before embryo harvest, subsequent analysis showed no differences in the EdU-positive perpendicular clonal columns which formed within sheet-shaped facial cartilage of Wnt5a knockout mutants or wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). µ-CT analysis at early developmental stages showed that as early as at E12.5, Wnt5a mutants had abnormal shape and placement of the mesenchymal condensations that create a template for future cartilaginous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). Although µ-CT analysis of Wnt5a, Ror2 and Vangl2 homozygous mutants at later developmental stages confirmed that chondrocranium shape was heavily affected (with generally shortened nasal capsules as compared to both wild-type and heterozygous controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we did not detect any defects in cartilage micro-geometry, including thickness or surface organization. Altogether, these results indicate that Wnt5a, Ror2 and Vangl2 do not control cartilage growth and shaping per se (via the insertion of perpendicular columns). Instead, they influence the position and shape of chondrogenic condensations, which define the future geometry of the facial chondrocranium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Deficiencies in Wnt/PCP pathway reshape the chondrocranium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) µ-CT-based reconstructions of the facial chondrocranium of wild type control, <italic>Wnt5a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Vangl2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Ror2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Vangl2<sup>-/+</sup>/Ror2<sup>-/+</sup></italic> embryos at E15.5, with wall-thickness analysis (the row below).

Knowing from our results that proliferation rate drops in the mature cartilage, we hypothesized that chondrocyte maturation speed may influence the number of cell divisions within a column. To test this suggestion, we analyzed G-protein stimulatory α-subunit (Gsα) knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Inactivation of Gsα, encoded by <italic>Gnas,</italic> is known to lead to accelerated differentiation of columnar chondrocytes, without affecting other aspects of cartilage biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chagin et al., 2014</xref>). We analyzed three different locations in the developing chondrocrania, and observed a significant reduction of cartilage thickness in absolute metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B,J</xref>), as well as in terms of the number of cells within each column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–H</xref>). Thus, the Gsα knockout is a perfect tool to test whether the modulation of differentiation speed can be used to create a variation of local cartilage thickness. The result of this experiment demonstrated that sheet-shaped cartilages in Gsα knockout embryos are thinner than that of littermate controls, while other parameters (including general size and shape of nasal capsule and other locations in the head together with the transverse orientation of chondrocyte columns) remain largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B,I</xref>). Thus, these data experimentally validated mathematical predictions and confirmed that the thickness of cartilage is determined by the number of cell divisions within a transverse clone, and that this is uncoupled from lateral expansion.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Manipulation of cartilage thickness in GSα mutant embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wall thickness was analysed in the µ-CT segmented olfactory system of control (left) and GSα (G-protein subunit alpha) mutant (right).

This model has been efficiently validated and applied for advanced simulations of complex 4D plant organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>). To simulate in silico nasal capsule shape transition from E13.5 to E14.5, we generated a basic E13.5-like shape by converting a sheet-shaped growing trapezoid into a corresponding 3D structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, central part and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The result was considered as a simplified starting condition for further simulations. Next, two lateral zones with a low rate of proliferation were introduced according to their original position in E13.5 nasal capsule. Further simulations of the growth showed that these low proliferative zones impose a characteristic bending on the sides of the simulated structure. This bending corresponds to the lateral transformations observed in embryonic development of the nasal capsule between E13.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B–C</xref>). This characteristic lateral bending did not depend on anterio-posterior polarity in the cartilage or formation of the groove at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>). According to the model, the polarity only affected the potential for the anterior elongation due to the anisotropic growth of the entire cartilaginous structure. Our results also suggested that the nasal septum functions as a slower proliferating anchoring point to the roof of the nasal capsule, which is necessary for the formation of the midline groove at E14.5. A simulated groove at the midline provided for the general bend and flattened shape of the in silico cartilage, similar to the native E14.5 nasal capsule and contrary to the model without the simulated midline groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C–D</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.022</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Modeling of uneven growth in the shaping of the nasal capsule.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In silico geometrical transformations of the nasal capsule-like anlage at E13.5 following various scenarios including: anisotropic oriented growth (following polarization introduced by the anterio-posterior gradient shown in green), non-polarized isotropic growth (no anterio-posterior gradient), the presence of fixed midline (simulation of septum and central groove), condition with the unfixed midline (only central groove), conditions with or without slowly growing lateral regions (shown in purple). Note that in condition with polarized anterio-posterior growth the anterior elongation of the structure is more prominent and faster as compared to the condition with non-polarized isotropic growth.

This simple material modeling demonstrated that growth zones/local expansions in the flat planes generate mechanical tensions which bend the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). We then performed another material modelling experiment using isotropic thermal expansion/constriction of a plastic film. For this purpose, we drew black regions (analogous to the lateral low proliferative zones in E13.5 nasal capsule) onto white plastic film that was cut in a shape of a trapezoid capable of transforming into a nasal capsule-like dome. Under the heating provided by a thermal infrared lamp, the black zones received more heat and isotropically shrunk. Shrinkage of the black zones created physical tensions that eventually bent the structure in a way similar to the original nasal capsule geometry at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12F</xref>). The model with shrinking zones is comparable to the real growth conditions as the nasal capsule expands faster than spatially distributed slow proliferative regions (simulated as shrinking zones inside of the non-expanding plastic material). These results, combined with analysis of proliferation and 3D visualizations, strongly suggest that the distribution of uneven proliferative zones plays an important role in the shaping of the facial chondrocranium during embryonic development.</p><p>Taken together, we reveal a set of principles contributing to the accurate scaling and shaping of cartilage tissue during growth. The reverse engineering of this process highlights the involvement of highly specialized systems that control the directional growth at the levels of micro- (clonal shapes) and macro-geometries (proliferative regions in nasal capsule). Our results show that allometric growth of complex 3D cartilage elements is not achieved by simple, evenly distributed and/or unidirectional proliferation, but is sculpted by precisely localized proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report the discovery of how oriented cell behavior and molecular signals control cartilage growth and shaping. Previously, the use of chimeric avian embryos demonstrated the competence of facial mesenchyme in producing species-specific shapes and sizes of cartilage elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eames and Schneider, 2008</xref>), while facial epithelium and brain provided the instructive signals guiding generalized shaping of the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foppiano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Knowledge of how the facial cartilaginous elements are shaped has been rather restricted, and mainly concerned with the correct formation of chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations.</p><p>The accurate expansion of the chondrogenic condensation or cartilage during growth is no trivial matter. The general shape should be both preserved and modified at the same time. We show that anisotropic proliferation and oriented clonal cell dynamics are implemented to achieve the necessary outcome. The reverse engineering of this process highlighted the involvement of highly specialized systems that control the directional growth at the levels of micro- (clonal shapes) and macrogeometries (proliferative regions).</p><p>Allometric growth of complex 3D structures requires certain cellular logics and cannot efficiently proceed with equally distributed and/or unidirectional proliferation inside of the mesenchymal condensation or cartilage element. On the other hand, we did not observe the formation of growth plate-like zones in early sheet-shaped (nasal capsule) or rod-shaped cartilages, nor uniform expansion of cartilage in all directions. Thus, the underlying growth and shaping mechanisms required an explanation.</p><p>To test various strategies of cellular behavior during cartilage growth we devised a model simulating different aspects of multicellular dynamics in 3D together with lineage tracing of individual clones. Most of the currently existing models of cell dynamics and tracing operate in 2D space, which often limits the predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarjour et al., 2014</xref>). Our model suggested that a gradient-controlled orientation of clonal expansion can explain the biological observations (i.e. it is consistent with ordered columnar growth and its disruption results in spherical microdomains rather than columns), and showed the relation between the geometries of clonal domains (envelopes), the overall shape and the fineness of the surface. We confirmed the predictions from the model in a series of experiments involving tracing with multicolor reporters and manipulating the cartilage with mutations. Our results showed that the formation of oriented clones of chondrocytes with clonal envelope shape corresponds to the geometry of the analyzed locality. The sheet-shaped cartilage elements consisted of transversely oriented clonal columns, while asymmetric complex geometries revealed a variety of clonal shapes ranging from spherical to particularly oriented.</p><p>Genetic tracing initiated during transition of condensations into cartilage resulted in clonal columns within both sheet- and rod-shaped cartilage elements. This confirms that chondrogenic condensations undergo complex oriented cell dynamics during their development. Importantly, tracing of chondrocranium cartilage showed formation of transverse clonal columns as growth proceeded. Intercalation of newly born columns into pre-existing cartilage provided for the expansion potential in the sheet-shaped cartilage. This growth mechanism is very original and is not reported elsewhere so far.</p><p>A few studies have demonstrated how clonal envelopes form in accordance with the general shape of the structure. These were mainly conducted on <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal wing disc or growing flower petals. In all cases the authors highlighted that the shape of clonal geometries correlates with the major vector of expansion in the growing structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Repiso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strutt, 2005</xref>). This implies the presence of polarized activity that directs the shaping of the tissue. Here, we provided the first experimental evidence of how the control of the directional clonal expansion influences the shape of a vertebrate tissue on a large scale. Moreover, in the sheet-shaped cartilage the orientation of clonal domains, i.e. the columns, does not correspond to the vectors of major expansion, but rather serves for uncoupling lateral expansion control and thickness tuning. In line with that, the number of chondrocytes comprising the clonal column or cluster depends on Gsα-mediated signals. Variations in this number do not significantly affect the lateral dimensions of the whole sheet-shaped cartilage structure: the thickness of the cartilage becomes less while the general geometry and size stay preserved. Additionally, the shape and orientation of clonal envelopes in cartilage is partially controlled by BMP signaling, since micro-geometries of clones depend on activation of ACVR1. Based on these results, we assume that BMP ligands (because of cAlk2/ACVR1 phenotype affected clonal orientation) expressed around the regularly shaped cartilages may play a role similar to the in silico predicted gradients. Indeed, the expression of INHBA, BMP5 and BMP3 fit this expression profile quite well (according to Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://developingmouse.brain-map.org">http://developingmouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>) and Eurexpress (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eurexpress.org">http://www.eurexpress.org</ext-link>) in situ public databases). At least, BMP5 is clearly expressed at the cartilage periphery and has been shown to affect the cartilage shape by David Kingsley lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenther et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our experimental manipulations of planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway did not affect microgeometries and clonal domains, but strongly affected the chondrocranium shape on the macroscopical scale in several different ways. These phenotypes appeared to be rooted in pre-chondrogenic or early chondrogenic stages, and are based on distorted placement of mesenchymal condensations in the very early head. These experiments with Wnt/PCP mutants may potentially provide a better understanding of species-specific mechanisms of control and evolution of the facial shape on a macro scale.</p><p>Regular shapes require regular cellular arrangements and clonal cell dynamics. It is not only sheet-shaped cartilage in the head that demonstrate geometric regularity; rod-shaped cartilage (Meckel, embryonic ribs and long cartilages in limbs) also has a regular shape. Regular clonal patterns, conceptually similar to those found in sheet-shaped cartilage, explain conservative tissue dynamics during formation and growth of cartilaginous rods. Indeed, genetic tracing experiments suggested that formation of clonal columns is important for the diameter control, while chondrogenic condensations at the very tip of the rod-shaped growing structures enable elongation. Similar to the cell dynamics in the sheet-shaped cartilage, this mechanism may provide for uncoupling of length versus diameter control. Such uncoupling may generally enable developmental and evolutional plasticity of cartilage size and shape.</p><p>The mechanism controlling the thickness or diameter of sheet-shaped and rod-shaped cartilage elements not only includes spatially orientated behavior, but also involves the regulation of cell number within each chondrogenic clone. Immature chondrocytes are proliferatively active, while more mature chondrocytes show decreased proliferation. Therefore, differentiation speed emerges as a concept which could regulate the organ shape by impinging on clone size, thereby altering the thickness or diameter of the cartilage. This concept is known to operate in the brain and other tissues with classical stem cell/transiently amplifying cell arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Díaz-Flores et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Clonal genetic tracing and EdU labeling experiments suggested that the origin of clonal columns and clusters might be represented by the cells located at the periphery of forming cartilage. The spherical clusters of chondrocytes forming at the periphery of the cartilage in cALK2 mutant mice may suggest that the cell source is also located at the periphery and might be a perichondrial cell. Clonal relationships between perichondrial cells and columns of chondrocytes also support the hypothesis of perichondrial cells acting as a stem population during cartilage expansion. In general, the heterogeneity and multipotency of perichondrial cells is still unclear, although there are multiple studies showing the perichondrium as a source of chondrocytes and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maes et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this, the perichondrium might mediate non-autonomous effects in the cartilage in case of cAlk2 and GSα experiments. Genetic tracing shows that some perichondrial cells always recombine with <italic>Sox10</italic>-, <italic>Plp1</italic>- and <italic>Col2a1-CreERT2</italic> lines, and, in case of functional experiments, may indirectly control some evens in more mature layers. Also, it is not clear how the fine border of the cartilage is set, and whether the perichondrial layer may play a key border-setting role during development and regeneration. This should be investigated further.</p><p>Next, our results show that tuning of macro-geometries on a large scale can be achieved through a stage-specific placement of proliferative hot zones where new clonal domains intercalate into the main cartilage structure. Anisotropic heterogeneous proliferation is a powerful tool, which, together with polarity in the tissue and local patterning, can drive the organ shape development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben Amar and Jia, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Campinho and Heisenberg, 2013</xref>). The localized growth zones provide for the general expansion and also bend the cartilage by creating local tensions that require mechanical relaxation and influence further development of the overall shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schötz et al., 2013</xref>). For probing such transformations of the sheet-shaped facial cartilage we applied an in silico model that was already successfully validated in a number of growth, shaping and scaling tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>). Such a model was necessary to understand why the high and low proliferation zones are positioned in such a specific way. Indeed, the discovered distribution of proliferative zones in the whole nasal capsule did not help us per se with intuitive explanations of geometrical changes on the macro-scale. Despite this counter-intuitive dataset, the mathematical model provided an insight into the logic of the high and low proliferation zones in relation to a transition between investigated cartilage shapes.</p><p>For example, it turned out that the position of lateral slow proliferation zones enables the generation of the symmetrical bends at the sides of the nasal capsule during transition from E13.5 to E14.5 developmental shapes. Furthermore, real material modelling confirmed the results predicted by the mathematical model, and generated lateral bends similarly to the native structure. The molecular mechanism controlling the dynamic distribution (patterning) of fast/slow proliferative zones in the cartilage is still unknown. It is likely linked to developmental signals from other tissues such as the olfactory epithelium or the mesenchyme surrounding the cartilage. Identification and validation of these signals will be essential in future studies and would involve a substantial combination of screening and functional approaches with transgenic animal models.</p><p>The anisotropic proliferation can be an important evolutionary mechanism that is directly responsible for the differences in snout geometry in a variety of phylogenetic groups. Additionally, it might be important for understanding the development of the facial shape variation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheehan and Nachman, 2014</xref>) as well as numerous pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afsharpaiman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One alternative way to fine-tune macro-geometry of a cartilage element is to continuously add on pre-shaped chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations from the pool of competent progenitors that are retained until late developmental stages. As we demonstrated, the formation of adjoining mesenchymal condensations occurs in sheet-shaped cranial cartilage. In the developing face, new chondrogenic condensations are responsible for introducing geometrically complicated fine details. Such mechanisms may also operate during amphibian metamorphosis, when most of the postmetamorphic cranial cartilage develops de novo and not from the pre-metamorphic cartilaginous elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerney et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we discovered important novel principles explaining the growth and shaping of cartilaginous structures. Further studies should focus, amongst other things, on the soluble signals emanating from other embryonic structures which influence the oriented behavior or proliferation of chondrogenic clones.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and animal information</title><p>All animal (mouse) work has been approved and permitted by the Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments (Norra Djurförsöksetiska Nämd, ethical permit N226/15 and N5/14) and conducted according to The Swedish Animal Agency´s Provisions and Guidelines for Animal Experimentation recommendations.

After dissection, the embryos were fixed with 4% aqueous solution of formaldehyde in PBS for 24 hr at +4°C, with slow rotation. Samples were then dehydrated by incubation in incrementally increasing concentrations of ethanol in PBS (30%, 50%, 70%); samples were incubated at +4°C for two days in each concentration to minimize the tissue shrinkage.</p><p>We found that the best signal to noise ratio on scans results from contrasting the samples with 0.5–1.0% PTA (Phosphotungstic acid, Sigma Aldrich) in 90% methanol. After sample dehydration, the tissue-contrasting PTA solution was added to the samples and then changed every day with the fresh solution. E12.5 embryos were contrasted with 0.5% PTA for four days while E15.5 embryos were stained in 0.7% PTA for six days. E16.5 and E17.5 embryos were decapitated, and the contrasting procedure was extended to 9–15 days in 1% PTA to ensure the best penetration of the contrasting agent. Subsequently, tissues were rehydrated through a methanol gradient (90%, 80%, 70%, 50% and 30%), to sterile distilled water. After that, rehydrated embryos were embedded in 0.5% agarose gel (A5304, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in polypropylene conical tubes (0.5, 1.5 or 15 ml depending on the sample size) to minimize the amount of surrounding agarose gel, and to avoid movement artifacts during X-ray computed tomography scanning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>µ-CT analysis (micro computed tomography analysis)</title><p>The µ-CT analysis of the embryos was performed using laboratory system GE phoenix v|tome|x L 240, equipped with a 180 kV/15W maximum power nanofocus X-ray tube and high contrast flat panel detector DXR250 with 2048 × 2048 pixel, 200 × 200 µm pixel size. The exposure time was 900 ms in all 2000 positions. The µ-CT scan was carried out at 60 kV acceleration voltage and with 200 μA X-ray tube current. The voxel size of obtained volumes appeared in the range of 4 µm - 6 µm depending on a size of an embryo. The tomographic reconstructions were performed using GE phoenix datos|x 2.0 3D computed tomography software.</p><p>The cartilage of the olfactory system was segmented manually using Avizo - 3D image data processing software (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). The volumetric data of a segmented region were transformed to a polygonal mesh that describes the outer boundary of the region. The polygonal mesh consisting of triangles is a digital geometrical representation of the real object. The polygonal mesh of the olfactory system was imported to VG Studio MAX 2.2 software (Volume Graphics, Germany) for surface smoothening. The analysis of wall thickness at different embryonic stages was performed in order to show the differences or similarities in the thickness of the cartilage structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tesařová et al., 2016</xref>). The results are shown on the polygonal mesh by a colour map. The growth zones in facial chondrocranium at different stages were outlined on top of the 3D polygonal mesh based on the EdU analysis and confocal microscopy results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Computer simulations of shape transitions of nasal capsule structure</title><p>Models were developed using the growing polarised tissue (GPT) framework and implemented in the MATLAB application GFtbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>). In this method, an initial finite element mesh, also termed the canvas, is deformed during growth. The pattern of deformation depends on growth-modulating factors, whose initial distribution was established during setup. Factors have one value for each vertex and values between vertices are linearly interpolated across each finite element. In the models described here, the initial canvas is oriented with regard to the external xy-coordinate system such that the canvas base is parallel to the x-axis and the midline is parallel to the y-axis. The initial nasal capsule-line canvas consists of 1800 elements. Elements were not subdivided during the simulations.</p><p>Each model has two interconnected networks: the Polarity Regulatory Network (PRN) specifies tissue polarity and hence specified orientations of growth, and the Growth-rate Regulatory Network (KRN) determines how factors influence specified growth rates. In total, growth interactions are specified by three equations, one for the PRN and two for the KRN. These networks determine the specified polarity and growth fields across the canvas. Growth rates are influenced by factors distributed across the canvas. Growth can be promoted in a region by the pro function or inhibited by the inh function as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Due to the connectedness of the canvas, this specified growth differs from the resultant growth by which the system is deformed.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Fixed midline models</title><p>These models question how the structure can transform given that the septum actively anchors the midline and the central groove.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Setup</title><p>The initial set-up phase runs from 0 to 12 time steps and during this phase the canvas deforms from a square sheet into the starting shape for the nasal capsule-like structure.

(IBM) for cartilage dynamics</title><p>In order to model and illustrate the growth of the cartilage on the cellular level, we developed an individual-based model incorporating cell proliferation (including displacement of surrounding cells via pushing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hellander, 2015</xref>). The model is stochastic because we want to be able to capture effects of e.g. synchronicity in cell division and the degree of determinism needed to achieve and ordered columnar growth of the structure. We do this by letting the cell division times, direction of allocation of daughter cells after cell division, etc., be random variables. This document describes the details of the model and its implementation.</p><p>There are several popular modeling frameworks for simulating interacting cells. In the cellular potts model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>) a single biological cell can be composed of multiple lattice sites making it possible to use a more detailed description of cell shape and include more detailed description of more mechanical properties. In off-lattice center based models cells are often modeled as spheres with pair-wise interactions and a force-based description to evolve the system dynamics, for an overview see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Liedekerke et al., 2015</xref>). Vertex models can offer even more realistic models of cell mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fletcher et al., 2013</xref>) but become expensive and complicated in three space dimensions.</p><p>Rather than these more comprehensive mechanical models, we use a simplistic rule-based, on-lattice stochastic cellular automaton (CA). In the language of a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Liedekerke et al., 2015</xref>) our model falls into the category of a Type B CA. These types of models are widely used in e.g. cancer tumor modeling and for simulation of monolayers and spheroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radszuweit et al., 2009</xref>). The simulation code is written in Python, relies on the PyURDME package for spatial stochastic simulations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pyurdme.org">www.pyurdme.org</ext-link>) and it is freely available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/ahellander/multicell">www.github.com/ahellander/multicell</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hellander, 2015</xref>) under the GPLv3 license. A copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/multicell">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/multicell</ext-link>.</p><p>The basic entities in our simulation are Agents and Events. An Agent is a model (implemented as a Python class) of an individual (cell). Events simulate discrete state changes involving one or several agents. They occur at a certain time (assuming no other event involving the same agents occurs first). They rely on rules that specify how and under what conditions the event is to be executed. A simulation is initialized by creating the initial population of agents and events, and then creating a priority queue (in our case implemented using a heap data structure using the Python module’ heapq’). In each iteration of the algorithm, the event with the shortest time is popped from the queue and executed (assuming that all of its rules and conditions can be satisfied), the system time updated, new events derived from any newly created agents are created and inserted into the queue, and all existing events affected by changes in the agents or the system state are updated.</p><p>Each agent occupies one voxel of a tessellation of 2D or 3D space, and each lattice site can only accommodate one agent. Following the recommendation in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radszuweit et al., 2009</xref>) a Delaunay triangulation is used. The mesh resolution is chosen such that the average voxel size is close to the desired cell size (∼7 µm radius) taken from the experiments. Being a lattice model, the shape and volume of the cells are a lattice property and are given by the dual grid (Voronoi cells in the case of a Delaunay triangulation). This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>. The interpretation is that individual agents occupy the dual elements (dashed lines) of an unstructured triangular (2D) or tetrahedral primal mesh (3D) (solid lines).<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.025</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Individual cells are modeled by a number of properties such as their color and distributions for cell division times.</title><p>The positions of cells in space are tracked on an underlying unstructured lattice, or grid.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews detailed below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors of the manuscript &quot;New growth mechanism operates in facial cartilage scaling and shaping&quot; analyzed growth of facial, specifically nasal/snout cartilages and proposed a mechanism by which it expands. More specifically, they suggest that facial cartilage growth that is based on introducing oriented clonal cell units into existing cartilage from the perichondrial cell layer. While the paper is interesting and makes a number of important observations, in its current form it is not very clearly written with some parts redundant, it makes a number of statements which need further clarification or support in the form of additional experiments. The paper draws conclusions which seem go beyond the most obvious interpretation of their data and to be more convincing of the main points the paper is trying to make. The significance of cranial synchondroses in facial cartilage growth is overlooked and while contribution from clonal expansion to such cartilages has not been reported before, such mode of growth is not new and its significance may have been exaggerated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Kaucka et al. paper aimed to address two important questions of craniofacial skeletal growth: 1), how does chondrocyte cellular behavior contribute to cartilage shaping and scaling; 2), what are the progenitors of chondrocytes? The authors started with characterizing tissue growth using micro-CT and found that tissue expansion was anisotropic mainly along its surface area (lateral) but not the short axis (thickness/depth). Interestingly, in confetti mice, chondrocytes clones were arranged in columns parallel to the short axis of the tissue (depth or width?). Combing this observation with mathematical modeling, the authors predicted that the polarized growth of columns controls tissue thickness. To test this hypothesis, they perturbed the activity of multiple signaling pathways and found an association between clone morphologies and tissue dimensions in mutant conditions. Next, to determine the lineage relationship between chondrocytes and perichondrium, the authors characterized clone distribution in confetti mice. In parallel, they performed H2B-GFP pulse-chase to analyze the distribution of daughter cells after division. In both cases, the labeled chondrocytes and perichondrial cells were clonally related, which made the authors believe that chondrocytes are derived from perichondrial cells. Finally, in silico modeling suggests that the diversity of cartilage morphology is driven by the uneven distribution of proliferative chondrocytes. Their work provides list of insights including:</p><p>1) Directional growth of cellular columns controls the thickness of craniofacial cartilage</p><p>2) Chondrocytes are derived from perichondrial cells</p><p>3) Uneven proliferative zone drives cartilage shape turning</p><p>This paper combined powerful mouse genetics with computational modeling and tomographic reconstruction to address the fundamental questions in morphogenesis. However, the analysis is not rigorous and the data is overinterpreted.</p><p>1) Clonal analysis is not clear at spatial level. The 3D tomographic reconstruction revealed that the surface size of cartilage increased significantly while thickness (depth) remained constant. However, the clonal analysis was performed at 2D level. The authors need to show if the direction of column growth is mainly along the width or the depth of the tissue. This is critical to determine how cellular organization contributes to 3D morphogenesis of the tissue. Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q and R</xref>, the authors developed a quantitative method to characterize clone morphology in wild-type and caALK2 mice, this approach should be applied to other studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B-G</xref>).</p><p>2) Clonal analysis is not clear at temporal level. Tomographic reconstruction showed that tissue thickness increased from E14.5 to E16.5 but remained constant from E16.5 to E17.5. If tissue thickness is driven by column expansion, the size of columns should show similar growth kinetics. This hypothesis needs to be tested.</p><p>3) The tomographic analysis is quantitative in wild-type tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>) but descriptive in BMP and PCP mutant mice. To draw the conclusion that cartilage display abnormal morphologies, the same quantitative analysis needs to be performed on mutants.</p><p>4) The authors identified a correlation but not a causal linkage between cellular columns and tissue dimensions. caALK2 mice were driven by <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>, which interfered the normal activity of both cartilage and adjacent perichondrium. Thus, it is possible that cartilage shaping is not controlled by chondrocyte column formation; instead, both of these two factors are affected by neighboring tissues. Supporting this possibility, musculature contraction is critical to chondrocyte organization and skeletal morphogenesis (Shwartz et al., 2012, Developmental Biology). Similarly, all the PCP mutant mice were full knock-out, which makes it difficult to interpret the phenotype in cartilage. Gsa mutant mice are driven by Col2-Cre that is more chondrocyte specific, but the adjacent perichondrium were still labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-G</xref>). In this case, the possible non-autonomous function of perichondrium could not be ruled out.</p><p>5) Some other questions about Gsa mutant mice: The authors found that these more matured cells divided more slowly. But the clonal size appears similar (compare 5B and C, compare 5D and E). Were the mutant proliferative cells differentiated into hypertrophic cells? In the growth plate of long bones, these cells are larger than proliferative cells. Could these matured cells affect cartilage morphology in Gsa mutant? Since the lateral expansion of the tissue was not measured, how could the authors know cell division only affects tissue thickness?</p><p>6) The progenitor role of perichondrium is uncertain. Based on the spatial distribution of clonally related cells, an alternative hypothesis is that the perichondrial cells are derived from chondrocytes. Because this lineage relationship is an important part of the paper, it is desirable to perform lineage-analysis using perichondrium specific Cre or time-lapse imaging to follow cell behaviors in the short-term. Time-lapse imaging on mouse craniofacial skeletons is technically possible (Romerim et al., 2014, Development).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper poses an interesting question, how do cartilaginous structures such as the nasal capsule grow without evidence of set growth plates, as in long bones etc.?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> clearly highlights this problem by showing that the pattern of the nasal cartilages are set around E14.5 but that substantial growth (scaling) occurs during later embryonic stages.</p><p>The question in tackled by following clones of cells in the cartilage revealing the formation of orientated doublets and lines of cells, which are very striking observation. This is a really interesting result that is then backed up by following patterns of clones in cartilages of different shapes and in different mutants.</p><p>Some parts of the paper are not as clear as they could be, with some experiments not explained and a few things presumed.</p><p>It is not clear why the authors have used PLP, Sox10 and Col2 cre mice. The Col2 appears to be enough to show the results. Are their different advantages of the different lines, or is there a benefit in targeting slightly different populations?</p><p>The authors call their cartilages flat. I am not sure this is a good description of cartilages that are in complex 3D sheets. Perhaps their definition can be explained further. Do they mean a smooth surface?</p><p>I cannot comment on the model presented from a mathematical point of view but the graphics are generally very good.</p><p>In the ACVR1 experiments clumps are shown at the periphery of the cartilages. This is a very nice clear result. In these mice are the cartilages shorter, as would be predicted if the cells were failing to intercalate successfully? In Image N there are quite a few GFP cells that might be expected to have altered the intercalation in this part of cartilage.</p><p>The PCP mutants are interesting to illustrate the difference between initial patterning defects and problems with later scaling. Likewise the Gs-α experiments separate the role of integration from proliferation for controlling cartilage thickness.</p><p>In the early section of the text the authors suggest that the cartilage cells move in from the perichondrial layer, seeding the vertical columns. The origin of the new cartilage cells is an important point and is tested using dilution of H2B-GFP. I find this experiment the weakest in the paper as it does not clearly prove a perichondrium origin, but simply reiterates that the perichondrium and cartilage cells are clearly clonal. The graph shows that the perichondrium appears to proliferate more than the cartilage cells but this is not showing point of origin. Time lapse would be a clear way of proving the origin of the cells.</p><p>The last part of the paper deals with shape changes during later development. A key part is an analysis of bending but do the cartilages actually bend? From the Introduction I thought the nasal cartilage was simply scaling from an original pre-cartilage template with minor adjustments. The cartilage is not a sheet but already curved. If bending does occur this should be shown very clearly using real images, rather than the schematic shown. The sections of the nasal region in the supplementary data do not give much impression of bending, perhaps at the bottom of the capsule?</p><p>Confirmation of bending is necessary to confirm that modelling on flat plastic is relevant. The use of actual materials, however, is a very nice way to visualise morphogenetic movements, following from the work of Enrico Coen on plant morphogenesis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Oriented clonal cell dynamics enables accurate growth and shaping of cartilage&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript is much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed by alterations in the text prior to acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) With respect to whether chondrocytes function autonomously to control cartilage morphology, how could the authors exclude the possible roles of this layer? They argue that for an autonomous effect based on observing that cells with recombined GPF express Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L and N</xref>). However, there are two layers of perichondrium: and inner layer that expresses Sox9 and an out layer that expresses collagen type I. Could this outer layer cause a non-autonomous effect in cartilage shaping? The outer layer perichondrium also contains recombined cells in both confetti mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and caALK2 mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>), both of which are driven by Sox10 promoter. Therefore, the possibility of non-autonomous effects should be discussed.</p><p>2) Kudos to the authors for trying very hard to do live imaging to test the lineage relationship between chondrocytes and perichondrium. However, the &quot;n&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>) is very low. Given that the total number of cell division drops in organ culture, such that they cannot perform statistical analysis, they should leave out this data.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, the authors use salamander regenerating limb as a tissue model for live imaging. However, cell behaviors could be very different during normal development versus regeneration. In addition, it previously has been shown that during cartilage regeneration, perichondrium cells can regenerate chondrocytes (Srour MK et al., Natural large-scale regeneration of rib cartilage in a mouse model, 2015). Therefore, these data may not be relevant to the story and the authors may want to leave it for a different paper.</p><p>4) The paper would profit from some rewriting. Parts of the paper are not well organized; the Summary and Introduction are too long and some of the contents seem to be misplaced; there are many grammatical mistakes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25902.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors of the manuscript &quot;New growth mechanism operates in facial cartilage scaling and shaping&quot; analyzed growth of facial, specifically nasal/snout cartilages and proposed a mechanism by which it expands.

We heavily worked on them many months during this revision. Mostly, we were very inspired by suggestion to analyze the role of synchondroses in cranial base and nasal capsule expansion. In this revision, we provided additional data addressing both synchondroses and apical growth zone. Please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and three associated supplementary figures. In these figures, we show the visualizations of synchondroses development and, despite it has an immense role in cranial base expansion, we proved that synchondroses, as well as direct endochondrial ossification processes, do not happen in the nasal capsule and many other parts of the chondrocranium during the period of embryonic development that we study here. And still, these cartilaginous parts are growing quite isotropically, while synchondroses provides rather unidirectional (anterio-posterior) expansion of the base of the skull. We showed, explained and discussed (with literature citations suggested by the reviewer 1) the importance of synchondroses. Our findings are clearly demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In addition to CT and histology-based approach, we also analyzed clonal cell dynamics in classical synchondroses (right part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panels D-I) and we never see such cell dynamics during the development of the nasal capsule in an embryo.</p><p>We also followed the advice of the reviewer and birth-dated the cartilage with inducible genetic tracing approach and showed that cartilage born from the apical growth zone and cartilage formed from newly induced mesenchymal condensations elsewhere do not explain fully the isotropic growth of the nasal capsule (please see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and associated supplementary figures). These results are completely new and have not been reported before. Our new data are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and 2 new supplementary figures. They show that mesenchymal chondrogenic condensations are continuously produced at the tip of the nasal capsule and around the nasal conchae. Later, this freshly produced cartilage fuses with the main nasal capsule structure to create the fine geometrical features. At the same time, the basic geometry of nasal capsule keeps growing. Thus, the third mechanism is taking place in addition to synchondroses, new chondrogenic condensations and apical growth zone.</p><p>When we were writing the first version of our manuscript, we did not aim to diminish the other ways of cartilage growth including synchondroses. We are happy that reviewer 1 helped us to obtain new results and inspired to formulate and discuss them more correctly in this light.</p><p>The reviewer 1 writes “such mode of growth is not new”. We hope that this statement results from some pedagogical/writing style-related issues from our manuscript. We focus on the geometry of clonal arrangements, anisotropic proliferation, oriented cell behavior, mechanical tensions and other mechanisms of growth and shaping of the facial cartilage in this manuscript. We are not aware of a publication describing these new clonal cell dynamics during embryonic chondrocranium growth elsewhere. We hope that after serious rewriting of the manuscript and doubling the amount of data during this revision, these problems have dissipated, and the reviewer will find our response well-grounded in the new results and comprehensive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] This paper combined powerful mouse genetics with computational modeling and tomographic reconstruction to address the fundamental questions in morphogenesis.

In the revised version of the manuscript we provide these new data on the 3D clonal column shape in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, new panel A, and also about clonal column growth in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, new panel E.</p><p><italic>Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q and R</xref>, the authors developed a quantitative method to characterize clone morphology in wild-type and caALK2 mice, this approach should be applied to other studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A-J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B-G</xref>).</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we quantified the clone morphology in facial cartilages of the wild type mice and caAlk2 mutants. However, in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> we describe micro-CT data, and thus we do not understand what reviewer 2 means here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the situation in the wild type mice, so the proposed quantification will be obviously redundant since it was already done and presented in old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) shows Gsa phenotype also with genetic tracing (oriented columns and doublets are visible), and we do provide the requested additional analysis of clonal shapes in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>. Importantly, facial shape does not change substantially in these mutants and, as we prove with newly supplied analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>, does not involve changes in clonal orientations. We apologize that this was not obvious in the first version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Clonal analysis is not clear at temporal level. Tomographic reconstruction showed that tissue thickness increased from E14.5 to E16.5 but remained constant from E16.5 to E17.5. If tissue thickness is driven by column expansion, the size of columns should show similar growth kinetics. This hypothesis needs to be tested.</italic> </p><p>We thank our reviewer for this advice and we addressed this comment. Indeed, eventually columns increase cell numbers between developmental stages. This new result can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, new panel E.</p><p><italic>3) The tomographic analysis is quantitative in wild-type tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>) but descriptive in BMP and PCP mutant mice. To draw the conclusion that cartilage display abnormal morphologies, the same quantitative analysis needs to be performed on mutants.</italic> </p><p>We do show the quantitative analysis for the Alk (BMP receptor) mutants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q and R</xref>) when it comes to clonal shapes. We cannot do the overall thickness analysis of the entire nasal capsule because the genetic penetrance (efficiency of Alk2 activation controlled by genetic tracing) is generally very low – too few clones appear to be affected by genetic recombination (and those we can efficiently observe). However, we show quantitative thickness analysis of the most affected regions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O-P</xref>, please see the insets with quantified thickness heatmap). Indeed, the microgeometries are affected as demonstrated in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O-P</xref>, while the majority of normal unaffected cartilage provides for the general recovery of the nasal capsule macro-shape. The suggested analysis of nasal capsule from caAlk2 mutants (similar to the one reported in the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)) will not make any sense – most of the measured positions will reflect only the wild type cartilage.</p><p>When it comes to the analysis of PCP mutants: in the new revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> we introduced the quantitative analysis of thickness following this reviewer comment.</p><p>Importantly, microgeometries of a sheet-like cartilage are fine in all those mutants and do not show neither geometrical nor clonal orientation-related differences from the control. This is the only aspect that is truly important in a context of this study. For this we demonstrated quantitative EdU-based analysis of clonal orientations. Other panels simply outline the general picture and stand for the pedagogical purpose, while the entire figure shows a clear negative result at the level of clonal structure/orientations etc.</p><p><italic>4) The authors identified a correlation but not a causal linkage between cellular columns and tissue dimensions. caALK2 mice were driven by Sox10-Cre, which interfered the normal activity of both cartilage and adjacent perichondrium. Thus, it is possible that cartilage shaping is not controlled by chondrocyte column formation; instead, both of these two factors are affected by neighboring tissues. Supporting this possibility, musculature contraction is critical to chondrocyte organization and skeletal morphogenesis (Shwartz et al., 2012, Developmental Biology).</italic> </p><p>We disagree with this reasoning because all recombined cells in case of caALK2 experiment turned into the Sox9<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes. We corrected the Results section and mentioned this fact. There were no other cell types found including traced perichondrial cells. Activation of caAlk2 somehow forces chondrogenesis and formation of spherical clusters instead of columns. This also shows that perichondrial cell are potent to produce chondrocytes when BMP pathway is activated. Therefore, there is no other neighboring tissue that bears activated ACVR1 and GFP. This is a pretty clear autonomous effect in the cartilage. Formation of spherical genetically traced bump and clumps is undeniable. Non-genetically traced cells (without caALK2 produced) behave in a normal way.</p><p>We expanded the description of results in the revised manuscript to discuss this particular detail.</p><p><italic>Similarly, all the PCP mutant mice were full knock-out, which makes it difficult to interpret the phenotype in cartilage.</italic> </p><p>We state that the cartilage is perfectly fine at the level of clonal arrangements and we show that mesenchymal condensations are rather affected. This is all in the manuscript. We show that it is not a PCP pathway that directs the columnar oriented clonal behavior. Thus, the analysis of PCP mutants shows very important negative results: these full mutations do not influence clonal orientation and cartilage microgeometry. Only if the result would bring a change in the clonal structure – then we would need to go for conditional KOs.</p><p><italic>Gsa mutant mice are driven by Col2-Cre that is more chondrocyte specific, but the adjacent perichondrium were still labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-G</xref>). In this case, the possible non-autonomous function of perichondrium could not be ruled out.</italic> </p><p>We observe no significant phenotype at the level of general geometry. Only the cartilage thickness is affected, while lateral expansion is unperturbed. Since GSa is instrumental to achieve less cells comprising the column, it does not matter how exactly this effect is achieved (directly or indirectly). This experiment serves only the argument about uncoupling thickness control and the lateral expansion.</p><p><italic>5) Some other questions about Gsa mutant mice: The authors found that these more matured cells divided more slowly. But the clonal size appears similar (compare 5B and C, compare 5D and E). Were the mutant proliferative cells differentiated into hypertrophic cells? In the growth plate of long bones, these cells are larger than proliferative cells. Could these matured cells affect cartilage morphology in Gsa mutant? Since the lateral expansion of the tissue was not measured, how could the authors know cell division only affects tissue thickness?</italic> </p><p>We introduced new analysis to answer this question. The shapes of the control and the GSa mutant are pretty identical despite differences in cartilage thickness (please see new in silico digital shape comparisons with GOM Inspect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, new panel J). This strongly suggests the existence of uncoupled control of lateral expansion and transversal proliferation. The blue dots in the shape comparison image occur because of the specifically strong drops of thickness in these locations.</p><p>In locations that are proximal to synchondroses and inside of the forming inner ear we were observing more hypertrophic cells as compared to control. These hypertrophic cells appeared rather concentrated in few locations in the chondrocranium at the analysis stage. Thus, cell hypertrophy is increased in Gsa mutant, which is consistent with the previous findings. However, at the analysis stage, less cells comprising the column or cluster provide stronger effect of thickness than slight hypertrophy (hypertrophy is getting compensated). Importantly, multiple analyzed locations did not show the signs of hypertrophy at the time of our analysis and were much thinner as compared to the control because of the clonal size differences (see the thickness heatmaps and sections through the cartilage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> for the proof of this reasoning).</p><p><italic>6) The progenitor role of perichondrium is uncertain. Based on the spatial distribution of clonally related cells, an alternative hypothesis is that the perichondrial cells are derived from chondrocytes.</italic> </p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we report the results of the live imaging of facial cartilage and regenerating salamander limb (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>), where perichondrial cells generate chondrocytes incorporated into the main structure of the cartilage. Also, in our data one can see that in the regenerating limb very often chondrogenic mesenchymal progenitors generate both chondrocyte clone and spatially associated perichondrial cell. This is consistent with our EdU results and clonal genetic tracing associations throughout the manuscript. Still, the perichondrial layer is complex, specific markers are unknown, and often there is no clear border between the perichondrium and the cartilage. Thus, we cannot claim the exact nature of progenitor cells, and we do not do this claim in the revised version despite we obtained much better support for this hypothesis. In the new version of our manuscript we toned down this part and we only say that our data suggest that cartilaginous columns may originate from perichondrial layer during the cartilage growth.</p><p><italic>Because this lineage relationship is an important part of the paper, it is desirable to perform lineage-analysis using perichondrium specific Cre or time-lapse imaging to follow cell behaviors in the short-term. Time-lapse imaging on mouse craniofacial skeletons is technically possible (Romerim et al., 2014, Development).</italic> </p><p>We addressed this comment experimentally. The imaging of the facial cartilage is extraordinarily hard. We performed it with only certain degree of success. We followed the advice of the reviewer and involved into collaboration the laboratory of Prof. Andrew Dudley (suggested by reviewer 2 by citing Romerim et al., 2014, Development). This collaboration resulted in better and comprehensive results (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-B</xref>). Still, the total amount of cell divisions drops down tremendously in explant culture conditions as compared to the real embryo (three independent laboratories tried numerous conditions and cultivating approaches during this big collaboration). As a result, we consistently observe perichondrial (or flattened peripheral) cells producing chondrocytes in the cartilage and performing transversal cell divisions (despite rare events because of in vitro situation). It appeared that salamander regenerating limb represents a much better model system being naturally intact (after initial healing), transparent, integrated and with opportunity to perform lineage tracing with live imaging. We took advantage of this approach through collaboration with Elly Tanaka laboratory. The results showed that perichondrial cells indeed can give rise to the chondrocyte clones and that oriented clonal columns form during cartilage development similar to the situation in the facial cartilage (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>, Figure 9—figure supplement 1, video). As we mentioned above, despite this experimental support, we decided to be cautious and rather suggest than claim lineage relationships between perichondrial and cartilage cells since we cannot experimentally address the amount of contribution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] It is not clear why the authors have used PLP, Sox10 and Col2 cre mice. The Col2 appears to be enough to show the results. Are their different advantages of the different lines, or is there a benefit in targeting slightly different populations?</italic> </p><p>There are different benefits of these different Cre lines since we wanted to explore clonal cell dynamics during formation of cartilage from early mesenchymal condensations and also we wanted to address how cells divide in the very early condensations. For this reason we needed to target neural crest stem cells, and therefore we recombined the confetti colors in the facial mesenchyme as early as E8.5 with the help of <italic>PLP-CreERT2</italic> and <italic>Sox10-CreERT2</italic>. However, later we wanted to explore cell dynamics in more mature cartilage, and <italic>Col2-CreERT2</italic> line appeared to be classical and working well. Still, at early stages of cartilage development and maturation it was not as efficient as <italic>Sox10-CreERT2</italic>. Thus, the reasons for using different Cre lines are purely technical. Importantly, all Cre lines show the same pattern and visualize the same process – this adds to the reliability of our study.</p><p><italic>The authors call their cartilages flat. I am not sure this is a good description of cartilages that are in complex 3D sheets. Perhaps their definition can be explained further. Do they mean a smooth surface?</italic> </p><p>Yes, we mean the smooth surface and that these cartilage form sheets or curved planes. Typically, at the microscale these cartilages appear quite flat even if they eventually do bend on the macroscale. We agree with the reviewer that it is better to clarify the term, and following the reviewer’s hint we started to call these cartilages 3D sheets/planes or sheet-shaped cartilages in many places in our text. We hope it provides a more clear picture now.</p><p><italic>I cannot comment on the model presented from a mathematical point of view but the graphics are generally very good.</italic> </p><p>We thank our reviewer for this comment. We did our best to perform good modelling!</p><p><italic>In the ACVR1 experiments clumps are shown at the periphery of the cartilages. This is a very nice clear result. In these mice are the cartilages shorter, as would be predicted if the cells were failing to intercalate successfully? In Image N there are quite a few GFP cells that might be expected to have altered the intercalation in this part of cartilage.</italic> </p><p>ACVR1 experiment is indeed very clear and interesting. Still, the recombination efficiency (less than 5%) is not sufficient to ruin the geometry at really large scale. GFP+ clusters are quite few within the cartilages. This is the nature of this mouse model. We can see only very local disturbances in some locations where by chance we succeeded in higher recombination rate. We show the geometrical problems in 3D in one of those locations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O-P</xref>.</p><p><italic>The PCP mutants are interesting to illustrate the difference between initial patterning defects and problems with later scaling. Likewise the Gs-α experiments separate the role of integration from proliferation for controlling cartilage thickness.</italic> </p><p><italic>In the early section of the text the authors suggest that the cartilage cells move in from the perichondrial layer, seeding the vertical columns. The origin of the new cartilage cells is an important point and is tested using dilution of H2B-GFP. I find this experiment the weakest in the paper as it does not clearly prove a perichondrium origin, but simply reiterates that the perichondrium and cartilage cells are clearly clonal.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and we removed the H2B-GFP part. It does not add anything new.</p><p><italic>The graph shows that the perichondrium appears to proliferate more than the cartilage cells but this is not showing point of origin. Time lapse would be a clear way of proving the origin of the cells.</italic> </p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and attempted to perform time lapse studies on thick slices of embryonic cartilages and regenerating salamander limb. These new data can be found in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and 10. Imaging of facial cartilage and regenerating limb shows that perichondrial cells can produce clones of chondrocytes. However, despite this is more direct evidence as compared to what we showed before, we decided to tone down the perichondrial origin of clonal columns since markers for this layer and its heterogeneity are unknown. We followed advices from the reviewers and decided to stay rather cautious. The readers can see the data and judge for themselves. In the revised version of the manuscript we do not claim, but only suggest that perichondrial cells provide for growth and regeneration by producing clones of chondrocytes.</p><p><italic>The last part of the paper deals with shape changes during later development. A key part is an analysis of bending but do the cartilages actually bend? From the Introduction I thought the nasal cartilage was simply scaling from an original pre-cartilage template with minor adjustments. The cartilage is not a sheet but already curved. If bending does occur this should be shown very clearly using real images, rather than the schematic shown. The sections of the nasal region in the supplementary data do not give much impression of bending, perhaps at the bottom of the capsule?</italic> </p><p><italic>Confirmation of bending is necessary to confirm that modelling on flat plastic is relevant. The use of actual materials, however, is a very nice way to visualise morphogenetic movements, following from the work of Enrico Coen on plant morphogenesis.</italic> </p><p>We do see how the new bends occur in the nasal capsule in transition from E13.5 to E14.5. The central groove becomes apparent and the lateral and anterior bends appear for the very first time. This allows the posterior bulge to form. All these bending elements are highlighted now in the real nasal capsule stage-dependent transformation outline in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We made this point to be better explained in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and figure legends thanks to the reviewer comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript is much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed by alterations in the text prior to acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) With respect to whether chondrocytes function autonomously to control cartilage morphology, how could the authors exclude the possible roles of this layer? They argue that for an autonomous effect based on observing that cells with recombined GPF express Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L and N</xref>). However, there are two layers of perichondrium: and inner layer that expresses Sox9 and an out layer that expresses collagen type I. Could this outer layer cause a non-autonomous effect in cartilage shaping? The outer layer perichondrium also contains recombined cells in both confetti mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and caALK2 mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>), both of which are driven by Sox10 promoter. Therefore, the possibility of non-autonomous effects should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>The possible non-autonomous effects are now discussed: “In addition to this, the perichondrium might mediate non-autonomous effects in the cartilage in case of cAlk2 and GSα experiments. Genetic tracing shows that some perichondrial cells always recombine with <italic>Sox10- PLP-</italic> and <italic>Col2-CreERT2</italic> lines, and, in case of functional experiments, may indirectly control some evens in more mature layers. Also, it is not clear how the fine border of the cartilage is set, and whether the perichondrial layer may play a key border-setting role during development and regeneration. This should be investigated further.”</p><p><italic>2) Kudos to the authors for trying very hard to do live imaging to test the lineage relationship between chondrocytes and perichondrium. However, the &quot;n&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>) is very low. Given that the total number of cell division drops in organ culture, such that they cannot perform statistical analysis, they should leave out this data.</italic> </p><p>We agree and we removed the data.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, the authors use salamander regenerating limb as a tissue model for live imaging. However, cell behaviors could be very different during normal development versus regeneration. In addition, it previously has been shown that during cartilage regeneration, perichondrium cells can regenerate chondrocytes (Srour MK et al., Natural large-scale regeneration of rib cartilage in a mouse model, 2015). Therefore, these data may not be relevant to the story and the authors may want to leave it for a different paper.</italic> </p><p>We agree and we reorganized the figure and the text so it better reflects the discussion of clonal patterns during growth of rod-shaped cartilages rather than perichondrial cells as a source of growth.</p><p><italic>4) The paper would profit from some rewriting. Parts of the paper are not well organized; the Summary and Introduction are too long and some of the contents seem to be misplaced; there are many grammatical mistakes.</italic> </p><p>We shortened the Summary and Introduction, reorganized the text to make it better ordered and we also fixed all grammar mistakes. Finally, we performed the large-scale language correction being assisted by native speakers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
