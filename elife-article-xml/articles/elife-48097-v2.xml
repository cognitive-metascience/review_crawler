Thymocytes interact with a variety of thymic-resident cells that present self-peptide:MHC complexes, and thymocytes bearing TCRs with high affinity for self-ligands can receive apoptotic death signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starr et al., 2003</xref>). Apoptosis is an immunologically silent form of cell death that is generally thought to be cell-autonomous once initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strasser et al., 2000</xref>). Although peptide-presenting cells provide the initial apoptotic stimulus to autoreactive thymocytes, whether additional cellular interactions are required to mediate thymocyte death remains unknown.</p><p>In addition to the affinity of TCR for self-peptide-MHC, the nature of the peptide-presenting cell is also an important determinant of T cell fate. For example, hematopoietic cells, especially dendritic cells (DC), are potent inducers of negative selection, whereas cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) are specialized to mediate positive selection, promoting thymocyte maturation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallegos and Bevan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCaughtry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohnmacht et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Proietto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taniguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wirasinha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yap et al., 2018</xref>). Distinctive features of these cell types, including specialized peptide processing machinery in cTECs and high expression of costimulatory ligands in DCs, play an important role in instructing divergent thymocyte fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starr et al., 2003</xref>). Peptide repertoire and costimulation can contribute to the intensity of TCR signal experienced by a thymocyte, but whether the peptide-presenting cells provide additional TCR-independent signals to promote thymocyte death or differentiation is largely unknown.</p><p>A related question is whether a strong TCR signal is sufficient to commit thymocytes to die in a cell-autonomous fashion, or whether other cellular interactions are required. Early observations of apoptotic bodies within thymic phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strasser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Surh and Sprent, 1994</xref>), together with time-lapse microscopy of thymocytes undergoing negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>), suggest a close coupling between thymocyte death and phagocytosis. In particular, visualization of dying thymocytes and phagocytes within thymic tissue slices showed that the death of autoreactive thymocytes invariably occurred during close contact with phagocytes, and in most cases death appeared to occur after phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether phagocytes actually contributed to the death of thymocytes by serving as peptide-presenting cells and/or by actively inducing cell death.</p><p>Dendritic cells are the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APC) for priming naïve T cells and also present self-peptide for negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallegos and Bevan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCaughtry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Norbury et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohnmacht et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Proietto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taniguchi et al., 2012</xref>), whereas thymic macrophages are known for their role in clearing away apoptotic thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Surh and Sprent, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, there is considerable functional and phenotypic overlap between DC and macrophages. For example, the marker F4/80 is often used to identify macrophages, but also marks a population with substantial antigen presentation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guerri et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the marker CD11c is often used to identify DCs, but is co-expressed with F4/80 by a subset of DC-like cells in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladi et al., 2008</xref>). To what extent the functions of peptide presentation and phagocytic clearance reside within separate or overlapping thymic cell populations remains unclear.</p><p>Phagocytes recognize and uptake apoptotic cells via receptors for ‘eat-me’ signals displayed on the surface of dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arandjelovic and Ravichandran, 2015</xref>). For example, apoptosis induces asymmetry in the plasma membrane, leading to the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which is then recognized by PS receptors on phagocytes. A variety of ‘eat-me’ receptors are expressed and functional in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyanishi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tacke et al., 2015</xref>), but the mechanisms that mediate the efficient removal of autoreactive thymocytes during negative selection have not yet been clearly defined.</p><p>Here, we used a thymic slice system in which thymocytes undergo negative selection in situ to address these questions. We show that depletion of thymic phagocytes or blocking phagocytosis impaired negative selection, allowing for the increased survival of thymocytes that experience strong TCR signals. We also identify the PS receptor Tim-4 as an important player during negative selection to tissue-restricted antigens (TRA), and provide evidence for reduced quiescence of CD8 T cells that developed in a Tim-4 deficient environment. Finally, we demonstrate that negative selection is most efficient when the same cell both presents the agonist peptide, and phagocytoses the self-reactive thymocyte. Taken together, our data suggest a model for thymocyte negative selection in which the apoptotic program initiated by strong TCR signals is facilitated by phagocytosis. Thus, thymic phagocytes are not merely ‘scavengers’, but rather play prominent roles in the induction of self-tolerance, both as peptide-presenting cells and as active inducers of self-reactive thymocyte death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of thymic phagocytes inhibits negative selection</title><p>To examine the role of phagocytes during negative selection, we used thymic tissue slices prepared from Macrophage-Associated Fas-Induced Apoptosis (MAFIA) mice. In these mice, an inducible suicide gene under the control of the colony stimulating factor one receptor (Csf1R) promoter is expressed in DC and macrophage subsets, rendering them susceptible to depletion upon exposure to the small molecule inducer AP20187 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnett et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously observed closely coupled thymocyte death and phagocytosis by GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in thymic slices from LysMGFP reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faust et al., 2000</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of the thymus of LysMGFP mice revealed that GFP-expressing cells include a subset of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> macrophages that have been previously described as having potent phagocytic abilities, as well as a subset of CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tacke et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed expression of the MAFIA transgene in these subsets using flow cytometric analysis to measure expression of a linked GFP gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We observed that treatment of thymic slices for 16 hr of culture with AP20187 led to the depletion of approximately 50% of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> macrophages and CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DC in MAFIA, but not WT, thymic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>To assess the impact of phagocyte depletion on negative selection, we used a previously described peptide-induced model of negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>). Total thymocytes from mice with a defined MHC class I-restricted TCR transgene (OT-I) were overlaid onto thymic slices with or without the cognate antigen (SIINFEKL, OVAp), along with a reference thymocyte population (either F5 TCR transgenic or polyclonal WT thymocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We used flow cytometry to determine the ratio of viable OT-I:reference thymocytes remaining in the slice as a measure of negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Au-Yeung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melichar et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Consistent with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dzhagalov et al., 2013</xref>), we observed a substantial reduction in the number of live OT-I thymocytes relative to reference thymocytes in thymic slices containing OVAp after 16 hr of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), with no difference between untreated WT and MAFIA slices (data not shown). In contrast, on phagocyte-depleted slices (MAFIA+AP20187) containing OVAp, the ratio of live OT-I:reference thymocytes was similar to that in control slices without antigen, consistent with the idea that phagocytes promote negative selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Depletion of phagocytes inhibits negative selection without dampening antigen recognition.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Strategy to quantify negative selection: labeled OT-I and reference thymocytes (either wild type or F5 TCR transgenic) were overlaid onto thymic slices with or without OVA peptide, cultured for 16 hr, and then dissociated for analysis by flow cytometry. Lower panels show the flow cytometry gating strategy used to quantify live OT-I and reference thymocytes.

This raises the possibility that the observed defect in negative selection on phagocyte-depleted slices could be the result of thymocytes receiving insufficient TCR signals. However, OT-I thymocytes on phagocyte-depleted slices did not show decreased levels of the TCR activation marker CD69, indicating that surviving thymocytes had received strong TCR signals, in spite of phagocyte depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). These results suggest that thymocytes on phagocyte-depleted thymic slices exhibit enhanced survival despite continuing to receive strong TCR signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Negative selection and phagocytosis in a model of tissue-restricted antigen presentation</title><p>Addition of agonist peptide directly to thymic tissue slices serves as a model for negative selection to ubiquitous self-antigen. To further characterize the relationship between thymocyte death and phagocytosis, we also examined a model of negative selection to TRA. In RIPmOVA transgenic mice, the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA), which provides the agonist peptide for OT-I thymocytes, is expressed in a subset of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), and is presented in the medulla by mTECs and hematopoietic-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallegos and Bevan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurts et al., 1996</xref>).

Additionally, we show that negative selection is most efficient when the phagocyte also presents the negative selecting peptide. Taken together, our data support a model for negative selection in which phagocytosis helps to enforce the ultimate death of thymocytes that have initiated the apoptotic process following a strong TCR signal.

Our current work adds to a growing body of evidence that the early events associated with apoptosis are not necessarily a death sentence. For example, activated T cells can transiently express active caspase-3 and expose PS at the cell surface, but ultimately avoid cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McComb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miossec et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, phagocyte-dependent killing is critical for regulating the size of T cell, erythrocyte, and neutrophil populations, as well as removal of transient structures during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albacker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoeppner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khandelwal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lang and Bishop, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marín-Teva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oldenborg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddien et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, mounting evidence suggests that phagocytosis contributes to the extent of cell death in vivo. While it is possible that autoreactive thymocytes that are not phagocytosed would ultimately undergo a delayed death, our data indicating that CD8 T cells that develop in a Tim-4 deficient environment display reduced quiescence support the view that at least some of these cells may escape deletion and persist as mature T cells with increased self-reactivity.

Following phagocytosis, the engulfed cell would be exposed to lysosomal proteases and other degradative enzymes.

It is tempting to speculate that the cytotoxic environment that a cell encounters within the phagosome following engulfment is ultimately responsible for its death.

On the other hand, globally blocking PS significantly impaired both forms of negative selection. These results could indicate that Tim-4 plays a non-redundant role in phagocytosis in the medulla, the site of TRA presentation, whereas other PS receptors may participate in phagocytosis in the thymic cortex, where negative selection to ubiquitous antigen takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCaughtry et al., 2008</xref>).

These changes are consistent with increased homeostatic proliferation characteristic of T cells with elevated self-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hogan et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, these changes were not observed in CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with evidence that thymocyte death has a larger impact on the CD8, compared to the CD4, T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>) and the relatively modest role of deletion in maintaining tolerance within CD4 lineage T cells, due to the diversion of self-reactive CD4 T cells into the regulatory T cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legoux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malhotra et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, <italic>Timd4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice do not develop overt autoimmunity, likely due to the presence of other tolerance mechanisms, such as regulatory T cells and peripheral tolerance mechanisms.</p><p>Our current data contribute to emerging evidence that the context in which an autoreactive thymocyte encounters peptides, shaped largely by the characteristics of the peptide-presenting cell, has profound impacts on its fate. We recently reported that thymic dendritic cells that provide both high-affinity TCR ligands and a local source of IL-2 can efficiently support the development of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weist et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the decision of an autoreactive thymocyte to die or differentiate may ultimately depend on whether it engages a peptide-presenting cell that promotes its death or supports its further development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were bred and maintained under pathogen-free conditions in an American Association of Laboratory Animal Care-approved facility at the University of California, Berkeley.

Thymocytes do not proliferate at the timepoints collected, allowing overlaid thymocytes to be distinguished from slice resident thymocytes by Cell Proliferation Dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In imaging experiments, OT-I thymocytes were depleted of mature CD8 single positives using the EasySep Biotin Positive Selection Kit (Stemcell Technologies) with anti-human/mouse β7 integrin antibody (FIB504, Biolegend) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Thymic lobes were cleaned of connective tissue, embedded in 4% agarose with a low melting point (GTG-NuSieve Agarose, Lonza), and sectioned into slices of 200–400 μm using a vibratome (1000 Plus sectioning system, Leica). Slices were overlaid onto 0.4 μm transwell inserts set in six well tissue culture plates with 1 ml cRPMI under the insert. 0.5−2 × 10<sup>6</sup> thymocytes in 10 μl cRPMI were overlaid onto each slice and allowed to migrate into the slice for 2 hr, then excess thymocytes were removed by gentle washing with PBS. Thymocytes actively migrate into the slice and localize as expected based on their maturation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehrlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halkias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurd and Robey, 2016</xref>). For peptide-induced negative selection, 10 μl of 1 μM SIINFEKL (AnaSpec) in PBS was overlaid onto each slice for 30 min, then removed by pipetting. To quantify negative selection, we used a fluorescent live/dead stain (Ghost Dye Violet 510 or Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780) to identify live cells (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We then calculated the ratio of total live OT-I thymocytes to total live reference (either wild type thymocytes or thymocytes expressing an irrelevant TCR: F5) recovered from the thymic slice. In general, the ratio of OT-I to reference populations was close to 1.0 in the absence of OVA, however, there was some variability due to differential ability of the two populations to enter or survive in the tissue. We therefore further normalized the ratios of OT-I:reference thymocytes in each experiment so that the average of the corresponding ‘no OVA’ samples was always 1.0. For depletion of phagocytes, 1 μM AP20187 (Clontech) was added to the media under the transwell and 10 μl of 10 μM AP20187 in PBS was added on top of each slice overnight (16–18 hr). The drug was washed out from the top of the slice with PBS prior to overlaying thymocytes. For Annexin V treatment, thymocytes were resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with purified Annexin V (BioLegend) at 200 μg/ml prior to overlaying on the slice. Following peptide treatment, 10 μl of purified Annexin V at 200 μg/ml in Annexin V binding buffer was overlaid onto each slice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures</title><p>Bone marrow was flushed from the femurs and tibias of mice into sterile PBS, and treated with ammonium chloride–potassium bicarbonate buffer for lysis of red blood cells.

negative selection of T-cells. It also shows that either blocking phosphatidylserine or one of its receptors reduces thymocyte death by affecting phagocytosis. The results facilitate our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of thymic negative selection, which is important for the establishment of immunological self-tolerance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A role for phagocytosis in inducing cell death during thymocyte negative selection&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>During T cell development, autoreactive thymocytes undergo apoptotic cell death induced by strong signals perceived through the T cell receptor (TCR). A number of distinct antigen presenting cell (APC) subsets present self-peptide on MHC and have been shown to facilitate this negative selection process. However, it has been shown that distinct APC subsets may promote different T cell developmental fates independent of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions. Here, Kurd et al. investigate additional cellular interactions that may facilitate thymocyte negative selection. Through the use of a thymic slice system, the authors demonstrate that thymic phagocytes aid in the removal of autoreactive thymocytes following clonal deletion in a phosphatidylserine-Tim-4 dependent manner. Thus, they propose a two-step model by which thymocytes first undergo high affinity self-peptide-MHC interactions, inducing phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Second, uptake dependent on phosphatidylserine expression leads to subsequent cell death.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that phagocytosis in the thymus not only serves the purpose of removing dying cells, but in fact is an essential prerequisite for efficient negative selection. This is an extremely interesting and conceptually striking scenario. A major concern is that these conclusions are entirely based on (undoubtedly striking!) observations in the thymic slice model. However, it remains somewhat unclear in how far the thymic slice model reflects steady state clonal deletion. Evidence to support the authors' conclusions in a steady model of in vivo clonal deletion is unfortunately not provided in the manuscript (see comment to Figure 4; this is such an obvious thing to do) and is of crucial importance to meet the standards of <italic>eLife</italic>. The conclusion that phagocytosis mediates negative selection in vivo is perhaps overstated given that the scope of their work is entirely within the slice model system.</p><p>2) The reference population seems to be an unspecified mix of irrelevant TCR and polyclonal thymocytes. Individually these are relevant controls, but it is difficult to understand the rational for mixing them together. Evidence that these two populations have similar performance in the assay is required to justify this approach.</p><p>3) Figure 1: It would help the reader to better describe the composition of input (and remaining) cells in order to put into perspective that at best 'only' half of the OT-I cells are lost. Are the input cells CD8 SP cells, total cells from OT-I thymi including DP / DN cells or otherwise fractionated cells?</p><p>Wouldn't MAFIA + OVA without AP20187 (instead of WT with AP20187) be a necessary control for comparison to MAFIA + OVA with AP20187 in Figures1B and 1C?</p><p>4) Figure 1 (and other figures describing CD69 expression): The interpretation of unchanged CD69 expression of cells crucially relies on knowing at which time point this analysis was done. This information seems not to be included. Analyzing this at 16h is probably not a useful indication of what happens to cells that are prone to die before the 16h timepoint. (Are cells that have not died by 16h resistant to peptide induced cell death; see Figure 2? Which again relates to better describing the input population and the composition of cells that remain at 16h: is it preferentially DP cells that are lost?)</p><p>5) In addition, in Figure 1B and 1C the WT and WT+AP20187 groups show a trend to difference (every data point is lower in the AP20187 group) even if this does not reach statistical significance. It is also worth noting that many of the OT-I/ref graphs combine experiments to give n numbers in the range of 15-34 while the CD69 MFI graphs have n numbers of 5 and also use a non-parametric test with considerably lower power than the ANOVA applied to the OT-I/ref data. As a result, the statistical tests used on the CD69 MFI graphs are only able to detect much larger effect sizes than those of the OT-I/ref data and should be interpreted with great caution. In particular Figure 1C does not clearly demonstrate that CD69 is not reduced by AP20187 and combining the data from the un shown representative experiments should be considered.</p><p>6) Figure 2B: This shows an isolated event. Quantifying the fraction of all recorded death events occurring (a) 'in isolation', (b) in contact and (c) inside a GFP<sup>+</sup> cell seems necessary to bolster the authors' claim that death and phagocytosis is closely coupled.</p><p>7) Figure 3: These are striking observations, but again: without knowing what the input population consists of, it seems surprising that the extent of death (as inferred from a change in the ratio of OT-I to ref cells) is so marginal (&lt; 2-fold) (in particular when OVA peptide is used). In how far was this system tuned towards low doses of OVA peptide, or in other words, does the apparent rescue from apoptosis only occur when low doses of OVA peptide are used? This would be informative also in light of the question whether phagocytosis may be particularly (or only?) crucial in cases of relatively 'low' signal strengths.</p><p>8) Figure 4: The authors must have crossed RIPmOVA (<italic>Timd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>Timd4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) to OT-I. This would be extremely important in order to show a role for Tim-4 in 'steady state' negative selection independent of the thymic slice system.</p><p>9) Currently the reduction in OT-I cells in Figures 4 and 5 is considered to be due to a loss of phagocytosis but a defect in phagocytosis is not demonstrated in their system. The authors demonstrate that DCs have phagocytic activity, it should be shown that this activity is reduced in Tim-4 KO DCs.</p><p>10) The authors propose that direct peptide presentation by a phagocyte results in more efficient negative selection (Figure 5). However, a thymic slice system in which phagocytes lack peptide presenting capability (MHC I), but are still capable of phagocytosis, is an experiment that could more robustly support this claim. The authors demonstrate in Figure 1 that thymocytes still receive strong signals through their TCR (based on CD69 MFI) in the absence of phagocytes, therefore direct peptide presentation by phagocytes may not be necessary for efficient negative selection.</p><p>11) In the Discussion, the authors point to several publications that report that cells may initiate early apoptosis programs (active caspase-3 and phosphatidylserine expression), but ultimately avoid cell death. The authors draw a similar conclusion here, but do not show that the thymocytes that would have otherwise undergone phagocytosis in this system are in fact viable and would go on to differentiate. The authors suggest that phagocytes may be the critical last step to thymocyte death, however they should discuss the possibility that phagocytes could just facilitate the efficient removal of dying cells and cell death may ultimately just be delayed in their absence.</p><p>12) Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. Control groups showing WT and MAFIA cells without AP20187 are needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48097.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that phagocytosis in the thymus not only serves the purpose of removing dying cells, but in fact is an essential prerequisite for efficient negative selection.

This is in line with previous reports that <italic>Timd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display elevated anti-DNA antibodies and T cell hyperactivity following immunization (Rodriguez-Manzanet et al., 2010). While these mild autoimmune phenotypes were attributed to defects in peripheral phagocytosis (Rodriguez-Manzanet et al., 2010), our new data show that CD8 T cells that arise in a Tim-4-deficient thymus are intrinsically less quiescent compared to CD8 T cells that develop in wild type mice, even in a Tim-4-sufficient periphery. These new results support our conclusion that Tim-4-mediated phagocytosis promotes efficient negative selection, and in its absence T cells with borderline self-reactivity can escape deletion and survive long-term in the periphery. We have also edited our wording throughout the text to reflect that phagocytosis may not be an absolute requirement for thymocyte death during negative selection, but rather that phagocytosis promotes thymocyte death and increases the efficiency of negative selection (Introduction final paragraph, subsection “The phosphatidylserine receptor Tim-4 promotes negative selection of CD8 T cells in the thymus”, and Discussion paragraph one).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reference population seems to be an unspecified mix of irrelevant TCR and polyclonal thymocytes.

To summarize, we used total, unfractionated, OT-I thymocytes from TCR transgenic H2b mice (positive selecting background) composed mostly of DP and CD8 SP thymocytes for all experiments in which we quantified the extent of OT-I thymocyte deletion. As mentioned in point 4, we did not attempt to separately quantify the loss of DP vs. CD8SP, because antigen encounter by DP thymocytes leads to a rapid downregulation of CD4 and CD8 (a phenomenon termed CD4/CD8 “dulling”)(McGargill and Hogquist, 1999), making it difficult to determine the separation between DP and CD8 SP populations for OT-I thymocytes exposed to OVA. For the imaging experiments (Figure 2B and videos), we depleted the most mature CD8 SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) prior to adding OT-I thymocytes to the slice.

By measuring CD69 levels at 16 hours, our goal was to focus on thymocytes that had survived negative selection under conditions of impaired phagocytosis, in order to rule out that these cells escaped death due to insufficient TCR signals. We have reworded the relevant sections of the figure legends (for Figures 1C, 3B, 3D, 4B, 4D, and 6C) and Results section to clarify this point. We are currently preparing a separate manuscript describing the fate of thymocytes that survive negative selection after 16 hours, which provides evidence that these thymocytes undergo agonist selection into the CD8αα intraepithelial lymphocyte lineage, and describes factors which may protect some thymocytes from death and instead promote agonist selection into this lineage. As mentioned in point 3, we did not attempt to separately quantify the loss of DP vs. CD8SP, because antigen encounter by DP thymocytes leads to a rapid downregulation of CD4 and CD8 (a phenomenon termed CD4/CD8 “dulling”)(McGargill and Hogquist, 1999), making it difficult to determine the separation between DP and CD8 SP populations on slices where thymocytes are exposed to OVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In addition, in Figure 1B and 1C the WT and WT+AP20187 groups show a trend to difference (every data point is lower in the AP20187 group) even if this does not reach statistical significance. It is also worth noting that many of the OT-I/ref graphs combine experiments to give n numbers in the range of 15-34 while the CD69 MFI graphs have n numbers of 5 and also use a non-parametric test with considerably lower power than the ANOVA applied to the OT-I/ref data. As a result, the statistical tests used on the CD69 MFI graphs are only able to detect much larger effect sizes than those of the OT-I/ref data and should be interpreted with great caution. In particular Figure 1C does not clearly demonstrate that CD69 is not reduced by AP20187 and combining the data from the un shown representative experiments should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>While there is a slight trend towards reduced death in the WT+AP20187+OVAp group in Figure 1B, there is a clear significant difference between this group and the MAFIA+AP20187+OVAp, suggesting that treatment with drug has the biggest impact on MAFIA slices, in which phagocytes are susceptible to deletion, and any potential off-target impacts of the drug on negative selection are relatively minimal. Moreover, our findings that negative selection is also impaired upon two additional conditions in which phagocytosis is impaired (blocking phosphatidylserine and in a Tim-4 deficient thymic environment), strongly suggest that the impairment in negative selection that we observe on MAFIA+AP20187+OVAp slices is driven mainly by a lack of phagocytosis as a result of phagocyte depletion, and not an off-target effect of the drug.</p><p>To provide a more robust measurement of CD69 upregulation, we have now combined the CD69 data from all independent experiments in Figure 1C, and in all additional figures demonstrating CD69 upregulation, and applied the same ANOVA statistical test that we applied to the OT-I/ref graphs (Figures 1C, 3B, 3D, 4B, 4D, and 6C, and corresponding figure legends).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2B: This shows an isolated event.

To summarize the relevant findings from the earlier study: we observed a total of 31 cell death events of which all 31 occurred while the dying thymocyte was in close contact with, or engulfed by, a phagocyte. In comparison, of the thymocytes from these same runs that did not die, 54% were in contact with, and 17% were engulfed by, a phagocyte. We also reported that for 14 examples of cell death (34%) we were also able to observe the initial contact with the phagocyte, and that the time between the initial contact with a phagocyte and death varied considerably from 2-56 minutes. We note that many of the experiments in the current manuscript use a peptide induced model of negative selection, so our earlier published imaging studies should provide a valid comparison to the functional studies presented here. We included Figure 2B and the videos only to make the point that simultaneous phagocytosis and death also occurs with AIRE-dependent negative selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 3: These are striking observations, but again: without knowing what the input population consists of, it seems surprising that the extent of death (as inferred from a change in the ratio of OT-I to ref cells) is so marginal (&lt; 2-fold) (in particular when OVA peptide is used).

With regard to the extent of negative selection, this was in line with a previously published study in which thymocytes were depleted of mature CD8 single positive cells prior to overlay on the slice (see Figure 5A from Dzhagalov et al., 2013). Thus it is unlikely that the use of an unfractionated thymocyte population greatly impacted the extent of negative selection in our system. While a relatively high concentration of OVA peptide was used in Figure 3 and 4, we agree with the reviewers point that phagocytosis may play a more important role in inducing thymocyte death under limiting antigen conditions. Indeed, we proposed this explanation for the observation that negative selection to a tissue-restricted antigen, which is present at low abundance, was more greatly impacted by Tim-4 deficiency than negative selection to exogenously added OVA peptide (Figure 4A and C, Discussion paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4: The authors must have crossed RIPmOVA (Timd4<sup>-/-</sup> or Timd4<sup>+/+</sup>) to OT-I.

While the mild autoimmune phenotype of these mice had been previously attributed to defects in peripheral phagocytosis (Rodriguez-Manzanet et al., 2010), our new data show that CD8 T cells that arise in a Tim-4 deficient thymus are intrinsically less quiescent compared to CD8 T cells that develop in wild type mice, even in a Tim-4-sufficient peripheral environment. These new results support our conclusion that Tim-4-mediated phagocytosis is required for efficient negative selection, and in its absence T cells with borderline self-reactivity can escape deletion. Given that loss of Tim-4 had a modest impact on negative selection compared to Annexin V blocking or phagocyte depletion (likely due to the fact that other PS receptors remain intact in <italic>Timd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals), and given that there are also multiple tolerance mechanisms still in place (regulatory T cells and other peripheral tolerance mechanisms), we would not expect to observe overt autoimmunity in <italic>Timd4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>With regard to the specific experiment suggested by the reviewer, we did not attempt to generate OT-IxRIPmOVAxTim-4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, since OT-IxRIPmOVA mice already have a high mortality rate shortly after birth (Koehli et al., 2014). As an alternative strategy, we attempted to examine the impact of Tim-4 deficiency on tolerance in the RIPmOVA model by generating neonatal partial hematopoietic chimeras in which OT-I bone marrow was injected into RIPmOVA or Tim-4<sup>-/-</sup> RIPmOVA neonates. Unfortunately, this experiment was not interpretable due to residual contaminating mature OT-I T cells from the bone marrow which were able to home to the thymus and expand in response to OVA expression there. Since these cells were mature at the time of transfer, they were not subject to negative selection in the thymus, making it impossible to discern whether any differences in negative selection existed between the RIPmOVA and Tim-4<sup>-/-</sup> RIPmOVA hosts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Currently the reduction in OT-I cells in Figures 4 and 5 is considered to be due to a loss of phagocytosis but a defect in phagocytosis is not demonstrated in their system. The authors demonstrate that DCs have phagocytic activity, it should be shown that this activity is reduced in Tim-4 KO DCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Several studies have previously demonstrated that Tim-4 plays an important role in phagocytosis within several phagocyte populations, including thymic phagocytes (Miyanishi et al., 2007; Rodriguez-Manzanet et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors propose that direct peptide presentation by a phagocyte results in more efficient negative selection (Figure 5). However, a thymic slice system in which phagocytes lack peptide presenting capability (MHC I), but are still capable of phagocytosis, is an experiment that could more robustly support this claim. The authors demonstrate in Figure 1 that thymocytes still receive strong signals through their TCR (based on CD69 MFI) in the absence of phagocytes, therefore direct peptide presentation by phagocytes may not be necessary for efficient negative selection.</p></disp-quote><p>Several previous studies have demonstrated reduced efficiency of negative selection under conditions in which hematopoietic-derived cells (including phagocytes) cannot present antigen, but would be capable of phagocytosis, in line with our findings that antigen presentation by phagocytic cells promotes negative selection (McCaughtry et al., 2008; Melichar et al., 2013; Proietto and Wu, 2008; Wirasinha et al., 2019; Yap et al., 2018). Moreover, we believe that the experiment presented in Figure 5 addresses the same questions as the experiment proposed by the reviewer. In this setting, endogenous phagocytes do not present the antigenic peptide (because the peptide is exclusively loaded onto the APC population that is added to the thymic slice), but retain normal phagocytic activity. Under these conditions, the phagocytic ability of the peptide presenting population significantly impacts the efficiency of negative selection. Moreover, we did not intend to argue that peptide presentation by phagocytes is a requirement for negative selection. Rather, we interpret our data to indicate that the efficiency of negative selection is improved when the same cell can both present agonist peptide and phagocytose the self-reactive thymocytes, as outlined in the Discussion and Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In the Discussion, the authors point to several publications that report that cells may initiate early apoptosis programs (active caspase-3 and phosphatidylserine expression), but ultimately avoid cell death. The authors draw a similar conclusion here, but do not show that the thymocytes that would have otherwise undergone phagocytosis in this system are in fact viable and would go on to differentiate. The authors suggest that phagocytes may be the critical last step to thymocyte death, however they should discuss the possibility that phagocytes could just facilitate the efficient removal of dying cells and cell death may ultimately just be delayed in their absence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional text to the Discussion acknowledging that thymocyte death may be delayed, rather than completely blocked, in the absence of phagocytosis (paragraph two). We also note that the revised manuscript contains new in vivo data (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and subsection “The phosphatidylserine receptor Tim-4 promotes negative selection of CD8 T cells in the thymus”, and Discussion, paragraph five) suggesting enhanced survival of autoreactive thymocytes due to defective thymic phagocytosis. Specifically, we show that CD8 T cells that arise in a Tim-4 deficient thymus have reduced quiescence weeks after residing in a Tim-4 sufficient peripheral environment. These data imply that impaired phagocytosis in the thymus has a long-lasting impact on T cells, likely due to the failure of some T cells with borderline self-reactivity to undergo negative selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. Control groups showing WT and MAFIA cells without AP20187 are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, the values shown represent the proportion of viable macrophages or dendritic cells in the slice after 16-18 hours of AP20187 treatment normalized to the proportion of viable macrophages or dendritic cells present within untreated slices, therefore the mean for the untreated groups is set to 1. We have now added these groups for better visualization of the changes that occur in response to AP20187 treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
