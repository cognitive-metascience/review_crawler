The sAHP amplitude increases with aging and may underlie age related memory decline. The sAHP is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> conductance, the molecular identity of which has remained elusive until a recent report suggested the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, IK1 (KCNN4) as the sAHP channel in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The signature pharmacology of IK1, blockade by TRAM-34, was reported for the sAHP and underlying current. We have examined the sAHP and find no evidence that TRAM-34 affects either the current underling the sAHP or excitability of CA1 or basolateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. In addition, CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice exhibit a characteristic sAHP current. Our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons carry signals in the form of electrical impulses called action potentials. These nerve impulses result from ions flowing through proteins called ion channels in the neuron’s membrane, and they determine how the neuron communicates with neighboring neurons. The number of action potentials a neuron can produce can vary over a wide range. In the brain, a particular kind of ion channel limits the number of action potentials that many neurons produce via a negative feedback mechanism. That is to say, nerve impulses activate this ion channel and the activated channel then makes the neuron less able to send further nerve impulses for a while.The activity of this ion channel increases with age and it may be responsible for some forms of age-related decline in cognitive abilities. However, the exact identity of the ion channel responsible was unclear.</p><p>Recent research has suggested the ion channel in question was a protein called IK1. This conclusion was largely based on how this ion channel responded to drugs in the laboratory. Wang, Materos-Aparico et al. sought to verify this conclusion and, in contrast with the previous reports, found that the IK1 ion channel did not respond to these drugs in the same way when it was in neurons in the brains of mice.</p><p>In further experiments, mice that had been engineered to lack the IK1 ion channel still showed the characteristic negative feedback that regulates the firing of action potentials. Thus, Wang, Materos-Aparico et al. found no evidence to support the previous conclusion, and instead conclude that the exact identity of this important ion channel in the brain has yet to be defined.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11206.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11206.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HEK293</kwd><kwd>Afterhyperpolarization</kwd><kwd>sAHP</kwd><kwd>IK1</kwd><kwd>TRAM-34</kwd><kwd>KCNN4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS03888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maylie</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelman</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH093599</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maylie</surname><given-names>Jim</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelman</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storm</surname><given-names>Johan F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SR120300015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sah</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The slow afterhyperpolarization that follows a burst of action potentials is a powerful regulator of neuronal excitability and is not due to IK1 (KCNN4), a member of the SK channel family.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1980, Hotson and Prince described a long lasting hyperpolarization (AHP) that followed current-induced repetitive firing of action potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotson and Prince, 1980</xref>). Since this initial finding the role of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) has been elucidated particularly in the hippocampus where its activity profoundly impacts learning. Thus, for example, the sAHP increases with aging and ovarian hormone deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2011</xref>) and this may underlie cognitive deficits in older or hormone deficient individuals. In 1982, Madison and Nicoll demonstrated that this sAHP was blocked by application of noradrenaline, via protein kinase A (PKA), since the effect is prevented by PKA antagonists and mimicked by application of cyclic AMP or the PKA catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Madison and Nicoll, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedarzani and Storm, 1993</xref>). Blocking the sAHP eliminated spike-frequency adaptation and resulted in dramatically enhanced repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Madison and Nicoll, 1982</xref>). This same effect can be observed following application of other neurotransmitter receptors, such as histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haas and Konnerth, 1983</xref>), dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benardo and Prince, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pedarzani and Storm, 1995</xref>), cholinergic agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benardo and Prince, 1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benardo and Prince, 1982c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cole and Nicoll, 1984</xref>), and various peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haug and Storm, 2000</xref>). In 1984, these same authors reported that loading cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, EGTA, or extracellular application of the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, blocked the sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madison and Nicoll, 1984</xref>). In 1986, Lancaster and Adams used a hybrid clamp technique to record the sAHP in current clamp and the underlying current in voltage clamp. This showed a characteristic slowly activating current, the IsAHP, with a reversal potential that shifted with the concentration of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> in a manner consistent with a K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lancaster and Adams, 1986</xref>). In 2002, Power et al. showed that activation of the IsAHP was voltage independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Power et al., 2002</xref>). Taken together, these and other reports strongly support the proposal that the sAHP was due to the activity of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> channel. Given the importance of the sAHP the identity of the underlying channel(s) and associated molecular components are of great interest. In 1996, Kohler et al. reported the cloning and expression of three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, voltage independent K<sup>+</sup> channels, the SK (small conductance) channels (SK1-3; KCNN1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohler et al., 1996</xref>) and in 1997 the fourth member of this family, SK4 (IK1; KCNN4; intermediate conductance) was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joiner et al., 1997</xref>). The pharmacological fingerprints of these channels are distinct. Apamin, an 18 amino acid peptide isolated from honeybee venom selectively blocks SK2 and SK3 channels, while SK1 is less apamin sensitive and IK1 is not apamin sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, the sAHP is not blocked by apamin. IK1 (SK4) is blocked by charybdotoxin (ChTX) a 37 amino acid peptide isolated from scorpion venom that also blocks BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>). The antimycotic agent, clotrimazole also blocks IK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>), but this is also a P450 inhibitor. However, the related triarlymethane, TRAM-34, potently and specifically blocks IK1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wulff et al., 2000</xref>). Sensitivity to TRAM-34 has therefore been taken as the signature of IK1 channels.</p><p>The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the SK/IK channels fulfill many of the expected characteristics of the channels underlying the sAHP in CA1 and basolateral amygdala (BLA) pyramidal neurons: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, voltage-independent, K<sup>+</sup> selective. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry suggest that SK1-3 are widely expressed in overlapping yet distinct patterns in the brain, including hippocampus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sailer et al., 2002</xref>). IK1 mRNA expression was detected in some limited brain areas but hippocampus and amygdala were ambiguous (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/130911">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/130911</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/119686">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/119686</ext-link>). Knock out mice for each of the three SK channels revealed that the apamin-insensitive IsAHP was not affected in any of the SK null mice, eliminating them as candidates for the sAHP channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond, 2004</xref>). However, a recent report used an IK1 reporter mouse to show that the IK1 promoter was active in several brain regions including hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Turner and colleagues further reported that the sAHP and the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons were greatly reduced by application of TRAM-34, and the sAHP was absent in CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice, strongly suggesting that IK1 channels underlie the sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, a recent paper reported that IK1 channels were suppressed by direct phosphorylation by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wong and Schlichter, 2014</xref>). Given the disparity on the role of IK1 channels, we have examined the sensitivity of the sAHP in pyramidal neurons from area CA1 of the hippocampus and the BLA to TRAM-34 and found that this compound did not significantly affect the current underlying the sAHP measured in voltage clamp. TRAM-34 also had no effect on the sAHP amplitude or intrinsic excitability measured in current clamp. Moreover, IK1 null mice express a characteristic IsAHP. Together our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The IsAHP in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons is not affected by TRAM-34</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedarzani and Storm, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madison et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerlach et al., 2004</xref>), a robust IsAHP was recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp configuration (22–24˚C) from CA1 pyramidal neurons in freshly prepared hippocampal slices from 6–8 week old rats. From a holding potential of -63 mV, a 200 ms voltage command to +7 mV was delivered to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Repolarization to -63 mV elicited a characteristic slowly decaying outward tail current, the IsAHP that decayed over several seconds with a time constant of 2.9 ± 0.2 s (n = 20). Apamin was included in the bath solution to eliminate the SK channel contribution that overlaps with the initial decay phase of the IsAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond, 2004</xref>). The IsAHP was measured as the current at 1 sec after the voltage step. The tail current protocol was repeated every 30 sec for 25 min, and showed modest rundown of the IsAHP in control cells, being reduced to 0.74 ± 0.17 of the initial current amplitude (n = 12, P &lt; 0.001). In some experiments carbachol (CCh; 1 μM), a muscarinic agonist that potently blocks the IsAHP, was applied after 25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). To test the effects of TRAM-34, control tail currents were first obtained for 5 min in the absence of drug. The average amplitude of the IsAHP in this baseline control period was 209.3 ± 27.9 pA (n = 11), not different for control cells (195.0 ± 28.3 pA, n = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). TRAM-34 (1 μM) was added to the bath solution and the tail current protocol was continued. After 25 min in TRAM-34, the IsAHP relative to control baseline was 0.79 ± 0.18 (n = 11), not different than rundown in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As in control, subsequent addition of CCh abolished the IsAHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While TRAM-34 rapidly blocks native and cloned IK1 channels when applied in the bath solution, the binding site for TRAM-34 is internal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wulff, 2001</xref>). Therefore, TRAM-34 was also applied through the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D-F</xref>). With intracellular dialysis of TRAM-34, the relative amplitude of the IsAHP measured 25 min after dialysis was not different from external TRAM-34 application (0.92 ± 0.13 of the initial current, n = 4); CCh treatment eliminated the IsAHP. The sensitivity of the IsAHP to 5 μM TRAM-34 was also tested and this increased concentration of TRAM-34 was without effect (0.83 ± 0.07, n = 9). ChTX (100 nM) was also tested and as for TRAM-34, ChTX did not affect the IsAHP (relative IsAHP 0.83 ± 0.11, n = 10). To be certain that the drugs, TRAM-34 and ChTX, were active each was bath-applied to HEK293 cells transiently expressing cloned IK1 channels. TRAM-34 (1 μM) produced a rapid block within 30 sec of the IK1 current (relative current after TRAM-34 compared to baseline = 0.07 ± 0.03, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, ChTX (100 nM) blocked cloned IK1 currents (relative current after ChTX = 0.05 ± 0.01, n = 8; not shown). These data show that ChTX or TRAM-34 does not block the IsAHP but they do block IK1 channels.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11206.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRAM-34 (1 µM; 22-24˚C) does not affect the IsAHP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of the normalized amplitude of the IsAHP from control rundown (ctrl, closed black symbols), or TRAM-34 treated cells either bath applied (closed red symbols) or internally delivered (open red symbols) in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

Modulation of the sAHP has been implicated in behavioral learning: animals with a smaller sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons learn hippocampus-dependent tasks better than those with a larger sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tombaugh, 2005</xref>), and a reduction of the sAHP is observed after successful learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oh, 2003</xref>). The sAHP increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landfield and Pitler, 1984</xref>), and this may underlie cognitive deficits in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deyo et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knuttinen et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, understanding the molecular basis of the sAHP is important and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to manage cognitive decline. Compelling evidence suggests that the sAHP reflects the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels. Members of the SK (KCNN) channel family share many features that are similar to those that mediate the sAHP. Thus, all four members (KCNN1-4; SK1-3, IK1) are voltage independent and are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated via constitutively bound calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>). The fourth member of the family, IK1, has a larger unitary conductance than the other family members (~40 pS vs ~10 pS in symmetrical K<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joiner et al., 1997</xref>) and, importantly, the SK and IK channels are pharmacologically distinct. The peptide toxin, apamin potently and selectively blocks SK2 and SK3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2012</xref>), while IK1 channels are apamin-insensitive but are selectively blocked by TRAM-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wulff et al., 2000</xref>). IK1 is additionally blocked by the scorpion peptide charybdotoxin (ChTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>) that also blocks BK channels. I<italic>n situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry data indicate that SK1-3 are expressed in overlapping but distinct patterns in the CNS. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and BLA pyramidal neurons, SK2 is heavily expressed while SK1 and SK3 are expressed at lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sailer et al., 2002</xref>). IK1 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues such as smooth muscle endothelium, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and salivary glands, but brain expression is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begenisich et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, recent transcriptome profiling using single CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons did not detect significant IK1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, a recent study using both immunohistochemistry and a GFP reporter mouse suggested that IK1 expression was significant in both cortex and hippocampus, including CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Using a monoclonal antibody to IK1, immunohistochemistry detected IK1 throughout the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). However this antibody also recognized a band on Western blots using tissue derived from either of two independently generated IK1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the specificity of the monoclonal antibody is questionable. For both of these transgenic IK1 gene disruption mouse lines previous work reported the loss IK1 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Si, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begenisich et al., 2004</xref>), and for one line, the line employed here, the loss of IK1 protein expression as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Si, 2006</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Si et al. (2006)</xref> used a different IK1 antibody that detected robust expression in Western blots with red blood cells prepared from wild type but did not detect a band in protein samples from the null mice, engendering confidence in this IK1 null mouse. We used these IK1 null mice to record the characteristic IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Turner et al. (2015)</xref> generated an IK1 promoter GFP-reporter mouse. In this mouse GFP was detected throughout the hippocampus. Assuming that the BAC employed contained all of the requisite regulatory sequences to direct normal IK1 expression, these results suggest that the IK1 promoter is active in hippocampus, but stands in contrast to transcriptome results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). In red blood cells, IK1 has been shown to be the ‘Gardos' channel, responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> efflux. The channel protein is presumably very stable as erythrocytes live for ~120 days after enucleation. Thus it is possible that a very brief ‘pulse’ of IK1 mRNA could give rise to channels that are stable long after the mRNA has been degraded.</p><p>CA1 pyramidal neurons from SK1, SK2, or SK3 knockout mice do not show alterations in the IsAHP, suggesting that none of these channels individually contribute to the sAHP, particularly SK1 that is less apamin sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond, 2004</xref>). In primary afferent neurons of the gastrointestinal tract there is a late AHP that follows the action potential that bears many similarities to the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons. IK1 is prominently expressed in these myenteric neurons and the late AHP is blocked by TRAM-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is likely that IK1 channel activity is responsible for this late AHP. A recent report showed that the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons was at least partially blocked by the signature agent, TRAM-34, and that the sAHP was absent in IK1 null mice. The authors concluded that IK1 channel activity is also responsible for the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, PKA has been shown to inhibit IK1 channel activity via direct phosphorylation of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wong and Schlichter, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We re-examined the sAHP in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and found that TRAM-34 or ChTX did not block it, and TRAM-34 had no effect on intrinsic excitability. Similar results were obtained from pyramidal neurons of the BLA. We noted that the average amplitude of the IsAHP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is higher than previously recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). There are two aspects to this. First, the IsAHP increases with age, and for the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons we used older (8 weeks) rats. Second, the amplitude of the IsAHP is sensitive to changes in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lancaster and Adams, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sah and Isaacson, 1995</xref>) that may explain the larger IsAHP amplitude in our present study (recorded at 22–23°). However, this is unlikely to affect our overall interpretation, since IsAHP may be increased at lower temperatures and therefore any IK1 component might be even bigger. Importantly, IK1 null mice showed a prominent IsAHP. Moreover, IK1 channels have been reported to have a single channel conductance of ~12 pS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joiner et al., 1997</xref>), however, while not directly recorded, channels underlying the IsAHP have been proposed to have a much lower single channel conductance of 2– 5 pS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sah and Isaacson, 1995</xref>). Our data show no effect of TRAM-34 in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King et al. (2015)</xref> This discrepancy may be related to a combination of several factors: 1) run-down of IsAHP during whole-cell recordings has been observed in several previous studies and cannot be excluded in absence of time course plots. 2) The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and IsAHP may differ during synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">King et al., 2015</xref>) or somatic current pulses by recruitment of different Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources. This may affect activation of IK1 depending on its specific subcellular localization. Regardless, data from three different laboratories using different conditions failed to find an effect of TRAM-34. Therefore, we conclude that the channel(s) underlying the sAHP is not IK1 and has not yet been identified. Several possibilities remain. For example, the sAHP might not be due to the activity of one particular type of K channel, but rather an ensemble of channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2012</xref>). It has also been proposed that the sAHP is mediated at least in part by Kv7/KCNQ (M) channels with Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity endowed by the calcium binding protein, hippocalcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tzingounis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tzingounis et al., 2007</xref>), although the Kv7/KCNQ (M) channel blocker XE991 fails to block the sAHP of CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2005</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Alternatively, the K<sup>+</sup> channel superfamily contains several subunits that do not express functional channels on their own. In either case, the pore-forming subunits may be co-assembled into larger signaling complexes that endow Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and characteristic slow activation kinetics. Recapitulating the sAHP using cloned components, together with gene targeting and pharmacology will eventually reveal the molecular details of the sAHP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal handling and slice preparation</title><p>All procedures were done in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (IACUC: IS00002421), the Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute of Basic Medical Sciences of the University of Oslo (FOTS ID 5676), and the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Queensland (QBI/551/12/NHMRC/ARC).

For IsAHP recordings in BLA neurons, patch pipettes (4–6 MΩ) were filled with a KMeSO<sub>4</sub> internal solution containing (in mM) KMeSO<sub>4</sub> 135, NaCl 8, HEPES 10, Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, Na<sub>3</sub>GTP 0.4, Spermine 0.1, Phosphocreatine 7, EGTA 0.2, (pH 7.3 with KOH; osmolarity ~ 290). Currents were recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp mode. For CA1 and BLA pyramidal neurons the membrane potential was held at −63 mV (CA1) and −50 mV (BLA), and IAHP currents were evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurons by depolarizing voltage commands to +7 mV for CA1 neurons for 200 ms and 10 mV for BLA neurons for 100 ms followed by a return to baseline potential for 10 sec where the current underlying the sAHP was measured. All cells had a resting membrane potential more hyperpolarized than −60 mV and input resistances of 150–350 MΩ for CA1 pyramidal neurons and 75–325 MΩ for BLA pyramidal neurons. Input resistance was determined from a −5 mV (100 ms) hyperpolarizing pulse applied at the beginning of each sweep. Access resistance was 80% electronically compensated and stable at &lt;20 MΩ. IAHP recordings were filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz. Voltages in CA1 and BLA pyramidal neurons were corrected for the liquid junction potential. Data were analyzed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 2-sample rank test was used to determine significance; P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>For current clamp recordings, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures or acutely cut hippocampal slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with aCSF (34 °C) of the following composition (in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 3.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.6, glucose 25. Acutely cut BLA brain slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with aCSF (34°C) of the following composition (in mM): NaCl 118, KCl 2.5, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1.3, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, glucose 10. CA1 and BLA pyramidal neurons were visually identified using infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics on an Olympus BX-51WI or BX-50WI microscope. For hippocampal neurons the intracellular recording solution contained (in mM): KGluconate 120, KCl 20, Na<sub>2</sub>.phosphocreatine 5, HEPES 10, MgATP 4, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.4, EGTA 0.1 (pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH). For BLA neurons the intracellular recording solution contained in (in mM) KMeSO<sub>4</sub> 135, NaCl 8, HEPES 10, Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, Na<sub>3</sub>GTP 0.4, Spermine 0.1, Phosphocreatine 7, EGTA 0.2, (pH 7.3 with KOH). Whole-cell current clamp recordings were obtained using a Multiclamp 700A or B amplifier, signals were low-pass filtered at 10 KHz and digitized at 20 KHz. Access resistances, typically 15–35 MΩ, were monitored and compensated throughout the experiments. Potentials were corrected for liquid junction potential (−14 mV). Origin 9.1 (Hearne Scientific Software, Victoria, AU) was used for statistical analysis and graphical representations.</p><p>In all hippocampal experiments, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 10 μM), DL-2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (DL-AP5, 50 μM) and gabazine (SR-95531, 5 μM) were added to the aCSF to block spontaneous synaptic transmission. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, XE991 (10 μM), apamin (100 nM) and TRAM-34 (1 μM) were added to the ACSF and slices were perfused for 25 minutes before recordings started. The mAHP and sAHP values were measured by averaging a time window (20 and 100 ms, respectively) around the peak of each one (20–50 ms and 0.17–0.4 s after a train of 7–8 spikes, respectively) and subtracted from the baseline voltage. Statistical analysis was done in Minitab 17 (Minitab UK). Group data are expressed as mean and standard error (SEM, in parentheses), and the sample size of cells (<italic>n</italic>), and number of rats (N) used in the individual experiments is given. Data were checked for normal distribution according to a normal probability plot of their residuals and 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests were performed for independent samples (control group vs. drug group) using a critical level of significance α=0.05.</p><p>HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were transfected using lipofectamine with a plasmid directing expression of IK1 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ishii et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sacha Nelson, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Foering (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, three independent labs have pooled resources to test whether IK1 channels mediate the sAHP and IsAHP in pyramidal neurons from CA1, as reported by King et al. (2015). In addition, the authors examined AHP currents in an IK1 KO animal and examined IsAHP and the sAHP in pyramidal cells from the basolateral amygdala. The principal findings are in direct opposition to those of King et al. (2015). The current study found that the IK1 KO had normal IsAHP currents and that the reported IK1-selective blocker TRAM-34 had no effect on the sAHP or IsAHP in either CA1 (acute or organotypic slices) or basolateral amygdalar pyramidal neurons (despite clear effects of TRAM-34 on IKI currents in HEK293 cells).</p><p>The data shown are convincing and strongly support the conclusion that IK1 is not a major player in the sAHP in CA1 or amygdalar pyramidal cells. Although these are essentially negative results, the present manuscript provides an important caution for interpretation of the role of IK1 in generating the sAHP.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One reviewer was concerned that there are inconsistencies in the treatment and reporting of data between figures, likely reflecting the fact that they were generated separately by independent laboratories..</p><p>2) In addition, there was concern that the all of the TRAM-34 data in this paper and the paper it fails to reproduce used a single dose. Given the different preparation employed and the striking difference in results compared with King et al., it would seem that at least some of the CA1 data should be pursued with other doses to ensure that the differences do not simply reflect different efficacy of the drug between labs.</p><p>3) The current values reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> seem to be much bigger than the values reported by other studies in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Gu et al., 2008; Pedarzani et al., 1998). Is it possible that the conditions used in these experiments increased the activity of Ca<sup>2</sup> -activated K channels; or that additional currents are isolated? Could this affect the overall interpretation? This does not necessarily require any additional experiments, but should be addressed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11206.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One reviewer was concerned that there are inconsistencies in the treatment and reporting of data between figures, likely reflecting the fact that they were generated separately by independent laboratories..</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern and have done our best to address this, as detailed below.

This does not necessarily require any additional experiments, but should be addressed in the text.</italic> </p><p>There are several aspects to this, and we assume the reviewer refers to Gu et al., 2005 (no voltage clamp data in Gu et al., 2008). First, the IsAHP increases with age and for our experiments on the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons we used older rats (8 weeks). A second point is temperature. The IsAHP tends to be larger at lower temperatures, and in Gu et al., 2005 the IsAHP was recorded at 30 °C and here, it was recorded at 22-23 °C. Pedarzani et al., 1998 recorded at room temperature as well (21-24 °C) but the internal solution was K-gluconate, which explains the smaller current amplitude (see also Kaczorowski, Disterhoft and Spruston, 2007). On one hand, the referee has a point, since King et al., 2015 recorded at 32-34 ºC and in our manuscript the IsAHP experiments in CA1 were done at 22-23 ºC while the rest of experiments were done at 34 ºC. On the other hand, this is unlikely to affect the overall interpretation, since Ca<sup>2</sup> -dependent K currents may be increased at lower temperatures (and therefore any IK1 component might be even bigger). Therefore, we believe the fact that we showed no effect, even at different temperatures actually strengthens our conclusions. We have added this to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
