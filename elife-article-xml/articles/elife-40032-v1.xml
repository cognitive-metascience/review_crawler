While <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> virulence hinges on cell-to-cell spread, little is known about the dynamics of bacterial spread in epithelia at a population level. Here, we use live microscopy and statistical modeling to demonstrate that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread proceeds anisotropically in an epithelial monolayer in culture. We show that boundaries of infection foci are irregular and dominated by rare pioneer bacteria that spread farther than the rest. We extend our quantitative model for bacterial spread to show that heterogeneous spreading behavior can improve the chances of creating a persistent <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection in an actively extruding epithelium.

This ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium can invade and replicate within non-phagocytic cells and, importantly, use a form of actin-based motility to spread directly from the cytoplasm of an infected host cell into the cytoplasm of another host cell without exposure to the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tilney and Portnoy, 1989</xref>). This process, known as cell-to-cell spread, enables <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to breach and colonize the intestinal epithelium and to subsequently reach distant organs including the liver and brain in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh et al., 2018</xref>) and the placenta in pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faralla et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, compared to wild-type <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, mutant strains incapable of undergoing cell-to-cell spread are three orders of magnitude less virulent in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domann et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infections begin in the intestinal epithelium, a tissue made up of polarized epithelial cells connected to each other by cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> preferentially adheres to and invades an epithelium at the tips of intestinal villi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pentecost et al., 2006</xref>), where epithelial cells are actively extruded and shed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sancho et al., 2004</xref>). Upon bacterial invasion, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> spreads to neighboring host cells, which can allow bacteria to move away from the tip of a villus before the next host cell extrusion event terminates the infection. Therefore, understanding <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> virulence requires a quantitative grasp of the spatiotemporal dynamics of cell-to-cell spread.</p><p>To initiate cell-to-cell spread, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> uses the protein ActA to polymerize actin at its surface and create an actin comet tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pistor et al., 1994</xref>). Actin polymerization generates a propulsive force that allows the bacterium to move within the host cytoplasm. Upon contact with the donor host cell membrane, the intracellular bacterium creates a protrusion that can extend into the cytoplasm of a recipient host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>). Although cell-to-cell spread has been primarily studied as a mechanism of bacterial dissemination between adjacent host cells, it is well established that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can create protrusions more than ten microns long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pust et al., 2005</xref>), which could, in principle, mediate bacterial spread between two non-adjacent host cells. To complete cell-to-cell spread, the recipient cell engulfs the bacterium-containing protrusion, thus giving <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> access to the recipient host cell’s cytoplasm. After escaping the double-membrane vacuole, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> rebuilds the actin comet tail and restarts intracellular motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gedde et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Particular attention has been paid to bacterial and host cell proteins that mediate cell-to-cell spread. The bacterial protein internalin C helps <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to relax cortical tension and increase the rate of bacterial-mediated protrusion formation to promote spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajabian et al., 2009</xref>). From the perspective of the host cell, it has been shown that TIM4 allows the host to sense bacterial-mediated membrane damage, which then triggers a repair mechanism that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> exploits to promote spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czuczman et al., 2014</xref>). The diaphanous-related formins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fattouh et al., 2015</xref>) and members of the ERM protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pust et al., 2005</xref>) have been shown to localize to bacteria-containing protrusions and inhibition of their activity decreases the efficiency of cell-to-cell spread. This cell biological approach has been useful in creating a mechanistic understanding of how individual spreading events occur. However, our larger scale understanding of how a population of bacteria spreads through tissue remains poorly developed.</p><p>Here, we combine live microscopy and statistical modeling to study the dynamics of a population of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> as it spreads through a polarized epithelial monolayer. We simulate cell-to-cell spread as an isotropic random walk because the movement of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is directionally persistent over short distances but shows no preferred orientation over long distances. Our experimental and computational results indicate that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread includes a majority of local-spreading bacteria but is dominated by rare pioneers, which determine the shape of infection foci. Importantly, we find that pioneers alter the kinetics of spread in a way that might promote bacterial persistence in a dynamic epithelium where cells are actively extruded, as at the tip of an intestinal villus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> spreads anisotropically through a polarized, confluent MDCK cell monolayer</title><p>To explore the dynamics of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread in an epithelial monolayer, we developed a live video microscopy assay to track the progression of a bacterial infection over tens of hours. As a model host cell, we chose Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells because they form polarized and homogeneous monolayers in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mays et al., 1995</xref>) and have been widely used to study <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pentecost et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pentecost et al., 2010</xref>). We infected confluent MDCK monolayers with a wild-type 10403 S <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strain that contains an mTagRFP open reading frame under the <italic>actA</italic> promoter, which becomes transcriptionally active when the bacterium enters the host cell cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moors et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeldovich et al., 2011</xref>). We then imaged the progression of the infection as described in Materials and Methods. The presence of gentamicin, a bacteriostatic antibiotic that cannot cross the host cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Portnoy et al., 1988</xref>), during live imaging ensured that only intracellular bacteria contributed to the growth and spread of the infection focus. Starting at approximately 6 hr post-infection, the earliest time point at which we could detect mTagRFP protein expression, we imaged bacterial foci for up to 22 hr post-infection (first three panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40032.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> spreads anisotropically through a polarized, confluent MDCK cell monolayer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) On the left three panels, micrographs show nuclei (Hoechst, blue) and intracellular bacteria (mTagRFP, red) at three different time points post-infection.

Due to the clonal nature of the replicating bacteria, and the homogeneity of the host monolayer, we were surprised to find behavioral heterogeneity within the bacterial population; the edges of the boundary of the infection focus, determined by the smallest boundary that completely encloses all bacteria, were dominated by a small number of bacteria that spread farther than the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, white arrows in third panel). Indeed, this was a common phenomenon that could be observed in most infection foci. Although each focus may have started out roughly circular, far-spreading bacteria, which we refer to as ‘pioneers’, nearly always created irregular boundaries by the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Despite boundary irregularity, intracellular bacterial replication was approximately exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the growth rate could be modeled with a one-term exponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) with an average doubling time of approximately 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This doubling time is comparable to what has been previously reported in other epithelial host cell types using gentamicin protection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaillard et al., 1987</xref>). Between 360 and 960 min post-infection, the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the bacterial positions (defined here as the second moment of the fluorescence intensity distribution) appeared linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is consistent with a random walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>). However, the slope of the MSD was not always constant, but instead increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is consistent with the appearance of fast-spreading organisms within a migrating population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shigesada et al., 1995</xref>). We found no correlation between bacterial growth rate and MSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), enabling us to treat these two parameters as independent in the quantitative model described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stochastic simulations of cell-to-cell spread via random walks are inconsistent with observed shapes of infection foci</title><p>What then is the expected range of shapes resulting from the random movement and exponential growth seen in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread?

For simplicity, we thus include pioneers in our model by allowing all bacteria to move in a purely diffusive fashion, with either a slow (non-pioneer) diffusivity D<sub>slow</sub> or a fast (pioneer) diffusivity D<sub>fast</sub>. Pioneer behavior in the simulations is then characterized by the ratio of D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub> (i.e. how much further pioneers spread as compared to non-pioneers) and the probability with which a bacterium becomes a pioneer. When a bacterium replicates, each daughter has a probability P of spreading according to D<sub>fast</sub> and probability 1–P of spreading according to D<sub>slow</sub> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).

These are reasonable parameters because (1) a relatively small number of bacteria spread much farther than the rest throughout a live microscopy assay, and (2) an effective diffusion coefficient ratio of 100 translates to pioneer steps that are an order of magnitude longer than non-pioneer steps, which is consistent with what we observe experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the presence of pioneers caused the simulated boundaries to become anisotropic, particularly in the early steps of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, these simulations recapitulated the increase in the MSD slope during the later time points of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The transition to a larger MSD occurs at a time when the bacterial population stabilizes to contain a larger fraction of pioneers. A probability of 0.10 allowed, on average, approximately 75% of bacteria to have a pioneer ancestor or be pioneers themselves by the end of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is likely that the approach towards a pioneer majority explains why simulated foci boundaries tended to be more anisotropic during earlier steps of the simulation, and why they became more circular as simulation time increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Circularity of simulated foci would sometimes drop precipitously if the probability of becoming a pioneer was less than 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also observed a general time-dependent increase in infection focus circularity in experimental data, which also sometimes exhibited rapid decreases in infection focus circularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The observed kinetics of changes in circularity over time for both the experimental data and the simulations are consistent with the proposition that the overall focus size and shape become more strongly dominated by the pioneers at later time points, as also illustrated by the transition in MSD slope described above. Overall, less circular foci shapes were observed when the pioneer probability was low enough so that only a few bacteria in each focus exhibited pioneer behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed these findings quantitatively and showed that experimental circularity is equivalent to the circularity seen for simulations with pioneer probabilities of 10<sup>−3</sup> and 10<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which suggests that during our cell-to-cell spread experimental assay, approximately 1.4% to 12% of bacteria have pioneer ancestors or are pioneers themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We note that these results are dependent on the total simulation time, as higher overall bacterial counts (longer simulation times) result in more circular foci for the same value of pioneer probability. We also tested the effect on circularity of changing the ratio of D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub>.

This mutant, known as the glycine-rich repeat (GRR) mutant, is less persistent than wild-type bacteria, which means that it loses its original direction more quickly than wild-type bacteria. The GRR mutant is also characterized by two-fold shorter actin comet tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auerbuch et al., 2003</xref>). These characteristics make the GRR mutant likely to enter protrusions at a lower frequency than wild-type bacteria and to form protrusions that are less straight. Upon quantifying the circularity of GRR foci, we found that they were significantly more circular than foci created by wild-type <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was likely a consequence of a decrease in the probability of forming long, straight protrusions, which then decreased the probability of bacteria exhibiting pioneer behavior. Indeed, changing the directional persistence in simulations including pioneers had little effect in circularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus supporting the idea that pioneer behavior, that is making long straight protrusions, has a stronger effect in circularity than intracellular directional persistence.

Specifically, we ran 100 independent simulations for each combination of D and E and quantified the outcomes. We found that small values of E, indicative of an actively extruding monolayer, favored bacterial clearance, and that large values of E, indicative of a more quiescent monolayer, favored uncontrolled growth, as expected. Similarly, small values of D favored bacterial clearance and large values of D favored uncontrolled growth. Stable steady state, on the other hand, was only reached by a narrow set of intermediate values of D and E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), corresponding to parameters where the rate of bacterial removal by extrusion was precisely balanced by the rate of replication (as derived in Materials and Methods).</p><p>We were next interested in asking whether heterogeneous cell-to-cell spread would increase the chances that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> could attain a stable steady state in an actively extruding epithelium. We first chose conditions that produced 100% bacterial clearance outcomes in the case of a random walk, by setting D = 2 and E = 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, to simulate heterogeneous spread, we set D<sub>slow</sub> = D, kept E the same, varied the value of D<sub>fast</sub>, and set P = 0.01, where p is the probability of becoming a pioneer at the time of birth. Interestingly, values of D<sub>fast</sub> that were 60- to 90-fold higher than D<sub>slow</sub> allowed <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to reach a stable steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub> ratio in this range translates to pioneer bacteria taking steps 7.4- to 9.5-fold longer as compared to non-pioneer bacteria, which is consistent with our experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, many D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub> ratios, for several host cell extrusion periods, allowed <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to attain a stable steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Together, our findings argue that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> heterogeneous cell-to-cell spread improves the chances of the pathogen reaching a stable steady state <italic>in vivo</italic> as compared to bacteria spreading via a random walk alone.

First, plaque assays have been used to study late stages of infection where a few millions of bacteria have created plaques—sites of host cell death in cultured epithelial monolayers. The size of the plaque correlates to the efficiency of spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Langendonck et al., 1998</xref>). Second, individual bacteria have been carefully observed by light and electron microscopy to provide information about the kinetics of protrusion formation and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>). In both cases, the identification of host and bacterial proteins has helped elucidate possible molecular mechanisms that facilitate <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajabian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czuczman et al., 2014</xref>). We were interested in bridging the gap between millions of bacteria creating millimeter-sized plaques and single bacteria creating micron-sized protrusions by studying cell-to-cell spread at a population level, while tracking individual bacteria at the frontier of the infection focus, with the goal of learning about both the collective and single-cell intercellular spreading behavior of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.</p><p>We initially predicted that the spatial distribution of bacteria as a function of time would follow that of a random walk, a model characterized by isotropic, uncorrelated directions and normally distributed displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg, 1993</xref>). We developed this null hypothesis because (1) there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that intracellular <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> motility has directionality, (2) late stages of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread create circular plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Langendonck et al., 1998</xref>), and (3) MDCK cells form compact and relatively homogeneous monolayers in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mays et al., 1995</xref>). Our high-resolution video microscopy assay, however, showed that a small number of bacteria spread farther than the rest and caused the infection focus boundary to become irregular. We propose that these pioneer bacteria spread by creating extracellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pust et al., 2005</xref>), that can reach and be taken up by recipient host cells that are not in direct contact with the donor cell.</p><p>Through simulations, we have found that allowing each bacterium to choose between two behaviors, far-reaching pioneer and local non-pioneer, approximated the shape of the experimental data better than simulating a single behavior of spreading bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Simulated foci became less circular when the ratio D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub> was high and the total number of pioneer bacteria in the infection focus was very small (yet non-zero). While high numbers of pioneers are expected to increase the overall spreading rate of an infection, the anisotropic non-circular shapes of observed foci imply that the infection boundary is determined by rare events. Because pioneer bacteria themselves are assumed to not have a preferred spreading direction, small absolute numbers of pioneers are required in order to generate non-circular foci shapes as a result of stochastic fluctuations.</p><p>While we cannot rule out the possibility that infection focus anisotropy can also be attributed in part to host cell heterogeneity, the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> GRR mutant data suggest that properties of the bacteria themselves contribute significantly to this phenomenon. <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> GRR mutants produce infection foci that are more circular than those produced by wild-type bacteria. Given that changing directional persistence in our simulations had little to no effect on circularity, but that changing D<sub>fast</sub>/D<sub>slow</sub> did, it is likely that the GRR mutant <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> creates shorter extracellular protrusions, that is GRR pioneers take shorter steps than wild-type pioneers. However, with our current experimental setup, we cannot determine whether these long protrusions seen in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pust et al., 2005</xref>) occur in the apical side of the monolayer, the basal side, or between cell-cell junctions in MDCK monolayers. Whereas at least a few of the pioneer events that we directly observed in MDCK cells appear to involve long apical protrusions, in the intestinal epithelium, which is characterized by a dense and highly organized apical brush border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crawley et al., 2014</xref>), it is probably more likely that pioneers would spread either laterally between cells in the epithelium or basally at the junction between the enterocytes and the subjacent basement membrane. Indeed, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>’ ability to cross the basal membrane of an epithelium via an actin-dependent process has been well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faralla et al., 2018</xref>). The key feature of these protrusions, however, is that they enable an <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> bacterium to bypass several host cells on its way to the more distant recipient cell. This model explains <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>’ ability to seemingly spread across two host cells in less than 30 min, even though the formation, uptake, and resolution of a single intercellular protrusion can take up to 45 min in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robbins et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>An extension of our model then argues that intracellular pathogens that spread from cell to cell without making extracellular protrusions would be expected to spread via a process resembling a random walk. The Gram-negative bacillus <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> is an example of a bacterial pathogen that spreads intercellularly primarily by inducing the cytoplasmic fusion of two neighboring host cells. Indeed, consistent with our pioneer model, infection foci created by <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> in mammalian host cells are significantly more isotropic than those created by wild-type <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">French et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This type of dual spreading behavior is not uncommon in other organisms. For example, the rice-water weevil, <italic>Lissorhoptrus orzyzophilus,</italic> migrates by both crawling and flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shigesada et al., 1995</xref>). If relatively few beetles migrate by flying, then early migration would be dominated by short steps and later migration would be dominated by longer steps. This ecological model parallels our heterogeneous <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread model given that: (1) the mean squared displacement accelerates with time in both rice-water weevil migration pattern data and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread live microscopy assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shigesada et al., 1995</xref>), (2) the migration boundary of this organism deviates from a circle similar to bacterial infection foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andow et al., 1990</xref>), and (3) the rice-water weevil bimodal migration mechanism resembles that of bacterial local spread versus pioneer spread in long protrusions. In another ecological example, the population of European starlings, <italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>, is made up of short-distance and long-distance migrants. The latter of the two groups was able to establish colonies that helped to promote survival of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shigesada et al., 1995</xref>). Indeed, we argue that heterogeneous spread increases the chance of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> survival in an actively extruding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and discussed below).</p><p>Dual spreading behavior can also occur in a variety of other microbial pathogens. Vaccinia virus undergoes intercellular cell-to-cell spread via an actin-mediated process resembling that of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. In addition, vaccinia virus can accelerate its own rate of spread by inducing the expression of viral proteins on the surface of an infected host cell. Upon encountering those proteins, new incoming viral particles are repelled from the already-infected host cells by actin projections and encouraged to infect virus-free host cells. The repulsion of superinfecting virions thus creates ‘viral superspreaders,’ whose spreading behavior resembles that of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> pioneers. Both viral superspreaders and bacterial pioneers skip host cells on their way to a recipient uninfected host cell, create anisotropic infection foci, and accelerate the pathogen’s rate of spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doceul et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Even though mixing two random walks recapitulated the decrease in circularity seen in experimental data, we cannot rule out alternative spread models. For example, a well-characterized mathematical model is the Lévy flight, a random walk model where the step sizes are drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution instead of a normal distribution, thus ensuring a non-trivial fraction of arbitrary long steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubkov et al., 2008</xref>). Lévy flights are used to model animals foraging for food: animals will take short steps as they are feeding and long steps as they are searching for the next feeding ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>). For <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cell-to-cell spread, a Lévy flight would indicate that at any given point, all bacteria have the ability to spread as either a pioneer or as a non-pioneer. With a Lévy flight, however, it is more difficult to mechanistically explain what allows a bacterium to become a pioneer. On the other hand, in our heterogeneous spread model, bacteria interconvert between two spread behaviors and retain that behavior until their next replication event. We designed the simulation this way to resemble a bacterium creating either a short protrusion or a straight, long protrusion, and replicating once they have broken out of the double-membrane vacuole in the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. The increase in directional persistence in pioneers is equivalent to a larger diffusion coefficient at long times.</p><p>Given that it is a foodborne pathogen, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infections begin in the host’s alimentary canal. In this work, we propose that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> may have evolved the ability to spread via host cell skipping to maximize its chances of surviving, replicating, and spreading in a host’s actively extruding intestinal epithelium. Under the conditions set by our single random walk simulations, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>’ ability to establish a stable steady state was attained by only a narrow set of effective diffusion coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Also, in this model, an individual effective diffusion coefficient usually led to an all-or-nothing outcome. If the step sizes were too small, then the infection was cleared 100% of the time. If the step sizes were too large, then the infection got out of control and caused uncontrolled growth 100% of the time. If the step sizes fell in a narrow range in between, the bacterium was able to successfully extrude many bacteria while sustaining the infection 100% of the time. This stable steady state is a desirable outcome for both bacteria and host: <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can promote the extrusion of its offspring, which can either (1) exit the animal via feces and infect other host animals, or (2) escape the extruded host cell and try to re-invade a different villus. This second point is important because our simulation considers a single villus only, even though the mammalian small intestine contains millions of individual villi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyton and Hall, 2006</xref>), each of which is a potential site of infection.</p><p>Given our findings, it was important to include pioneers in the host extrusion simulations. Simulating an effective diffusion coefficient that previously led to bacterial clearance and mixing it with larger effective diffusion coefficients allowed <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to attain a stable steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Even though heterogeneous spread did not lead to 100% stable steady state, 10–15% of stable steady state infections become significant in the context of the millions of villi that make up the intestinal epithelium. Under these conditions, bacterial clearance was the most likely outcome, and uncontrolled growth remained low, unlike in the case of the random walk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). It is critical for bacteria to avoid uncontrolled growth in any single villus site as this could result in death of the host animal, which harms both the host and the pathogen since the pathogen can no longer replicate and spread to other hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falkow, 2006</xref>). Importantly, high but not 100% of bacterial clearance allows <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to extrude more offspring while being able to achieve a stable steady state in a smaller fraction of villi. Finally, given that step size is a function of nutrient availability, temperature, and monolayer age, among other factors, our model predicts that heterogeneous spread widens the range of biological conditions that <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can explore to create a stable steady state. This is an import host-pathogen relationship because it does not harm the host and promotes pathogenic success. Beyond the gut, it is also possible that pioneers may be more successful at reaching distant organs within the host animal. In fact, it has been shown that a very small number of founder <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> bacteria can spread from the gut to organs such as the spleen and gall bladder, a process that leads to bottlenecking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our current model of an actively extruding epithelium, host cell extrusion occurs at regular intervals and is not influenced by bacterial load. An alternate mechanism that would also be expected to lead to a stable steady state would be forcing extrusion to occur after a preset number of bacteria is reached. Uncontrolled growth is inhibited since bacteria are extruded as soon as the number gets too high, and bacterial clearance does not occur since extrusion stops if bacterial counts get low. However, this alternative mechanism would require that the host cell be able to sense the number of intracellular bacteria and specifically alter its behavior accordingly. Our model, in contrast, presents a simple physical mechanism by which steady state can be achieved without additional sensing capabilities on the part of the host cell.</p><p>In addition to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, other pathogens have evolved strategies to create persistent infections in their hosts. For example, the lambda phage induces expression of the λ repressor to change its gene expression profile from an active host-killing lytic state to a dormant lysogenic state. During the lysogenic state, the lambda phage integrates its genome into the bacterial chromosome, which is then inconspicuously replicated by the host’s DNA replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ptashne, 2006</xref>). The lambda phage stays dormant until environmental conditions, such as host bacteria availability, indicate that it is safe to kill the donor and spread to recipient hosts. Just like pioneer <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> behavior, spontaneous induction from a lysogenic to lytic state is rare, a characteristic that promotes phage replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Little et al., 1999</xref>). A continuous lytic state, similar to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> taking large steps in an extruding monolayer, would cause indiscriminate host death, thus harming both host and pathogen. Indeed, strategies that help establish persistent infections are critical in creating stable host pathogen interactions that have evolved over millions of years.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>)</td><td>10403S; JAT607;wild-type + actAp::mTagRFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop and Hinrichs, 1987</xref> <break/>PMID: 3114382</td><td/><td rowspan="2">Strains were conjugated with actAp::mTagRFP ORF as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ortega et al., 2017</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>)</td><td>DP-L4032; JAT1348; GRR + actAp::mTagRFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skoble et al., 2001</xref> <break/>PMID: 11581288</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>C. familiaris</italic>)</td><td>Madin-Darby canine kidney type II G cells</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mays et al., 1995</xref> <break/>PMID: 7657695</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0424">CVCL_0424</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin</td><td/><td>Thermo Fisher A12379; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2315147">AB_2315147</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Gentamicin sulfate</td><td/><td>MP Biomedicals 194530</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, drug</td><td>Rat-tail collage type I</td><td/><td>Thermo Fisher A1048301</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td/><td>Mathworks; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td>Used image processing toolbox</td></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>algorithm</td><td>Circularity measurement</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng and Hryciw, 2015</xref> <break/>DOI: 10.1680/geot.14.P.192</td><td>Mathworks; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td>Written in MATLAB</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>DMEM low glucose, <break/>no sodium <break/>bicarbonate, <break/>no phenol red</td><td/><td>Sigma D5921</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Leibovitz's L-15 <break/>medium, <break/>no phenol red</td><td/><td>Thermo Fisher 21083027</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Foundation Fetal <break/>Bovine Serum</td><td/><td>Gemini Bio-Prod 900108</td><td>Lot: A37C48A</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Phosphate buffered <break/>saline <break/>(PBS), no <break/>calcium, no <break/>magnesium</td><td/><td>Fisher SH30028FS</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Brain heart infusion (BHI)</td><td/><td>BD 211059</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All 10403S <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> strains used in this study are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

To process experimental microscopy data, images were read in as 1024 × 1024 matrices, converted to double-precision numbers, and normalized to intensities ranging from 0 to 1. Images were thresholded using Otsu’s method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sezgin and Sankur, 2004</xref>). Bacterial debris was excluded from the thresholded mask by inspection.</p><p>To quantify the total fluorescence intensity for a given time point, the thresholded mask was dilated until the infection focus was represented as a single continuous round shape. The median of the intensity values found outside of the thresholded mask was set as the image’s background, which was then subtracted from every value in the matrix. Finally, background-subtracted intensity values were summed. For a full time-lapse movie, total fluorescence intensity values were fit to an exponential function, which provided an estimated value for growth rate. Doubling time was calculated by dividing the natural log of 2 by the growth rate.</p><p>To quantify the mean squared displacement (MSD) for a given time point, the distance squared to each pixel of the thresholded mask was normalized by that pixel’s fluorescence intensity. All normalized squared distances were averaged. For a full time-lapse movie, MSD values were fit to a linear function. The slope of this line was divided by four to estimate an effective diffusion coefficient.</p><p>To quantify the area of an intracellular bacterial focus for a given time point, the x y coordinates of the thresholded mask were calculated. MATLAB’s boundary() function, using x y coordinates as input, was then used to calculate a boundary that fully encompasses all of the points while shrinking towards them. This function also returns the area contained inside the boundary. The radial speed of the focus is equivalent to the slope of the square root of the area divided by π plotted as a function of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liebhold and Tobin, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To quantify circularity, the boundary of the infection focus was used to calculate the smallest circle that fully encompasses the boundary, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng and Hryciw, 2015</xref>). Then, the area of the boundary was divided by the area of a circle. A perfect circle thus has a circularity of 1.</p><p>To use the Voronoi tessellation to estimate the position of host cell boundaries, nuclei were thresholded as described above and segmented using a watershed transform.

Images were averaged to create the PSF. Simulated data in Cartesian coordinates were binned in a 1024 × 1024 matrix and convolved with the PSF to generate data that matched the resolution of our microscope system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Simulation methodology</title><p>All data were generated from simulations written in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ortega, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Listeria_spread_simulations">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Listeria_spread_simulations</ext-link>).</p><p>At the beginning of the random walk simulations, several parameters are set: the effective diffusion coefficient (D), the replication rate (krep), the maximum bacteria to be accumulated (maxnbact), and the time-step (delt). Every run of the for loop is equivalent to a single time step during which (1) bacteria age, (2) bacteria replicate, and (3) bacteria move. For bacterial aging, a vector called bacthist keeps track of each bacterium’s age. These numbers increase monotonically until a particular number reaches that bacterium’s replication time, drawn from a normal distribution with mean ln(2)/krep and variance mean/5. For replication, the positions of those bacteria whose age has reached their replication time are duplicated. Both daughters are assigned a new replication time from the same distribution and their ages are set to 0. Finally, the bacteria move in the x and y dimensions by sampling random numbers from the standard normal distribution scaled by the square root of 2*D*delt, where D is the effective diffusion coefficient and delt = 0.01 is the time step. At every time step, the number of bacteria, the MSD, the area of the boundary, and the circularity of the boundary, calculated as above, are recorded.</p><p>For heterogeneous spread simulations, the values of D<sub>slow</sub>, D<sub>fast</sub>, and P were set prior to the start of the simulation. P refers to the probability of becoming a pioneer. At the start of a bacterium’s life, it chooses whether to spread according to D<sub>slow</sub> with probability P or according to D<sub>fast</sub> with probability 1–P.</p><p>To add persistence to the bacterial cell motility, two new parameters, θ and β, were included. In these simulations, the angle of movement is sampled from a normal distribution with mean θ (the angle associated with the previous step) and standard deviation β. For a random walk, β &gt;&gt; 2π, which means that any angle between 0 and 2π is equally possible. For a persistent random walk, β limits the angle of movement to values close to the angle of the previous step. When β = 0, the angle of movement is constant over time, and the bacteria will be perfectly persistent. To plot circularity as a function of persistence, one thousand random angles were generated for each value of β, and the cosine values of the angles were averaged. For β = 0, persistence was close to 1. As β increased, persistence was close to 0.</p><p>To add host cell boundaries, a Cartesian lattice was used to define boundaries between host cells. The parameter γ defines the probability with which simulated bacteria will cross the boundaries. In these simulations, the new bacterial positions are calculated, and those bacteria that do not cross a boundary are moved to the new positions. Those new positions that require boundary crossing are attained with probability γ. The remaining bacteria reflect from the boundary, remaining in the same cell.</p><p>For host cell extrusion simulations, a circular host cell (of size R = 1) is created in the center of the monolayer and extrudes after every fixed period of time. At this point, the simulated bacteria found inside the host cell were eliminated from the monolayer and cumulatively summed over the entire simulation. After extrusion, remaining bacteria are radially moved inwards by a distance equal to the radius of the extruded host cell. The number of bacteria at the beginning of the simulation is 100. If the number of bacteria goes to 0, then bacterial clearance is triggered. If the number of bacteria in the monolayer reaches 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>, then uncontrolled growth is triggered. If the number of extruded bacteria reaches 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, stable steady state is triggered. Triggering any of these three outcomes causes the simulation to end.</p><p>Any combination of the above parameters (simple random walk, two effective diffusion coefficients, persistence, host cell boundaries, and host cell extrusion) can be used for any given simulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Random walk theory</title><p>The reaction-diffusion equation we used to formalize the null hypothesis of an isotropic random walk is defined as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>is a differential equation where Φ represents the bacterial concentration as a function of position and time, <italic>t</italic> refers to time, <italic>r</italic> refers to the position of the bacteria in polar coordinates or their radial distance to the center of mass, <italic>D</italic> is the effective diffusion coefficient, and <italic>k</italic> is the exponential growth rate.

As stated, the circularity of the simulations is dependent on time, but it is not clear how this time relates to the experimental results being used as the benchmark. Please comment.</p><p>3) Figure 5D. You need to label the lines. After I stared at it a little while, I realized that the &quot;outcomes&quot; colors are indicated under 5C, but it was not immediately obvious.</p><p>4) Subsection “Allowing simulated bacteria to interconvert between pioneer and non-pioneer behavior recapitulates the non-circular phenotype of experimental foci” and Figure 5C. You carefully discuss the fact that clearance versus death is dependent on the rate of host cell extrusion, but it is not clear what times you used for extrusion relative to replication, for example. Minutes, hours, days…?</p><p>5) I also wonder if you considered having extrusion dependent on the number of bacteria in the host cell instead of time.</p><p>6) Some people might read primarily the discussion. Redefine or just spell out &quot;MSD&quot; in paragraph five of the Discussion section.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Seems more than thorough.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors use modeling to infer the mechanism of cell-to-cell spread of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in epithelial cells. They start by observing that despite expecting each infection to be clonal, the spread appears anisotropic. They then create simple models of random walk (continuum and agent-based) and note that their model predictions do not match experimental observations. Based on insights on known mechanisms of spread, they propose a different model in which a small fraction of progeny spread over longer distances, and examine whether such a model describes the observations properly.</p><p>The manuscript has a logical flow, is easy to follow, and has a nice combination of theoretical modeling and supporting experiments. It is generally well-written and contains useful and interesting information. I find the premise interesting and important, but I feel some of the results could benefit from additional explanation to clarify the rationale for some of the assumptions made in the model.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) One concern regards the construction of the model. The observed parameter that the authors have used to fit the parameters is &quot;circularity&quot;, and their model they introduce two additional degrees of freedom (Dfast/Dslow and P), both of which affect circularity. When fitting the parameters of their model, they assume Dfast/Dslow = 100, and sweep over values of P (in Figure 3D) to find a P value for which their simulations match the experimental data. Since circularity is the only parameter they are using for fitting, it leaves the question open if with other values of these parameters the same outcome can be achieved (say, Dfast/Dslow = 10 and P = 1e-4). I suspect the authors have already examined this when constraining their model parameters, but I think it helps to explicitly mention their process of eliminating the alternative possibilities in their manuscript.</p><p>2) When examining the GRR mutant, the authors have mentioned that &quot;This mutant… is less persistent than wild-type bacteria and it is therefore likely to enter protrusions at a lower frequency than wild-type bacteria and to form protrusions that are less straight&quot;. First, the authors should clarify what they mean by &quot;less persistent&quot;, and why persistence matters.</p><p>Second, if I understand correctly, the reference they cite mentions that cell-to-cell spread is less efficient with GRR mutant and the trajectory of protrusions is less straight. I expected the authors to quantitatively assess the hypothesis that the spread of GRR mutant still follows their model (with different P and Dfast/Dslow parameters that they estimate). In my opinion, this is a missed opportunity in the current paper. The experiments are already done by the authors and there are some estimates of the difference between WT and GRR mutants in the reference they have cited. Thus, the only remaining part is making quantitative predictions based on the model about how the spread is expected to be and comparing those predictions with experimental data. If the results match, that would re-enforce the model, and if they don't, perhaps they can speculate what other factors might be involved.</p><p>3) In the last section of the Results: &quot;Simulations predict that heterogeneous spread increases the chance of a persistent <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection in the intestinal epithelium&quot;, in my opinion, there are aspects that need to be clarified. What is the significance of a stable steady state infection per infection site/villus? Based on the discussions in the paper, one can consider the overall infection as a metapopulation of several sites/villi. In this context, a steady-state infection would be important in the overall infection, not at each site/villus, since unstable sites/villi can still persist at the metapopulation level. This is because infections that spread too quickly are still primarily contained within that site (conceptually similar to coexistence with spatial refuge in a prey-predator ecological model) and the ones that are cleared can still infect other sites (dispersal-clearance balance, conceptually similar to mutation-selection balance in evolutionary theory). Without a more thorough investigation, it is not obvious to me why the special case of stable steady state would be the best strategy for maintaining an infection compared to these alternatives. I suggest de-emphasizing stable steady state infection at each site as the &quot;evolutionarily preferred&quot; solution for persistent infection.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In determining the circularity, the authors mention that they use the smallest circle that contains all the points. How do you find this circle? Maybe I am overthinking it, but to me this is not trivial.</p><p>2) The choice of P = 0.01 is justified in Figure 3D, but it's not clear to me how the choice of Dfast/Dslow = 100 was made. Would you please elaborate?</p><p>3) Is the &quot;effective&quot; diffusion coefficient in Figure 5C the same as Dslow? I think it is and it helps to mention it explicitly.</p><p>4) I think it would have helped to include the spread for another microbe that does not have extracellular protrusions (no pioneer cells, as a point of reference), as a negative control. Would you observe a homogeneous plaque shape in these cases? If not, what are the parameters involved, and do they contribute to the heterogeneous spread observed for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>? I suggest this only as an optional addition, if such a system already exists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40032.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't have any major concerns.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>This is a very nice manuscript that details an interesting phenomenon that is likely to have impact on a number of both intracellular and extracellular pathogens.

This was meant to be “Total bacterial fluorescence intensity.” We have changed the axis label and figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Allowing simulated bacteria to interconvert between pioneer and non-pioneer behavior recapitulates the non-circular phenotype of experimental foci” and Figure 3D. As stated, the circularity of the simulations is dependent on time, but it is not clear how this time relates to the experimental results being used as the benchmark. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The times are comparable as 1 simulation step is, on average, equivalent to 1.7 minutes. Therefore, 800 steps, when simulations were stopped, are roughly equivalent to 1360 minutes, which is approximately the last time point of the experimental data. We have included this information in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5D. You need to label the lines. After I stared at it a little while, I realized that the &quot;outcomes&quot; colors are indicated under 5C, but it was not immediately obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>This was also noted by reviewer #1 (minor point 4). We have added the label to Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Allowing simulated bacteria to interconvert between pioneer and non-pioneer behavior recapitulates the non-circular phenotype of experimental foci” and Figure 5C. You carefully discuss the fact that clearance versus death is dependent on the rate of host cell extrusion, but it is not clear what times you used for extrusion relative to replication, for example. Minutes, hours, days…?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is useful to clarify the correspondence between times and distances in the simulation with real times and distances. The bacterial replication rate of 1 is equivalent to 0.006 replication events per minute. This was calculated by normalizing the simulation steps by the doubling time of intracellular <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, which is approximately 120 minutes in MDCK cells. Then, the period of host cell extrusion ranges from a period of 0.10 (i.e. 10 simulation steps) to 0.50 (i.e. 50 simulation steps). These translate to approximately 17 to 85 minutes respectively. The radius of a human enterocyte is approximately 7 µm (Ho et al., 2017), which scales the effective diffusion coefficients to speeds from 0 to 0.2 µm/sec, which is the average speed of intracellular <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (Robbins et al., 1999). We have added this information to the legend of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I also wonder if you considered having extrusion dependent on the number of bacteria in the host cell instead of time.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this possibility. This kind of mechanism would be another way of enabling establishment of a stable steady state; by forcing extrusion to occur after a preset number of bacteria is reached, one effectively inhibits both uncontrolled growth (cannot get to high numbers since the host cell will then be immediately extruded) and bacterial clearance (since extrusion stops if bacterial counts get low). This scenario would require that the host cell be able to measure the number of intracellular bacteria in some way. Our model demonstrates an alternate physical mechanism by which steady state can be achieved without additional sensing capabilities on the part of the host cell. We have included a brief comment on this in the Discussion paragraph ten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some people might read primarily the discussion. Redefine or just spell out &quot;MSD&quot; in paragraph five of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now fixed that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Seems more than thorough.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use modeling to infer the mechanism of cell-to-cell spread of L. monocytogenes in epithelial cells. They start by observing that despite expecting each infection to be clonal, the spread appears anisotropic. They then create simple models of random walk (continuum and agent-based) and note that their model predictions do not match experimental observations. Based on insights on known mechanisms of spread, they propose a different model in which a small fraction of progeny spread over longer distances, and examine whether such a model describes the observations properly.</p><p>The manuscript has a logical flow, is easy to follow, and has a nice combination of theoretical modeling and supporting experiments. It is generally well-written and contains useful and interesting information. I find the premise interesting and important, but I feel some of the results could benefit from additional explanation to clarify the rationale for some of the assumptions made in the model.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) One concern regards the construction of the model. The observed parameter that the authors have used to fit the parameters is &quot;circularity&quot;, and their model they introduce two additional degrees of freedom (Dfast/Dslow and P), both of which affect circularity. When fitting the parameters of their model, they assume Dfast/Dslow = 100, and sweep over values of P (in Figure 3D) to find a P value for which their simulations match the experimental data. Since circularity is the only parameter they are using for fitting, it leaves the question open if with other values of these parameters the same outcome can be achieved (say, Dfast/Dslow = 10 and P = 1e-4). I suspect the authors have already examined this when constraining their model parameters, but I think it helps to explicitly mention their process of eliminating the alternative possibilities in their manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We included these data in what was previously Figure S5F (and has now been moved to Figure 3D). In this figure, we spanned a range of values of Dfast/Dslow and showed that larger values of Dfast/Dslow make foci less circular. We have expanded the text to make this more clear (subsection “Decreasing the persistence of bacterial motility leads to more circular infection foci”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When examining the GRR mutant, the authors have mentioned that &quot;This mutant… is less persistent than wild-type bacteria and it is therefore likely to enter protrusions at a lower frequency than wild-type bacteria and to form protrusions that are less straight&quot;. First, the authors should clarify what they mean by &quot;less persistent&quot;, and why persistence matters.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our explanation of directional persistence in subsection “Decreasing the persistence of bacterial motility leads to more circular infection foci”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, if I understand correctly, the reference they cite mentions that cell-to-cell spread is less efficient with GRR mutant and the trajectory of protrusions is less straight. I expected the authors to quantitatively assess the hypothesis that the spread of GRR mutant still follows their model (with different P and Dfast/Dslow parameters that they estimate). In my opinion, this is a missed opportunity in the current paper. The experiments are already done by the authors and there are some estimates of the difference between WT and GRR mutants in the reference they have cited. Thus, the only remaining part is making quantitative predictions based on the model about how the spread is expected to be and comparing those predictions with experimental data. If the results match, that would re-enforce the model, and if they don't, perhaps they can speculate what other factors might be involved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting suggestion. We ran additional simulations to test what feature of the change in behavior of the GRR mutant is most likely to allow the bacteria to make more circular foci. In these simulations, we varied both the directional persistence and the Dfast/Dslow ratio. The data show that persistence has little effect on circularity, particularly in the presence of pioneers (Dfast/Dslow &gt; 1). Specifically, when bacteria are perfectly persistent, circularity actually increases in a random walk (at this artificial extreme, essentially all the bacteria simply move straight outward from the center). However, when pioneers are present, changing the persistence alone ends up having very little effect on circularity over a very large range of possible values. Given that changes in persistence over a degree quantitatively much greater than the actual persistence change for the GRR mutant has no effect on circularity in the simulations, but that changing Dfast/Dslow does, we conclude that the GRR mutant <italic>Lm</italic> likely is deficient in making long extracellular protrusions, i.e. GRR pioneers take shorter steps than wild-type pioneers. These new results are summarized in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and discussed in more detail in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the last section of the Results: &quot;Simulations predict that heterogeneous spread increases the chance of a persistent Listeria monocytogenes infection in the intestinal epithelium&quot;, in my opinion, there are aspects that need to be clarified. What is the significance of a stable steady state infection per infection site/villus? Based on the discussions in the paper, one can consider the overall infection as a metapopulation of several sites/villi. In this context, a steady-state infection would be important in the overall infection, not at each site/villus, since unstable sites/villi can still persist at the metapopulation level. This is because infections that spread too quickly are still primarily contained within that site (conceptually similar to coexistence with spatial refuge in a prey-predator ecological model) and the ones that are cleared can still infect other sites (dispersal-clearance balance, conceptually similar to mutation-selection balance in evolutionary theory). Without a more thorough investigation, it is not obvious to me why the special case of stable steady state would be the best strategy for maintaining an infection compared to these alternatives. I suggest de-emphasizing stable steady state infection at each site as the &quot;evolutionarily preferred&quot; solution for persistent infection.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point to clarify. At the level of the bacterial population infecting any single villus, it is most important for bacteria to avoid uncontrolled growth in any single site as this could result in tissue damage and possible death of the animal. But, if every infection site in the entire intestine were cleared, there would be no persistent infection to result in fecal shedding of replicated bacteria that can go on to infect other hosts. In this context, the observation that the “blue” range in Figure 5C is so narrow for the model based on a simple random walk suggests that it would be very difficult to hit this “sweet spot” for the whole metapopulation in the intestine, as the most likely outcomes at any given cell extrusion rate would always be either complete clearance at every site or rampant uncontrolled growth. At the level of the metapopulation, then, our results suggest that the “best” option for the bacteria to most likely persist at some few sites would be to have a fairly large range of parameters where both clearance (red) and stable steady state (blue) are possible outcomes for the bacterial population in any single villus. Figure 5D indicates that this is exactly the result of adding pioneer behavior to the cell extrusion simulations. So, having the expanded “blue” range in Figure 5D, i.e. an expanded regime to attain a stable steady state, means that not all bacteria were cleared and also that uncontrolled growth at any single site within the entire intestinal metapopulation could be avoided. This specifically is the outcome that we argue is most favorable for the bacteria. We have included a more complete explanation in paragraph eleven of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In determining the circularity, the authors mention that they use the smallest circle that contains all the points. How do you find this circle? Maybe I am overthinking it, but to me this is not trivial.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed you are right, this is not trivial. The detailed explanation for this algorithm can be found in Zheng and Hryciw, 2015, which we have now cited in subsection “Stochastic simulations of cell-to-cell spread via random walks are inconsistent with observed shapes of infection foci” and the Materials and methods section. In short, once the boundary of the focus is calculated using MATLAB’s boundary() function, the two farthest vertices are determined, which set the diameter of a temporary circle. If all the other points are contained within the circle, then the algorithm stops. If not, then the point that lies farthest outside of the circle is used to draw a new a circle (including the first two original points. The algorithm proceeds iteratively until the smallest circumscribing circle is determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The choice of P = 0.01 is justified in Figure 3D, but it's not clear to me how the choice of Dfast/Dslow = 100 was made. Would you please elaborate?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the value of Dfast/Dslow to be 100 because the observed size of jumps for individual pioneer events are approximately 10 times longer than for non-pioneers, and the effective step size scales as the square root of the diffusion coefficient. We explain this in paragraph four of subsection “Allowing simulated bacteria to interconvert between pioneer and non-pioneer behavior</p><p>recapitulates the non-circular phenotype of experimental foci”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is the &quot;effective&quot; diffusion coefficient in Figure 5C the same as Dslow? I think it is and it helps to mention it explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5C describes a simple random walk with only a single effective diffusion coefficient. We have added “random walk simulations with only a single effective diffusion coefficient (no pioneers)” to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think it would have helped to include the spread for another microbe that does not have extracellular protrusions (no pioneer cells, as a point of reference), as a negative control. Would you observe a homogeneous plaque shape in these cases? If not, what are the parameters involved, and do they contribute to the heterogeneous spread observed for L. monocytogenes? I suggest this only as an optional addition, if such a system already exists.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Among bacterial pathogens that use this form of actin-based motility to spread from cell to cell, we do not know of any pathogens that are unable to make extracellular protrusions. However, in addition to being able to make protrusions (both intracellular and extracellular), <italic>Burkholderia thailandesis</italic> spreads primarily by inducing the fusion of neighboring host cells (French et al., 2011). If most spread occurs by fusion with neighboring cells, we would expect that this kind of spread would yield more circular foci than those dominated by pioneer behavior such as we have described here for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Indeed, <italic>B. thailandesis</italic> generates infectious foci that are indeed significantly more isotropic than those created by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (French et al., 2011). We have added a new paragraph in the Discussion section describing this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
