This is due partly to the importance of non-synaptic communication by neuromodulators, which can dynamically reconfigure circuit activity to alter its output. Here, we systematically map the patterns of neuromodulatory connectivity in a network that governs a developmentally critical behavioral sequence in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This sequence, which mediates pupal ecdysis, is governed by the serial release of several key factors, which act both somatically as hormones and within the brain as neuromodulators. By identifying and characterizing the functions of the neuronal targets of these factors, we find that they define hierarchically organized layers of the network controlling the pupal ecdysis sequence: a modular input layer, an intermediate central pattern generating layer, and a motor output layer. Mapping neuromodulatory connections in this system thus defines the functional architecture of the network.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29797.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Why do animals behave the way they do? Behavior occurs in response to signals from the environment, such as those indicating food or danger, or signals from the body, such as those indicating hunger or thirst. The nervous system detects these signals and triggers an appropriate response, such as seeking food or fleeing a threat. But because much of the nervous system takes part in generating these responses, it can make it difficult to understand how even simple behaviors come about.</p><p>One behavior that has been studied extensively is molting in insects. Molting enables insects to grow and develop, and involves casting off the outer skeleton of the previous developmental stage. To do this, the insect performs a series of repetitive movements, known as an ecdysis sequence. In the fruit fly, the pupal ecdysis sequence consists of three distinct patterns rhythmic abdominal movement. A hormone called ecdysis triggering hormone, or ETH for short, initiates this sequence by triggering the release of two further hormones, Bursicon and CCAP. All three hormones act on the nervous system to coordinate molting behavior, but exactly how they do so is unclear.</p><p>Diao et al. have now used genetic tools called Trojan exons to identify the neurons of fruit flies on which these hormones act. Trojan exons are short sequences of DNA that can be inserted into non-coding regions of a target gene to mark or manipulate the cells that express it. When a cell uses its copy of the target gene to make a protein, it also makes the product encoded by the Trojan exon. Using this technique, Diao et al. identified three sets of neurons that produce receptor proteins that recognize the molting hormones. Neurons with ETH receptors start the molting process by activating neurons that make Bursicon and CCAP. Neurons with Bursicon receptors then generate motor rhythms within the nervous system. Finally, neurons with CCAP receptors respond to these rhythms and produce the abdominal movements of the ecdysis sequence.</p><p>Many other animal behaviors depend on substances like ETH, Bursicon and CCAP, which act within the brain to change the activity of neurons and circuits. The work of Diao et al. suggests that identifying the sites at which such substances act can help reveal the circuits that govern complex behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>ecdysis</kwd><kwd>calcium activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH002800-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FI2 GM117582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Amicia D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using targeted functional manipulations of neural activity to map neuromodulatory connections can deliver considerable insight into the functional architecture of a behaviorally important network even in the absence of information about its synaptic connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuromodulators constitute a major channel of communication in the nervous system and act at virtually all levels of sensorimotor processing to tune the intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nadim and Bucher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van den Pol, 2012</xref>). How these properties are tuned can profoundly influence the function of not only the individual neurons, but also the circuits in which they participate. Dynamic and coordinated regulation of multiple brain circuits is required for behavior, and an attractive idea with deep historical roots is that neuromodulators, which typically act over timescales and distances that are long compared with synaptic neurotransmission, may serve to coordinate activity in broadly distributed circuits to bias the performance of behaviors appropriate for a given set of circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicker and Menzel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris-Warrick and Marder, 1991</xref>). Although the generality and scope of this viewpoint remain unclear, it implies that identifying sites of neuromodulator action may represent a productive strategy for mapping critical circuits involved in generating a behavior of interest.</p><p>The strategy of mapping sites of neuromodulator action emerged from early observations on the activating effects of various brain-derived hormones and biogenic amines. When introduced into the nervous system, these compounds were found to induce complex motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris-Warrick, 1988</xref>), such as emergence of moths from their cocoons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Truman and Riddiford, 1970</xref>), egg-laying in sea hares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kupfermann, 1967</xref>), and postural changes in lobsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Livingstone et al., 1980</xref>). Attempts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sombati and Hoyle (1984)</xref> to map the sites of action of the insect locomotor activator, octopamine (OA), in the metathoracic ganglion of locusts led to Hoyle’s ‘orchestration hypothesis,’ according to which flight and other motor programs are encoded in the activities of subpopulations of OA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoyle, 1985</xref>). Although the explicit statement of this influential hypothesis remains to be proven, a generalized role for OA in coordinating insect flight was supported by subsequent discoveries that OA neurons modulate muscle metabolism and visual motion processing during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Libersat and Pflueger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suver et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistic insight into how neuromodulators regulate and coordinate circuit function came from the intensive functional and anatomical investigation of small circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Selverston, 2010</xref>). This work included fine-mapping sites of neuromodulator action by painstaking physiological characterization of single neuron responses in, among other systems, the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flamm and Harris-Warrick, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hooper and Marder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Swensen and Marder, 2001</xref>). The STG houses two principal central pattern generators (CPGs) that drive digestive rhythms and their activity patterns, the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms, are both dependent upon, and can be variously reconfigured by, the actions of neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>). Two of these, the neuropeptides proctolin and <italic>C. borealis</italic> Tachykinin-Related Peptide Ia (CabTRP), offer a simple example of how neuromodulators acting at different sites can coordinate changes in two (overlapping) circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nusbaum, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nusbaum et al., 2001</xref>). Both proctolin and CabTRP are released from a neuromodulatory projection neuron (MCN1) into the STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 1999</xref>), and although both peptides activate the same inward current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swensen and Marder, 2000</xref>), their effects on the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms differs because they target distinct cells within the respective CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). Proctolin principally excites the pyloric circuit and can activate it from quiescence, while CabTRP is required for the gastric mill rhythm and acts on a key neuron in its CPG in addition to neurons of the pyloric circuit. Activation of MCN1 by mechanosensory inputs from the stomach, induces a gastric mill rhythm via the action of CabTRP and alters the pyloric rhythm in response to the actions of both peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beenhakker and Nusbaum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitz et al., 2004</xref>). Sensory information, conveyed by two neuromodulators, thus produces coordinated changes in two functionally related circuits.</p><p>The significance and adaptive value of many neuromodulatory effects characterized in the STG remains unknown, and, in general, the sheer abundance of circuit neuromodulation revealed by studies of this and other small systems challenges the simple idea of ‘chemical coding’ of behavior by neuromodulators. This complexity is also underscored by analyses of neuromodulator receptor-distributions, first undertaken by ligand autoradiography in the 1980s. On the one hand, these studies supplied strong evidence that neuromodulators could act at many sites and over long distances, but they also highlighted the difficulty of establishing which sites were relevant for performance of specific behaviors without knowledge of where and under what circumstances each neuromodulator was released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herkenham, 1987</xref>). For neuromodulators already implicated in specific behaviors, however, the receptor distributions sometimes spectacularly confirmed the idea that neuromodulators target ethologically significant circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Insel and Young, 2000</xref>). For example, cross-species differences in striatal expression of vasopressin receptors in two closely related vole species were shown to correlate with, and in fact cause, monogamous and polygamous predispositions in mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammock and Young, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Young et al., 1997</xref>). Based on these and other examples, variations in neuromodulator receptor expression during speciation have been proposed to be a major driver of behavioral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz and Lillvis, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The recent development of genetic techniques for targeting and functionally manipulating neurons in genetic model animals has facilitated the functional characterization of neuronal populations on which neuromodulators act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spangler and Bruchas, 2017</xref>). This work again provides examples of neuromodulators that coordinate activity in broadly distributed circuits. The evidence is particularly compelling for conserved neuromodulators, such oxytocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mitre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stoop, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2014</xref>), which in mice regulates distinct circuits that promote social behaviors, including conspecific recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>), pup retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marlin et al., 2015</xref>), and social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choe et al., 2015</xref>). Oxytocin’s homologs likewise act on circuits that facilitate behaviors related to affiliation and reproduction in species as diverse as worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>), leeches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagenaar et al., 2010</xref>), fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reddon et al., 2015</xref>), and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly and Goodson, 2014a</xref>). Similarly, members of the Neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling pathway have been shown to act on circuits that promote feeding in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Like many neuromodulatory signaling systems, however, oxytocin, NPY, and their receptors are widely distributed in nervous systems and are likely to function in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chronwall and Zukowska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly and Goodson, 2014b</xref>). This added complexity in neuromodulator action, together with the observation that neuromodulators rarely, if ever, act in isolation, has made it difficult to simply generalize the conclusion that neuromodulators organize activity in broadly distributed circuits to produce adaptive changes in behavioral expression. Given the evidence that favors such an organizational role, however, it remains a potentially useful strategy to map sites of neuromodulator action to identify key circuits involved in the generation of behaviors of interest. Particularly suitable behaviors for this approach are those for which both the neuromodulators important for behavioral performance and the circumstances under which they are released are known. The hormonally governed behaviors that underlie insect molting meet these criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Truman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zitnan and Adams, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Molting is accomplished by the serial execution of several motor programs in what is called an ecdysis sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White and Ewer, 2014</xref>). Ecdysis sequences are initiated by the peripheral release of Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH), which facilitates the secretion of multiple other peptide hormones, including Eclosion Hormone (EH), Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP), and Bursicon. These factors function as neuromodulators within the nervous system to orchestrate the progression of the ecdysis sequence, and their action has been extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at the pupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mena et al., 2016</xref>). The pupal ecdysis sequence of the fly consists of three distinct behavioral phases, the second of which is governed by CCAP and Bursicon released from neurons that are targets of ETH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we use the recently developed Trojan exon method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2015</xref>), which permits the high-fidelity targeting of neurons that express specific neuromodulator receptors, to investigate the downstream effectors of ETH, CCAP, and Bursicon and show that the sites of action of these factors expose the structure and operational logic of the fly pupal ecdysis circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neurons expressing ETHRA and CCAP regulate all pupal ecdysis phases</title><p>Each of the three phases of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal ecdysis sequence is characterized by a dominant abdominal motor rhythm (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).

This is clearly true of the second behavioral phase (Phase II, sometimes referred to as ‘ecdysis’), which is specifically dependent on CCAP and the heterodimeric hormone Bursicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-29797-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29797.003</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The pupal ecdysis sequence and its constituent motor programs.</title><p>Video speed: 20X.</p></caption></media><p>We have previously shown that a subset of CCAP-expressing neurons (ETHRA/CCAP neurons) also expresses the A-isoform of the ETH receptor (ETHRA) and is required for head eversion, a signature event of pupal ecdysis that occurs during Phase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diao et al., 2016</xref>). The ETHRA/CCAP neurons also include the subset expressing Bursicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and we began our investigation by confirming that chronic suppression of these neurons using the inward rectifying channel Kir2.1 blocks execution of Phase II. Consistent with previous observations, this manipulation also inhibits execution of the third motor program (Phase III, or ‘post-ecdysis’) and extends the duration of the first (Phase I or ‘pre-ecdysis,'; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that Phase I may be terminated by the onset of Phase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mena et al., 2016</xref>).

This suggests that the VNC-Rk population contains at least two types of neurons: one that may represent the oscillatory output of the network and one that may be involved in sustaining phasic activity within it. Records for both types of ROI, contained examples in which activity was predominantly restricted to one (#28, 89), two (#84, 2), or three (#16, 74) phases and some records with oscillatory activity exhibited changes in oscillation frequency with phase (e.g. #2, 74).

We found that ATP induced a substantial increase in Ca<sup>++</sup> signal in a large number of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that glutamatergic motor neurons of the VNC are downstream targets of the Rk-expressing neurons.</p><p>The identity of some or all the motor neurons activated by the stimulation of Rk-expressing neurons was revealed by our parallel investigation of the targets of CCAP signaling.

The latter two layers, defined by their expression of Bursicon- and CCAP-receptors, respectively, appear to be broadly involved in generating all three phases of the ecdysis sequence. Bursicon and CCAP, however, are unlikely to be released from the ETHRA/CCAP neurons until Phase II, the first motor program for which they are required, and their regulation of Phase I behavior is inhibitory. The initiation and maintenance of Phase I is thus likely to depend on other factors. To ask which neurons within the input layer might regulate Phase I, we used two drivers that together allowed us to interrogate the function of the two subsets of ETHR-expressing neurons outside of those that secrete CCAP and Bursicon.

We find that the sites of action of the neuromodulators ETH, Bursicon, and CCAP identify essential functional components of the network architecture, defining three hierarchically organized layers from the sites of hormonal initiation to the sites of motor neuron output. In addition, we find that descending neuromodulatory signaling from the ETHR-expressing input layer not only governs the basic motor rhythms of the ecdysis sequence by modulating the intermediate CPG layer, but also modulates activity of the CCAP-R-expressing motor neurons of the output layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Neuromodulators thus act broadly within, as well as across, network layers. Our finding that the functional architecture of the ecdysis network can be decoded from its patterns of neuromodulatory connectivity provides further evidence that characterizing neuromodulatory connectomes is a valuable strategy in elucidating neural networks.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Major components of the pupal ecdysis circuitry are shared by the three motor programs</title><p>The schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> broadly augments existing models of the pupal ecdysis network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zitnan and Adams, 2012</xref>), both by providing a more comprehensive description of the input layer than has previously been possible and by identifying the motor circuits on which this layer acts. A principal finding reported here is that the downstream targets of Bursicon and CCAP are shared components of the pupal ecdysis network and are used to generate all three motor rhythms. Our results draw particular attention to the centrality of neurons that express the Bursicon receptor (Rk), which are absolutely required for all pupal ecdysis behavior. A role in central pattern generation is indicated both from the effects of their suppression, which eliminates all motor activity, and from their pattern of ETH1-induced Ca<sup>++</sup> activity, which matches the phases of ecdysis behavior. The fact that ETH1-induced Ca<sup>++</sup> activity is observed in the excised nervous system and thus in the absence of sensory feedback, demonstrates that it is centrally generated and further supports the identification of the VNC-Rk neurons as central pattern generators. Conclusive evidence that some or all VNC-Rk neurons participate in central pattern generation will require more precise observations and perturbations than those performed here, as will determining the functional roles of individual neurons. However, our preliminary observation that regions containing at most small numbers of VNC-Rk neurons exhibit activity that is phasically coupled to two or more motor patterns argues that the ecdysis circuitry includes multifunctional CPG neurons that express Rk and are subject to modulation by distinct input layer modules, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Similar architectures have been described in other motor networks where two CPGs formed from overlapping pools of neurons can switch between activity states to generate distinct behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kristan and Gillette, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Input layer control of the phases of pupal ecdysis</title><p>How input layer neurons modulate the pupal ecdysis CPG is exemplified by the control of Phase II by ETHRA/CCAP neurons. Direct activation of these neurons induces Phase II-like rhythmic activity in the VNC-Rk neurons, an observation that is easily explained if Bursicon secreted from ETHRA/CCAP neurons shifts the mode of activity of the VNC-Rk CPG. This mechanism is consistent with the neuromodulatory control of CPGs described in numerous other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>) and accounts for the long-standing observation that CCAP- and Bursicon-expressing neurons are important for pupal ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2008</xref>), including Phase II initiation and Phase I termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The CCAP- and Bursicon-expressing neurons are known to express additional neuropeptides, including Myoinhibitory Peptides and Allatostatin C, and it is likely that these neuromodulators also play a role in regulating these phases. The mixed activity patterns that define the transition from Phase II to Phase III, first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al. (2006)</xref> and further characterized here, are also readily interpreted as a period of bistability in which CPG modes transiently alternate, perhaps as Bursicon and/or other co-released neuromodulator concentrations fall.</p><p>In addition to neurons that switch CPG activity from Phase I to Phase II, the input layer must also contain neurons that initiate pupal ecdysis by inducing Phase I. The search for such neurons has focused primarily on those that express ETHRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krüger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mena et al., 2016</xref>), but no components of this group have yet been identified that are required for ecdysis initiation. To identify the ETH targets responsible for Phase I, we systematically parsed ETHR-expressing neurons into three, nearly mutually exclusive subsets that together cover the entire input layer. Our results indicate that the largely uncharacterized neurons that express the B-isoform of ETHR are required to initiate Phase I, and that the non-CCAP/ETHRA neurons are important for maintaining that phase.</p><p>The essential role of ETHRB-expressing neurons in Phase I initiation is consistent with the significantly higher affinity for ETH peptides of ETHRB compared with ETHRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iversen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2003b</xref>). ETHRB-expressing neurons may thus initiate Phase I by responding to rising titers of ETH earlier than neurons expressing ETHRA. How they regulate the VNC-Rk CPG neurons remains to be determined, but their mechanism of action appears to be different from that of the ETHRA/CCAP neurons insofar as the Phase I motor program cannot be evoked by TrpA1-mediated activation. It could be that this manipulation fails to induce the correct pattern of activity in ETHRB-expressing neurons. Preliminary imaging results show that ETHRB-expressing neurons respond to ETH1 with oscillatory activity (data not shown), and it is possible that these neurons directly couple to the Rk-expressing neurons through synaptic or electrical contacts and participate in generating Phase I behavior. However, further characterization of the activity of both the ETHRB- and non-CCAP/ETHRA neurons will be required to determine how they modulate VNC-Rk CPG activity.</p><p>Two input layer neurons that are common to the ETHRB- and non-CCAP/ETHRA groups express the major ecdysis neuromodulator, EH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). The EH-expressing neurons, which are among the few cells to express both ETHRA and ETHRB, respond to ETH1 application at the onset of Phase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), and evidence from other insects indicates that EH targets CCAP-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewer and Truman, 1996</xref>). EH is thus thought to be responsible for the release of CCAP and Bursicon, but this has not yet been verified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where the EH receptor has yet to be identified. We were thus not able to target EH receptor-expressing neurons in this study, but the identity and function of such neurons is likely to be critical to understanding the progression of the ecdysis sequence.</p><p>In general, it is worth noting that the neuromodulators regulating the ecdysis sequence are of the type called ‘extrinsic,’ because they are released from neurons that do not function in the circuits upon which they act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katz and Frost, 1996</xref>). Extrinsic neuromodulatory neurons, however, must be components of the broader neural networks that generate behaviors, and the mechanisms that organize their activities are only beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brezina, 2010</xref>). In some cases, these mechanisms are surprising. For example, the neuromodulatory connections between neurons that govern two foraging states in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are orthogonal to the sensory-to-motor synaptic connections between these neurons, which are not involved in the state decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). There are currently few studies that jointly examine patterns of neuromodulatory and synaptic connectivity (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schlegel et al., 2016</xref>), and to understand how extrinsic neuromodulatory neurons integrate into the broader networks in which they function more examples of such networks are required. Elucidating the interactions of neurons in the input layer of the ecdysis network—in addition to interactions of the input layer with neurons in other layers—should provide insight into this general problem.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Feed-forward mechanisms in the regulation of motor output: the role of CCAP</title><p>Our finding that the motor output of the pupal ecdysis network is mediated by neurons that express the CCAP-R provides insight into the hitherto poorly understood mechanism of action of CCAP.

Our results indicate that it does so by acting on motor neurons, and because CCAP is co-released with Bursicon from the ETHRA/CCAP neurons to govern the CPG transition at Phase II, this suggests a role for feed-forward signaling in the pupal ecdysis circuit.</p><p>Neuromodulatory feedforward pathways have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) and appear to be a common motif in motor network architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</xref>). Feedforward loops of the type posited here for Bursicon and CCAP may be important in adjusting the coupling between Rk-expressing CPG neurons and their downstream motor neuron targets during Phase II. Compensatory adjustments in CPG, motor neuron and muscle activity by a single neuropeptide released from two different nodes in a feedforward loop have been described in the <italic>Aplysia</italic> feeding network where they guarantee stability of network output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jing et al., 2010</xref>). Coordinating CPG activity with motor neuron activity may be particularly important for multifunctional CPGs, in which individual neurons participate in multiple motor patterns, as for example, in the leech swim/crawl network in which multifunctional neurons fire in phase with the contraction of one muscle group during swimming, but not necessarily during crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggman and Kristan, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The value of ‘neuromodulatory connectomics’</title><p>The architecture of the pupal ecdysis network revealed here is similar to that of other motor circuits, such as those governing locomotion, feeding, and breathing in which higher order neurons modulate the activity of core CPGs to generate varied motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nusbaum et al., 2001</xref>). What is striking about neuromodulator action in the ecdysis circuit is its broad scope. ETH acts throughout the input layer to control different phases of pupal ecdysis behavior; Bursicon similarly regulates a large and essential set of neurons constituting the ecdysis CPG; and CCAP acts on many motor neurons necessary for generating the rhythmic ecdysis movements. The observation that Bursicon and CCAP signal from the input layer speaks to an organizational logic in which the ecdysial neuromodulators function together to provide coherence to the operation of the pupal ecdysis network by acting both within each hierarchical layer and by acting coordinately across layers. This organization is consistent with a generalized role for neuromodulatory systems in organizing neural activity to generate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marder, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results also support the rationale of mapping neuromodulatory pathways as a strategy for identifying essential network circuits and their functional organization. It is worth noting that our mapping of the pupal ecdysis network was done without reference to patterns of synaptic connectivity. Synaptic connectomes have proved difficult to interpret, in part due to their dense interconnectivity. If, as has been previously emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brezina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marder, 2012</xref>), this interconnectivity reflects the multifunctionality of the underlying networks, and if the functional configuration of a network at any given time is determined by where and how neuromodulators are acting on its components, then patterns of neuromodulatory connectivity may provide a necessary complement to synaptic maps to render them interpretable. A key challenge will lie in identifying which neuromodulator systems play critical roles in establishing a network’s output, but as the work here demonstrates, when these are known, the neuromodulatory connections can deliver substantial insight into how a neural network is organized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ETHRB-Gal4 (ETHRB<sup>MI00949</sup>-Gal4)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diao et al.

The ETHRB-p65AD line was made by ΦC31-mediated cassette exchange into MiMIC insertion MI00949 in the ETHR gene using a strategy previously used to make the ETHRA-p65AD line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diao et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, we created an ‘ETHRB<sup>MI00949</sup>-p65AD in 4b’ construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) by combining two fragments: one was a PCR-generated fragment encoding T2A-p65AD, amplified from the pBS-KS-attB-SA-SD-0-T2A-P65AD vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2015</xref>) using the primers listed in the Key Resources Table, and the other was a synthesized gene fragment corresponding to the ETHR genomic region from the MI00949 insertion point to the 3’ end of exon 4b. The latter fragment included an extension containing an Hsp70 polyadenylation signal and was flanked by Sal I restriction sites, which were used to subclone the fragment into the pBS-KS-attB1-2 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). The T2A-p65AD fragment was inserted in frame into a unique <italic>Bgl II</italic> site just prior to the stop codon of Exon 4b in the synthesized fragment using the In-Fusion Cloning Kit from Takara Bio USA, Inc (Mountain View, CA). The resulting vector (pBS-KS-ETHR<sup>MI00949</sup>-T2A-p65AD in 4B) was used for ΦC31-mediated transgenesis. All other lines created for use in this paper were generated using the Trojan exon technology by plasmid injection as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al. (2015)</xref>. All injections were made by Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc (Camarillo, CA). CCAP-R-specific Split Gal4 lines (CCAP-R-Gal4DBD and CCAP-R-p65AD), were generated by inserting the indicated Trojan exons into the MI05804 MiMIC site in intron 4 of the CCAP-R gene. New Rk-specific lines were generated by first inserting the Trojan Gal4 Expression Module (T-GEM) into the Rk locus using Crispr/Cas technology as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). The guide RNA (sgRNA) used to target T-GEM insertion was specific for a PAM site in intron 13 of the Rk gene and was made by annealing the two oligos listed in the Key Resources Table. The sgRNA was then inserted into the U6b-sgRNA-short plasmid of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ren et al. (2013)</xref> after digestion with <italic>Bbs I</italic>. The T-GEM construct was flanked by left (HAL) and right (HAR) homology arms of approximately 1 kb in length amplified by PCR using the primers indicated in the Key Resources Table (where upper case indicates sequences homologous to Rk and lower case indicates sequence homologous to the pT-GEM(1) plasmid.) The PCR products were cloned into the linearized pT-GEM(1) plasmid using the In-Fusion Cloning Kit from Takara Bio USA, Inc (Mountain View, CA). The Rk<sup>TGEM</sup>-Gal4 transgenic flies were made by microinjecting embryos of the {nosCas9} attP2 line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ren et al., 2013</xref>) with the sgRNA and pT-GEM plasmid DNA. The microinjection was made by Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc (CA). The G0 adults were crossed with yw;Sp/Cyo;Dr/TM3,Sb flies and the progeny were screened by fluorescence for those with eye-specific expression of the selection marker, RFP. Rk-specific Split Gal4 hemidriver lines were subsequently generated from this Rk<sup>TGEM</sup>-Gal4 line by substituting Gal4DBD and p65AD Trojan exons into the site of T-GEM insertion. The Burs-LexA::VP16AD line was generated from a drosophilized LexA::VP16AD DNA construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) in pBlueScript synthesized by Epoch Life Science, Inc (Sugar Land, TX). Flanking <italic>NotI</italic> and <italic>AscI</italic> restriction sites in the construct were used to subclone this construct into the pCAST-Burs<sup>Gal4DBD</sup> plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luan et al., 2012</xref>) after excision of the Gal4DBD sequence. Burs-LexA::VP16AD flies were made by standard P-element transgenesis by injecting the resulting pCAST-Burs-LexA::VP16AD plasmid into the embryos of w<sup>1118</sup> flies and a line was established with the transgene inserted on Chromosome II. The UAS-dTrpA1 and UAS-P2X2 lines were the kind gifts of Paul Garrity and Orie Shafer, respectively.

Animals were shifted to 31°C at the wandering L3 stage. Neuronal activation of ETHRA/CCAP neurons was accomplished using UAS-dTrpA1 using temperature shifts from 18°C to 29°C. Transient temperatures shifts were accomplished by heating to 29°C for 1 min before returning to 18°C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"/></p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>The method used for videorecording of pupal ecdysis behaviors was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diao et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, cryptocephalic pupae were selected for videorecording just prior to pupal ecdysis, after the abdominal bubble had appeared and vigorous movement of the gut had commenced. Puparia were coated with a mixture of halocarbon oil and water (~2:1) to increase their transparency and placed ventral side down on a cover glass, which was attached to a glass slide with doublestick tape to form a small chamber. Behavior was recorded from the ventral side for 1–2 hr at 20X magnification using a Sony NEX VG20 camcorder mounted on an Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope. Videorecords were imported into iMovie (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) software for behavioral analysis. Scoring of the pupal ecdysis phases largely followed the criteria described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al. (2006)</xref>: Phase I (pre-ecdysis) begins when the tip of the abdomen is lifted, creating an air pocket at the posterior end of the puparium, and continues with posterior-to-anterior ‘rolling’ contractions of the lateral body wall; Phase II (ecdysis) is characterized by persistent swinging, resulting from alternating lateral contractions of the abdomen; and Phase III (post-ecdysis) consists predominantly of anterior-to-posterior ‘stretch-compressions’ of the abdomen. The transition from Phase II to Phase III is not well-defined and consists of mixed abdominal movements that include intermingled swings and stretch-compressions. These various movements are often poorly resolved when viewed through the puparium, even when the latter are clarified by treatment with an oil/water mixture. To unambiguously define the end of Phase II for behavioral experiments, and to simplify the analysis, we therefore defined the last occurrence of any swinging (scored by playing the videos backwards and marking the time of the ‘first’ swinging bout) as the end of Phase II. For the muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> imaging experiments, where the transition from consolidated swinging to mixed abdominal movements could be resolved, we defined the end of consolidated swinging as the end of Phase II, and divided Phase III into a ‘Transition Period’ consisting of the mixed behavioral phase followed by a ‘late Phase III’ period of consolidated stretch-compressions. This division conformed well with the patterns of neural Ca<sup>++</sup> activity recorded in VNC-Rk and glutamatergic CCAP-R-expressing neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Nervous system whole mounts were excised from stage four pupae with an air bubble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>) and prepared for immunolabeling as described previously, using normal donkey or goat serum in the blocking solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luan et al., 2006a</xref>). Rabbit anti-pBurs (kind gift of Aaron Hsueh and Willi Honegger) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Guinea pig secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression patterns of Gal4 and Split Gal4 lines were visualized using either UAS-6XEGFP or UAS-6XmCherry. To visualize labeling of motor axons by CCAP-R-p65AD ∩ VGlut-Gal4DBD, wandering third instar larvae were briefly anesthetized under CO<sub>2</sub>, immersed in 100% ETOH, and then pinned out and filleted from the dorsal side in PBS. The head and internal organs were removed before fixation and staining. Muscle was visualized using Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Preparations were incubated with phalloidin at 1:1000 dilution for 2 hr, followed by three 10 min washes.

CNSs were excised and placed on poly-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) coated cover glass, dorsal side up, and then covered with Schneider's Insect Medium. GCaMP6s fluorescence in the VNC was imaged at a frequency of approximately 1 Hz for 90 min using a Nikon C2 confocal microscope with a 20X/0.75 NA air objective. Imaging was carried out using the largest pinhole (optical section thickness of 150 μm) and focusing on a plane approximately 20–35 μm below the dorsal surface, to maximize the number of neurons in the field.

Puparia were then mounted as described for behavioral videorecording in a halocarbon oil/water mixture, and GCaMP6s florescence was imaged from the ventral side at a frequency of approximately 1 Hz for 90 min using a Nikon C2 confocal microscope with a 4X/0.13 NA air objective.

For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, the frequencies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations for single ROIs were determined using the PhaseFinder program (described below) and average frequencies were calculated for each Phase, the duration of which was calculated by PhaseFinder using the global Ca<sup>++</sup> signal for the Rk-VNC neurons. Heatmaps showing the average Phase frequencies for each individual ROI (and the whole population) were created with MatLab using the built-in heatmap function.

This was achieved as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Using ImageJ, the mean Ca<sup>++</sup> activity within an ROI drawn over the whole VNC was calculated for each image in a timeseries to generate a Ca<sup>++</sup> trace. The PhaseFinder code operated on such a trace by first identifying peaks, and then a sliding window was used to compare the frequency or average amplitude of the peaks in one time-window to those in the next. The onset of Phase 1 was defined as the time of the first peak of activity following the addition of ETH. To find the onset of Phase 2 (and offset of Phase 1), the difference in average peak amplitude was calculated for consecutive windows and the first window for which this difference was more than one standard deviation above the average peak amplitude across all windows was defined as the beginning of Phase 2. Phase 3 was the most difficult to define because of the complexity of its Ca<sup>++</sup> activity patterns, but it was generally distinguished from the two preceding phases by a change in peak frequency. As described in the text, we divided this phase into a ‘Transition Period,’ of mixed frequencies, and a period of more uniform frequency (‘late Phase 3’). The onset of Phase 3 (which also marked the offset of Phase 2) was defined by the decrement in frequency that occurred at the time of phase transition. This was most easily identified by analyzing the time series data in reverse, using time windows starting at the end of the Ca<sup>++</sup> trace and looking for the first window for which the difference in frequency was positive (indicating a decrement in frequency moving forward in time). The uniformity of activity in late Phase 3 allowed its onset (and the offset of the Transition Period of Phase 3) to be defined simply as the first window for which the difference in peak frequency exceeded the average peak frequency for all windows by more than one standard deviation. Phase durations were calculated by subtracting the onset of each phase from the onset of the next phase. Further details about each parameter used in the PhaseFinder program can be found in the documentation available at Github (see below). Importantly, the parameter settings used to analyze all neuronal datasets (i.e. for both Rk- and CCAP-R-expressing neurons) were the same. Muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> traces required somewhat different parameters because of the significantly larger signal amplitudes in integrated mean fluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Sample sizes and statistics</title><p>For all experiments, the number of biological replicates (i.e. the number of animals or CNS preparations of a given genotype) analyzed was at least five, with the actual numbers for each experiment given in the figures or figure legends. Estimation of required sample sizes were made using the procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al. (1995)</xref> for binary categorical variables, since most experiments involved determining whether manipulation of a specific neuronal population (e.g. one expressing the receptors for Bursicon or CCAP) resulted in pupal ecdysis deficits or not. Similar manipulations previously applied to neurons expressing Bursicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peabody et al., 2008</xref>) or CCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2003a</xref>) report effect sizes on pupal ecdysis ranging from approximately 0.45 to 0.9, indicating the use of samples sizes of 4 to 10. The correlation analyses of Ca<sup>++</sup> signals measured on the left- and right-hand sides of the midline for VNC-Rk neurons and muscles were performed in MatLab using the built-in Corrcoeff function. For the statistical analysis of Ca<sup>++</sup> oscillation frequencies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, GraphPad Prism was used to conduct a one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett’s tests determined that the variance between groups was not significant and a Sidak’s multiple comparison’s test showed no significant differences between Rk and CCAPR-Vglut frequencies at any of the phases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health (ZIAMH002800, BHW) and by a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PRAT) Fellowship from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (FI2 GM117582, AE).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #3), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael E Adams (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant and informative study that advances our knowledge considerably regarding neuromodulatory regulation of the pupal ecdysis behavioral sequence in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The authors have capitalized on their earlier development of Trojan exon targeting of peptide receptors to identify neuronal targets of ETH, bursicon, and CCAP and ascertain their roles in each of the sequential behaviors. Using a combination of behavioral monitoring, calcium imaging, and selective activation of neuronal groups through expression of temperature sensitive TrpA1 and ATP/P2X2, they have identified layers (modular input, CPG, motor output) of circuit organization and how they interact to produce an innate sequence of behaviors. These findings have general relevance to our understanding of how multiple centrally patterned behaviors can be encoded by modulating the properties/connections of neural circuit(s). The work is nicely illustrated with exemplary data. The writing is clear and the Introduction in particular very scholarly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript as written does not provide a clear description of the genotypes used in the experiments. This makes it difficult at times to gauge the quality of experimental controls. It is also a significant barrier to future replication of the experiments. Full genotypes, preferably using standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic notation, should be included in the manuscript in a way that makes it easy for the reader to determine the precise genotypes used for each experiment. This is particularly pressing for the first P2X2 experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, as it is not completely clear what the genotype of the control line is here (see point two below).</p><p>2) The P2X2 functional connectivity experiments described appear to use inconsistent negative controls. In the first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>,) ATP is applied to preparations that lack P2X2 expression. In the second and third (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the negative control is the same time-course imaging and genotype in the absence of ATP application. In order to fully control this experiment, it is important to apply ATP to a preparation that contains the P2X2 responder element without its genetic driver. This controls for both the potential effects of ATP application and for the possibility of leaky P2X2 expression that may occur independently of the genetic driver used in the experimental animals. It is not clear if this is the control used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but it seems clear that this was not what was done for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and 6. The P2X2 controls are straightforward and critical. Now that this method has been used more extensively, it has become clear that leaky P2X2 can result in the direct ATP mediated excitation of the presumptive target. The authors need only repeat the ATP application experiments on genotypes that lack the driver for P2X2 Expression for last two P2X2 experiments. This would require no new reagents and would take about a month and a half, most of which would be waiting on the flies to eclose.</p><p>3) The level of quantification and analysis of the Ca-imaging time series is a bit disappointing. The authors seem to be focused on showing the match between neuronal activity, muscle activity, and behavior but miss the opportunity to provide in-depth analysis of the rhythms/patterns observed. Particularly for the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> there is a missed opportunity to present neuronal phase data using modern phase analyses. The data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> are used to justify the argument that the GPGs are multifunctional but the analyses are not deep. Several of the studies cited do provide such phase analyses, e.g. Briggman and Kristan, 2006; 2008, not just correlations, average behavior-phase durations and average frequencies. We ask that the authors consider expanding these analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29797.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript as written does not provide a clear description of the genotypes used in the experiments.

As indicated on the list of genotypes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, the controls requested were, in fact, conducted for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>, thus excluding possible ATP responses by both ectopically expressed P2X2 and endogenously expressed ATP receptors. The latter possibility was also controlled for in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, though in this case we did not control for possible leaky expression of P2X2. We were at the time of the experiment unaware of the report that ectopically expressed P2X2 could give rise to spurious signals. Because of the difficulty of genetically recombining the necessary transgenes, we were also unable to repeat this experiment within the two-month period of revision. It thus remains possible that ectopic P2X2 expression induces the observed Ca<sup>++</sup> response in the VGlut-expressing neurons. We note, however, that if this is true, the responding population cannot include the neurons that also express CCAP-R based on the negative results obtained with the control preparations shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>. This seems less likely to us than the alternative possibility, which is that the same population of VGlut- and CCAP-R-expressing neurons is responding to activation of upstream Rk neurons in the two experiments. Because of the consistency of the results from the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>, we are loathe to omit <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, but we will do so if the reviewers think it necessary. We note, however, that the control performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> has been an accepted standard in the literature (and, in fact, was used in a paper published earlier this year in <italic>eLife</italic>: doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.23206), and that the reviewers’ published comments might serve as sufficient warning to readers that our results are open to this caveat. In response to the reviewers’ comments we have also amended the legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6 to clarify the nature of the control experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The level of quantification and analysis of the Ca-imaging time series is a bit disappointing. The authors seem to be focused on showing the match between neuronal activity, muscle activity, and behavior but miss the opportunity to provide in-depth analysis of the rhythms/patterns observed.

We ask that the authors consider expanding these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we are very sympathetic with the reviewers on this point. We’d love to be able to carry out the type of analysis that Briggman and Kristan conducted on the leech swimming and crawling CPGs! In fact, our hope is that our work will pave the way for a comprehensive analysis of not only the CPGs, but of all the relevant components of the pupal ecdysis network lying between the sites of hormonal input and the motor neurons. Before that is possible, however, we will need to be able to meet two conditions that facilitated Briggman and Kristan’s elegant analysis. First, we need to be able to confidently assign optically observed Ca<sup>++</sup> changes to individually identifiable neurons, and second, we must be able to independently monitor fictive motor program output using the activity of identified neurons as proxies. Using our current imaging paradigm, the spatial resolution of our Ca<sup>++</sup> activity records is relatively limited, particularly in the z-dimension, which makes obtaining bona fide single cell traces difficult, if not impossible. In addition, we lack a gold standard for following the motor output. We have recently completed construction of a light-sheet microscope that will permit two-channel imaging. Our goal is to collect brain-wide measurements of single-cell responses to ETH from neurons in different layers of the pupal ecdysis network while simultaneously recording motor neuron activity as a proxy for behavior from the same preparation. We think that this type of data will lend itself well to the type of deep analysis that the reviewers request and hope that they will view our failure to provide it not so much as a “missed opportunity,” but as an opportunity prudently deferred.</p><p>Given the limitations of our current imaging capabilities, we felt that the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> of our original manuscript was about as deep as our data warranted. Our intention was to provide suggestive, rather than conclusive, evidence for the multifunctionality of the putative CPG neurons in the VNC-Rk pattern and we are still inclined to think that this analysis is worth including. However, the reviewers’ disappointment with its limited scope indicates that our original treatment needs to be improved, if only to limit the reader’s expectations. Accordingly, we have tried in the revised manuscript to: 1) clearly spell out the limitations of our approach, explicitly stating in the Materials and methods our limited imaging resolution in the z-dimension (see “GCaMP Ca<sup>++</sup> imaging”); 2) indicate that the analysis is “preliminary”; and 3) more carefully qualify our conclusions. The text of both the Results and the legend of the revised figure (i.e. “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>”) now make it clear that the small ROIs selected for analysis cannot necessarily be interpreted as “neurons.” In addition, after considering the reviewers’ comments, we thought it might be useful to summarize in some way our analysis of the 95 selected small ROIs rather than simply present selected Ca<sup>++</sup> traces. Although no single parameter defines the phases of Ca<sup>++</sup> activity, oscillation frequency is an important determinant. For each ROI, we therefore calculated the average oscillation frequency for each Phase (defined from the global Ca<sup>++</sup> signal over the entire VNC-Rk population) using the PhaseFinder program. The activity of each ROI can thus be represented as a set of average Phase frequencies that can be compared across ROIs and against the global average. This data—represented as a heatmap—is now included as panel C in “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Represented in this way, one can see that the ROIs exhibit a heterogeneous set of activity patterns, but that roughly 10% of them have frequency patterns across Phases that resemble that of the whole population—again consistent with the conclusion that some neurons within the VNC-Rk pattern may be multifunctional.</p><p>We realize that this additional analysis is by no means definitive proof that VNC-Rk neurons constitute a multifunctional central pattern generator and that further analysis will be required. To lay the groundwork for such an analysis, however, the first step has to be the plausible identification of the CPG neurons. Our goal was to provide such a demonstration, not only for the putative CPG neurons, but also for the neurons of the input and motor output layers. One of the strengths of the manuscript as we see it is that it provides a map of where to look for the different functional components of the pupal ecdysis network by revealing the molecular markers that distinguish them. By providing such a map, we not only confirm the insight derived from the pioneering work of Mike Adams’ lab—namely that ETH induces the generation of a bona fide fictive ecdysis sequence in the excised pupal nervous system—but open the door to a comprehensive analysis of how that sequence is generated from start to finish.</p></body></sub-article></article>
