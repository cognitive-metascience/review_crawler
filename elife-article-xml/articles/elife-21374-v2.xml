The cAMP-degrading enzymes, phosphodiesterases (PDEs), localise to specific subcellular domains within which they control local cAMP levels and are key regulators of signal compartmentalisation. Several components of the cAMP/PKA cascade are located to different mitochondrial sub-compartments, suggesting the presence of multiple cAMP/PKA signalling domains within the organelle. The function and regulation of these domains remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a novel cAMP/PKA signalling domain localised at mitochondrial membranes and regulated by PDE2A2. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches combined with real-time FRET imaging and high resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that in rat cardiac myocytes and other cell types mitochondrial PDE2A2 regulates local cAMP levels and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1. We further demonstrate that inhibition of PDE2A, by enhancing the hormone-dependent cAMP response locally, affects mitochondria dynamics and protects from apoptotic cell death.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21374.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21374.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>cAMP/PKA</kwd><kwd>compartmentalisation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>phosphodiesterases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K501256/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaccolo</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/10/75/28537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaccolo</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005617</institution-id><institution>BHF Centre of Research Excellence, Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RE/08/004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaccolo</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/12/3/29423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zaccolo</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enzyme phosphodiesterase 2A2 localises at the mitochondrial membrane and its inhibition results in a local increase in cAMP concentration, mitochondrial elongation and resistance to apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria produce the majority of ATP required for a cell to function and perform vital functions in the maintenance of cellular metabolism and ion homeostasis. Additionally, mitochondria play an important role in apoptosis and are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>). Mitochondria exist in a dynamic network and are continuously remodelled by fusion and fission reactions. Alteration of the fusion/fission balance contributes to the pathogenesis of many complex conditions, including common neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer, 2013</xref>), including the adaptive response to ischaemia–reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sharp et al., 2014</xref>) and cardiac remodelling associated with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Disorganized, small mitochondria are typically found in a variety of cardiac pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schaper et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). As a consequence, molecular mediators of mitochondria dynamics are recognised as potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria fission involves dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a GTPase of the dynamin superfamily, which resides in the cytosol and translocates to the mitochondria upon activation by calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>). Drp1 multimerises at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and is thought to mechanically constrict and eventually sever mitochondria. Drp1 is subject to complex post-translational modification by ubiquitylation, sumoylation, nitrosylation and phosphorylation. A well-characterised regulation of Drp1 is its inactivation by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation at serine 637 (ser637), which results in mitochondria elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cereghetti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Blackstone, 2007</xref>).</p><p>PKA is a multi-target kinase activated by the ubiquitous second messenger 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP is synthesised either by a plasma membrane- associated adenylyl cyclase (pmAC), upon hormonal activation of Gs protein-coupled receptors, or by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and bicarbonate sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rahman et al., 2013</xref>). cAMP/PKA signalling regulates fundamental cellular processes, including cell differentiation, growth, metabolism and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taskén and Aandahl, 2004</xref>). Dysfunctional cAMP signalling has been implicated in multiple disease conditions and several drugs currently in use target the cAMP/PKA pathway. cAMP/PKA signalling is compartmentalised in distinct signalling domains and occurs largely via generation of restricted pools of cAMP that activate PKA subsets tethered in proximity to specific targets via binding to A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) constitute a superfamily of enzymes, which includes more than 100 isoforms, and are the only enzymes that degrade cAMP. Different PDE isoforms are uniquely regulated and distributed within the cell. Therefore, they differentially determine the local level of cAMP at specific subcellular sites, dictating which PKA targets are phosphorylated and the specificity of the downstream response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurice et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A number of components of the cAMP signalling cascade have been located at the mitochondria, including multiple AKAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Means et al., 2011</xref>) and PDEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cercek and Houslay, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shimizu-Albergine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the co-existence at the organelle of multiple cAMP/PKA signalling domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lefkimmiatis and Zaccolo, 2014</xref>). However, the organisation, regulation and functional significance of these domains remain largely to be established.</p><p>PDE2A is a 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-activated PDE that degrades both cAMP and cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stroop and Beavo, 1991</xref>) and is expressed in a number of tissues, including brain, heart, liver, lung, adipose tissue and adrenal gland. Three variants of the Pde2a gene are expressed (PDE2A1, PDE2A2 and PDE2A3). The variants differ in their amino termini, and this variation may explain their different subcellular localisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lugnier, 2006</xref>). Genetic ablation of PDE2A results in high embryonic lethality past E17.5–E18.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stephenson et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that these enzymes are involved in vital biological functions.</p><p>Previous evidence suggests localisation of PDE2A2 to the mitochondrial matrix where it regulates ATP production via modulation of cAMP generated locally by sAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that in cardiac myocytes and other cell types PDE2A2 is part of a distinct cAMP/PKA signalling domain located at the mitochondria but outside the mitochondrial matrix. This PDE2A2 subset localises to mitochondrial membranes where it controls a pool of cAMP generated at the plasma membrane by the hormone-responsive pmAC, and regulates PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1. Inhibition of this subset of PDE2A2 results in elongated mitochondria and protection from mitochondrial-dependent cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDE2A2 regulates mitochondria morphology</title><p>When we expressed PDE2A2-GFP in primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), we found that it is distinctly located at the mitochondria, unlike PDE2A1-GFP, which is cytosolic, and PDE2A3-GFP, which localises predominantly to the plasmalemma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Increasing cAMP levels via selective inhibition of PDE3 with cilostamide (10 µM) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), whereas maximal elevation of cAMP, as achieved by application of the tmAC activator forskolin (25 µM) and the non-selective PDE inhibitor isobutyl-methyl-xanthine (IBMX, 100 µM), also resulted in mitochondria elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Knock down of PDE2A expression in NRVM, using the small interfering RNA sequence siPDE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stangherlin et al., 2011</xref>), also resulted in elongated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Western blotting analysis of lysates from NRVM treated with Bay 60–7550 showed significant increase in Drp1 phosphorylation at the PKA site ser637 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) compared to DMSO-treated controls, whereas no increased phosphorylation was detected at ser616, a site phosphorylated by the kinase CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taguchi et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). No effect of Bay 60–7550 treatment on mitochondrial morphology was found in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which DRP1 was genetically ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>) (MEFs<sup>DRP1-/-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Expression of wild type Drp1 (Drp1 wtGFP) in MEFs<sup>DRP1-/-</sup>, but not of a DRP1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA (Drp1 Mut-GFP), rescued the effect of Bay 60–7550 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), confirming that elongation of mitochondria on inhibition of PDE2A is mediated by PKA phosphorylation of Drp1.</p><p>The role of PDE2A2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology is further supported by analysis of MEFs obtained from E.13 dpc embryos that are homozygous for the genetic ablation of the PDE2A gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stephenson et al., 2009</xref>) (MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref> shows that MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> have significantly more elongated mitochondria than the wild type counterpart (MEFs<sup>wt</sup>). The MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> mitochondrial phenotype could be completely rescued by expression of a red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged PDE2A2 (PDE2A2wt-RFP), whereas expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PDE2A2 (PDE2A2dn-RFP) in MEFs<sup>WT</sup> resulted in elongated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). It should be noted that both PDE2A2wt-RFP and PDE2A2dn-RFP localise to mitochondria with no appreciable cytosolic localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that the rescue effect of PDE2A2wt-RFP in MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> is the consequence of local cAMP hydrolysis at the organelle, and that elongation of mitochondria in MEFs<sup>WT</sup> expressing PDE2A2dn-RFP relies on a local increase in cAMP following displacement of the endogenous active mitochondrial PDE2A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stangherlin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zoccarato et al., 2015</xref>).

However, the molecular machinery that regulates mitochondria fission/fusion, including Drp1, is not localised to the matrix and any cAMP generated in the matrix cannot escape this compartment as the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is impermeable to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Benedetto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that the elongation of mitochondria we observe on inhibition of PDE2A depends on modulation of cAMP generated in the matrix. We therefore hypothesised that mitochondrial PDE2A2 may be located outside the matrix in a compartment where it can access and degrade cAMP generated by pmAC. To test this hypothesis, we measured cAMP levels using FRET-based reporters that are targeted to the OMM (OMM-H90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>), to the mitochondrial matrix (matrix-H90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lefkimmiatis et al., 2013</xref>), or are free in the cytosol (H90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van der Krogt et al., 2008</xref>). When expressed in NRVM the three sensors show the expected localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, inhibition of PDE2A generates a similar elevation of cAMP in the bulk cytosol as inhibition of PDE3. In contrast, and in line with the effect on mitochondria morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), a significantly higher increase in cAMP was detected at the OMM upon inhibition of PDE2A, as compared to inhibition of PDE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, Bay 60–7550 did not increase cAMP levels in the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and was unable to appreciably increase in the matrix the concentration of the membrane permeable cAMP analogue 8-CPT-6-Phe-cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). When matrix-H90 was expressed in MEFs<sup>PDE2wt</sup> no appreciable increase in cAMP was detected in the matrix on inhibition of PDE2A and the response was undistinguishable from that obtained in MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> expressing the same sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We next measured FRET changes in MEFs<sup>PDE2wt</sup> and MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> expressing H90 or OMM-H90. We found that application of IBMX (100 µM) results in a similar increase in cAMP in the bulk cytosol in the two cell types. In contrast, the cAMP increase at the OMM is significantly higher in MEFs<sup>PDE2wt</sup> than in MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). As expected, no response to Bay 60–7550 was detected in either compartment in MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup>. Collectively, the above findings indicate that, at least in cardiac myocytes and MEFs, the predominant role of PDE2A is to regulate pmAC-generated cAMP at the OMM, and that any PDE2A activity in the matrix in these cells is below the detection limit of the matrix-H90 sensor. Furthermore, PDE2A2 appears to account for a large fraction (about 85%) of the IBMX-sensitive PDE activity at the OMM.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21374.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PDE2A2 controls cAMP at the outer mitochondrial membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FRET analysis in NRVM expressing the cytosolic EPAC-based H90 sensor (left) and treated with the PDE2 selective inhibitor Bay 60–7550 (BAY60, 1 µM) or the PDE3 selective inhibitor cilostamide (Cilo), 10 µM). 25 µM Forskolin and 100 µM IBMX (F/I) was applied at the end of the experiment to achieve saturation of the sensor.

To address whether PDE2A2 activity at the mitochondria may modulate the sensitivity of cardiac myocytes to pro-apoptotic stimuli, we exposed MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> and MEFs<sup>wt</sup> to ionomycin (iono), a pro-apoptotic treatment that relies on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

We found that, while at the concentration used the two treatments result in comparable death of MEFs<sup>wt</sup>, MEFs<sup>PDE2KO</sup> are significantly protected from ionomycin- but not staurosporin-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In line with these results, NRVM treated with Bay 60–7550 are protected from ionomycin but not staurosporin treatment, an effect that was not observed when the cells were treated with the PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

This complex and multifaceted functional role is executed with accuracy thanks to a tight temporal and spatial control of protein phosphorylation, which is achieved by compartmentalisation of the molecular components of the signalling cascade. Compartmentalisation of cAMP offers the opportunity to target therapeutically individual cAMP pools, rather than global intracellular cAMP levels, in order to achieve greater efficacy and specificity of intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurice et al., 2014</xref>). To assess the translational relevance of such a strategy, a detailed understanding of the organisation and regulation of individual cAMP signalling domains is required. Here we investigated the role of PDE2A in the local regulation of cAMP signalling at the mitochondria and its impact on mitochondrial function.</p><p>Numerous studies have linked PDE2A to pathological conditions, including psychiatric, neurological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), cardiovascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mehel et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and respiratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) disorders. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A in animal models has been shown to have beneficial effects in a number of conditions, such as cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zoccarato et al., 2015</xref>), pulmonary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bubb et al., 2014</xref>) as well as depression, anxiety and cognition deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). A phase I clinical trial examining a PDE2A inhibitor for the treatment of schizophrenia is currently ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takeda, 2015</xref>). Despite extensive evidence linking PDE2A to disease and the growing interest of pharmaceutical companies in PDE2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trabanco et al., 2016</xref>), a mechanistic understanding of the role of this enzyme in pathophysiology remains limited.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that PDE2A2 is part of a novel mitochondrial cAMP/PKA signalling domain. We demonstrate that this domain is fuelled by cAMP generated at the plasma membrane, it drives PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 and modulates mitochondria dynamics and cell survival. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of PDE2A2 activity results in more elongated mitochondria, increased membrane potential and resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. Our STED analysis shows that PDE2A2 localisation at mitochondrial membranes is not homogeneous but shows a dotted appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which suggests that PDE2A2 may be part of a protein cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jans et al., 2013</xref>). If confirmed, the identification of PDE2A2 interacting partners at the OMM/IMM may provide an avenue for selective displacement, and therefore specific ablation, of PDE2A activity at this site.</p><p>A previous study reported that PDE2A2 localises to the mitochondrial matrix in hepatocytes and neurons where it hydrolyses cAMP generated locally by sAC and regulates ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2011</xref>). In our investigation using primary cells (NRVM and embryonic fibroblasts) and cell lines, we found that the majority of PDE2A2 localises to mitochondrial membranes. Our findings are in line with an earlier report of a cGMP-activated mitochondrial PDE, 20% of which was found to be associated with the OMM and 80% with the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cercek and Houslay, 1982</xref>). Although we failed to detect significant PDE2A activity in the mitochondrial matrix using FRET imaging, we cannot exclude that a smaller fraction of the enzyme is present in this compartment. However, we demonstrate that the effect on mitochondria morphology, mitochondria membrane potential and reduced apoptotic cell death observed upon inhibition of PDE2A is not dependent on a sAC/cAMP/PKA/PDE2A signalling domain in the matrix as these effects are unchanged in cells lacking sAC.</p><p>Future studies are required to establish the extent to which dysfunction of the cAMP/PKA/PDE2A domain localised at the OMM/IMM underpins PDE2A-related pathological conditions, and whether PDE2A inhibition at this site may be a viable therapeutic avenue. A number of findings warrant these investigations. The positive effect of PDE2A inhibitors on depression/anxiety-like behaviours has been linked to their anti-apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, inhibition of Drp1 was shown to preserve mitochondria morphology and to prevent cell death in a model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sharp et al., 2014</xref>). Increased PDE2A expression was reported both in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hua et al., 2012</xref>) and in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aye et al., 2012</xref>) heart failure and PDE2A inhibition was shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophic remodelling in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zoccarato et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that PDE2A inhibition may be of therapeutic value in this context. Whether the localisation of PDE2A at mitochondrial membranes is related to the anti-hypertrophic effect of PDE2A inhibition in cardiac myocytes remains to be established. However, it is interesting to note that knock down of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2, which results in fragmented mitochondria, also leads to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, suggesting a possible direct link between mitochondria fragmentation and cardiac myocytes hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pennanen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of a novel cAMP/PKA/PDE2A2 signalling domain located at mitochondrial membranes provides an original mechanistic framework for understanding the involvement of PDE2A2 in pathology and has potential implications for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents, constructs and cell lines</title><p>Forskolin, IBMX, Cilostamide, Ionomycin, Pancreatin and Proteinase K were from Sigma-Aldrich (UK).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission..</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here, the authors showed that the PDE2A2 cAMP phosphodiesterase is localized to the mitochondria, in part at the outer membrane, and, using either knockdown and re-expression of WT and catalytic mutant PDE2A2 or a selective PDE2A2 inhibitor, they used localized FRET-based cAMP sensor analysis to show that PDE2A2 regulates cAMP levels in the vicinity of mitochondria in cardiac myocytes. Functionally, they showed that inhibition or depletion of PDE2A2 caused mitochondrial elongation, whereas overexpression of PDE2A2 but not PDE2A7 caused mitochondrial fragmentation, concomitant with increased or decreased phosphorylation of S637 in the Drp1 fission protein, a PKA site whose phosphorylation inhibits Drp1 mitochondrial fission activity.</p><p>The compartmentalization of cAMP and PKA signaling is highly topical, and the reviewers found your conclusion that PDE2A2 acts at the periphery of mitochondria to control local cAMP concentrations to be of interest. However, they were not fully convinced that your current data provide unequivocal evidence that cAMP levels in the vicinity of mitochondria are regulated by a pool of PDE2A2 on the surface as opposed to by the intramitochondrial PDE2A2 population.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the experiments on PDE2A2 sub-mitochondrial localization need to be revisited. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> on the localization of endogenous PDE2A2 are not particularly convincing in terms of an outer membrane localization. Only ~40% of the protein was removed by proteinase K, compared to 100% for TOM20. At face value, these data indicate that the majority of the endogenous protein resides interior to the outer membrane, more consistent with previous studies. Moreover, most of the PDE2A2 in the mitochondrial fraction appears to be immunolocalized on cristae membranes in immunoEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, although when PDE2A2 was overexpressed as a GFP fusion, it appeared to have a largely outer membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C</xref>), one could argue that this localization is an overexpression artifact. It is essential to track the remaining ~60% proteinase K-resistant PDE2A2 by biochemical studies to determine its subcellular localization. Other subfractionation approaches are required to inspect mitochondrial localization of PDE2A2 – see for example the swell-contract method used in Murthy and Pande (PNAS 84:378, 1987), and proper quantitation of PDE2A2 protein during fractionation is required. The authors should also discuss more fairly the possibility that a major fraction is inside and only a minor population on the outer membrane. This would not detract from the biological effects they are showing.</p><p>2) The authors attribute the elongation of mitochondria in PDE2A2 knockout cells to phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser637, but unequivocal proof is needed to demonstrate that the protective effect of PDE2A on apoptosis is Drp1 mediated. To this end, they need to repeat the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in cells where Drp1 has been ablated, and WT or non-phosphorylatable Drp1 S637A has been re-expressed, and test if the protection by PDE2A inhibition is additive. At the same time, the levels of phospho-S637 need to be checked by immunoblotting. Ideally, one could show that PDE2A2 knockout cells no longer have elongated mitochondria if a S637E Drp1 phosphomimetic mutant is expressed in the cells.</p><p>3) Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the membrane potential data are puzzling: FCCP is a protonophore and it fully dissipates membrane potential, so the differences upon BAY-60 pretreatment cannot be explained. A correct measurement of membrane potential would require that the authors titrate in oligomycin (to reach maximal TMRM fluorescence) and then FCCP, in conditions where they inhibit the MDR pump for which rhodamines are substrates (for example with verapamil). The difference between steady state TMRM fluorescence and the [max (oligomycin)-min (FCCP)] fluorescence would be an indicator of steady state membrane potential. Yet, a lower membrane potential might just mean more respiring mitochondria, not simply dysfunctional ones. A more meaningful assay would be to correlate cell death protection to preservation of membrane potential.</p><p>4) The strongest evidence for a role of PDE2A2 on outer membrane cAMP levels is the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, especially parts D versus E. However, a concern with these experiments is the potential for artifacts from the use of drugs. It is unclear why the nonspecific PDE inhibitor IBMX was used in panel E, instead of BAY60. Also, the behavior of the matrix FRET sensor needs to be compared in PDE2A2 knockout cells.</p><p>5) A major concern is how to reconcile the data in this paper with previous work (Acin-Perez et al. Cell Metab. 9:265, 2009) that convincingly showed that PDE is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates cAMP levels generated by sAC, which is also localized to the mitochondrial matrix. The production of cAMP activated phosphorylation of respiratory chain subunits and increased oxidative phosphorylation. The authors need to provide a convincing explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PDE2A2 regulates mitochondria morphology and apoptotic cell death via local modulation of cAMP/PKA signalling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>I am pleased to say that in principle your paper is now acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been greatly improved by inclusion of new data to address the original reviewers' concerns, but there are a few minor issues raised by the new reviewer 3 and by the original reviewer 1 that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in the reviews below. Please make the small changes that are requested, and resubmit the paper to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript has been improved by the addition of some key new experiments. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> provide good evidence that the fraction of PDE2A2 within mitochondria are not within the matrix. The new result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> is consistent with their model that PDE2A2 inhibition causes mitochondrial elongation through phosphorylation of Drp1 at S637. The results are not particularly striking, however. The figure legend should indicate the meaning of the asterisks, as well as the statistical test used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The revision greatly improved the paper: the conclusions are now fully supported by the experiments presented and this paper would make a very nice addition to the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper reports the localisation of PDE2A2 at the outer mitochondrial membrane where the authors show that this enzyme contributes to creating a cAMP microdomain that regulates PKA phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (which inhibits its function in fission). Inhibition of PDE2A2 gives mitochondrial elongation, increases membrane potential and protects from apoptosis. The conclusions are supported by pharmacological studies, studies using differentially targeted cAMP FRET reporters and studies in PDE2A2, Drp1 and sAC knockout MEFs. As a new reviewer on the revised version of this manuscript. I have focused on reading the revised paper which I think in general is now a convincing story. I have also gone through the tracked version of the revised manuscript and the reviewers' earlier comments and responses from the authors to these that I in general find have addressed the major comments to the first version.</p><p>The remaining comment that I have is that I still (as also brought up in the first review under comment 1 and which has not specifically been commented on by the authors) think the EM immunolocalization still appears to be on cristae membranes rather than OMM, it would be good if the authors could clarify this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21374.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) All the experiments on PDE2A2 sub-mitochondrial localization need to be revisited.

The authors should also discuss more fairly the possibility that a major fraction is inside and only a minor population on the outer membrane. This would not detract from the biological effects they are showing.</italic> </p><p>In our original submission we did clearly state that only a fraction (about 40%) of PDE2A2 resides at the OMM and suggested, based also on our EM analysis and STED imaging, that the remaining 60% of PDE2A2 resided inside the mitochondria at the IMM, as it appeared to be excluded from the intra-cristae space and the matrix. As suggested by the reviewers, to further strengthen this point, we have now performed a more detailed biochemical analysis of submitochondrial fractions. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and show that while PDE2A2 can clearly be detected in the mitoplast fraction, it is completely depleted when the mitoplasts are treated with proteinase K (PK), as is TIM23, another protein that localises at the IMM facing the IMS. In contrast, COX2, a protein associated to the IMM but entirely facing the matrix, is not affected by PK treatment, confirming that in our preparation the mitoplasts are intact and that matrix-localised proteins are not affected by PK treatment. Based on these results, and taking into account the imaging data (STED and EM) we conclude that, in NRVM, PDE2A2 localises predominantly at the mitochondria, with a minor fraction being found at the OMM and a larger fraction at the IMM facing the IMS.</p><p><italic>2) The authors attribute the elongation of mitochondria in PDE2A2 knockout cells to phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser637, but unequivocal proof is needed to demonstrate that the protective effect of PDE2A on apoptosis is Drp1 mediated. To this end, they need to repeat the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in cells where Drp1 has been ablated, and WT or non-phosphorylatable Drp1 S637A has been re-expressed, and test if the protection by PDE2A inhibition is additive. At the same time, the levels of phospho-S637 need to be checked by immunoblotting. Ideally, one could show that PDE2A2 knockout cells no longer have elongated mitochondria if a S637E Drp1 phosphomimetic mutant is expressed in the cells.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion as this experiment allows to directly demonstrate the involvement of Drp1 in the effect of PDE2A inhibition. However, we would like to point out that, because inhibition of PDE2A results in an increase of cAMP and PKA-dependent phosphorylation, overexpression of a phospho-null Drp1 is not expected to show additive effect with PDE2A inhibition but is expected to cancel out such effect. Based on this suggestion, to strengthen our conclusion that the effects on mitochondria morphology and cell death that we observe on PDE2 inhibition are dependent on PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 we performed two completely new sets of experiments using MEF<sup>wt</sup> and MEF<sup>Drp1KO</sup>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> we show that the effect of PDE2A inhibition on mitochondria elongation is not detectable in MEF<sup>Drp1KO</sup> cells. The ability of PDE2A inhibition to induce elongation of mitochondria is restored in MEF<sup>Drp1KO</sup> that express wt Drp1 but not a Drp1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA. In addition, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> we show that while we confirm in wt MEFs that BAY60 protects the cells from ionomycin-induced apoptosis, this effect is lost in MEF<sup>Drp1KO</sup>, confirming that for PDE2A inhibition to exert a protective effect, Drp1 is required. Expression of a Drp1 phosphomimetic in PDE2AKO cells is not expected to reverse the phenotype (elongated mitochondria) of PDE2AKO cells as lack of PDE2A leads to increased phosphorylation of Drp1 and phosphomimetic Drp1 (always inactive) would also result in elongated mitochondria. We therefore did not perform this experiment.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to confirm by western blot the level of phosphorylated Drp1 in the experiments with expression of Drp1 wt in MEF<sup>Drp1KO</sup>. We believe this depends on the low fraction of Drp1 that is phosphorylated in MEFs. In support of this interpretation is the fact that we could only detect a very weak signal for phospho-Drp1 when the recombinant Drp1 was pulled-down from lysates of MEFs treated with saturating concentrations of Forskolin and IBMX (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Cells treated with Bay60 did not show any signal at all.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21374.014</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21374.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21374.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-21374-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the membrane potential data are puzzling: FCCP is a protonophore and it fully dissipates membrane potential, so the differences upon BAY-60 pretreatment cannot be explained.

Yet, a lower membrane potential might just mean more respiring mitochondria, not simply dysfunctional ones. A more meaningful assay would be to correlate cell death protection to preservation of membrane potential.</italic> </p><p>The presentation of our data on mitochondria membrane potential in the first submission was unclear and has created a misunderstanding. The representative traces shown in our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> were normalised to the basal fluorescence values, which is what we did to calculate the percent drop in membrane potential on FCCP application. We realise now that this way of presenting the data is misleading as it looks like FCCP is not dissipating completely the membrane potential in all treatment groups. We apologise for the confusion that this has generated. We have now corrected this and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref> have raw, non-normalised data, which clearly show that treatment with PDE2A2 inhibitor results in higher membrane potential compared to untreated cells and that FCCP, as expected, dissipates the membrane potential completely in all conditions.</p><p>We thought however that the concern raised by the reviewers about the possibility that a lower membrane potential could result from mitochondria that respire more and, vice versa, that a higher membrane potential may result from mitochondria that respire less, was an important point to address. We therefore performed Seahorse measurement to assess mitochondria respiration in cardiac myocytes treated with the PDE2A inhibitor and found no significant difference compared to untreated myocytes (data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), confirming that the increased membrane potential on Bay 60-7550 application is not due to deficient respiration. Finally, to try and correlate cell death protection to preservation of membrane potential, we assessed whether PDE2A inhibition would preserve membrane potential in cardiac myocytes subjected to pro-apoptotic stimuli. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, while ionomycin treatment results in a significant reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential, Bay 60-7550 completely restores the membrane potential to control values.</p><p><italic>4) The strongest evidence for a role of PDE2A2 on outer membrane cAMP levels is the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, especially parts D versus E. However, a concern with these experiments is the potential for artifacts from the use of drugs. It is unclear why the nonspecific PDE inhibitor IBMX was used in panel E, instead of BAY60. Also, the behavior of the matrix FRET sensor needs to be compared in PDE2A2 knockout cells.</italic> </p><p>We have now included experiments where we show the effect of Bay 60-7550 on cAMP levels both in the cytosol and OMM of both MEF<sup>wt</sup> and MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). The data show that, as expected, inhibition of PDE2A does not generate an appreciable response in both cytosol and mitochondria of MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup> cells. In addition, while IBMX treatment results in the same cAMP increase in the cytosol of MEF<sup>wt</sup> and MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup>, the effect of IBMX is almost completely abolished at the OMM in MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup> cells compared to MEF<sup>wt</sup>, further supporting that PDE2A is the predominant PDE at the mitochondria. In addition, we now provide data showing the response of matrix-H90 expressed in both MEF<sup>wt</sup> and MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup>. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and show that the FRET change on PDE2A inhibition is indistinguishable in the two cell types, confirming that the activity of any matrix-localised PDE2A is not detectable with this sensor.</p><p><italic>5) A major concern is how to reconcile the data in this paper with previous work (Acin-Perez et al. Cell Metab. 9:265, 2009) that convincingly showed that PDE is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates cAMP levels generated by sAC, which is also localized to the mitochondrial matrix. The production of cAMP activated phosphorylation of respiratory chain subunits and increased oxidative phosphorylation. The authors need to provide a convincing explanation.</italic> </p><p>In this study we present multiple lines of evidence that consistently support localisation of PDE2A2 at mitochondrial membranes (both OMM facing the cytosol and IMM facing the IMS). Biochemical fractionation, super resolution microscopy and electron microscopy all confirm predominant localisation of PDE2A2 at these sites. Our FRET imaging experiments also exclude that a major fraction of PDE2A2 localises at the matrix as the response detected at this site on inhibition of PDEs (both with the non-selective inhibitor IBMX and with the PDE2-selective inhibitor BAY60) using a matrix-targeted reporter is the same in MEFs wt and MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup>. By contrast, both IBMX and BAY60 generate a robust response at the OMM in MEFs wt but no response at this site in MEF<sup>PDE2KO</sup>. Although it is possible that a fraction of PDE2A2 is localised in the matrix in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts we were not able to detect it with any of the approaches we used.</p><p>We would also like to point out that the data presented in Acin-Perez et al., Cell Metab 2009 are not incompatible with localisation of PDE2A at mitochondrial membranes. In that study the evidence that PDE activity is in the matrix is based on an experiment where exogenous cAMP is added to a permeabilised mitoplast preparation with or without addition of the non-selective PDE inhibitor IBMX (Acin-Perez et al. Cell Metab. 9:265, 2009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The first consideration is that the study does not address specifically the role of PDE2A. Therefore, it is possible that another PDE, different from PDE2A2, may localise to the matrix and be responsible for hydrolysis of cAMP. We also observe that, based on the data presented, it is not possible to exclude that the cAMP hydrolysing activity is due to a PDE localised to the IMM facing the IMS (a PDE localised at that site would be present in their preparation). To firmly conclude that the observed mitoplasts cAMP hydrolytic activity is due to a PDE localised in the matrix one would need to assess the effect of IBMX in intact mitoplast and in mitoplasts that have been treated with PK prior to sonication.</p><p>In a subsequent study (Acin-Perez et al. J Biol Chem 286, 2011) the same group addresses directly the submitochondrial localisation of PDE2A2 using a biochemical approach. The key data, (Acin-Perez et al. J Biol Chem 286, 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) in our opinion do not incontrovertibly demonstrate that PDE2A2 is exclusively localised to the mitochondrial matrix for the following reasons: 1) there is a reduction in the PDE2A signal in the intact mitochondrial fraction after treatment with PK. This suggest that a fraction of PDE2A2 is indeed at the OMM; ii) although the PDE2A2 signal persists in the mitoplast preparation after treatment with PK, its intensity is reduced compared to untreated mitoplasts. Notably, the signal for TIM23, a protein that is localised to the IMM facing the IMS, also persists in PK-treated mitoplasts, suggesting that the enzymatic treatment is possibly not completely effective. This, rather than predominant localisation in the matrix, could account for the persistent PDE2A2 signal in the PK-treated mitoplast fraction. Therefore, in our opinion the data presented in that study do not exclude a localisation of PDE2A2 at the IMM facing the IMS.</p><p>Another consideration is that the predominant localisation of PDE2A2 may be different in different cell types. Acin-Perez et al. investigate the role of sAC in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in liver and brain cells, whereas our study is focused on cardiac myocytes and embryonic fibroblasts. It is interesting to note that inhibition of PDE2A results in increased respiration in brain mitochondria (Acin-Perez et al. J Biol Chem 286, 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) whereas our data in primary cardiac myocytes show no effect of BAY60 on oxygen consumption (our study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). It is therefore possible that the distribution of PDE2A2 in different submitochondrial compartments varies in different cell types, possibly resulting in different functional effects.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: […] The new result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> is consistent with their model that PDE2A2 inhibition causes mitochondrial elongation through phosphorylation of Drp1 at S637.

This is reflected in the mitochondria sections captured by EM images, where the length of the IMM largely exceeds that of the OMM. It is therefore to be expected that the number of particles detected at the OMM is significantly smaller than the number found at the IMM. We did perform a more detailed analysis of the number of particles at the OMM and found that this is about 7% of the total. A rough estimation of the particle density per unit of membrane indicates that there is no difference between OMM and IMM. To clarify this point we have now added a sentence to the subsection “Sub-mitochondrial localisation of PDE2A”, including this information.</p></body></sub-article></article>
