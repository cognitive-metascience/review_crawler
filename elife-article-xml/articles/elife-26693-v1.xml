In this study, we combined chemical and genetic perturbants, including the development of a novel selective maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor HTH-01-091, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated MELK knockout, a novel chemical-induced protein degradation strategy, RNA interference and CRISPR interference to validate MELK as a therapeutic target in basal-like breast cancers (BBC). In common culture conditions, we found that small molecule inhibition, genetic deletion, or acute depletion of MELK did not significantly affect cellular growth. This discrepancy to previous findings illuminated selectivity issues of the widely used MELK inhibitor OTSSP167, and potential off-target effects of MELK-targeting short hairpins. The different genetic and chemical tools developed here allow for the identification and validation of any causal roles MELK may play in cancer biology, which will be required to guide future MELK drug discovery efforts. Furthermore, our study provides a general framework for preclinical target validation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MELK</kwd><kwd>basal-like breast cancer</kwd><kwd>OTSSP167</kwd><kwd>HTH-01-091</kwd><kwd>target validation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007886</institution-id><institution>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Accelerator Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Hai-Tsang</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Tinghu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yubao</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jean J</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Nathanael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2196-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckley</surname><given-names>Dennis L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PF-17-010-01-CDD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nabet</surname><given-names>Behnam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibitory or deletion effect of MELK does not impair the proliferation of basal-like breast cancer cell lines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a serine/threonine kinase in the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinase family, and was first identified as a maternal gene in mouse eggs and preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heyer et al., 1997</xref>). In the past decade, multiple studies have reported overexpression of MELK in various cancers, including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2007</xref>), brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>), colorectal, lung and ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of MELK is observed in cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganguly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebbard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), associated with undifferentiated phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>), poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickard et al., 2009</xref>), and chemo and radioresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi and Ku, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Speers et al., 2016</xref>). Despite a strong association with tumorigenesis, little is known about whether MELK plays a causal role in orchestrating these aggressive cancer phenotypes. Nonetheless, studies have shown that MELK may control cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davezac et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2005</xref>) and suppress apoptotic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). Out of all of these potential roles, MELK is best characterized as a mitotic kinase, as its expression pattern highly correlates with other mitotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakano et al., 2005</xref>). At the protein level, MELK is hyperphosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouel et al., 2010</xref>), and reaches its maximal abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2005</xref>) and kinase activity during M phase in both Xenopus embryos and human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davezac et al., 2002</xref>). Upon mitotic exit, MELK is actively degraded and dephosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Among MELK-associated cancers, breast cancer is one of particular interest. MELK-expressing cells enriched from mammary tumors of MMTV-Wnt1/MELK-GFP mice have higher tumor-initiating potential both in vitro and in vivo, which is reversed upon MELK-targeting shRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebbard et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, correlative studies have repeatedly identified MELK expression as a gene signature in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickard et al., 2009</xref>). However, while some groups claimed that MELK overexpression is found in all breast cancers (in comparison to normal tissues), and demonstrated that MELK-targeting siRNA impaired growth in the luminal lines T-47D and MCF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickard et al., 2009</xref>), others claimed that MELK dependence is specific to basal-like breast cancer (BBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">TourÃ© et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The latter argument was postulated based on higher expression of MELK in BBC (in comparison with other subtypes), and supported by subtype-specific toxicity using both shRNA depletion and pharmacological inhibition of MELK. Regardless of the subtype specificity, BBC, which largely overlaps with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is in great need of a clinically tractable therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foulkes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rakha et al., 2008</xref>). As patients with BBC/TNBC face dismal outcome upon chemoresistance, investigation of potential molecular targets, such as MELK, is worthy of attention.</p><p>Due to the potential oncogenic role of MELK, several groups have developed MELK inhibitors to validate its potential as a drug target. Among these, OTSSP167 is the most potent, with subnanomolar activity against MELK and broad-spectrum efficacy in in vitro and in vivo tumor models of various tissue origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2012</xref>); these encouraging preclinical results spurred initiation of a clinical trial of this compound for patients with solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganguly et al., 2014</xref>). However, OTSSP167 is a promiscuous kinase inhibitor, and it is unclear whether its antitumor activity stems from MELK inhibition. Subsequently, two pharmaceutical groups reported the development of MELK inhibitors with much improved selectivity. MELK-T1, the product of a fragment-based drug discovery campaign, exhibits impressive selectivity owing to an atypical carbonyl hinge binder. Based on profiling a panel of 235 kinases, only MELK (IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 37 nM) and Flt3 (IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 18 nM) were significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). Another effort successfully developed several low nanomolar MELK inhibitors based off of a 4-(pyrazol-4-yl)-pyridine scaffold. In particular, NVS-MELK8a (IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 2 nM) exhibited high selectivity with only 7 off-target kinases inhibitedÂ &gt;85% when profiled against 456 kinases at 1 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">TourÃ© et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, MRT199665, a pan-AMPK-related kinase inhibitor, showed reasonable potency against MELK (IC<sub>50</sub>Â =Â 29 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2012</xref>). All of these MELK inhibitors were evaluated in our study.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery of HTH-01-091, a potent and selective MELK inhibitor. We utilized HTH-01-091, published MELK inhibitors, as well as genetic knockout, genetic depletion, and chemical-genetic degradation strategies to study the consequences of loss of MELK function in BBC cell lines. Surprisingly, our results indicate that neither chemical inhibition nor genetic manipulation of MELK in breast cancer cell lines inhibited cell growth in vitro. The discrepancy between our study and previous reports prompted us to uncover selectivity issues of OTSSP167 and potential off-target effects from MELK-targeting short hairpins. The chemical and genetic tools presented in this study will be useful to further elucidate cellular functions of MELK, and represent a general strategy for thorough target validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discovery of lead scaffold and compound optimization for selective MELK inhibition</title><p>Based on biochemical (KINOME<italic>scan</italic>) and cellular (KiNativ) kinase profiling of our in-house library of structurally diverse ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, we identified several chemotypes that were prioritized for further characterization and development.

Thus, we monitored inhibition of these off-target kinases throughout the optimization process. After several iterative rounds of compound synthesis and characterization, we arrived at HTH-01-091, which demonstrated significantly improved selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>HTH-01-091 inhibits MELK with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 10.5 nM, which is comparable to MELK-T1 and NVS-MELK8a in the same enzymatic assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, HTH-01-091 exhibited reduced inhibition of the select off-target kinases by 20- to 140-fold when compared with JW-7-25-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Crystal structures of MELK bound to other inhibitors have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">TourÃ© et al., 2016</xref>). The 2.5 Ã structure of MELK in complex with HTH-01-091 revealed a type I binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The quinoline nitrogen in the tricylic core forms the only hinge interaction with the backbone NH of Cys89. In the deep pocket, the 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl group engages with the catalytic (Lys40) lysine and recruits Glu57 on the Î±C helix. Toward the solvent, the cyclic urea group forms a hydrogen bond with Ile17 in the P-loop. In addition, the cyclohexyl group of HTH-01-091 is sandwiched between Val25 and Leu139 in a nearly orthogonal orientation with respect to the core, while projecting the (dimethylamino)methyl tail into the negatively-charged catalytic pocket made-up by Glu93, Asp150, and Glu136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Many of the corresponding interactions were previously observed in the MELK-OTSSP167 co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the OTSSP167 structure, the cyclohexyl group occupies the active site in a manner that makes greater van der Waals interactions with the P-loop, causing the N-lobe to be in a slightly more closed conformation reflected by the proximity of Phe22 to the carboxyl end of the Î±C helix. This could contribute to the higher binding affinity of OTSSP167 to MELK.</p><p>The MRT199665 structure also revealed a type I binding mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The pyrimidine and aniline nitrogen atoms from the core form dual hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH and carbonyl group of Cys89 in the hinge. Toward the deep pocket, MRT199665 hydrogen bonds with Lys40, while the dimethyl group abuts the gatekeeper L86, promoting a relatively open conformation of the N-lobe. The hydroxy group of the hydroxydihydroindene group forms a hydrogen bond with Glu93, restricting the plane of the indene orthogonoal to the rest of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The indene group is in van der Waals contact with Gly18 and Val25, but intervening residues in the P-loop are largely disordered. These co-crystal structures provide insights on how to further optimize the inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HTH-01-091 is cell permeable and induces MELK degradation</title><p>After confirming HTH-01-091 as a potent MELK inhibitor in biochemical assays, we next investigated whether HTH-01-091 engages MELK in cells.

We treated a panel of breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-468 and ZR-75-1 cells, with HTH-01-091 and other MELK inhibitors; despite our focus on basal-like breast cancers, we included luminal cell lines for comparison. In 3-day proliferation assays, OTSSP167 demonstrated exceptional antiproliferative effects, exhibiting half maximal killing below 100 nM for most cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

Thus, to understand the immediate effect of MELK loss, we employed a novel chemical genetic system (the dTAG system) whereby tagged proteins are targeted for degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon (CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erb et al., 2017</xref>). In this system, mutant FKBP12 (FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>) serves as a degradation tag (dTAG) and is fused to a protein of interest. The F36V mutation introduces a âholeâ in the FKBP12 binding site that accommodates a âbumpâ on the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-binding ligand, which does not effectively bind to wild-type FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clackson et al., 1998</xref>). We synthesized heterobifunctional molecules (dTAG molecules) by conjugating FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> binders to thalidomide, which is a potent ligand for CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>. These molecules bring the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-fusion protein and CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> into close proximity, thus inducing rapid ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the tagged protein while sparing endogenous FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To maintain continuous expression of MELK, we first expressed N-terminally tagged MELK (FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK) in MDA-MB-468 cells, and then deleted endogenous MELK using CRISPR/Cas9. A single point mutation in the protospacer adjacent motif targeted by sgMELK-3 (termed sg3R) prevented CRISPR editing of the transgene encoding FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R). We isolated 24 clones with varying levels of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R) expression and varying endogenous MELK status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

As there is still no tractable target identified in BBC, the finding encouraged a medicinal chemistry campaign to validate the therapeutic potential of MELK inhibition. However, the highly discrepant antiproliferative effects observed between the selective MELK inhibitor HTH-01-091 and the clinical candidate OTSSP167 led us to reexamine whether MELK is necessary for the survival of BBC. To answer this question, we applied and integrated multiple chemical and genetic tools, including selective MELK inhibitors, CRISPR gene editing, a chemical-induced degradation strategy (the dTAG system), RNA interference and CRISPR interference, to understand how a BBC cell line responds to loss of MELK function. Collectively, our efforts led to the conclusion that inhibition or depletion of MELK alone does not impair the proliferation of BBC cell lines in common culture conditions.</p><p>While numerous methods are available for assessing kinase inhibitor selectivity, the potential for additional unexpected off-targets can never be excluded. In addition to HTH-01-091, which exhibits substantially improved kinome selectivity in comparison with OTSSP167, we included MRT199665, NVS-MELK8a and MELK-T1 when we surveyed the proliferative response of a panel of breast cancer cell lines to MELK inhibition. Testing multiple inhibitors derived from diverse chemical scaffolds decreases the chances of chemically perturbing a common off-target, bolstering the robustness of the conclusion drawn. When we observed that three selective MELK inhibitors all showed much poorer antiproliferative effects than OTSSP167, which we recognized as multi-targeted by kinome profiling, we suspected OTSSP167 achieved its effect as a result of polypharmacology. Until recently, little had been done to validate whether the anticancer activity of OTSSP167 originated from MELK inhibition. A study investigating the abrogation of mitotic checkpoint by OTSSP167 illustrated a specific example where inhibition of several mitotic kinases other than MELK contributed to the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, a CRISPR/Cas9-focused study that reached similar conclusions to our study, demonstrated that off-target mechanisms contribute to the anticancer effects of OTSSP167 because WT and MELKâ/â cancer cell lines were similarly sensitive to OTSSP167 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, we found that off-targets also contribute to the weak antiproliferative activities of HTH-01-091 and NVS-MELK8a, underscoring the importance of using genetic methods to examine the outcomes of chemical perturbations. The lack of strong antiproliferative activities of NVS-MELK8a in MDA-MB-468 cells contradicted a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">TourÃ© et al., 2016</xref>), which remains to be understood; cell seeding density and compound renewals are potential reasons for the discrepant antiproliferative responses. In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that MELK inhibition contributes to the efficacy of OTSSP167. While equivalent levels of cell killing by OTSSP167 in a MELK wild-type and a MELK-null background confirmed the presence of off-target effects, an OTSSP167-resistant MELK mutant would be necessary to fully dissect the role of MELK inhibition, which is the gold standard for validating on-target drug action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaelin, 2017</xref>). While OTSSP167 may achieve therapeutic effects through unknown mechanisms, in which MELK may or may not be involved, our data highly discourage using OTSSP167 as a probe to elucidate MELK-dependent pharmacological effects.</p><p>Our ability to isolate MELK-deficient MDA-MB-468 clones edited by the CRISPR/Cas9 system also suggested that MELK might not be necessary for in vitro proliferation. It is possible that alternate pathways readily compensate for the loss of MELK, or that resistance emerged. We inferred that the former case is more likely based on the probability of observing 6 out of 10 isolated clones with MELK deletion. If MELK is a survival dependency that requires resistance events to overcome, we would expect a disproportionate excess of WT MELK clones after the single-cell cloning process.</p><p>However, to truly understand the transient and adaptive response to loss of MELK, we adopted a novel chemical-induced protein degradation strategy known as the dTAG system, which allows rapid control of MELK protein levels. By introducing exogenous FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R) into MDA-MB-468 cells before knockout of endogenous MELK, we ensured that the cells never fully lost MELK expression. After treating these cells with the dTAG molecules to induce acute and sustained degradation of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R), we observed normal growth, which argued against an initial loss of fitness that is rescued over time. One important aspect of this strategy is to ensure that the FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-fusion protein behaves similarly to the endogenous counterpart. Although we were not able to directly test the kinase function of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R) due to a lack of well-validated and specific MELK substrates, we confirmed that FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R) was sensitive to MRT199665-induced degradation and was stabilized and hyperphosphorylated during mitosis, two reliable phenotypes that we and others have observed for endogenous MELK.</p><p>Using the pair of WT and MELKâ/â MDA-MB-468 cells, we found that off-target mechanisms may also contribute to the antiproliferative effects of shMELK-1, 2 and 5. Since the previous study was able to rescue the antiproliferative activity observed for shMELK-2 using an shRNA-resistant MELK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), we postulated that the potential off-target of shMELK-2 might only manifest its effect in the presence of MELK knockdown, a so-called âsynthetic lethalâ interaction. Based on the data, we encourage cautious evaluation of the phenotypes caused by RNAi-mediated MELK knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson and Linsley, 2010</xref>), and further validation of the outcomes using independent experimental approaches such as CRISPR interference. Nevertheless, it is still surprising that three independent MELK-targeting hairpins all led to loss of fitness due to off-target effects. In the future, it may be worthwhile to understand the mechanism by which these hairpins mediate growth defects, and whether it occurred by chance or in a MELK-dependent manner.</p><p>We discovered that drug-induced degradation of MELK is general to the MELK inhibitors tested. While the rate and extent of degradation largely correlated with biochemical potency for MELK inhibition, we noticed that different chemical scaffolds displayed different propensities for inducing degradation. Specifically, the pyrrolopyrimidine MRT199665 induced MELK degradation most efficiently. We postulate that the induced conformation upon binding of MRT199665 is more poised for the degradation response. The inhibitor-induced MELK degradation is unlikely cell-cycle dependent because the cells were not synchronized and we observed unchanging levels of cyclin B1 when MELK level significantly decreased (data not shown). The previous study proposed two possible models for inhibitor-induced MELK degradation: inhibitor-induced modulation of the interaction between MELK and the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone system, and inhibitor stabilizing an active kinase conformation that is associated with a shorter protein half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beke et al., 2015</xref>). These two models are not mutually exclusive and may also relate to how the inhibitor-induced conformation influences auto-phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of MELK by other kinases. The status of MELK phosphorylation has been proposed as a mechanism that regulates its stability during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>MELK likely has complex functions in cells including embryonic development, maintenance of progenitor cell fate, cell cycle regulation, and potentially cancer development. The results of this study suggest that any potential dependence on MELK in cancer is not easily modeled using common cell culture conditions. Another important conclusion is the recognition that none of the tools in our study are perfectly specific, including the selective inhibitors and CRISPR-based technologies. Combined use of genetic, pharmacological and chemical genetic perturbations is required to reach conclusions regarding target dependence. For example, initial excitement generated by OTSSP167 and the effects of short hairpins on the proliferation of BBC cells were not recapitulated using selective MELK inhibitors and CRISPR-based technologies. By confirming that OTSSP167 and the MELK-targeting hairpins present off-target effects that cause growth defects, we deduced that MELK inhibition or depletion alone is not sufficient to impede the growth of BBC cell lines, or at a minimum, of MDA-MB-468 cells. Notably, a missense mutation (heterozygous G20V) in <italic>MELK</italic> in MDA-MB-468 line has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forbes et al., 2017</xref>), which may complicate data interpretation. Therefore, further studies need to be performed in other cancer cell lines. With the current data, we cannot rule out the possibility that MELK may play a crucial role for cancer maintenance in vivo, which would only manifest in more context-dependent assays. Using clonogenic assays, an approach to measure the capability of single cells to grow into colonies, we recently demonstrate that both RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing impair the clonogenic growth of cancer cells, but cause minimal effects on regular cell growth (Wang et al., submitted to eLife). Our results also hinted at potential synthetic lethal relationships between MELK and other targets that are waiting toÂ be explored. We expect that the novel chemical and chemical-genetic tools that we have generated will be useful in search of MELK-dependent biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tissue culture</title><p>MDA-MB-468 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0419">CVCL_0419</ext-link>, ATCC) and MELKâ/â MDA-MB-468 cells were authenticated using small tandem repeat (STR) profiling (DFCI Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Boston).

All oligonucleotides were ordered from IDT (Coralville, Iowa). To construct a Cas9/sgRNA expression system for MELK deletion, we annealed oligonucleotides targeting exon 4 or 5 of the <italic>MELK</italic> gene and directly ligated them with a linearized CRISPR nuclease vector (OFP reporter) from the GeneArt CRISPR nuclease vector kit (A21174, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). For the expression of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK(sg3R), we used a modified pLEX_305 (Addgene #41390) construct that contains a FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-2xHA tag at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erb et al., 2017</xref>). Human MELK or MELK(sg3R) in a pDONR223 vector was cloned into the modified pLEX_305 construct using Gateway cloning (Life Technologies). The mutation in MELK(sg3R) that confers resistance to sgMELK-3 was generated via Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs). To generate doxycycline-inducible shRNA vectors targeting MELK, oligonucleotides selected from the RNAi Consortium shRNA Library or previously reported were annealed, and directly ligated with gel-purified tet-pLKO-puro backbone digested with AgeI and EcoRI. The H1 based doxycycline-inducible sgRNA vector (tet-pLKO-sgRNA-puro) that coexpresses the Tet repressor (TetR) from the hPGK promoter was modified from tet-pLKO-puro (Addgene plasmid # 21915) by replacing the sequences encoding for shRNA with sgRNA. Briefly, a pair of overlapping primers that encodes for an AjuI cloning site and the same sgRNA constant region as in pU6-sgRNA EF1Alpha-puro-T2A-BFP (Addgene plasmid # 60955) was amplified by PCR and digested with AgeI and EcoRI, followed by ligation with tet-pLKO-puro digested with AgeI and EcoRI.

Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS once, collected by scraping and centrifugation, and lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH8.5 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). A micro-BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine the protein concentration of each sample. A total of 1200 Âµg of proteins from each sample was depleted of abundant proteins using two Pierce Top 12 protein depletion spin columns. Eluted proteins were combined, and protein concentration was determined by micro-BCA. Proteins were precipitated on ice for 1 hour with 13% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed twice with acetone, and pellets were allowed to air dry. Proteins were resuspended in 6 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at room temperature for 1 hour, and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 1 hour. Alkylation was quenched with DTT. Urea concentration was reduced to 4 M and proteins were digested with LysC (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 6 hours at 25Â°C.

Modification of tyrosine residue with TMT was reversed by the addition of 5% hydroxyl amine for 15 min at 25Â°C. The reaction was quenched with 0.5% trifluoroactic acid (TFA) and samples were combined at a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Jeffrey Settleman (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin F Cravatt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Huang and co-authors have used several orthogonal approaches to evaluate the role of the MELK kinase in basal breast cancers. Their work extends previously reported findings by several groups indicating that MELK levels are increased in various cancers and that MELK seems to be required in several tested cancer cell lines based on RNAi as well as pharmacologic studies using a small molecule MELK inhibitor that is currently undergoing clinical investigation as an anti-cancer agent.</p><p>The approaches include the discovery and testing of a novel, more selective MELK kinase inhibitor, the use of CRISPR-based targeted gene knockouts of MELK, as well as a so-called &quot;dTAG&quot; method that enabled the acute and selective degradation of ectopically expressed MELK protein via pharmacologic treatment. The manuscript should be of broad interest to readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Overall, this is an exceptionally well executed and well documented study, which highlights the critical caveats associated with oncology target validation and provides an excellent example of the proper approach to validation of novel candidates. The findings convincingly demonstrate with strong likelihood that MELK is not required for the proliferation of the tested cancer cells and that the MELK inhibitor undergoing clinical evaluation is almost certainly not driving any efficacy via effects on MELK. However, a few important points should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The authors make the argument that the observed similar profile of weak (IC50 &gt; 1 Î¼M) anti-proliferative activity of their new MELK inhibitor in isogenic breast cancer cells in which MELK is either WT or CRISPR-deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) supports the conclusion that specific pharmacologic inhibition of MELK does not affect these cells. However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> regarding target engagement make it difficult to determine whether, at concentrations of the inhibitor that &quot;cover&quot; the target, there is sufficient MELK selectivity to support that conclusion.

The findings convincingly demonstrate with strong likelihood that MELK is not required for the proliferation of the tested cancer cells and that the MELK inhibitor undergoing clinical evaluation is almost certainly not driving any efficacy via effects on MELK. However, a few important points should be addressed prior to publication:</p><p>1) The authors make the argument that the observed similar profile of weak (IC50 &gt; 1 Î¼M) anti-proliferative activity of their new MELK inhibitor in isogenic breast cancer cells in which MELK is either WT or CRISPR-deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) supports the conclusion that specific pharmacologic inhibition of MELK does not affect these cells. However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> regarding target engagement make it difficult to determine whether, at concentrations of the inhibitor that &quot;cover&quot; the target, there is sufficient MELK selectivity to support that conclusion. It seems that, between 1 and 10 Î¼M of the inhibitor, there are cell viability effects--which are presumably off-target effects. But this is also the concentration range where MELK seems to be engaged by the inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It would be helpful to include an additional more relevant pharmacodynamic readout of MELK suppression; for example, a change in a phospho-substrate, in order to generate a more robust cellular IC50 for target suppression and to enable a more compelling conclusion about the absence of any detectable effects of MELK inhibition on cell viability. If this is not possible, the authors should at least discuss this caveat regarding the conclusion of this part of the analysis. This discussion should also address what appears to be a substantial &quot;cell shift&quot; in potency of the inhibitor (at least 100-fold).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the proliferation studies with inhibitors of varying degrees of selectivity for MELK do not conclusively demonstrate that inhibition of MELK does not contribute in part to their pharmacological effects. We have therefore removed the statements within the manuscript suggesting we have shown that specific pharmacologic inhibition of MELK does not affect the growth of these cells.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the inhibitors inhibit the proliferation of WT versus MELK-/- cell lines with similar potency, from which we conclude that MELK inhibition is not necessary to observe growth inhibition in the MELK-/- cells. Clearly this does not prove that inhibition of MELK is not important in WT cells and that the dependence on MELK is lost during the process of generating the MELK-/- cell lines. The best experiment to address whether there is a MELK-dependent pharmacological effect in the WT cells would be to perform a ârescueâ experiment by introducing a functional but inhibitor-resistant version of MELK. We used molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to generate a number of MELK mutants but unfortunately were unsuccessful in identifying a mutation that retained WT kinase activity and conferred greater that 50-fold resistance to OTSSP167 and HTH-01-091. We have now included a discussion of this point in the Discussion section.</p><p>The second problem, as pointed out by the reviewers, is that we have not demonstrated selectivity on MELK over other targets inside cells. Indeed, the potency of HTH-01-091 evaluated by the Kinativ target engagement assay fell within the range where the cell viability starts to get affected by the potential off-targets of HTH-01-091. Kinativ target engagement assays may underestimate the potency of reversible inhibitors due to re-equilibration with target kinases after cell lysis and competition with covalent probe labeling. The estimated potency is affected by how inhibitors accumulate in cells, the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>), and the duration of probe labeling. As a result, the cellular potency of HTH-01-091 is possibly greater than suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. However, due to the lack of well-validated pharmacodynamic markers that can be used to specifically evaluate MELK inhibition, we cannot conclude that HTH-01-091 exhibits selectivity for MELK versus other intracellular targets. The complicating factors described above, in addition to high ATP concentrations inside cells, likely contribute to the substantial âcell shiftâ in the potency of the inhibitor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have not demonstrated that the dTAG-MELK fusion retains biological function. While it probably does, in the absence of a formal demonstration of that, it is not possible to use these findings to support a definitive conclusion about the putative lack of adaptive MELK independency based on the negative data that is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Our ability to demonstrate that FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK fusion protein retains the functionality of MELK is unfortunately limited by the absence of a well-validated and unique MELK substrate protein that could serve as a biomarker. As a surrogate, we evaluated what have been the most reliable phenotypes of MELK functionality, namely drug-induced degradation, and stabilization and hyperphosphorylation during mitosis, to demonstrate the relevance of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK.</p><p>We successfully demonstrated that FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK recapitulates both phenotypes, which would suggest that this N-terminally tagged fusion MELK protein reasonably retains the endogenous binding partners and is similarly regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We have included the data in the second paragraph of the section that describes the dTAG system. However, we recognize that this does not definitely demonstrate FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK functions. To account for this deficiency we have now added extensive new experiments where we address the consequence of MELK depletion using CRISPR-interference.</p><p>We tested 8 guide sequences around the transcription start site of MELK for their ability to knockdown MELK in MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing KRAB-dCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We also modified a doxycycline-inducible shRNA vector (tet-pLKO-puro) into an inducible sgRNA vector, so that we can compare the results of CRISPR interference with those of RNA interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We confirmed by both qPCR and Western blotting that the five most effective guide RNAs worked as effectively as shMELK-1, 2 and 5 do after a 2-day doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Even though MELK knockdown with inducible CRISPRi is not as rapid as MELK degradation by the dTAG system (1-2 days vs. hours), we think both systems can adequately capture the immediate and transient response to loss of MELK, if it has an effect on cell proliferation. Based on the results of the five guide RNAs we tested, we found no evidence to support an adaptive MELK independency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While it is great to see proteomic data confirming selective reductions of MELK in the dTAG degrader experiments, the actual magnitude of MELK reduction is very modest (~40%), which contrasts with the apparent complete loss of MELK expression observed by Western blotting (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C and D</xref>). Presumably, this reflects that the proteomic data were acquired after only 1 hour of dTAG probe treatment. But, why was such an early time point selected for proteomic analysis of protein expression? It would have been arguably more interesting to see the proteomic profiles at 12 or 24 h post-dTAG probe treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally selected a short time point of 1 hour because FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK appears significantly degraded by this time point based on our Western blotting results. We agree that we may have learned more things about the system had longer time points been tested; however, the main goal of this experiment was to demonstrate selective FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK depletion using an unbiased, proteome-wide approach. We worried that later time points would be confounded by secondary consequence of MELK protein depletion.</p><p>We also noticed the discrepant levels of MELK knockdown indicated by Western blotting versus by quantitative proteomics. In fact, in the first paper where the dTAG system was described (Erb et al., 2017), similarly, FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-ENL showed around 40% degradation in 3 hours (Erb et al., 2017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) whereas a substantial loss of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-ENL was already observed by an hour (Erb et al., 2017, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, we believe the Western blotting results are representative, and we offer a few possibilities of why quantitative proteomics may underestimate the extent of degradation.</p><p>First, the endogenous protein is knocked out because indels within the gene introduce premature stop codons. A shorter version of the protein or an exon-skipping isoform may still be translated, contributing to MELK-associated peptides. These potential MELK variants unlikely retain kinase activity because sgMELK-3 targets an exon within the kinase domain. Second, multiple peptide species may be present within the cells while FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK is in the process of getting ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. These modified and degraded fusion MELK proteins are unlikely functional, and are undetected by Western Blotting, but may still contribute to certain peptide populations detected by mass spectrometry. Last, five (four unique) MELK peptides identified in the multiplexed proteomic study were used to quantify the relative MELK protein levels collectively. When assessing each peptide individually (Table I), the relative abundance upon the degrader treatment ranged from 92% to 20%. This range of difference illustrates the limitation of quantitative multiplexed proteomics, and may support our hypothesis that certain background MELK peptides exist despite MELK knockdown and FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-MELK depletion. Unfortunately, our data do not support an obvious answer that the N-terminal peptides before the premature stop codon strictly contribute to this issue.</p><p>Table I.
