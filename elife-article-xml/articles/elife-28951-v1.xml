drives asymmetric morphogenesis is unclear. Here, we have quantified shape changes during mouse heart looping, from 3D reconstructions by HREM. In combination with cell labelling and computer simulations, we propose a novel model of heart looping. Buckling, when the cardiac tube grows between fixed poles, is modulated by the progressive breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium. We have identified sequential left-right asymmetries at the poles, which bias the buckling in opposite directions, thus leading to a helical shape. Our predictive model is useful to explore the parameter space generating shape variations. The role of the dorsal mesocardium was validated in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, which recapitulate heart shape changes expected from a persistent dorsal mesocardium. Our computer and quantitative tools provide novel insight into the mechanism of heart looping and the contribution of different factors, beyond the simple description of looping direction. This is relevant to congenital heart defects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28951.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is an organ that pumps blood throughout the body to supply oxygen and to remove carbon dioxide and waste products.

However, left-right patterning of the body is essential for the development of the embryo, and in particular for the formation of visceral organs that are asymmetric. In the case of the heart, the primordium is a tube, which undergoes a process of rightward looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten, 1922</xref>), thereby acquiring a helical shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Männer, 2004</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Männer, 2009</xref>). Heart looping, which is the first morphological sign of bilateral asymmetry during embryonic development, is required for the correct alignment of cardiac chambers and thus for the establishment of the double blood circulation. Abnormal left-right patterning is associated with human diseases referred to as heterotaxy, with an incidence of about 1/10 000, including defects in the lung, spleen, liver, stomach, intestine and also complex cardiac malformations, which will determine the prognosis of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guimier et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments in animal models have provided insight into how left-right patterning is established. The left-right organiser, the node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>), is first detectable in the early embryo, at Embryonic day (E)7.5 in the mouse. Left-right patterning involves a leftward fluid flow, generated by cilia, which initiates a signalling cascade centred on the left determinant Nodal, a secretory protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collignon et al., 1996</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shiratori and Hamada, 2014</xref>). This initial left-right biasing mechanism is important to coordinate the morphogenesis of visceral organs according to the same reference. However, it does not explain why morphogenesis is asymmetrical. For example, in <italic>Nodal</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>), the direction of heart looping is randomised, but the process of looping still takes place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Wolpert (1990</xref>) had hypothesised the existence of an additional mechanism, organ specific, for randomly generating asymmetry. Yet the basis of such a mechanism for the looping of the heart tube has remained enigmatic.</p><p>Formation of the cardiac tube occurs under the head folds, by fusion of two bilateral heart fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rawles and Rawles, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kinder et al., 1999</xref>). Heart precursors are detected in two waves, referred to as the first and second heart fields (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meilhac et al., 2014</xref>). Formation of the cardiac tube, at E8 in the mouse, is initiated on the ventral side such that the heart remains initially attached to the body dorsally, by a tissue referred to as the dorsal mesocardium, which finally breaks down at E9.5. Elongation of the heart tube progresses cranially and caudally by ingression of heart precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stalsberg, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Cruz et al., 1977</xref>) and also by proliferation of cells inside the tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>). Growth of the myocardium inside the tube is coherent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meilhac, 2003</xref>), suggesting that mixing between cells derived from the right and left heart fields is limited. In agreement with this, cell-labelling experiments have shown that left and right heart precursors contribute to specific regions of the mouse heart tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez et al., 2012</xref>) and later, in the fetal heart, to specific veins, atrial regions or specific great arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lescroart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lescroart et al., 2012</xref>). Looping of the tube is concomitant with elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biben and Harvey, 1997</xref>), raising the possibility that the two processes may be linked. Although the general sequence of heart looping has been well studied, the morphological changes of the cardiac tube, particularly in the mammalian embryo, have not been quantified, hindering precise reconstruction of the looping process, as well as description of mutant heart geometries.</p><p>In principle, looping of a tube may result from intrinsic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noël et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) or extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Morales et al., 2015</xref>). In the context of the heart, looping mechanisms have been mainly studied in the chick. Early embryologists made the morphological observation that the elongation of the heart tube is constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">His, 1868</xref>). Measurements indicated that the increase of the tube length is much greater than that of the distance between the attached cranial (arterial) and caudal (venous) ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten, 1922</xref>), leading to the proposal that looping results from a buckling mechanism, when the tube elongates between fixed poles. This mechanism was challenged by explant experiments, showing curvature of isolated heart tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manning and McLachlan, 1990</xref>), thus pointing to intrinsic rather than extrinsic factors for heart looping. A problem with these analyses lies in the definition of heart looping. Explants generated a C-shape tube, but not a helical shape. In addition, surgical disconnection of a single pole (the arterial pole) impaired heart looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kidokoro et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in heart looping have remained unclear. Theoretically, intrinsic factors may contribute to heart looping, for example by differential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manasek et al., 1972</xref>) or oriented deformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Itasaki et al., 1991</xref>). To predict which 3D shape might emerge from a combination of forces, computer simulations are required. Simulations with a Finite Element Analysis model, in combination with experiments in the chick, have shown how intrinsic and local variations in tissue stiffness or growth can influence phases of heart looping: the increase in cell size ventrally can generate the initial ventral bulge of the heart tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soufan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2014a</xref>), whereas increased growth in the left atrial region can bias the direction of heart looping and generate a rightward C-shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kidokoro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voronov et al., 2004</xref>). Whether intrinsic factors are dependent on the Nodal left-right signalling cascade remains undetermined, since <italic>Nodal</italic> is transiently expressed in heart precursors and turned off within the heart tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vincent et al., 2004</xref>), and since the Nodal target <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, which is expressed in the heart tube, is not required for heart looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, the concomitant inflation of cardiac chambers, which is associated with differential growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>), as well as oriented growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Garrec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meilhac et al., 2004</xref>), would interfere with intrinsic factors of heart looping. Therefore, there is currently no convincing demonstration that intrinsic factors are required to produce a helical heart tube shape.</p><p>Rather than computer simulations, mechanical simulations with non-biological material such as rubber tubes have explored the theoretical role of extrinsic factors in a buckling mechanism of heart looping, such as a rotation of the tube poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Männer, 2004</xref>), or tube growth within the confined space of the pericardial cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayraktar and Männer, 2014</xref>). However, removal of the pericardial membrane does not impair heart looping in the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kidokoro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nerurkar et al., 2006</xref>), questioning the role of this confinement. The role in heart looping of another mechanical constraint, the attachment by the dorsal mesocardium, was not taken into account in these simulations. Yet, failure of the dorsal mesocardium to break down has been associated with incomplete heart looping, for example in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hildreth et al., 2009</xref>) or upon inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linask et al., 2005</xref>). A structure analogous to the dorsal mesocardium of the heart tube, the dorsal mesentery, has been shown to be involved in the looping of another tube, the gut, as a result of left-right asymmetries in its cellular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2008</xref>). Left-right asymmetries of the dorsal mesocardium have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linask et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linask et al., 2005</xref>), further pointing to this structure as a potential factor of heart looping.</p><p>Here, we explore further the buckling mechanism and test whether it is sufficient for heart looping. Using the mouse embryo, we have developed a novel procedure to generate qualitative and quantitative datasets of shape changes in 3D of the looping heart, captured by high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM). We provide a novel dynamic 3D computer simulation of heart looping which is based on these data. Our combined modelling and experimental approach shows that asymmetries at the fixed heart poles, generating opposite deformations, associated with the progressive release of the heart tube dorsally, are sufficient to generate looping of a tube growing between fixed poles. Our predictive model is validated in four experimental conditions, using cell labelling, time-lapse imaging and molecular deficiencies. The novel model of heart looping that we propose functions as a generator of asymmetric organ morphogenesis, in the sense of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Wolpert(1990</xref>), able to amplify initial left-right differences between heart precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3D reconstruction of the sequence of heart looping in the mouse embryo</title><p>We investigated the process of heart looping in the mouse embryo, whereas it had been previously mainly studied in the chick. In litters dissected at E8.5, we observed a spectrum of heart shapes, which suggests that heart looping is a rapid process. Theiler stages, which report general embryonic landmarks over the whole gestation, fail to account for the rapid progression of heart looping. We grouped the embryos according to heart shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To order them, we used two criteria. The heart tube is known to elongate by ingression of heart precursors at both the cranial, arterial, pole and the caudal, venous, pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zaffran et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the addition of novel heart regions was taken as an indication of later stages. The cranial addition of the right ventricle and the extension of the outflow tract were particularly striking. Heart looping is also known to correspond to a repositioning of the right ventricle, from an initial cranial to a final right position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Cruz, 1998</xref>). Thus, the position of the right ventricle relative to the left ventricle was taken as another sign of the progression of heart looping. The resulting sequence parallels the addition of somites. However, we found, as others previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaufman and Navaratnam, 1981</xref>), that heart development was not strictly synchronous with somitogenesis. We propose a novel staging system of early heart development, based on the shape of the heart tube. At E8.5c, the cardiac crescent is visible but the bilateral heart fields have not fused. At E8.5d, the right and left heart fields, adjacent at the midline, bulge separately within the cardiac crescent. At E8.5e, the bilateral heart fields have fused, with a visible midline furrow. They form a primitive left ventricle, which bulges ventrally, with the venous and arterial poles caudal and cranial respectively. This corresponds to the initial cardiac tube, taking the shape of an inverted Y, as the venous pole remains bilateral. At E8.5f, a right ventricular region appears cranially and the tube still appears bilaterally symmetrical. At E8.5g, the first external sign of left-right asymmetry occurs, with the tilting of the tube axis. At E8.5h, the outflow region starts to extend, resulting in a more variable curved heart shape. At E8.5i, the looped tube is clearly detectable; however, the right ventricle has not yet reached its right position. The right ventricle-left ventricle axis does not parallel the embryonic right-left axis. At E8.5j, the right ventricle has reached its final position such that the right ventricle-left ventricle axis tends to be perpendicular to the cranio-caudal axis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28951.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stages depicting the progression of heart looping in the mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of shape changes during the formation and looping of the heart tube (orange) in the E8.5 mouse embryo.

These measures are consistent with the buckling mechanism initially proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten (1922)</xref>.</p><p>To evaluate the shapes that can be generated by a buckling mechanism, we designed a finite element computer model, based on the GPT framework previously used to model flower shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>). The model, in which the growing tissue is simulated as a continuous sheet of material, can capture tissue deformations at a large scale with a reduced number of arbitrary parameters, compared to cell-based simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osborne et al., 2017</xref>). Tissue deformation depends on the regional growth patterns, modulated in rate and orientation, which are the input parameters of the model. It also depends on the mechanical constraint of maintaining a continuous sheet of tissue elements. In the absence of any asymmetry, the simulation of a tube growing between fixed poles did not lead to buckling, but to a wider tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When we introduced a small left-right bias (burst of 5% increase in growth at one pole), which would correspond to stochastic, naturally occurring, left-right variations, the tube was able to curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The buckling mechanism is thus able to generate asymmetric morphogenesis by amplifying small left-right variations. However, in this minimal hypothesis, the tube acquired a C-shape. Therefore, a buckling mechanism is insufficient to account for the biological helical shape of the looped heart tube. This prompted us to further analyse mouse hearts, to quantify left-right asymmetries, as well as additional mechanical constraints.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dynamics of the mechanical constraint from the dorsal mesocardium</title><p>The heart tube is initially attached dorsally to the body via the dorsal mesocardium. From a mechanical point of view, this may hinder heart looping. We analysed the dynamics of the dorsal mesocardium in our 3D reconstructions. We observed it in serial embryonic sections acquired by HREM and found variations in its lateral thickness along the cranio-caudal axis and between stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Thus, we quantified the thickness of the dorsal mesocardium from the arterial to the venous pole at different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The dorsal mesocardium was at least 94 ± 50 µm (n = 3) thick at E8.5e and got thinner to a minimum of 28 ± 13 µm (n = 3 per stage) between E8.5f and E8.5h, corresponding to about two cells. Breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium was detectable from E8.5i, in the arterial half of the tube and progressed towards the venous pole at E8.5j (see thick lines below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Before breaking down, the dorsal mesocardium appeared elongated on the dorsal/ventral axis, at E8.5g and E8.5h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>), suggesting stretching of the tissue. The distance to the foregut was higher in the arterial half of the tube, where breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium was initiated. In contrast, the dorsal mesocardium displayed homogenous characteristics in the venous half between E8.5f and E8.5i. Thus, a clear boundary was apparent between the arterial and venous halves of the tube (position 90, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>).

Thus, we examined early left-right asymmetries during the formation of the heart tube. The E8.5f stage, corresponding to the straight heart tube, had always been considered as a stage of bilateral symmetry, as seen externally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the chick heart tube undergoes a rightward rotation between stages HH10 and 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Cruz et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Cruz, 1998</xref>).

We quantified this asymmetry, by measuring the right and left angles between the heart tube and the dorsal pericardial wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

At E8.5f, this asymmetry was specific to the arterial pole (Student test, p&lt;0.001) and not significant in the venous half of the tube (p&gt;0.40). We estimated, at E8.5f in the mouse, that the rotation is in the order of 25° (inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In addition, the dorsal mesocardium was simulated by constraints along two vertical lines dorsally, restricting displacement in the dorso-ventral (y) and cranio-caudal (z) axes. The breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium was simulated by a progressive release of this constraint, starting from the nodes at mid-length of the tube and progressing towards the poles. The orientation of growth was defined relative to the tube, accompanying its deformation, and not relative to embryonic axes. Longitudinal growth parallels the axis of the tube, whereas circumferential growth is perpendicular. Longitudinal growth was implemented with a baseline value accounting for the observed lengthening of the tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and with an initial ventral increase to reproduce the ventral bulge of the cardiac tube.

The venous pole asymmetry is simulated as a burst of growth (red dot). Its position is shown relative to the dorsal mesocardium (position 0°, with the left at 90°). The intensity of the burst is defined as a growth increase with the indicated fold difference relative to the opposite side.

The burst of growth at the venous pole may vary in its position or intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Computer simulations show that there is a narrow window, in which a helical tube shape can be generated. This corresponds to a burst of longitudinal growth located on the right side, that is generating an opposite deformation to the arterial pole, and a burst intensity defined by the ratio of right over left growth around 2.8-fold. Outside this window, the tube has a flat S shape (in case of a burst on the same position, but with a higher fold difference), or most frequently a C shape. Reversal of the rotation at the arterial pole (leftward), combined with a reversed position of the burst at the venous pole, creates mirror images. We also tested how the intensities of asymmetries at the arterial and venous poles are combined to shape the heart tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Computer simulations indicate that the intensities of asymmetries at the arterial and venous poles have to be proportional to generate a helical shape. The helix becomes flatter, that is S-shape, when the intensity of asymmetry increases (red dotted diagonal). Such flat S-shapes are also generated close to the window of parameter space corresponding to the helix, whereas C-shapes are observed otherwise. These analyses show that the regulation of the position and intensity of left-right asymmetries at the poles of the heart can greatly influence the shape of the looped heart tube.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Experimental validation of the rotation of the arterial pole</title><p>Computer simulations indicate that acquisition of a helical heart tube requires opposite deformations from the arterial and venous poles. However, mechanistically, computer simulations of heart looping are compatible with either a rightward rotation of the arterial pole, or a burst of growth on the left side, similar (but opposite) to that observed at the venous pole. The computer model can be used to raise predictions and distinguish these cases. In case of a burst of growth at the arterial pole, the model predicts that the initial ventral line of the tube would remain ventral at the end of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas it would shift to the right in case of a rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). To test these predictions experimentally, we injected DiI at the most cranial ventral midline, at E8.5e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>) and E8.5f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>), that is, before or during the stage when we first observed left-right asymmetry at the arterial pole. After 24 hr of culture, in the looped heart, the label was clearly located on the right side. In addition, we performed time-lapse imaging of mouse embryos at the beginning of heart looping, using inducible reporter lines to better track cell movement in a mosaic tissue. We generated two independent movies, in which a cell could be tracked at the arterial pole between E8.5e/f and E8.5g.

The direction of the loop was found normally rightward (n = 5/5 at E8.5, 6/6 at E9.5) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, heart looping was severely impaired in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). When we measured the tube length, we found that <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants have a significantly shorter heart tube, compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Lengthening of the tube is not arrested, as the increase in the length of the heart tube relative to the number of somites follows a linear regression, with a slope not significantly different from that of control samples. This suggests that defects in heart looping in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants are not the result of overall reduced growth. In contrast, our computer simulations show that persistence of the dorsal mesocardium constrains the longitudinal growth of the heart tube, such that enlargement of the tube is observed to account for the same amount of overall tissue growth. Thus, we measured the perimeter of the heart tube in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants and found a significant 1.2-fold increase compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>, Student test, p=0.03). The overall area of the heart tube did not change significantly between mutants and controls (0.56 ± 0.12 mm<sup>2</sup> and 0.55 ± 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, n = 5 and 5, Student test, p=0.75), further showing that there is no overall growth defects in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts. We also confirmed that the distance between the poles is not significantly changed in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts (121 ± 15 µm, compared to 132 ± 17 µm in controls, n = 5 and 5, p=0.31, Student test). Finally, computer simulations predict that persistence of the dorsal mesocardium constrains the curvature of the tube axis in the transverse plane. This prediction is validated in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts, in which we observed a narrower curvature of the tube axis in the transverse plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H–J</xref>). Alternatively, we tested whether the shape of <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts could be explained by impairment of left-right signalling: a reduction by 50% of left-right asymmetries would account for the malposition of the right ventricle, but not for the changes in length and the narrow helix (see transverse sector) of the heart tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). In summary, there is a discrepancy between the real shape of <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts and the simulated shape in case of reduced left-right signalling. In contrast, there is a good match between the shape of <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant hearts and the simulated shape in case of persistent dorsal mesocardium, both qualitatively and quantitatively for the change of values of four geometrical parameters.</p><p>Another case of dorsal mesocardium persistence, without manipulating Shh, was analysed. In the chick, failure of dorsal mesocardium breakdown associated with incomplete heart looping was reported upon inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linask et al., 2005</xref>). We investigated whether this is the case in the mouse. We detected expression of Mmp2 in the foregut of the mouse at the beginning of heart looping (E8.5g), with vesicular localisations in the cardiac region, suggesting secretion of Mmp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). To test the role of Mmp, we used GM6001, a broad-spectrum Mmp inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shichi et al., 2011</xref>), in cultures of mouse embryos at E8.5d-e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). After 10 hr of culture, the embryos reached stage E8.5h-i in the control situation (DMSO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Whereas all control embryos (3/3) displayed a broken down dorsal mesocardium, this concerned only 2/4 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D–E</xref>). Dorsal mesocardium breakdown was detected over a maximum length of 8 µm (3/4) upon GM6001 treatment, which is much less than a breakdown over 23–125 µm in control cultures (3/3). In this situation again, persistence of the dorsal mesocardium was associated with incomplete heart looping. After 24 hr of culture, the right ventricle failed in most cases (7/9) to reach a right position relative to the left ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>), leading to a tube shape similar to that predicted by the computer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Taken together, our analyses combining two experimental conditions and computer modelling highlight the important role of the dorsal mesocardium in heart looping.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28951.024</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Matrix metalloproteases are required for dorsal mesocardium breakdown and heart looping.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of Mmp2, showing expression in the foregut (fg) at E8.5g, and vesicular localisations in the cardiac region (arrowheads in A1), but not in the neural tube (nt, <bold>A2</bold>).

We provide novel tools to quantify the progression of heart looping and analyse the 3D shape. In addition, we have characterised the spatio-temporal sequence of mechanical constraints during looping, including the elongation of the tube, the distance between the poles and the breakdown of the dorsal attachment. With additional left-right asymmetries uncovered at the arterial and venous poles, we propose a novel predictive model of heart looping.</p><p>Our staging system extends that proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biben and Harvey, 1997</xref>). LS-0 is equivalent to E8.5e/f, when the tube axis parallels the cranio-caudal axis. LS-I is equivalent to E8.5g, when the initial tilting of the tube axis is detected, and the venous pole is displaced leftward. Although we did not use the atrioventricular sulcus as a marker of staging, it can be monitored from our 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), showing that LS-II is equivalent to E8.5g/h. LS-III, which corresponds to ventricular looping, is equivalent to E8.5h-j. We now provide 3D reconstructions and quantitative spatio-temporal measures to assist staging of a continuous process. Several geometrical parameters can be used to assess the progression of heart looping, such as the length of the heart tube, the right ventricle/left ventricle orientation, the rotation of the arterial pole, the position of the venous pole, the extent and localisation of the dorsal mesocardium breakdown. These tools will be instrumental to analyse defects of heart looping beyond the simple description of looping direction, as reported previously in mutant embryos. Our model of heart looping predicts that defects in left-right patterning not only result in impaired direction of heart looping, but also in different shapes, from C-shapes to flat S-shapes. Our tools open novel avenues to study heart looping defects with a greater precision and thus, to better understand the mechanism of looping and the respective contribution of different factors.</p><p>Our model, which is based on analyses in the mouse, could potentially be applied to heart looping in other species. In the mouse, we show that the distance between the poles of the tube is fixed, whereas the tube length increases 4.4-fold during the process of looping. We detect a rightward rotation of the arterial pole, which precedes a leftward displacement and deformation of the venous pole. These features are conserved between chick and mouse, despite variations in the morphological sequence of heart looping. The distance between the poles of the chick heart tube has long been reported to be fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten, 1922</xref>). However, the value is higher in the chick (600–800 µm) compared to the mouse (100–200 µm), and thus, a straight heart tube is more obvious in the chick. The fold increase in the heart tube length is comparable in the chick and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten, 1922</xref>). A rightward rotation of the ventricular region in the chick was shown by labelling with iron oxide particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Cruz et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Cruz, 1998</xref>), preceding the leftward displacement of the venous pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kidokoro et al., 2008</xref>). This is compatible with mechanical simulations showing that opposite and sequential rotations of the heart poles are sufficient to generate a helical tube shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Männer, 2004</xref>). These simulations postulated a 90° rotation, in agreement with the displacement of iron oxide particles in the outer curvature of the chick heart. However, we have measured a 25° rotation of the arterial pole in the mouse. This could be a species difference, because the C-shape of the chick heart tube observed at stage HH12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de la Cruz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Männer, 2000</xref>) has no equivalent in the mouse. Alternatively, it is possible that confinement in the pericardial cavity increases the apparent rotation of the outer curvature of the heart, generating a transient C-shape heart tube in the chick. This is supported by the reduced displacement of the outer curvature upon removal of the pericardial membrane (splanchnopleura) in the chick, with no consequence for heart looping in the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Voronov and Taber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nerurkar et al., 2006</xref>). Rotation of the arterial pole in the chick would need to be measured with the same approach as described here, that is the angle between the heart tube and the dorsal pericardial wall. At the venous pole of the mouse, we do not detect a significant leftward rotation, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Männer, 2004</xref>, but rather an asymmetric ingression and proliferation of heart precursors, in favour of right cells. This is in keeping with the increased size of the right atrium compared to the left at E8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meilhac et al., 2004</xref>). Cell labelling experiments in the posterior second heart field at E8.5 showed that right cells contribute not only to the right atrium, but also to the ventral aspect of the left atrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez et al., 2012</xref>), indicating a wider deployment of right cells in the mouse. An asymmetric ingression of heart precursors, in favour of right cells, has also been observed in the chick by grafting experiments at the beginning of heart looping (HH10, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stalsberg, 1969</xref>). These similarities suggest that our model would also apply to the chick embryo, so that the mechanism of heart looping may be conserved in amniotes. In the zebrafish, formation of the heart tube follows a different morphogenetic process, involving the formation of a cone, which telescopes out to form a tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stainier et al., 1993</xref>). The looped heart tube in the zebrafish is a flat-S, distinct from the helix in chick and mouse. The fish tube does not grow between fixed poles, has no equivalent of the dorsal mesocardium, and looping was shown to depend on intrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noël et al., 2013</xref>), thus ruling out a buckling mechanism. However, left-right asymmetry of the zebrafish heart tube is first seen at the venous pole, with a leftward displacement of the atrial region referred to as cardiac jogging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1997</xref>), resulting from asymmetric migration and involution of cells in the cardiac cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rohr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). It is about a day later that the ventricle, at the arterial pole, bends rightward, in a process referred to as cardiac looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stainier et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, as in chick and mouse, opposite and sequential deformations occur at the poles of the zebrafish heart tube. However, the order is reversed, with a venous pole displacement first in fish, whereas it is the arterial pole deformation first in amniotes. Further analyses of the molecular pathways and cell behaviour underlying asymmetric heart morphogenesis in different animal models will be essential to further assess the degree of conservation of the looping mechanism in vertebrates.</p><p>The molecular and cellular mechanism of heart looping in amniotes remains poorly understood. Left-right asymmetric cell proliferation, in favour of right cells and depending on the Nodal target <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, has been observed in the sinus venosus of the mouse at the seven somite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galli et al., 2008</xref>). We extend the observation of asymmetric proliferation to precursor cells of the second heart field, indicating a potential mechanism for the asymmetric cell ingression that we have observed in the venous pole at E8.5g. The rotation of the arterial pole that we detect in the early heart tube at E8.5f, precedes the well-known rotation of the outflow tract, observed with transgenic markers from E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajolle et al., 2006</xref>) and the later spiralling of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. It is possible that a continuous process of rightward rotation at the arterial pole takes place throughout heart morphogenesis. However, we can only speculate about its mechanism, by homology with other examples of asymmetric tubular morphogenesis: movements of myocardial cells in the zebrafish result in a rotation of the cardiac cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rohr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2008</xref>), tilting of the gut tube in the mouse depends on asymmetries in the cellular architecture of the dorsal mesentery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2008</xref>), and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rotation of the hindgut or genitalia is associated with the chiral activity of an atypical myosin, Myo1D, in an organiser tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Morales et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spéder et al., 2006</xref>). The asymmetric (right &gt; left) proliferation of precursor cells was observed also in the anterior domain of the second heart field, suggesting potential modulation of the arterial pole deformation at E8.5g. This will require further analysis. Breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium was shown, in the chick, not to be associated with apoptosis, but rather to depend on the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linask et al., 2005</xref>). This is in agreement with our mouse embryo cultures treated with the inhibitor GM6001 and suggests a mechanism of degradation of the extra-cellular matrix. Our quantification of the breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium, as well as of the tube rotation, uncovers a sharp boundary between the arterial and venous halves of the mouse cardiac tube at E8.5. This is in keeping with the regionalisation of the second heart field, lying in the dorsal pericardial wall, into anterior and posterior domains. Such regionalisation has been characterised later, at E9.5, based on epithelial markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francou et al., 2014</xref>) and differential gene expression, for example of the transcription factors Tbx1 and Tbx5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rana et al., 2014</xref>). Our results highlight an earlier stage of this boundary, which would provide a context for the differential left-right asymmetries that we observe at the poles of the heart, leading to opposite deformations (rightward at the arterial pole and leftward at the venous pole). Thus, heart looping integrates both left-right and anterior-posterior patterning.</p><p>Our work identifies Shh as an upstream regulator of the breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium. Hh signalling was shown to be required in the lateral plate mesoderm for the establishment of left-right patterning. However, in this context, Shh and Ihh ligands are redundant, so that it is only in the double mutant of the ligands (<italic>Shh<sup>flox/-</sup>; Ihh<sup>flox/-</sup>; Sox2-Cre</italic>) or in the mutant of the receptor (<italic>Smo<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) that left markers are absent in the lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsiairis and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Shh is also required for the formation of the floorplate, which functions as a barrier for the maintenance of left-right asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyers and Martin, 1999</xref>). In <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, <italic>Nodal</italic> expression is initiated correctly, whereas the downstream target <italic>Pitx2</italic> is bilaterally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hildreth et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyers and Martin, 1999</xref>). This is in agreement with our observation that the incomplete looping of <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants was biased correctly towards the right side, as also previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsukui et al., 1999</xref>), and distinct from cases of bilateral <italic>Nodal</italic> expression leading to a randomised looping direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murray and Gridley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Izraeli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furtado et al., 2008</xref>). From these data, we conclude that left-right patterning is not disrupted initially in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants. Our simulations with reduced left-right signalling fail to reproduce the heart shape observed in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants. Shh has been shown to regulate cell differentiation in the second heart field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goddeeris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>), thus affecting the growth of the heart. However, during looping, we have not detected any significant change in the heart growth of <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, indicating that looping defects are not related to defective growth. The good quantitative match between our computer simulations and mutant shapes rather show that heart looping defects in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants recapitulate that expected from a persistent dorsal mesocardium. This is reinforced by the observation of similar looping defects associated with dorsal mesocardium persistence in another experimental condition, upon matrix metalloproteinase inhibition.</p><p>Our model of heart looping extends the buckling mechanism, theoretically proposed by early embryologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patten, 1922</xref>) and tested mechanically with non-biological materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Männer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayraktar and Männer, 2014</xref>). We now integrate another mechanical constraint, the dorsal mesocardium, as well as left-right asymmetries taken from biological observations. The direction of the buckling is biased by left-right asymmetries, whereas the degree of buckling depends on the forces applied at the ends, i.e. the magnitude of growth of the heart tube, and restriction from the dorsal mesocardium. The importance of growth of the cardiac tube, as a pre-requisite for the buckling, is supported experimentally by the looping defects observed in mouse mutants with reduced ingression of heart progenitors, when the cardiomyocyte differentiation cascade is affected (see mutants for <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lyons et al., 1995</xref>], <italic>Mef2c</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 1997</xref>], <italic>Isl1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>], <italic>Tbx20</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stennard et al., 2005</xref>] or <italic>Tbx3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ribeiro et al., 2007</xref>]). The spatio-temporal sequence of breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium, relative to the growth and asymmetries of the heart tube, appears, in our computer model, as an important determinant of embryonic heart shape. This is supported by our analysis of heart looping defects in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants or GM6001-treated embryos, in which the dorsal mesocardium is persistent. Our computer simulations also show that left-right asymmetries extrinsic to the heart tube, that is in heart precursors, are sufficient for heart looping. This suggests that intrinsic asymmetries, such as complex growth gradients or growth orientations within the heart tube may be largely dispensable for heart looping. This is in agreement with current knowledge of left-right patterning of cardiac cells. Expression of the major left determinant Nodal is detected in heart precursors, and not within the heart tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collignon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vincent et al., 2004</xref>), whereas the Nodal target <italic>Pitx2c</italic>, which is expressed in the heart tube, is not required for heart looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 1999</xref>). Our computer simulations show that the position and intensities of left-right asymmetries at the poles of the heart greatly influence heart shape. Thus, our model provides a mechanism for a generator of asymmetric morphogenesis, specific to the heart, able to amplify variations in left-right patterning. The existence of such a mechanism had been postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Wolpert (1990)</xref> as an important element of left-right patterning, in which asymmetric morphogenesis is local, and can be uncoupled from a global left-right biasing mechanism coordinating the position of different organs according to the same reference. This elegant model of left-right patterning is supported by the observation that in the absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>) or in case of bilateral expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murray and Gridley, 2006</xref>) of the left determinant Nodal, the process of asymmetric morphogenesis still takes place, that is, the heart does not remain symmetrical and some heart looping occurs, with a random orientation, probably due to stochastic and spontaneous left-right variations. Our computer simulations indeed show that the heart would only remain straight if there was a complete absence of asymmetry, a very unlikely situation in a noisy biological context. Simulations with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) predict that very small localised differences in growth rate (in the order of 1%) will lead to significant buckling. The curvature is stronger with a progressive breakdown of a dorsal attachment than without (data not shown). The parameter space of left-right asymmetries compatible with the helix shape observed in vivo is narrow. A tight coordination between the intensities and positions of left-right asymmetry at either pole is required.</p><p>The looping mechanism that we propose for the heart tube shares similarities with that proposed for the looping of the embryonic gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis et al., 2008</xref>). Left-right cellular asymmetries in the dorsal mesentery have been uncovered, with elegant cell-based computer simulations showing that this is sufficient to generate a leftward tilt of the gut. However, looping of the midgut is more than a tilting. Generation of a S-shape for the midgut has been proposed to depend on a buckling mechanism. Yet, the growth of the tube between fixed poles, and the opposite left-right deformation at the anterior pole have not been quantified. The similarities in the gut and heart raise the possibility of a common framework for the asymmetric morphogenesis of tubular organs. Our model at the tissue level will be generally useful to predict which tubular shape emerges from a given combination of mechanical constraints and left-right asymmetries. Together with the image analysis tools that we have developed to quantify the shape of the heart tube, it will now be possible to explore, in various experimental conditions, the parameter space in vivo and decipher the molecular and cellular determinants of asymmetric tubular morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</bold></th><th><bold>Designation</bold></th><th><bold>Source or reference</bold></th><th><bold>Identifiers</bold></th><th><bold>Additional information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus)</td><td>wild-type, Swiss background</td><td>Janvier</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus)</td><td>wild-type, C57Bl6 background</td><td>Janvier</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus)</td><td>T4nLacZ, Swiss background</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biben et al.

The notochord was similarly segmented to serve as a reference longitudinal axis. 3D visualisation was produced with ICY (Institut Pasteur, Paris) for raw images, and with Blender (Blender Foundation, Netherlands) or DAZ Studio (Daz Productions Inc.) for segmented images. 3D PDF files were built with Acrobat Pro (Adobe Systems Inc.) after exporting the Imaris file in WRL format, and conversion into a U3D format with Meshlab (Visual Computing Lab).</p><p>The axis of the cardiac tube was reconstructed from the Imaris surface, using the Oblique Slicer function to intersect the tube perpendicularly, proceeding along its length. On each slice the polygon outlining the myocardium was drawn. The centroids of the successive polygons were computed with Matlab (geom3d library), and the 3D line exported in X3D format (figure2xhtml function). The X3D file was then imported in Blender and superimposed on the segmented myocardium. To quantify the average perimeter of the heart tube, 10 polygons, evenly distributed along the length, were selected and the perimeters of theoretical circular discs of the same area were taken as values. The tranverse sector, in which the tube axis is inscribed, was obtained after rotating the 3D line to superimpose the two extremities of the axis. The sector angle was measured from this view.</p><p>The orientation of the right ventricle–left ventricle axis was similarly obtained by intersection of the Imaris surface at the level of the interventricular sulcus. The polygon outlining the myocardium was drawn and its centroid computed. The axis was defined as the line perpendicular to this polygon. It was projected on the frontal plane, taken as perpendicular to the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo. The orientation was measured as the angle between this projection and the notochord axis.</p><p>The thickness and the dorso-ventral elongation of the dorsal mesocardium, the positions of its ventral and dorsal aspects, as well as the angle between the heart tube and the dorsal pericardial wall, were measured in transverse sections, after aligning the HREM cubic images on the notochord axis with the ICY software (StackRotationByAngle plugin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mouse embryo culture</title><p>E8.5 embryos from wild-type [Swiss] mice, or from the T4-nlacZ [Swiss] transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biben et al., 1996</xref>) were collected, transferred to Hank’s solution and labelled by injection of a lipophilic carbocyanine (Interchim, France) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez et al., 2012</xref>). Symmetrical dye injections were done at the right and left venous pole of the embryo using DiO and DiI to distinguish them. Injections at the most cranial midline of the heart tube were performed using DiI. Injected embryos were photographed using a Nikon Digital Sight DS-L1 camera system and a Nikon C-DSS230 stereomicroscope and, then, cultured for 24 hr in 75% rat serum, 25% T6 medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whittingham, 1971</xref>), with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, 90% N<sub>2</sub> in rolling bottles in a precision incubator (BTC Engineering, Milton, Cambridge, UK).

The heart tube is represented as a cylindrical mesh, made of 938 nodes and 1800 finite elements, with two outside and inside surfaces and a thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At each successive step during a simulation, each element is deformed according to a growth tensor field specified from the hypotheses of the model. The constraint of continuity of the tissue implies that the resulting growth is different from the input growth, this difference giving rise to residual strain. The output shape of the simulations is computed by minimising the energy derived from this residual strain, under the assumption of linear elasticity (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>] for a detailed presentation and discussion of this modeling framework and its numerical implementation).</p><p>The simulations of a tube growing between fixed poles, in a minimal hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>), were generated with the MATLAB code provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>.</p><p>In a more refined model, the dorsal mesocardium was simulated as a displacement constraint on a set of nodes situated along two vertical lines on the dorsal side of the tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These nodes are not allowed any displacement along the y and z axes (the axes along which a thin beam would strongly resist deformation). This constraint is released to simulate breakdown of the dorsal mesocardium. The fixed distance between the two poles is implemented by forbidding any displacement along the z axis for the nodes situated at both extremities of the tube.</p><p>The local orientation of growth is defined relative to a reference axis of the tube, called the polarizer axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), so that growth in any region may be defined by two components: longitudinal growth along the direction of the polarizer, and circumferential growth in a direction tangent to the surface of the tube and perpendicular to the direction of the polarizer. The direction of the polarizer is defined by the gradient of a morphogen diffusing from the venous pole towards the arterial pole, and thus represents the axis of the tube, which changes in direction and curvature over the course of the simulation.</p><p>The first 10 steps of the simulation are required to set up initial conditions, and establish the gradients that are used to define the polarizer as well as regions of the tube (right and left ventricles, venous, arterial, ventral, left regions), and thus smoothen the growth profile.</p><p>The six input parameters of growth were set as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The basic longitudinal growth, active in every element of the tube, was set in order to obtain a 2.6-fold increase in the total length of the tube at the end of the simulation, as observed biologically between stages E8.5f and E8.5i (from 243 ± 62 µm to 638 ± 57 µm <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The authors have used high resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) with 3D reconstruction to describe heart morphogenesis with a specific emphasis on the heart looping process. Using these 3D reconstructions the authors have quantified geometrical parameters of the developing heart. The authors have quantified where and when the mesocardium is broken down. Furthermore they describe when left-right asymmetries in the position of the heart tube could be observed. Based on these observations a mathematical model of the heart tube was reconstructed. In the model the observed arterial rotation, asymmetric cell addition at the venous pole and the breakdown of the mesocardium were implicated and their effects on heart morphogenesis were tested. From the modelling the authors conclude that all three aspects are required to form a helical heart tube. The prediction that the mesocardium break down is required for normal looping morphogenesis was validated in <italic>shh</italic> mutant mice, in which breakdown of the mesocardium was impaired as well as heart looping.</p><p>The topic of heart looping is of high interest because of the complexity of the process and the significance to congenital heart defects. The authors provide detailed descriptions of the process and use these to build a mathematical model that can be used to test hypothesis. This is an excellent, scholastic and well-written study that is likely to be a seminal paper in the field. The work contextualises disparate and sometimes perplexing findings such as randomisation of looping in the face of mutation of LR pathway genes, and the long-standing hypothesis of Brown and Wolpert 1990 that posits global and local determinants of organ LR morphogenesis.</p><p>However, there are some important issues to address.</p><p>Major Issues to be addressed:</p><p>1) Rotation of the arterial pole (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Please comment.</p><p>4) Related to results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Results of the dye injections and their interpretation are confusing. a) The authors describe that they label both the right and left side of the mesoderm that will contribute to the heart tube. They score the embryos 24 hours after dye injection based on the distribution of the dyes in the heart tube. If only one of the labels sides contribute to the heart the result is scored as either right or left, and if no difference is observed they score these embryos as both left and right. Instead of showing the bar graph the authors should show the data in a table and include the three categories (instead of only showing two categories in the graph). It makes a difference whether the embryos labelled at E8.5g and scored as left were actually L&gt;R or L=R. b) The observed asymmetric contribution from the right side was only observed in embryos labelled at E8.5g, at which stage the heart tube already shows asymmetric morphology. It seems very unlikely that this asymmetric contribution is the cause of the observed asymmetric morphology, as claimed by the authors, but rather is a consequence. c) In a previous study by Galli et al. (cited by the authors) a similar LR difference in cardiac contribution at the venous pole was described. It is unclear what the new data adds to this previous study</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> the authors compare rotation of the arterial pole with asymmetric growth. The computer simulations for both these processes show a slight difference in the position of the ventral wall of the arteria pole. The authors use dye labelling of the ventral wall to look at this shift. The authors claim that they have observed a right-ward shift of the dye, but it is difficult to appreciate this shift in the static photographs. A more sensitive or dynamic technique, such as time-lapse imaging, should be used to address this. In addition, the authors have not addressed a possible mechanism that could cause this rotation, if it is not due to asymmetric growth.</p><p>6) The authors have used the <italic>shh</italic> mutant mouse model to validate the model's prediction about the role for the breakdown of the mesocardium. The question here is whether the <italic>shh</italic> mutant is the proper genetic model to do so. Besides the reduced breakdown of the mesocardium, <italic>shh</italic> mutant embryos have other phenotypes such as left-right patterning defects (PMID: 10500184)). In addition, <italic>Shh</italic> signalling is important for atrial septation due to its role in migration of cells from the second heart field (PMID: 19369393; PMID: 22898775). The authors try to address this by measuring tube length in the mutant and modelled heart as well as by modelling left-right differences. The latter is not convincing, because it is unclear why and how they use a 50% reduction in left-right patterning. In addition, the sum of all the effects is not tested in the model. Most convincing would be if the authors can (computationally?) rescue the mesocardium breakdown in the <italic>shh</italic> mutants and test if this would also rescue the heart looping defect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28951.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Issues to be addressed:</p><p>1) Rotation of the arterial pole (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

In the graph of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, statistical analyses indicate that the deviation at the arterial pole is statistically significant (max 25° rightward rotation, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, p</xref>-value &lt;0.001, paired Student test), whereas this is not the case at the venous pole (max 8° leftward rotation, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, p</xref>&gt;0.40 at E8.5f, p&gt;0.10 at E8.5e). Therefore, our observations do not permit to conclude on a negative rotation of the venous pole. We have cited in 4 instances the alternative model, based on a negative rotation at the venous pole, proposed by Männer (2004) from simulations with rubber tubes. This previous model is similar to ours, for the principle of opposite deformations at the poles. However, our biological observations in the mouse would suggest that the underlying mechanisms are different at each pole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Results of the dye injections and their interpretation are confusing. a) The authors describe that they label both the right and left side of the mesoderm that will contribute to the heart tube.

In the absence of any asymmetry, the expected proportions would be half R&gt;L and half L&gt;R (the null hypothesis). It is more accurate and more conservative to take into account the R=L cases, rather than discarding them.

At E8.5g, the tube is tilted towards the right, which reflects the rightward rotation of the arterial pole that we detect earlier at E8.5f. At E8.5g, the tube has not acquired a helical shape, which requires the additional leftward deformation at the venous pole. Thus, the asymmetric cell ingression that we observe at the venous pole at E8.5g is in keeping with the curvature of the atrioventricular region at E8.5h and later stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In a previous study by Galli et al.

(2008) identified LR asymmetry as a number of differentiated cells in explant studies of the posterior heart field at 6 somites. They also investigated cell proliferation asymmetry based on quantifications of PH3 staining in histological sections. They reported LR asymmetry in cell proliferation in the sinus venosus at 7 somites, but not in the Isl1 positive posterior heart field (between 5-7 somites). All embryos were staged according to somite numbers. Our work now addresses asymmetric cell ingression in vivo, based on symmetrical DiI labelling in 71 embryos. The embryos are staged with a novel nomenclature, better reflecting the progression of heart looping. It is essential for the computer model to reconstitute the kinetics of different parameters and shape changes and thus acquire data within the same staging nomenclature. For this reason, we have now re-investigated cell proliferation, with a higher spatio-temporal resolution, using our staging system and 3D images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-G</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> the authors compare rotation of the arterial pole with asymmetric growth.

In the computer model, we used a 50% reduction in left-right patterning as it reproduces well the positioning of the RV relative to the LV.
