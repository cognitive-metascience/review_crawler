Neural stem cells have long lives, much of which they spend in a quiescent state. Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells, which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then ‘differentiate’ into neurons or glia.</p><p>Unlike some other tissues, it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue. Consequently, neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively, based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures.</p><p>A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells, and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals. When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around (rather than growing on a surface), a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres. Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia, the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells. However, the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain.</p><p>Now, Mich, Signer et al. have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone. The neural stem cells, which Mich, Signer et al. term pre-GEPCOT cells (based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells), were long-lived and quiescent, but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture. The neurosphere-forming cells, named GEPCOT cells, were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain. These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all, and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions.</p><p>The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain, and to isolate live cells to test how they function. The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function, given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02669.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02669.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>forebrain</kwd><kwd>fate-mapping</kwd><kwd>prospective identification</kwd><kwd>Bmi-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>None</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AG024945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Flow cytometric isolation and fate mapping shows that neurosphere-initiating cells are highly mitotically active and persist only transiently in vivo, and are distinct from quiescent, long-lived neural stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in two regions of the adult mammalian forebrain: the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle (SVZ).

However, in the adult forebrain it remains uncertain whether these colonies are formed by quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) or by mitotically active and shorter-lived multipotent progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morshead et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doetsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds and Rietze, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastrana et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2011</xref>). Moreover, reliance upon retrospective colony-formation assays makes it impossible to directly study qNSCs or NICs as they exist in vivo.</p><p>Pioneering work by Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues has demonstrated the existence of a lineage of NSCs and transit amplifying cells in the SVZ that gives rise to neuronal progenitors throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doetsch et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mirzadeh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ihrie and Alvarez-Buylla, 2011</xref>). By electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis they identified GFAP-expressing type B cells that appear to be the qNSCs. These cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents such as AraC and appear capable of repopulating the SVZ after AraC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doetsch et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2002</xref>). Type B cells are thought to give rise to <italic>Ascl1</italic>- and <italic>Dlx2</italic>-expressing type C cells, which are mitotically active and ablated by anti-mitotic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morshead et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doetsch et al., 1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastrana et al., 2009</xref>). The type C cells give rise to Dcx- and PSA-NCAM-expressing type A neuronal progenitors. These studies have provided a critical framework for understanding the SVZ neurogenic lineage, though the inability to purify live cells from each stage of this hierarchy has hampered efforts to assess their properties.</p><p>The inability to prospectively identify and isolate uncultured stem cells from the central nervous system (CNS) has contributed to uncertainty regarding the relationship between qNSCs and NICs. SVZ NICs have been enriched by flow cytometry based on CD15 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capela and Temple, 2002</xref>) or ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Belle et al., 2011</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that NSCs express GFAP and that these cells sustainably contribute to neurogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doetsch et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1999b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morshead et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mirzadeh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastrana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giachino et al., 2013</xref>). Pastrana et al. identified quiescent GFAP-GFP<sup>+</sup>EGFR<sup>−</sup> SVZ cells and speculated that these cells include NSCs that give rise to more mitotically active GFAP-GFP<sup>+</sup>EGFR<sup>+</sup> and GFAP-GFP<sup>-</sup>EGFR<sup>+</sup> NICs but did not test this by fate-mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastrana et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, it has been suggested that nearly all GFAP-GFP<sup>+</sup>CD133<sup>+</sup> cells are NICs and that these cells are the qNSCs in the SVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckervordersandforth et al., 2010</xref>). Efforts toward prospective identification have therefore generated conflicting results about whether NICs are quiescent or mitotically active in vivo and regarding their relationship to NSCs.</p><p>We have identified regulators of CNS stem cell self-renewal based on their ability to regulate SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis in vivo as well as multipotent NIC self-renewal in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuikov et al., 2010</xref>). However, an important question that we have not been able to address directly is whether those genes are necessary for NSC maintenance in vivo. Impaired NIC self-renewal in culture may not reflect reduced NSC self-renewal in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joseph and Morrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2009</xref>). For example, the polycomb transcriptional repressor <italic>Bmi-1</italic> is thought to be required for NSC self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruggeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molofsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zencak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruggeman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fasano et al., 2009</xref>). However, these studies were performed in germline knockout mice that generally die within a month after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Lugt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it has not been possible to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by NSCs in the adult brain or whether NSCs differ from NICs in their dependence upon Bmi-1.</p><p>Here we report the prospective identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of cells in the SVZ: GEPCOT cells and pre-GEPCOT cells. The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 ± 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells, were highly quiescent, lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture, and included type B1 cells based on marker expression, morphology, and position in vivo. These cells contained long-lived qNSCs based on both fate mapping and temozolomide resistance. GEPCOTs were distinguished by lower GFAP and Glast expression and higher EGFR and PlexinB2 expression. These cells accounted for 3.2 ± 0.7% of cells in the adult mouse SVZ, were highly mitotically active, highly enriched for NICs, and included type C cells based on marker expression, morphology, and position in vivo. Based on fate-mapping these cells were short-lived in the SVZ. Our data thus provide methods to prospectively identify and distinguish qNSCs from NICs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prospective identification of NICs</title><p>We enzymatically dissociated adult mouse SVZ cells then sorted cells by flow cytometry into non-adherent cultures at clonal density (0.66 cells/µl of culture medium).

Sucrose density centrifugation (approximately 90% debris reduction) or myelin depletion using paramagnetic myelin-binding microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-096-733, approximately ∼95–98% debris reduction) greatly reduce debris but also reduce cell yield by ∼50–60%.

On a plot of Glast vs CD24, live SVZ cells should have two clearly resolved populations that are either CD24<sup>mid</sup> or CD24<sup>−/low</sup>. The CD24 gate excludes all the CD24<sup>mid</sup> cells and retains all the CD24<sup>−/low</sup> cells.

First, the phenotype in <italic>Bmi-1</italic> germline knockout mice may indeed be more severe as non-cell-autonomous effects of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deficient stroma contribute to stem cell deficits in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oguro et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2010</xref>). Second, the death of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> germline knockout mice before young adulthood meant that adult phenotypes could not be studied directly and it was assumed that the deficits observed in the early postnatal period would rapidly worsen over time. Third, without the ability to prospectively identify qNSCs or NICs in vivo, these cells could only be studied based on neurosphere formation in culture. Since p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p19<sup>Arf</sup> expression are induced to a greater extent in culture than in vivo, the severity of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deficiency phenotypes in the nervous system are sometimes exaggerated in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molofsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2009</xref>).

Use of commercially available antibodies against cell surface antigens will enable such studies in a wide range of genetic backgrounds. Our data on Bmi-1 demonstrate how the existence of these markers makes it possible to assess the function of gene products within the neural stem/progenitor cell pool with a more granular appreciation for effects on qNSCs vs NICs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57Bl/6 were maintained in standard cages with water and standard diet (Teklad 2916) <italic>ad libitum</italic>. <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>CAG-loxp-Stop-loxp-tdTomato(Ai14)</italic></sup> (referred to here as <italic>Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Gli1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>), <italic>Sox2</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Dlx1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Tg(Slc1a3-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Tg(Nestin-Cre)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Tg(Ubc-GFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schaefer et al., 2001</xref>) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>Tg(GFAP-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirrlinger et al., 2006</xref>) mice were provided by Frank Kirchhoff. <italic>Tg(Nestin-GFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbrair et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Tg(Nestin-mCherry)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2012</xref>) mice were kindly provided by Grigori Enikopalov. <italic>Tg(Nestin-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> mice were provided by G Fishell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balordi and Fishell, 2007</xref>). <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) mice were housed in the Johnson laboratory.

However when sorting adult SVZ cells for neurosphere assays several important technical points require attention:</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Debris elimination</title><p>The extensive debris in adult SVZ cell preps complicates the determination of which events are real cells. This is not a problem for embryonic or neonatal cell preparations. We compared multiple strategies to eliminate debris from adult SVZ preparations. The simplest, least expensive, and most reproducible solution was stringent forward scatter and side scatter gating as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. To use this technique it is important to calibrate the forward scatter and side scatter voltages using freshly isolated bone marrow cells because even a small change in PMT voltages can dramatically affect cell yield and the amount of debris contaminating the cellular fraction. Before every experiment we aligned the myeloid population into the center of the forward scatter/side scatter plot [FSC-Area = 125k, SSC-Area = 125k] then we ensured that the forward scatter threshold was set as high as possible without eliminating cells (typically 75000 and did not require daily adjustment). When the forward scatter and side scatter voltages are properly calibrated there should be a prominent population of adult SVZ cells with similar FSC/SSC as lymphoid cells.</p><p>There are drawbacks to stringent forward scatter and side scatter gating. Some debris has similar FSC/SSC characteristics as live SVZ cells (typically ∼10% of events in the live SVZ scatter fraction represent debris as judged by DAPI staining after sorting on slides), and some cells are lost in the debris exclusion gate including a few cells with neurosphere-forming activity (generally ∼25% of NICs are excluded by the debris exclusion gate) and all ependymal cells (which have very high side scatter properties due to their cilia). As a result we also explored other options to increase cell purity and yield which we will summarize here.</p><p>We tried two other techniques to eliminate debris: sucrose gradient and myelin depletion. For sucrose gradient, we resuspended pelleted SVZ cells in 10 ml of 0.9M sucrose in staining medium, then centrifuged the cells (750×<italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C) and decanted the supernatant. The sucrose gradient typically eliminated ∼90% of debris but also lost ∼50% of cells. We performed myelin depletion using the Myelin Removal Beads II kit (130-096-733; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Myelin depletion typically eliminated ∼95–98% of debris but also eliminated ∼50% of cells. Because of the unacceptable losses in cell yields, for routine experiments we did not eliminate debris using either of these methods. However when cell purity is paramount these debris elimination techniques may be useful.</p><p>We also attempted other techniques to enrich for cells and to deplete debris using vital dyes. We tried Calcein AM (C3099; Life Technologies) and CFSE (C1157; Life Technologies) but these stains did not distinguish adequately between cells and debris. We also tried Hoechst 33342 (H1399; Life Technologies) and Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (V35003; Life Technologies), and although these stains did distinguish between cells and debris we found that these reagents were not useful because (1) the intensity of staining varied substantially across days, (2) staining of other markers (in particular Glast) was negatively affected by using these reagents, and (3) efficiency of clonogenesis after sorting was negatively impacted by using either of these reagents. As a result we did not use these dyes for routine experiments, but they could be useful when cell yield is paramount.</p><p>Finally we also used the fluorescent transgenic lines <italic>Nestin-GFP</italic> and <italic>Nestin-mCherry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbrair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). These lines allowed easy discrimination of SVZ cells from debris because of their bright, unambiguous expression in cells. Using <italic>Nestin-GFP</italic> or <italic>Nestin-mCherry</italic> and gating on GFP<sup>+</sup>DAPI<sup>−</sup> (or mCherry<sup>+</sup>DAPI<sup>−</sup>) events typically gave ∼50% greater cell yield and greater cell purity than when only using scatter-gating for cell identification. This is presumably because some Nestin-GFP+ or Nestin-Cherry+ cells (such as ependymal cells) appear as debris by FSC/SSC profile and would otherwise be excluded. However we did not wish to use transgenic lines to purify GEPCOT or pre-GEPCOT cells as this would limit the technique to these genetic backgrounds, and because express these transgenes are not uniformly expressed by pre-GEPCOT cells. However, for certain applications where high cell purity and yield are both paramount, or ependymal cells are desired, then <italic>Nestin-GFP</italic> or <italic>Nestin-mCherry</italic> may be useful.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>EDTA in staining medium increased GEPCOT cell yield</title><p>In our experiments the staining medium we employed contained 3.0 mM EDTA, enough to neutralize 2.7 mM of divalent cations in the staining medium (with a small surplus). We found that this slight excess of EDTA had a large effect (2–3-fold) on the yield of GEPCOT cells, probably by preventing clumping of GEPCOT cells with debris and/or other cells. The EDTA also prevented clogging of the nozzle during sorting. EDTA was found to be better than EGTA for this purpose. However it was important to maintain the osmolarity of the staining medium when adding EDTA or clonogenesis was negatively impacted. We pre-diluted 0.5M EDTA (made from Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>EDTA, pH 8.0) to 77.7 mM (309 mOsm) before adding it to the staining medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Growth medium pH must be kept neutral during sorting by preventing equilibration with the atmosphere</title><p>When sorting cells directly into culture medium it is essential to keep the pH of the medium constant. The phenol red indicator should maintain a red-orange color (pH 7.2–7.4) before, during, and after the sort. Typically we keep each plate in a Ziploc bag filled with 6% CO<sub>2</sub>/93% N<sub>2</sub>/1% O<sub>2</sub> prior to the sort, then sort one plate in 2–3 min or less, and return it to a freshly gassed Ziploc bag until transferring the plate to a humidified 37°C, CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for culture. By keeping plates in 6% CO<sub>2</sub> before and after the sort, the culture medium does not equilibrate with the air (which would deplete CO<sub>2</sub> from the medium and increase pH to levels incompatible with cell survival).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Rock inhibitor (Y-27632) and IGF1 increase clonogenesis after sorting</title><p>The process of being sorted has a negative effect on neurosphere formation from adult SVZ cells: at the beginning of our experiments we observed a ∼threefold loss of activity in sorted live SVZ cells compared to crude unsorted cells. Sorted neonatal SVZ cells do not show this problem. We wondered how to sort gently to overcome the fragility of adult SVZ cells.</p><p>Addition of the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 hydrochloride, to the culture medium after sorting (10 μM) increased neurosphere formation by adult cells approximately twofold after sorting but did not have any effect on adult SVZ cells pipetted into the culture medium, on sorted neonatal SVZ cells, or on crude neonatal SVZ cells. We also found that IGF1 (20 ng/ml) further improved clonogenesis after sorting. The mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear but may involve promotion of cell survival after sorting or repression of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsieh et al., 2004</xref>). When using both these culture additives, there was little difference between sorted live SVZ cells and an equal number of cells added to culture by pipette in terms of the numbers of neurospheres they made.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Preventing neurosphere aggregation after sorting</title><p>Neurospheres can aggregate and fuse in culture, particularly when cultured at higher densities or when plates are moved (facilitating collisions among neurospheres) during the culture period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singec et al., 2006</xref>). To minimize this problem we took several precautions. First, we always sorted cells into culture at clonal (low) density: 1000 cells in 1.5 ml medium (0.66 cells/μl) in each well of a 6 well-plate. Second, we maintained a separate incubator specifically for neurosphere cultures that was only opened sparingly to prevent mechanical disturbances or changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p><p>Finally, we found that chick embryonic extract (CEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>) can prevent cell fusion after sorting. In the absence of CEE, sorted cell-derived primary neurospheres were few in number and very large, suggesting extensive sphere fusion. After adding 10% CEE to the culture medium, sorted cell-derived primary neurospheres were indistinguishable in size and number from neurospheres cultured from cells pipetted into culture. We found that the combination of 10% CEE plus 10 μM Y-27632 hydrochloride plus 20 ng/ml IGF1 maximized the formation of non-aggregating neurospheres from sorted adult SVZ cells.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SJM is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The general consensus of the reviewers was that the data are extensive, of high quality, use cutting edge approaches, and support the conclusions. In addition, the findings make a significant contribution to the field of adult neural stem cells, particularly with regard to the ongoing search for the “true” quiescent adult neural stem cell. However, the reviewers did raise a number of issues that, if addressed, would strengthen the manuscript, as follows:</p><p>1) The authors indicate that they could not grow colonies from the pre-GEPCOT cells under neurosphere conditions or under adherent conditions. Nonetheless, it is clear that these cells must proliferate under some conditions, since they repopulate the GEPCOT compartment following its ablation. Any data addressing potential growth factor requirements for these cells would greatly enhance the manuscript. If the authors have tried to identify such growth factors and have been unsuccessful then even that negative data would be informative.</p><p>2) Given the link between p16 and senescence, have the authors ever asked whether senescence is the relevant mechanism for depletion of neural stem cells in their various Bmi1 mouse models?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, there are many non-specific bands, and it is not clear whether Bmi-1 protein expression was lost in the mutant mice. The authors should improve the data, or alternatively perform qPCR to confirm the loss of Bmi-1 expression.</p><p>On a more minor note:</p><p>1) One of the surprising findings of this manuscript is the relatively high frequency of the pre-GEPCOT cells (6%). It is generally assumed in the field that the quiescent neural stem cells should be a rare population.

In the original manuscript we had chased for only 22 days. This longer chase period strengthens the evidence that the cells that are responsible for the regeneration of GECPOT neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and other SVZ cells after TMZ ablation are GFAP<sup>+</sup>. Since GFAP is one of the most specific markers of pre-GEPCOT cells, this further supports our conclusion that quiescent pre-GEPCOT cells are the stem cells of the SVZ.</p><p>We have also added new data on neurogenesis in <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice. In the original manuscript we showed that <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deletion significantly reduced neurogenesis in 14-month-old <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice relative to littermate controls. In the revised manuscript we have expanded our analysis to include neurogenesis in 4-month-old <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice, showing that neurogenesis is normal in these mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This further demonstrates that even when <italic>Bmi-1</italic> is deleted throughout the nervous system during fetal development, stem cells and neurogenesis persist into young adulthood and are not depleted until around a year of age. Bmi-1 is therefore not absolutely required for the maintenance of adult neural stem cells, in contrast to what has been widely assumed based on studies of germline knockout mice.</p><p>Review comments:</p><p><italic>1) The authors indicate that they could not grow colonies from the pre-GEPCOT cells under neurosphere conditions or under adherent conditions. Nonetheless, it is clear that these cells must proliferate under some conditions, since they repopulate the GEPCOT compartment following its ablation. Any data addressing potential growth factor requirements for these cells would greatly enhance the manuscript. If the authors have tried to identify such growth factors and have been unsuccessful then even that negative data would be informative</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it should, in principle, be possible to identify culture conditions that enable colony-formation by pre-GEPCOT cells and have worked very hard to do this. To date, we have tested the effects of 36 different growth factors or medium supplements on adherent or non-adherent colony formation by SVZ cells from normal or TMZ-treated mice. Since TMZ treatment ablates GEPCOT NICs, any growth factor that enables colony formation by pre-GEPCOT cells should profoundly increase colony formation by SVZ cells from TMZ-treated mice. Out of the 36 growth factors and medium supplements we have tested so far, 5 significantly reduced colony-formation but none significantly increased colony formation. The new data have been added to Supplementary File 1B. We will continue testing additional growth factors and medium supplements in future studies.</p><p><italic>2) Given the link between p16 and senescence, have the authors ever asked whether senescence is the relevant mechanism for depletion of neural stem</italic> <italic>cells in their various Bmi1 mouse models?</italic></p><p>We have added new data further exploring <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> expression after <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deletion. In the original manuscript we demonstrated in <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice that <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> expression increased after <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deletion in pre-GEPCOT but not GEPCOT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>). In the revised manuscript, we have added new data demonstrating in <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice that <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> expression also increased in pre-GEPCOT but not GEPCOT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7R</xref>). These results demonstrate that quiescent neural stem cells are particularly dependent upon Bmi-1 for the repression of <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> expression, providing a molecular distinction in the way in which Bmi-1 functions in pre-GEPCOT versus GEPCOT cells.</p><p>The most commonly used marker of cellular senescence is β-galactosidase staining. We have attempted to test whether <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deletion induced cellular senescence by staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. However, relative to control cells, we have not been able to detect any increase in senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in pre-GEPCOT cells from 14-month-old <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice or in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from <italic>Bmi-1</italic> germline knockout mice. We have added this information to the text of the revised manuscript; however, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of senescence among <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deficient neural stem cells as there are no definitive markers of cellular senescence in vivo.</p><p>We are also attempting to test whether <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> deficiency rescues the depletion of pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells after <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deletion but have not yet been able to generate definitive results for technical reasons. We initially attempted to test this by generating <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>; Bmi1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>; p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup><italic>-p19</italic><sup><italic>Arf -/-</italic></sup> compound mutant mice. However, germline deletion of <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup><italic>-p19</italic><sup><italic>Arf</italic></sup> leads to the death of mice from hematopoietic malignancies by around 5 months of age. Therefore, these mice died before we could test whether there was a rescue of neural stem cell function. We have more recently generated <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>; Bmi1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup><italic>; p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a fl/fl</italic></sup> mice but will have to age these mice for at least a year to test whether conditional <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> deletion rescues the depletion of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deficient pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>, there are many non-specific bands, and it is not clear whether Bmi-1 protein expression was lost in the mutant mice. The authors should improve the data, or alternatively perform qPCR to confirm the loss of Bmi-1 expression</italic>.</p><p>We have redone the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and have replaced the blot shown in the original manuscript with another blot that is cleaner and includes more controls. Consistent with our conclusions in the original manuscript, the new blot shows that conditional deletion of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> using <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> leads to a complete or near complete, loss of Bmi-1 protein throughout the cortex and SVZ (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We have also included new RT-PCR data demonstrating that SVZ cells, GEPCOT cells, and pre-GEPCOT cells from <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice generally lack detectable <italic>Bmi-1</italic> mRNA, in contrast to littermate controls (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1G</xref>). These new data supplement the genomic DNA PCR data in the original manuscript showing that SVZ cells, GEPCOT cells, and pre-GEPCOT cells from <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice all exhibit complete <italic>Bmi-1</italic> recombination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, PCR analysis of genomic DNA, RT-PCR analysis of mRNA, and western analysis of protein all indicate efficient deletion of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> from SVZ cells, GEPCOT cells, and pre-GEPCOT cells.</p><p><italic>On a more</italic> <italic>minor note:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One of the surprising findings of this manuscript is the relatively high frequency of the pre-GEPCOT cells (6%). It is generally assumed in the field that the quiescent neural stem cells should be a rare population. The authors do indicate in the discussion that the pre-GEPCOT cells they are sorting are likely to be heterogeneous. However, it would be worth discussing this issue further</italic>.</p><p>We have added new text to discuss this issue. There are two important points. First, the pre-GEPCOT cell population is probably not pure. However, given the lack of a clonal assay to detect quiescent neural stem cells we have no way to test purity. This means that to exclude non-stem cells from this population we will have to perform fate mapping with each potential non-stem cell marker. This will take a long time. Second, we should not expect quiescent neural stem cells to be rare. The idea that quiescent stem cells should be rare comes from the hematopoietic system, where stem cells are always rare and are always fated to form massive numbers of progeny. The nervous system has adopted a fundamentally different strategy in which stem cells (when they are present) are common, but are each fated to form relatively small numbers of progeny in vivo. Fate mapping of neural stem cells in multiple regions of the developing and adult nervous system has shown that undifferentiated neural stem cells undergo only a small number of divisions before terminally differentiating (e.g. PNAS 110: E1045; Cell Stem Cell 8: 566; Cell 145: 1142). Neural stem cells are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of the cells in germinal zones of the adult nervous system (e.g., Cell Stem Cell 11: 265; PNAS 106: 6387; J. Neurosci. 17: 5046).</p><p><italic>2) It would be nice to see the enhanced GFAP staining that the authors allude to when they describe the floxed</italic> Bmi1;Nestin-Cre <italic>mice in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have added a new figure showing the dramatic increase in GFAP staining in the forebrain of young adult <italic>Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6-figure supplement 1F</xref>). This effect was not observed in young adult <italic>Nestin-CreER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>; Bmi-1</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mice. This appears to be a developmental consequence of <italic>Bmi-1</italic> deficiency in neural stem/progenitor cells or in glia.</p><p><italic>3) The proportions of new astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that are made from their BrdU-positive proliferating SVZ cells in vivo seem to be very small. It would help the reader if the authors were to compare the relative proportions of BrdU-positive cells that made neurons versus glia over the relevant timeframes</italic>.</p><p>We have revised the text to make clear that the vast majority of newborn cells that arise in the adult olfactory bulb are neurons, such that the proportion of new astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in our experiments was very small. This is consistent with a number of prior studies. Lineage tracing by multiple techniques (Cre/Lox, retrovirus, and BrdU) indicates that olfactory bulb neurons make up the vast majority of SVZ-derived mature cells in the mouse brain (e.g., Science 317: 381; J. Neurosci. 27: 12623; Nature 443: 448). Newborn mature glia are generated, but on a much smaller scale (e.g., J. Neurosci. 26: 7907; Genesis 47: 122).</p></body></sub-article></article>
