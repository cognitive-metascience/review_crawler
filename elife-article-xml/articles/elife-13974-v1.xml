This genetic diversity has long been known to facilitate adaptation, but recent studies have suggested that cooperation between variants might also increase population fitness. Here, we demonstrate strong cooperation between two H3N2 influenza variants that differ by a single mutation at residue 151 in neuraminidase, which normally mediates viral exit from host cells. Residue 151 is often annotated as an ambiguous amino acid in sequenced isolates, indicating mixed viral populations. We show that mixed populations grow better than either variant alone in cell culture. Pure populations of either variant generate the other through mutation and then stably maintain a mix of the two genotypes. We suggest that cooperation arises because mixed populations combine one variant’s proficiency at cell entry with the other’s proficiency at cell exit. Our work demonstrates a specific cooperative interaction between defined variants in a viral quasispecies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13974.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13974.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13974.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses like influenza mutate fast. When you get the flu, the virus hijacks your cells, and your body becomes home to millions of viruses, many of which are genetically different from each other. Previous research had suggested that variants of rapidly evolving viruses sometimes cooperate with one another to survive, but few studies have pinpointed specific cooperative interactions.</p><p>In the past decade, influenza surveillance groups noticed that one particular mutant virus appears again and again when influenza viruses are grown in the laboratory. Xue et al. thought that this mutant virus shouldn’t be able to grow on its own because the mutation disrupted the protein that influenza viruses use to detach from host cells. So, they asked if the mutant was cooperating with the non-mutated virus to survive.</p><p>Xue et al. revealed that the two influenza viruses, which differ by just one mutation, cooperate with each other when grown in cells in the laboratory. The mutant virus often appeared following a random mutation in a population of non-mutated virus, and vice versa. Instead of competing with each other until one virus went extinct, the two viruses actually grew better together than they did apart. Xue et al. suggest that this is because one of the viruses is good at entering new cells, while the other is better at exiting cells to spread the infection. A mixed population combines these two strengths.</p><p>Following on from this work, it remains unclear whether influenza viruses cooperate in other settings – for example, during infections in people. Further studies are also needed to determine exactly how the two viruses help each other at the molecular level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13974.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13974.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase</kwd><kwd>D151G</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>quasispecies</kwd><kwd>D151N</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Katherine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005883</institution-id><institution>Hertz Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hertz Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Katherine S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Kathryn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The frequent co-occurrence of two variants of influenza is due to the fact that they cooperate, meaning that a mixed population grows better than either variant alone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of RNA viruses is characterized by high mutation rates and large population sizes, which together create genetically diverse populations known as quasispecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eigen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holland et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lauring and Andino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andino and Domingo, 2015</xref>).

More recent studies have suggested cooperation between distinct variants of measles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shirogane et al., 2012</xref>), hepatitis B virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), and Coxsackie virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordería et al., 2015</xref>). However, specific examples of robust cooperative interactions between defined variants in viral quasispecies remain rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmes, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that cooperation between two distinct variants of human H3N2 influenza promotes viral growth in cell culture. The two variants differ by a single amino-acid mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) protein, which normally mediates viral exit from the host cell. Both variants are reported numerous times in human H3N2 NA sequences deposited in the GISAID EpiFlu database, and both have been observed in mixed populations when clinical specimens are passaged in cell culture. We show that the two variants grow better together than apart, and that serial passage repeatably selects for mixed populations. We suggest that the cooperation arises because one variant is proficient at cell entry while the other is proficient at cell exit. Overall, our work represents a clear example of selection to generate and maintain two cooperating genotypes within a viral quasispecies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations at site 151 in H3N2 neuraminidase tend to occur in mixed populations</title><p>Over the last decade, several groups have reported that mutations arise rapidly and repeatedly at residue NA 151 when human H3N2 influenza is passaged in cell culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McKimm-Breschkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohr et al., 2015</xref>). Residue 151 is in the NA active site and is highly conserved; until recently, it had an amino-acid identity of D in virtually all N2 NAs. Ordinarily, NA mediates viral exit from the host cell by cleaving sialic-acid receptors to release newly produced virions. The D151G mutation ablates the catalytic activity of NA and instead causes it to bind the receptors that it typically cleaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>).

Most isolates in this database are first passaged in eggs or cell culture, and then the consensus sequence of the viral population is determined by Sanger sequencing. Beginning in 2007, the frequency of mutations at NA site 151 rose dramatically, with mutant genotypes representing about a quarter of the sequences. G151 and N151 are each reported in about 1% of sequences, but ambiguous nucleotide calls at the codon make up the majority of non-wild-type sequences. Because these sequences usually represent consensus calls from Sanger sequencing, the ambiguous nucleotides likely indicate the presence of mixed D151+G151 and D151+N151 populations. The relative abundance of mixed populations in strains deposited in the GISAID EpiFlu database is consistent with the fact that, in tissue culture, mutations at site 151 arise frequently but fix rarely (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okomo-Adhiambo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohr et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13974.004</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ambiguous identities are common at NA site 151 after 2007.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shown are the number of human H3N2 influenza NA sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database with the given identity at site 151 for each year from 2000 to 2014.

To understand how variation at site 151 might depend on the passaging procedures, we classified sequences according to their passage histories as annotated in the GISAID EpiFlu database. Prior to 2007, site 151 is almost always reported to be D, regardless of passage history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From 2007 onward, variants at site 151 are reported almost exclusively in isolates that have been passaged in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Whereas nearly a third of isolates that have been passaged in cell culture are reported to have an amino acid other than D at site 151, only two of nearly 1800 unpassaged isolates and five of nearly 400 egg-passaged isolates are reported to have non-D amino acids at site 151. These observations accord with reports in the literature that mutations at site 151 are observed primarily in cell-culture-passaged isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tamura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohr et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is important to remember that the methods used to determine most sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database lack sensitivity to detect minority variants in a viral population. For instance, the experimental results that we describe below suggest that it is exceedingly unlikely that any of the more than 100 reported G151 sequences actually reflect the complete fixation of this mutation.</p><p>Overall, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> indicate that the G151 mutation tends to occur in mixed populations. We therefore sought to experimentally characterize the growth of pure D151 and G151 viral variants to determine whether mixed populations represent incomplete fixation of a lab-adaptation mutation or whether they are the product of active selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mixed populations of D151 and G151 viruses grow better than pure populations of either variant</title><p>We compared the growth of the D151 and G151 variants both alone and in mixed populations by generating viruses of defined genotypes using reverse genetics. The A/Hanoi/Q118/2007 strain, henceforth referred to as Hanoi/2007, is a human H3N2 strain with a G151 genotype. Its NA protein sequence is identical to that of several other sequenced isolates, except that the other strains have D at site 151. We created reverse-genetics plasmids encoding the protein sequences of both the D151 and G151 variants of the Hanoi/2007 NA, as well as the HA from this strain. The internal genes were derived from the lab-adapted A/WSN/33 influenza strain with GFP packaged in the PB1 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>). The two viral variants were therefore isogenic except for the variation at site 151.</p><p>We generated virus using reverse genetics by co-transfecting cells with plasmids encoding the D151 variant, the G151 variant, or an equal mix of the two, together with isogenic plasmids for the other viral genes, and we quantified the resulting titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, given its widespread designation as a lab adaptation, the G151 variant grows extremely poorly. However, a mixed population of D151 and G151 variants grows to substantially higher titers than the corresponding pure population of D151 viruses.

We generated pure populations of D151 and G151 viruses by reverse genetics, growing both populations in the presence of 50 nM oseltamivir, a small molecule that competes with sialic acid for binding to the NA active site. The addition of oseltamivir increases the titers of the G151 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and presumably prevents selection for <italic>de novo</italic> NA mutations by suppressing both the cleavage and binding activity of this protein.

The pure G151 populations grew very poorly, again showing that this variant has very low fitness on its own.

A candidate gene for these potentiating mutations is HA. Good viral growth requires a balance between the receptor binding of HA and the receptor cleaving of NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wagner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gulati et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neverov et al., 2015</xref>).

We therefore hypothesized that recent mutations in HA might have potentiated cooperation by making it advantageous for viral populations to acquire the NA-mediated receptor-binding of the G151 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>) to compensate for reduced HA binding.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of the D151 and G151 NA variants in viruses that had the HA of an earlier H3N2 strain, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, henceforth referred to as Wisconsin/2005.

These variants differ by a single amino-acid mutation in NA, and each variant is present in many human H3N2 isolates that have been analyzed by Sanger sequencing after passage in the lab. Prior work has assumed that the less common G151 variant is a lab-adaptation mutant that emerges as the more common D151 variant is passaged in cell culture. Our work shows, however, that evolution in cell culture selects for a balanced mix of both variants. The G151 variant can barely replicate alone, but it cooperates with the D151 variant to increase population fitness. After multiple serial passages, both pure and mixed populations converge to an equilibrium in which both variants are present at approximately equal frequencies. Our work therefore represents a clear example of cooperation between distinct variants in a viral quasispecies.</p><p>We propose that cooperation arises because one variant is proficient at cell entry, while the other is proficient at cell exit. Viruses with wild-type D151 NAs always exit cells efficiently, since their NAs cleave sialic-acid receptors to facilitate viral release. However, the HAs of recent human H3N2 strains have reduced affinity for many sialic-acid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gulati et al., 2013</xref>), reducing the efficiency with which those viruses can attach to many cells via HA. G151 viruses are proficient at cell entry, since their NA binds strongly to sialic acid, but they cannot detach effectively from host cells due to a lack of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). But in combination, D151 and G151 enable both efficient cell exit and entry. Indeed, our experiments with a binding-deficient HA indicate that in a mixed D151 and G151 population, NA can act as the exclusive source of both receptor binding and receptor cleaving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results evoke prior work showing that fitness in a Coxsackie virus population is enhanced by the combination of multiple receptor-binding variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordería et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How do the D151 and G151 variants collaborate to enable both viral entry and exit at the level of individual virions? Co-infection of the same cell with both D151 and G151 variants would produce progeny that have both NA variants on their surface, even though each new virion would package only a single copy of the NA gene. We suspect that much of the observed cooperation may result from co-infections that produce such mixed-NA virions, which would then carry proteins that make them proficient at both cell entry and cell exit. We found that MOI affects cooperative dynamics, supporting this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, other mechanisms could also contribute. In a mixed population, D151 viruses may cleave G151 viruses from the cell surface without both protein variants being present on the same infectious particle, since sialidase activity can promote viral growth in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu and Air, 1993</xref>). More detailed molecular characterization of virions in mixed populations will be necessary to establish the exact mechanism of cooperation.</p><p>It remains unclear whether the D151 and G151 variants cooperate in clinical infections. When we analyzed the passage histories of sequenced isolates, we found that mixed populations were reported almost exclusively in isolates that had been passaged in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Several groups have reported that mutations emerge at NA site 151 when clinical isolates are expanded in cell culture – but with one exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2010</xref>), Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing of matched clinical and passaged isolates has so far failed to detect variation in site 151 in unpassaged isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chambers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishin et al., 2014</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). However, the sequencing methods used by these studies are relatively insensitive to low-frequency variation. Given how quickly and frequently D151 mutations sometimes arise—one group found that nearly a quarter of isolates showed variation at appreciable frequencies after a single passage in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>)—pre-existing variation at site 151 in the original clinical isolates could contribute to the observed evolution. More sensitive deep sequencing of unpassaged clinical isolates will be necessary to resolve these questions.</p><p>Our work demonstrates that cooperation between distinct viral variants can enhance the population’s overall fitness. This cooperation is not a rare event; the cooperating variants that we describe emerge rapidly and repeatedly, both in our own experiments and apparently in hundreds of clinical isolates passaged by numerous labs. Our work emphasizes that genetic diversity in viral populations can be more than a transient state that facilitates adaptation: it can itself be a beneficial trait that is generated and maintained by selection. As the deep sequencing of viruses becomes increasingly common in microbiology and epidemiology, it will be important to better understand the broader role that cooperation plays in the evolution and maintenance of population-level diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analysis of GISAID EpiFlu sequences</title><p>We downloaded the set of 15,079 sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogner et al., 2006</xref>) corresponding to all full-length NA coding regions from human H3N2 influenza A isolates collected from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2014.

Mixed genotypes were assigned on the basis of IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity codes; for instance, the triplet GRT could refer to GAT or GGT, corresponding to amino acids aspartic acid (D) and glycine (G), respectively. We occasionally observed the triplet RRT, which could correspond to a mix of aspartic acid (D; GAT), glycine (G; GGT), asparagine (N; AAT), and serine (S; AGT).

For instance, sequences with passage annotations containing 'MDCK,' 'SIAT,' 'RHMK,' 'MEK,' and various other cell-culture signifiers were combined into the broad category of cell-culture-passaged isolates. Our exact parsing procedures and the computer code used for analysis are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viral strains</title><p>HA and NA sequences from the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) strain were cloned into the bidirectional pHW2000 backbone to generate virus by reverse genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>). We performed site-directed mutagenesis on the HA and NA to match the amino-acid (but not nucleotide) sequence from A/Hanoi/Q118/2007 (Genbank accessions AEX34134 and AEX34137 for the HA and NA, respectively), which has a G at NA site 151 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2008</xref>). The HA and NA protein sequences are identical to those from A/California/UR06-0565/2007 (Genbank accessions ABW40191 and ABW40194 for HA and NA, respectively) aside from a single site in HA, as well as the genotype at NA site 151. We performed further rounds of site-directed mutagenesis to generate the D151 and N151 variants of the NA. The HA sequence from the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) influenza strain (Genbank accession CY163744) was similarly cloned into the bidirectional pHW2000 backbone for reverse genetics. The binding-deficient HA is derived from the A/Hong Kong/2/1968 (H3N2) HA and contains extensive mutations and deletions that eliminate receptor-binding activity; this is the variant referred to as the 'PassMut HA' in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hooper and Bloom, 2013</xref>).

For all experiments not otherwise indicated, we used a plasmid (PB1flank-eGFP) that carried GFP flanked by PB1 packaging signals in place of pHW182-PB1 plasmid, and propagated the viruses in 293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells expressing the WSN PB1 under the control of a CMV promoter as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viral reverse genetics</title><p>To generate GFP-expressing virus using reverse genetics, we transfected co-cultures of 293T-CMV-SIAT-PB1 and MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells with plasmids encoding the eight viral genes, with PB1flank-GFP rather than PB1 as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>). We plated 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> 293T-CMV-PB1 cells and 0.2 x 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-CMV-PB1 cells per well in six-well dishes in D10 (Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS], 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin) and transfected each well with 2 µg plasmid DNA, corresponding to 250 ng of each of the eight plasmids, using the BioT transfection reagent (Bioland Scientific, Paramount, California). At 12 to 18 hr post-transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the media was changed to low-serum influenza growth media (IGM; Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.01% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 100 µg/mL calcium chloride). TPCK (toylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone)-trypsin was added to IGM at 3 µg/mL immediately before use. For reverse genetics carried out in the presence of oseltamivir, we added the indicated concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate (kindly provided by Roche) to the IGM at this point as well. We collected viral supernatant at 72 hr post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation at 285xg for 4 min, aliquoted, and froze at -80 degrees C before thawing aliquots for titering. To generate viral populations that expressed the A/WSN/33 PB1 gene rather than the PB1 segment packaging GFP, we substituted 293T and MDCK-SIAT1 cells for 293T-CMV-PB1 and MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells in the protocol above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Viral titering</title><p>For viruses grown with the PB1flank-eGFP gene, titers were determined using flow cytometry. We plated 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells per well in 12-well plates in IGM and infected them 4–6 hr later with 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 µL of viral supernatant. At 16 hr post-infection, we collected the cells into PBS with 1% paraformaldehyde from wells in which approximately 1–10% of cells were GFP-positive and used flow cytometry to determine the exact proportion of GFP-positive cells. We used the Poisson equation to calculate the number of infectious particles in the original inoculum as:</p><p>[titer, in infectious particle per µL] = -log(1 – [fraction of GFP-positive cells]) * [number of cells plated, in this case 10<sup>5</sup>] / [inoculum volume, in µL]</p><p>For viruses grown with the WSN PB1 gene, titers were determined by staining for intracellular NP. Similar to the GFP titering described above, MDCK-SIAT1 cells were infected with serial dilutions of viral supernatant. At 12 hr post-infection, the cells were collected, fixed and permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (product number 554722, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) following the manufacturer’s protocol but omitting the GolgiPlug, stained with a 1:20 dilution of mouse anti-NP FITC-conjugated antibody (clone A1 from MAB8257F, EMD MilliPore, Darmstadt, Germany), washed twice, and analyzed by flow cytometry to count NP-positive cells. The viral titer was computed from the fraction of positive cells using the Poisson equation above. All titers are plotted with the lower bound of the y-axis set at the limit of detection of this assay, approximately 10<sup>–1</sup> infectious particles/µL.</p><p>Note that all of these titering methods quantify the number of virions that enter cells and express a functional polymerase complex that produces large amounts of the mRNA encoding the protein product being detected (GFP or NP). Unlike in a TCID50 or plaque assay, not all detected virions are necessarily able to undergo multi-cycle infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Viral serial passage in cell culture</title><p>For each passage, we plated 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells per well in six-well plates in IGM and infected them 4–6 hr later with D151 viruses, G151 viruses, or an equal mix of the two at a total MOI of 0.2. An hour after the viruses were added, we washed the cells with PBS and added fresh IGM supplemented with 3 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin to dilute the effect of any oseltamivir remaining from reverse genetics for the first passage. We collected viral supernatant at 40 hr post-infection, clarified by centrifugation at 285xg for 4 min, aliquoted, and froze it at -80 degrees C before thawing aliquots for titering. We collected cells remaining at the end of each passage in 1mL Trizol reagent and froze them at -20 degrees C. From passage 4 onwards, mutation accumulation in the PB1flank-eGFP gene caused widespread loss of GFP in many viral populations; by the end of this passage, cytopathic effect was clearly visible even though GFP fluorescence was not. To inoculate passage 5, we infected cells with 5uL viral supernatant from passage 4, a volume corresponding approximately to an MOI of 0.2 based on the titers for earlier passages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Targeted deep sequencing of the NA gene</title><p>We extracted RNA from cells remaining at the end of each passage using Trizol reagent and performed reverse-transcription using the primers CAGGAGTGAAAATGAATCCAAATCAAAAGATAATAACGATTG and TTGCGAAAGCTTATATAGGCATGAGATTGATG, which target the full-length NA gene. We then used primers CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTxxxCAACACTAAACAACGTGCATTCAAATGAC and GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCCTAACTCATTCATCAATAGGGTCCGATAAGG to amplify a targeted region of the NA gene surrounding site 151 and add the first half of the Illumina sequencing adaptor and a three-mer in-read barcode, represented here as xxx. We performed 25 cycles of amplification at an annealing temperature of 55 degrees C and an extension time of 40 s. We purified the PCR product using 1.5X Ampure beads and used this product as template for a second round of PCR using primers AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC and CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATxxxxxxGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCC, which add the second half of the Illumina sequencing adaptors and a six-mer barcode, represented here as xxxxxx.</p><p>To sequence the viral stocks used to inoculate the first passage (these inoculating stocks are referred to as 'Passage 0' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we plated 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells per well in six-well plates in IGM and infected them 4–6 hr later with viral stocks at an MOI of 0.02. An hour after the viruses were added, we washed the cells with PBS and added fresh IGM to dilute the effect of any oseltamivir remaining from the generation of virus by reverse genetics. We collected the cells in 1mL Trizol reagent at 16 hr post-infection and froze them at -20 degrees C. The purpose of this inoculation was to ensure that sequencing of viral stocks detected only infectious particles. We then prepared PCR amplicons from these samples for deep sequencing as described above.</p><p>Reads were first screened to verify sequencing quality and correct identity. Reads were discarded if any position had a Q-score below 25 or if the read had more than 4 mismatches relative to the plasmid reference sequence. We translated the reads in the NA reading frame and tallied the amino-acid identities at each position, recording “X” for positions with a discrepancy between the forward and reverse reads.

We have carried out several additional experiments and analyses that we believe have greatly improved the manuscript. These revisions are summarized here and described at greater length below. Briefly:</p><p>a) We have tested the effect of cooperation at a low multiplicity of infection by inoculating infections at an MOI of 0.02 and assaying viral titer;</p><p>b) We have parsed the passage history metadata for sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database to better understand how cooperation relates to passage history;</p><p>c) We have expanded the discussion of our results to better set them in the context of prior work suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>We would like to understand how cooperation depends on the multiplicity of infection. MOIs of 0.2 and 0.5 seem to behave similarly and experiments at lower MOI would be instructive.</italic> </p><p>This was a very helpful suggestion. We measured the growth of mixed and pure viral populations at an MOI of 0.02, and we serially passaged replicate pure and mixed populations at the same MOI. As the reviewers may have suspected, we find that at low MOI there is initially a lag period where the mixed population grows slightly worse than the pure D151 population. But by later times, we find that mixed populations grow better than pure populations even at an MOI of 0.02. We proposed that cooperation occurs when the D151 and G151 viruses co-infect the same cell, which would occur less frequently during the initial stages of a lower MOI infection. In accordance with these predictions, we see that the mixed populations grow slightly worse than the pure populations during the first 24 hours of the passage, when the MOI is low. Later in the passage, when the MOI increases due to accumulation of virus in the supernatant, we find that the mixed populations grow better than the pure populations. These new data are what in now is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised paper.</p><p><italic>A large fraction of the influenza sequences in data bases are annotated with passage information. It would be informative to stratify the sequences by passage and redo <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for different passage categories. Direct sequencing data of RNA from patient isolates could shed light on the existence of mixed populations in clinical samples. If such data were available, this could further strengthen this paper.</italic> </p><p>This was another helpful suggestion that helped us set cooperation in the context of passage protocols and clinical infections. We parsed the passage annotations from sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu database and observed mixed populations almost exclusively in strains that had been passaged in cell culture. Notably, mixed populations were detected in only two of the unpassaged isolates. These new data are included in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>However, as we note in the Discussion, these sequences are obtained through Sanger sequencing, which may not detect G151 if it is a rare variant in the population. For instance, a number of Sanger sequencing studies report G151 as “fixed” in cell culture passaged virus – something that appears very unlikely in light of our experimental results. It therefore remains unclear of G151 arises fully de novo in cell culture, or is simply enriched from pre-existing variation.</p><p>Certainly, as the reviewers suggest, deep sequencing of unpassaged clinical isolates is the only way to definitively determine whether cooperation occurs in clinical infections. However, this work requires access to clinical samples that place it outside the scope of our current study. In any case, we note that the identification of viral cooperation even in cell culture is a finding of significant evolutionary interest – particularly since it arises so repeatedly and consistently. As is often the case in biology, we hope that our characterization of this fascinating phenomenon in the lab will provide a scientific motivation for further studies that examine if the same principles apply in other settings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: While the authors included the Bordería et al. reference in the Introduction, I believe that to be fair, they should refer more directly to this work in the Discussion where they state that their own work demonstrates that cooperation between distinct variants can enhance overall fitness. In Bordería et al., the authors showed that variants of several residues on different structural proteins also emerged as a mixed population whose total fitness was greater than any single virus population alone</italic> – <italic>and these mutants also affect receptor binding.</italic> </p><p>This was another helpful suggestion. The work of Bordería et al. bears several similarities to ours, and we have noted the connections and context in both the Introduction and Discussion. We hope these revisions provide better context for readers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
