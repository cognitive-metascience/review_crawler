active role in integrating information to generate motivation. Here, we investigated whether rat VP cue responses would encode and contribute similarly to the vigor of reward-seeking behaviors trained under Pavlovian versus instrumental contingencies, when these behavioral responses consist of superficially similar locomotor response patterns but may reflect distinct underlying decision-making processes. We find that cue-elicited activity in many VP neurons predicts the latency of instrumental reward seeking, but not of Pavlovian response latency. Further, disruption of VP signaling increases the latency of instrumental but not Pavlovian reward seeking. This suggests that VP encoding of and contributions to response vigor are specific to the ability of incentive cues to invigorate reward-seeking behaviors upon which reward delivery is contingent.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33107.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sounds or other cues associated with receiving a reward can have a powerful effect on an individual’s behavior or emotions. For example, the sound of an ice cream truck might cause salivation and motivate an individual to stand in a long line. Cues may prompt specific actions necessary to receive a reward, for example, approaching the ice cream truck and paying to get an ice cream. This is called instrumental conditioning. Some cues predict reward delivery, without requiring a specific action. This is called Pavlovian conditioning. Pavlovian cues can still prompt actions, such as approaching the truck, even though the action is not required. But exactly what happens in the brain to generate these actions during the two types of learning, is unclear.</p><p>Learning more about these reward-driven brain mechanisms might help scientists to develop better treatments for people with addiction or other conditions that involve compulsive reward-seeking behavior. Currently, scientists do not know enough about how the brain triggers this kind of behavior or how these processes lead to relapse in individuals who have been abstinent. Basic studies on the brain mechanisms that trigger reward-seeking behavior are needed.</p><p>Now, Richard et al. show that a greater activity in neurons, or brain cells, in a part of the brain called the ventral pallidum predicts a faster response to a reward cue. In the experiments, some rats were trained to approach a certain location when they heard a particular sound in order to receive sugar water, a form of instrumental conditioning. Another group of rats underwent Pavlovian training and learned to expect sugar water every time they heard sound even if they did nothing. Both groups learned to approach the sugar water location when they heard the cue, despite the different training requirements.</p><p>Richard et al. measured the activity of neurons in the ventral pallidum when the rats in the two groups heard the reward-associated sound. The experiments showed that the amount of activity in the brain cells in this area predicted whether a rat would approach the sugar-water delivery area and how quickly they would approach the reward after hearing the cue. The predictions were most reliable for rats that had to do something to get the sugar water. When Richard et al. reduced the activity in these cells they found the rats took longer to approach the reward source, but only when this action was required to receive sugar water. The experiments show that the ventral pallidum may provide the motivation to undertake reward-seeking behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ventral pallidum</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA022290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Jocelyn M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Jocelyn M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA014925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janak</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reward-related cues elicit phasic changes in activity in ventral pallidum neurons, which predict and functionally contribute to the speed of behaviors trained on the basis of act-outcome, but not stimulus-outcome, contingencies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tendency to seek rewards, like many adaptive behaviors, is influenced by multiple dissociable decision-making processes. These decision-making processes have different costs and benefits and may be differentially vulnerable to perturbations that contribute to psychopathology. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a critical node in the neural circuitry underlying reward-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), including relapse to drug and alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalivas and Volkow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). Neurons in the VP are known to respond to a variety of reward-related stimuli, including primary rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itoga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tindell et al., 2006</xref>), Pavlovian cues predicting reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tindell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2009</xref>), cues predicting reward availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>), and cues indicating specific appropriate reward-seeking actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito and Doya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tachibana and Hikosaka, 2012</xref>). Further, activity in VP is critical for normal levels of cue-elicited reward seeking across a variety of paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung and Balleine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prasad and McNally, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Yet, there is little consensus on the primary role of VP in driving reward-seeking behaviors, and how VP signaling contributes to reward seeking across behavioral domains and rewarding outcomes. While historically the VP has been suggested to act as a motor expression site for a ‘limbic-motor’ interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heimer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>) due to its close connections with motor output regions, more recent work has suggested a greater role for VP in reward processing itself. For instance, VP responses to cues have been argued to contribute to reward seeking by representing expected reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tachibana and Hikosaka, 2012</xref>), but have also been suggested to encode state and action values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito and Doya, 2009</xref>). Previously, we showed that VP neurons encode the incentive value of cues, as defined by their ability to invigorate instrumental reward-seeking actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined VP encoding of cue-driven reward seeking in two different behavioral models, in which cues generate superficially similar behavioral patterns based on similar levels of and variations in reward expectancy, after training with distinct underlying reward contingencies. The first model consists of Pavlovian conditioning, in which an auditory tone predicts the delivery of sucrose to a reward port. While delivery of the reward is not contingent on the animal’s behavior during the cue, over conditioning the animal learns to approach the reward port during the cue, prior to reward delivery. The second model consists of a discriminative stimulus task, similar to that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>), but modified to generate superficially similar behavior to that following Pavlovian conditioning. In this task, the animal is presented with an auditory cue (the discriminative stimulus, DS), which indicates the availability of sucrose reward from the port <italic>if</italic> the animal enters the reward port during the cue period. We found that although VP neurons respond robustly to reward-related cues in both tasks, these cue responses are only robustly predictive of reward seeking vigor when reward delivery is contingent upon that behavior. This suggests that VP neuron responses to cues contribute to reward seeking, not by driving locomotor vigor more generally, but by encoding an underlying decision process that is reflected in the latency of instrumental but not Pavlovian responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ventral pallidum population encoding of discriminative stimuli is more robust than Pavlovian cues</title><p>To assess the degree to which VP encoding of cue-elicited reward seeking depends on the underlying task structure, we trained rats in either an instrumental task (the ‘DS task’) or in Pavlovian conditioning. In the DS task, entry into the reward port during the DS (an auditory cue lasting up to 10 s) resulted in delivery of liquid sucrose (10%), whereas port entries during an alternative auditory cue (the non-reward stimulus [NS]) had no programmed consequences. During Pavlovian conditioning, presentations of one auditory cue (the CS+) predicted delivery of liquid sucrose at the end of the cue, irrespective of the animal’s port entry behavior, whereas presentations of an alternative auditory cue (the CS–) did not predict sucrose delivery. In both tasks, rats learned to enter the reward delivery port more quickly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) and frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) during the reward-related cue (DS or CS+) than the control cue (NS or CS–). They were trained until they made port entries during at least 70% of reward cue presentations (DS or CS+) and less than 30% of control cue presentations (NS or CS–). Rats trained in the two tasks did not differ in the number of training days required to meet training criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; t(10)=0.1249, p=0.9031, Bayes factor of 2.112 in favor of the null). Once the rats met the training criteria, they were implanted with drivable electrode arrays aimed at the VP. Most recording sites were centered in middle to slightly caudal locations in VP (0 to 0.24 mm behind bregma), though one rat trained in the Pavlovian task had electrodes centered more caudally (~0.5 mm caudal to bregma). All comparisons between encoding in the instrumental and Pavlovian tasks were conducted with and without this subject, to ensure that our conclusions were not biased on the basis of recording location.

Most DS excited neurons were significantly more excited by the DS than the NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; 132/189, 69.8%), whereas only 23.5% of DS-inhibited neurons were more inhibited by the DS than the NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; 20/85, 6% of the whole population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To further assess the ability of post-cue VP neuron firing to predict cue identity, we conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to assess the detection of either the DS or the CS+ versus their respective control cues. For each unit, we calculated the area under the ROC curve (auROC); auROCs greater than five indicate units that had greater firing rates on reward cue than control cue trials.

First, we assessed the magnitude of VP cue responses on trials with and without a behavioral response from those sessions with a sufficient number of trials without a response to allow reliable assessment of the difference (at least five trials). Because responding in these two tasks was more likely to approach 100% than in our previous experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>), probably due to the simpler, pre-potent nature of the port entry responses as opposed to a lever press, this trial criterion was lower than previously used, which may have reduced our ability to detect significant differences at an individual neuron level. When assessed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), about 20% of DS-excited neurons are significantly more responsive to the DS when it is followed by a response (24/130) and 16% of DS-inhibited neurons are more responsive on trials with a response (14/85).

This suggests that while latency encoding in the Pavlovian task is much weaker, VP firing rates do encode some information relating to the subsequent port entry latency. To determine when this information is first encoded by VP neurons, we assessed correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and the proportion of units with significant correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>) in 50 msec windows starting from 0.5 s before to 1 s after cue onset.

By contrast, the distribution of correlation coefficients in the DS task did not significantly differ from 0 until the window 50–100 msec post-DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; q=4.171, p&lt;0.05), when phasic cue excitations are occurring in the bulk of correlated neurons.</p><p>Overall, encoding of the latency of cue-elicited reward seeking by individual VP units and in the population is much stronger in the instrumental task than in the Pavlovian task.

Overall, although we found that velocity increased and distance from the port decreased shortly after cue onset for both tasks, instrumentally trained rats moved at greater velocities post-cue (F[1,118]=23.166, p&lt;0.001) and were positioned at further distances from the port at cue onset (F[1,118]=6.99, p=0.009). We also assessed movement onsets to determine whether greater encoding of latency in instrumentally conditioned rats might be due to a greater incidence of movement onsets during the immediate post-cue period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Rats trained under Pavlovian versus instrumental contingencies did not differ in the likelihood of movement onset during the first 300 ms post cue in which we assessed neural firing (13.3% of post-DS movement onsets and 8.3% of post-CS+ movement onsets; X<sub>2</sub>=0.345, p=0.56), and we did not observe a significant difference in movement-onset times (F[1,74]=1.365, p=0.24). To determine whether subtle differences in movement (velocity and movement onset) and/or non-movement (distance) variables drive differences in neural encoding between the two tasks, we assessed whether the relationships between post-cue firing and latency in individual neurons were predicted by the relationship between post-cue firing in these same units and trial-by-trial a) distance from port, b) post-cue velocity, or c) movement onset latency. We found that the only significant single predictor of latency encoding was distance encoding, in that neurons that had greater post-cue firing rates on trials with shorter port entry latencies, also had greater post-cue firing on trials where the rat was closer to the port at cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>; F[1,140]=16.295, p&lt;0.001), similar to results previously reported for the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGinty et al., 2013</xref>). This relationship between encoding of proximity and vigor depended on training history (F[1,140]=4.55, p=0.034), as distance encoding in the rats trained under a Pavlovian contingency was not significantly predictive of latency encoding (F[1,44]=2.09, p=0.15), whereas distance encoding robustly predicted latency encoding in instrumentally trained rats (F[1,96]=35.632, p&lt;0.001). Notably, latency encoding was not significantly predicted by the degree to which neurons encoded post-cue velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>; F[1,140]=–0.335, p=0.56) or movement-onset latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>; F[1,140]=1.83, p=0.17). Proximity encoding has been suggested to reflect pre-cue variables such as attention or ‘task engagement’, but may also reflect encoding of other information derived from distance, such as expected effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGinty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola, 2010</xref>).

Therefore, we next sought to assess the contributions of glutamatergic, dopaminergic and substance P signaling in the VP to the likelihood and vigor of cue-elicited reward seeking after instrumental or Pavlovian training. Infusions of either a mixture of the glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and MK801 or the relatively non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol had similar effects to VP inactivation with GABA agonists in both tasks. Glutamate or dopamine blockade reduced the probability of port entry during the cue (Sidak p&lt;0.001 for both), though only the effect of glutamate blockade was selective to the DS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>; DS Sidak, p&lt;0.001; NS Sidak, p=n .s.) whereas flupenthixol reduced the probability of port entry during both cue types (DS Sidak, p&lt;0.001; NS Sidak, p&lt;0.003). Glutamate or dopamine antagonism selectively increased port entry latency during the DS (CNQX-MK801 Sidak, p=0.005; flupenthixol Sidak, p=0.022), but not during the NS.

Infusions of the NK-1 antagonist WIN51708, used to block the effects of substance P, had no effect on port entry probability or latency in either task. Because, for many behaviors, VP functionality appears to be organized topographically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Root et al., 2015</xref>), we mapped our behavioral effects for each subject at each microinfusion site in the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>) to determine whether the null effects on latency in the Pavlovian task were due to mixed effects at distinct neuroanatomical locations. This does not appear to be the case because the vast majority of our infusion sites were located in the caudal half of VP, in and around the hedonic ‘hot spot’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho and Berridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Berridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2007</xref>), and we found inconsistent changes in post-CS+ port entry latency even at this particular anatomical location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we demonstrate that while most VP neurons are responsive to reward-related cues in either a Pavlovian or instrumental task, the information encoded by these responses differs depending on the associative structure of the task. VP neuron responses to either a Pavlovian cue signaling reward delivery or a discriminative stimulus signaling reward availability are equally predictive of a cue’s learned value, in that they selectively respond to the reward-related cue in comparison to its control cue. But, the degree to which VP cue responses predict the likelihood of a behavioral response are comparatively weak in the Pavlovian task. In addition, while the firing of many cue-excited VP neurons is predictive of response latency on a trial-by-trial basis, in the Pavlovian task, the proportion of VP neurons with firing rates at cue onset that predict response latency does not exceed chance levels. Further, we show that while activity in VP functionally contributes to normal response latency in the instrumental task, it does not in the Pavlovian task. Finally, we demonstrate that normal response latency in the instrumental task depends on local dopamine and glutamate signaling, but not on substance P signaling, the main source of excitatory drive from the nucleus accumbens. Together, these results suggest that VP neuron firing that predicts and contributes to response latency in the instrumental task is not merely a motor invigoration signal, but more likely a neural instantiation of an underlying decision-making process that is reflected behaviorally by response latency in the instrumental task, but not the Pavlovian task.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Do VP neurons drive a specific subset of motor behaviors?</title><p>Our results demonstrate that VP neurons do not drive movement invigoration generically, but encode a variable that is manifested by port entry latency after instrumental, but not after Pavlovian training. Yet, VP has not been classically construed as a motor output region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heimer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mogenson et al., 1980</xref>) without cause. Manipulations of VP alter a wide range of motor behaviors including general locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchill and Kalivas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Napier and Chrobak, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Root et al., 2015</xref>), though reports of locomotor activation linked to VP may be more related to activity in nearby structures such as the rostral preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zahm et al., 2014</xref>). The differences in VP encoding of the latency of instrumental and Pavlovian approach behaviors that we report here are inconsistent with a general role in motor invigoration, but perhaps VP signaling serves to invigorate a specific subset of behavioral responses. For instance, similar cue-related signals in the nucleus accumbens and in midbrain dopamine neurons have been proposed to promote ‘flexible approach’, in which animals must navigate toward their goal location from a flexible starting location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGinty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola, 2010</xref>). It is unlikely, however, that promotion of flexible approach accounts for the differences in encoding that we report here for superficially similar approach behaviors. VP neuron activity may contribute to at least some forms of flexible approach, but only when that approach reflects a specific underlying decision variable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What decision variables are encoded by latency-predicting VP neurons?</title><p>VP activity has been suggested to signal many different decision-making variables including action values or state values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito and Doya, 2009</xref>). One critical difference between cue responses in the instrumental versus Pavlovian tasks may be the degree to which state values are linked to action values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck and Costa, 2017</xref>). While a stronger link between state and action values in the instrumental task may explain a more robust relationship between VP cue responses and reward-seeking behaviors, the existing literature does not make clear predictions about how changes in state value should alter response latency in these two conditioning paradigms, or about how response latency might be altered separately from response probability after Pavlovian conditioning. An alternative variable that predicts a more specific relationship between VP activity and the animals’ reward-seeking vigor or motivation is incentive value, or the degree to which cues have the ability to activate motivational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindra, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), including those that invigorate ongoing reward-seeking actions. We and others have shown that this property of incentive cues requires normal activity in VP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leung and Balleine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prasad and McNally, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that latency-encoding neurons are more likely to also encode proximity in instrumentally trained rats supports the hypothesis that these firing patterns reflect an underlying variable that is related to both proximity and response vigor. Proximity-encoding signals have been hypothesized to reflect encoding of information derived from distance, such as reward expectancy or expected effort, but may also be influenced by pre-cue factors such as ‘task engagement’ or motivational state at cue onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGinty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicola, 2010</xref>), consistent with an incentive motivational role for this firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Within this framework, VP neuron activity may represent the incentive value of both the instrumental DS and the Pavlovian CS+, but the latency to approach the reward location following Pavlovian cues does not reflect this incentive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson and Flagel, 2009</xref>). This is supported by our finding that proximity encoding is similar in the two tasks, but is only correlated with latency encoding in the instrumental task. Alternatively, incentive value may be low in the Pavlovian task, and therefore the corresponding encoding less apparent, consistent with weaker VP population-level representation of reward cues in this task in general. We should note that VP activity both encodes and contributes to the likelihood of behavioral responses following the Pavlovian cue, though this encoding is weaker than in the instrumental task. VP activity may contribute to response likelihood in the Pavlovian task via the same underlying circuits and processes as in the instrumental task, or through distinct neural and psychological mechanisms, such as thencoding of incentive value versus expected reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tindell et al., 2009</xref>), as some evidence suggests that reward value and motivation rely on dissociable neural mechanisms even within VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creed et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional heterogeneity along the rostrocaudal axis of VP: neural encoding of response vigor</title><p>Because rostral and caudal VP neurons have different morphologic and electrophysiologic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson and Osborne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kupchik and Kalivas, 2013</xref>), and differentially modulate reward-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ho and Berridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McBride et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panagis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Berridge, 2005</xref>), we previously assessed neural responses in the DS task in rostral, middle and caudal subregions of VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Richard et al., 2016</xref>). We observed similar population encoding at rostral, middle and caudal recording sites in VP, in that most neurons in each subregion exhibited excitations following the DS, and post-cue firing in 18–25% of neurons predicted response latency. Although neurons throughout VP appear to encode cue value and the subsequent reward seeking similarly across the rostrocaudal axis, discrete populations may be differentially involved in dissociable behavioral responses to these reward cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milton and Everitt, 2010</xref>), including their ability to act as conditioned reinforcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Torregrossa and Kalivas, 2008</xref>) or to generate instrumental reward-seeking or other reward-related motivational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leung and Balleine, 2013</xref>). Here, we aimed to reduce the potential influence of subregional heterogeneity on differences in encoding or functional effects between the two tasks by focusing our recording and injections in the same middle to slightly caudal area of VP, in and around the VP ‘hot spot’.

The microdrive carrying the electrode arrays was lowered by 80–160 µm at the end of each session with satisfactory behavior (&gt;60% of DS or CS+ presentations with a response), in order to obtain a new set of neurons for each session that was included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of electrophysiological recordings</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>Isolation of individual units was performed off-line with Offline Sorter (Plexon) using principal component analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghazizadeh et al., 2012</xref>). Interspike interval distribution, cross-correlograms and autocorrelograms were used to ensure that single units were isolated. Only units with well-defined waveforms with characteristics that were constant over the entire recording session were included in the study. Sorted units were exported to NeuroExplorer 3.0 and Matlab for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Determination of the optimal bin size</title><p>Optimal bin size was determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambroggi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghazizadeh et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the optimal bin size for each neuron was found using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Because the optimal bin size is rather large for most neurons, and because the AIC shows a fast reduction over small bin sizes, followed by slow changes around the optimal bin size, we used the smallest possible bin size that showed less than a 10% change from the optimal AIC value. This bin size, referred to as the deflection point, was on average 50 ms across the population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Response detection</title><p>Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs), constructed around the behavioral events using the optimal bin size, were used to detect the presence of excitations and inhibitions, as well as their onsets and offsets, in comparison to a 10 s baseline period prior to cue onset. At least one bin outside of the 99% confidence interval of the baseline during the analysis window for each event was required to determine an excitation or inhibition for that event. Onset detection was performed using a telescopic approach: within the first bin outside of the 99% confidence interval, we searched for the first of three 10 ms bins in which firing was beyond the 99% confidence interval of the baseline based on a 10 ms bin size. This allowed us to determine onset times using the highest valid resolution for each PSTH. Response offset was identified by finding the start of the first bin after the detected onset in which firing fell within the 99% confidence interval for at least 300 ms. Because inhibitions are more difficult to detect using this method, we also assessed response direction by running Wilcoxon sign-rank tests on firing during the 300 ms post-cue versus firing during the 10 s baseline period; this enabled us to detect significant inhibitions in firing rate that could not be detected using the telescopic onset detection approach. To compare firing in response to different task events (e.g. DS versus NS), Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were run on event-related firing during these same windows. The firing rate of each neuron during each bin of the PSTH was transformed to a z-score as follows: (F<sub>i</sub> – F<sub>mean</sub>)/F<sub>sd</sub>, where F<sub>i</sub> is the firing rate of the <italic>i</italic>th bin of the PSTH, and F<sub>mean</sub> and F<sub>sd</sub> are the mean and the SD of the firing rate during the 10 s baseline period. Color-coded maps and average traces were constructed on the basis of these z-scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis</title><p>To assess the ability of VP neural firing to predict the presence or identity of cues and subsequent behavioral responses, we conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluating: (1) the DS or CS+ response window in comparison to baseline, (2) the DS window versus the NS window or (3) the CS+ window versus the CS– windows, and (4) cue presentations that are followed by a port entry versus cue presentations that are not followed by a port entry. For each analysis, we assessed the probability that firing during each window met criteria that ranged from zero to the maximum firing rate for that neuron, and plotted the true positive rate (the likelihood that the firing in the window of interest was above criteria) against the false positive rate (the likelihood that the firing in the control window was above criteria) to create a ROC curve for each neuron. We then assessed the area under the ROC curve (auROC) for all VP neurons as well as the average ROC curve for the whole population. We also conducted ROC analysis comparing two randomly selected baseline windows and then compared the test auROC distributions to this control auROC distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Correlation analysis and shuffled data controls</title><p>To assess the relationship between post-DS and post-CS+ firing rate and latency to enter the reward port in individual neurons, we ran Spearman’s rank correlations. To assess the degree to which significant correlations occur spuriously in a small percentage of units, we ran Spearman correlations on 1,000 iterations of shuffled data. The trial-by-trial latency was randomly shuffled for each neuron for each iteration, and Spearman correlations that related latency and firing rate during the 90–300 ms post-cue window were assessed for each neuron. We then evaluated the distribution of both the number of units with significant correlations (at p&lt;0.05) and the mean correlation coefficient, confirming that both the mean correlation coefficient and the number of significant units from the real data were well outside the shuffled data distribution. To assess the degree to which these correlations were cue locked, we assessed the relationship between firing rate and port entry latency during 50 msec windows beginning 0.5 s prior to the cue onset, and finishing 1 s after. We ran a one-way ANOVA on the correlation coefficients for these windows, using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons to determine the bin during which the correlation coefficients first differed from baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Comparing population and rate encoding across the tasks</title><p>To assess differences in population encoding (i.e. the degree to which the proportions of neurons that responded to task events differed) across the two tasks, we used chi-squared (X<sub>2</sub>) tests. To assess differences in the rate encoding of cue identity (auROCs), response likelihood (auROCs), response latency (correlation coefficients) or response variability (latency or firing rate standard deviations) between the two tasks, we used two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate. When the effect of task had a critical non-significant effect, we followed this analysis by calculating a Bayes factor to assess support for the null hypothesis (Scaled JZS Bayes Factor).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Video data acquisition, processing and analysis</title><p>For a subset of recording sessions, overhead video was captured at 30 frames per s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For those subjects for which video was available (n = 4, 2 instrumental and 2 Pavlovian), Noldus Ethovision software was used to track the position of a red LED mounted on the recording headstage located on top of the rats’ heads during the session, with the maximum number of recorded units located in VP for each subject. The position of the LEDs was transformed into a position coordinate, with missing data points filled in using linear interpolation. An experimenter who was blind to conditioning group viewed all pre- and post-cue periods to adjust for errors in tracking or interpolation manually. These position coordinates were used to determine frame-by-frame velocity (cm/s) and distance from the reward port (cm) during the pre- and post-cue periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 51—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>). Velocity data were used to determine the latency of movement onsets following each cue presentation, by finding the first of at least five consecutive frames with velocity values greater than the 95% confidence interval of baseline velocity (5 s pre-cue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). To assess differences in these variables across the two tasks, we fit linear mixed-effects models for each movement variable with a fixed effect for training history and a random effect for subject. To determine the degree to which neural encoding of port entry latency was related to encoding of these response characteristics, we first computed Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for each unit and trial-by-trial velocity (0 to 0.5 s and 0.5 to 1 s post-cue, cm/s), distance from the port (cm) and movement onset latency (s). Then, we fit a linear mixed-effects model of the correlation coefficients relating neural firing to port entry latency, with fixed effects for training history and the correlation coefficients for velocity, distance and movement onset latencies, as well as a random effect for subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Intracranial microinjections</title><p>Drug microinjections were administered bilaterally in a 0.3 µl volume on test days spaced at least 48 hr apart, and counterbalanced for drug order across rats. On test days, solutions were brought to room temperature, and were infused at a rate of 0.3 µl per minute using a syringe pump attached via PE-20 tubing to stainless steel injectors (Plastics One, 29-gauge) that extended 2 mm beyond the end of the guide cannulae into VP. Injectors were left in place for 1 min to allow diffusion of the test solution, after which the experimenter replaced the obturators and immediately placed the rat in the testing chamber to begin the session. After reaching criteria in either task and prior to test sessions, rats received microinjections of vehicle immediately prior to a final training session, to habituate them to the testing procedure. Following each test day, rats received at least one drug-free retraining session to ensure that initial performance criteria were met.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Drugs and solutions</title><p>In order to test the importance of VP activity and the role of specific neurotransmitter systems in cue-elicited behavior, rats (n = 43; Pavlovian conditioning, n = 23; DS task, n = 20) received bilateral VP infusions of the following drugs (amounts given are per hemisphere): a mixture of the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist muscimol and the GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen (10 ng each in 0.3 µl 0.15 M saline) to inactivate VP; a mixture of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (450 ng) and the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (2 µg in 0.3 µl 90% saline/10% DMSO vehicle); the relatively non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist, flupenthixol (15 µg in 0.3 µl saline); and the NK-1 receptor antagonist WIN57108 (10 ng in 0.3 µl 90% saline/10% DMSO vehicle) to block the actions of substance P. Because WIN51708 and CNQX were initially dissolved in a small amount of DMSO, we also compared the effects of saline vehicle with the 90% saline/10% DMSO mixture to ensure that there were no differing effects of the vehicle solutions themselves, and found no significant effects (all ps &gt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of microinjection effects</title><p>On the basis of histological analysis, a total of 31 rats were included in the analysis of the microinjection effects, 17 from the Pavlovian task and 14 from the instrumental task. Effect sizes were not determined a priori, but we aimed to include at least 12 subjects with accurate bilateral cannulae placements in each behavioral group, based on established standards. To compare the effects of VP inactivation or receptor blockade on responses to Pavlovian versus instrumental cues, we primarily focused our analysis on the likelihood and latency of port entry during each cue type. To account for some missing data (e.g. when port entry probability went to zero, no latency data were available), we analyzed the data using linear mixed models (drug X cue type [CS+ versus CS- <italic>or</italic> DS versus NS]), followed by pairwise comparisons with Sidak corrections. To achieve this, we used Akaike’s information criteria to determine the best-fitting covariance model. Depending on the best-fitting covariance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2009</xref>), the degrees of freedom may be a non-integer value. In both tasks, the best fitting model for the assessment of latency was a first-order antedependence model and the best fitting model for the assessment of probability was an identity model. We also analyzed the number of port entries during the inter-trial interval using linear mixed models with an identity covariance structure, followed by pairwise comparisons with Sidak corrections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and electrode sites were labeled by passing a DC current through each electrode. All rats were perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline following by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4–24 hr, cryoprotected in 25% sucrose for &gt;48 hr, and sectioned at 50 um on a microtome. We verified the location of injection or recording sites using two methods. One set of tissue was stained with cresyl violet and analyzed using light microscopy. On the alternating set of sections, we performed immunohistochemistry for substance P (SP) to better demarcate the boundaries of VP. Sections were washed in PBS with bovine serum albumin and triton (PBST) for 20 min, and incubated in 10% normal donkey serum in PBST for 30 min, before incubating in primary antibody (rabbit anti-SP 1:6500 Immunostar #20064, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_572266">AB_572266</ext-link>) in PBST overnight at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBST three times, incubated in 2% normal donkey serum in PBS for 10 min, and incubated for 2 hr in secondary antibody in PBS (Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit 1:500 Thermo Fisher #A21207, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141637">AB_141637</ext-link>). Sections were then washed with PBS three times, mounted on coated glass slides in PBS, air-dried, coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI, and imaged on a fluorescent microscope. The dorsoventral location of recording sites was determined by subtracting the distance driven between recording sessions from the final recording location. Units that were recorded during sessions when the recording sites were determined to be localized outside of the VP were excluded from analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants F32 AA022290 (JMR) and R01 AA014925 (PHJ), and by a NARSAD Young Investigator Award (JMR).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examined the role of the ventral pallidium (VP) in encoding reward-seeking behaviors. The authors used a carefully designed pair of tasks, one involving Pavlovian conditioning and the other involving instrumental learning, to compare VP's role in both situations, controlling for visuo-motor factors (e.g., the same sensory cues and the same superficial behaviors). Results from electrophysiology and inactivation studies show converging evidence that VP encodes motivational incentives in both situations, but dissociable relationships with behavior. Specifically, VP inactivation leads to lower likelihood and higher latencies of reward approach in instrumental conditioning, but only leads to lower likelihood of approach (but no higher latency) in Pavlovian conditioning.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the study was well designed, conducted, and analyzed. There was also general enthusiasm for the idea of better understanding the role of the VP in learning and for distinguishing Pavlovian and instrumental learning.</p><p>However, the reviewers also agreed that a number of essential revisions are necessary, as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interpretation of the results rests strongly on the claim that behavior was essentially equivalent on the two tasks. However, this equivalence may be only superficial. It is important to show that the relatively subtle differences in neural activity and pharmacological effects on behavior for the two tasks types did not reflect the relatively subtle differences in behavior for the two tasks. This issue is important because it goes to the heart of how to interpret the rest of the data. Even if port entry probability and latency do not differ, these are more blunt tools than those employed for the analysis of neural data. For example, there could be differences in locomotor speed to approach the port that might be detectable with a set of beam breaks. There may be more subtle differences in consummatory behavior that could be detected by EMG analyses.</p><p>Consider, for example, the following two claims from the Abstract:</p><p>a) &quot;We find that cue elicited activity in many VP neurons predicts the latency of instrumental reward seeking, but not Pavlovian response latency.&quot; The distributions of latencies were different for the two tasks. Could that difference have accounted for this result? For example, port-entry latencies tended to be shorter in the instrumental case. It therefore seems possible that this effect is because there are more movement-related responses in the time window tested in that case. Likewise, this relationship between VP activity and response latency on the instrumental task stays consistent 0-1 sec after cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,I</xref>), despite the fact that the neural response is only strong right at the beginning of that epoch. How statistically reliable are the correlations computed with low spike counts (including for those measured before cue onset)?</p><p>b) &quot;Further, disruption of VP signaling increases the latency of instrumental but not Pavlovian reward seeking.&quot; Because the latency was tighter in instrumental conditions, is it possible that this condition was simply easier to disrupt (or at the very least easier to tell statistically if it was disrupted)?</p><p>Given that the reported behavioral similarities and differences between the two tasks was based on a relatively small number of animals, it seems like it would be useful to show the same analysis of behavioral data as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F and G</xref> for the 43 additional animals tested in the microinfusion studies.</p><p>2) It appears as though the history of reward for the two tasks is different, which in principle could lead to different learned valuation of the cues or actions taken by the animals. Can the authors discuss, or control for this in their analyses?</p><p>3) The authors describe the results in terms of incentive and conclude as to what the VP does not do (general motor envigoration) but remain extremely vague as to what they propose the VP does do (&quot;encode a motivational signal that may be uniquely integrated in the VP&quot;). Even the description in terms of incentive/motivational signal is a bit problematic – how could this produce distinct effects on reaction times (effects absent) from effects on choice (port entry – effects present) in the Pavlovian. The authors should ground their results in a theoretical proposal and discuss how their results support this theory in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33107.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The interpretation of the results rests strongly on the claim that behavior was essentially equivalent on the two tasks.

Overall, we think it unlikely that encoding of response latency in the instrumental task is specific to the movement response characteristics of the instrumental task used here, as we find very similar latency encoding using a version of the DS task in which rats were trained to make an entirely different operant response (lever press) as reported previously (Richard et al., 2016). Further, though “port-entry latencies tended to be shorter in the instrumental case”, short latency port entries did occur after the Pavlovian CS+ and were not preceded by greater post-cue firing than port entries that occurred at longer latencies (post-cue VP firing, training x port entry latency interaction: F(17,6500)=3.9765, p &lt; 0.001).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33107.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33107-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>To further assess whether neural encoding differences “reflect the relatively subtle differences in behavior for the two tasks” such as “differences in locomotor speed to approach the port”, as well as to determine whether “there are more movement-related responses in the time window tested” in instrumentally trained rats, we conducted detailed behavioral tracking analysis on videos that were obtained from a subset of subjects from the electrophysiological experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Based on this analysis we assessed velocity and distance from the reward port during the pre- and post-cue periods (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C-H</xref>), as well as the timing of post-cue movement onsets. The details of this analysis are now described in the Methods section of the revised manuscript. Overall, while we found that velocity and distance from the port changed on a similar timescale for both tasks, instrumentally-trained rats moved at greater velocities post-cue (starting 0-.5 sec, F(1,118)=23.166, p &lt; 0.001) and on average were positioned at further distances from the port at cue onset (F(1,118)=6.99, p = 0.009). We also assessed movement onsets to determine whether the correlation of cue-evoked firing with latency in instrumentally conditioned rats might be due to a greater incidence of movement onsets during the immediate post-cue period (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Rats trained under Pavlovian versus instrumental contingencies did not differ in the likelihood of movement onset during the first 300 msec post cue in which we assessed neural firing (13.3% of post-DS movement onsets and 8.3% of post-CS+ movement onsets; Χ2=.345, p = 0.56), and we did not observe a significant difference in movement onset times (F(1,74)=1.365, p = 0.24).</p><p>Yet the critical question remains whether these subtle differences in movement (velocity and movement onset) and/or non-movement (distance) variables drive differences in neural encoding between the two tasks. To answer this question, we assessed whether the relationships between post-cue firing and latency in individual neurons were predicted by the relationship between post-cue firing in these same units and trial-by-trial (a) distance from port, (b) post-cue velocity, or (c) movement onset latency, by fitting a linear mixed effects model that included these factors, along with a fixed effect for training and a random effect for subject. We found that the only significant single predictor of latency encoding was distance encoding, in that neurons that had greater post-cue firing rates on trials with shorter port entry latencies, also had greater post-cue firing on trials where the rat was closer to the port at cue onset (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A; F</xref>(1,140)=16.295, p &lt; 0.001). A relationship between neural firing and distance from the port suggests that these neurons fire more to the cue when the rat is more “engaged” in the task, consistent with an incentive motivational role for this firing. The relationship between distance and latency encoding was modulated by training history (F(1,140)=4.55, p = 0.034): distance encoding in the rats trained under a Pavlovian contingency was not significantly predictive of latency encoding (F(1,44)=2.09, p = 0.15), whereas distance encoding robustly predicted latency encoding in instrumentally trained rats (F(1,96)=35.632, p &lt; 0.001). This suggests a greater coupling of task engagement and action in the instrumental task than the Pavlovian. Latency encoding was not significantly predicted by the degree to which a neuron’s firing predicted post-cue velocity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B; F</xref>(1,140)=-.335, p = 0.56) or movement onsets (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C; F</xref>(1,140)=1.83, p = 0.17). The results of these analyses have been integrated into the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, this relationship between VP activity and response latency on the instrumental task stays consistent 0-1 sec after cue onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,I</xref>), despite the fact that the neural response is only strong right at the beginning of that epoch. How statistically reliable are the correlations computed with low spike counts (including for those measured before cue onset)?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we computed the correlations (blue line) between correlations computed in the larger response window 300 ms post-DS (blue shaded area) that were used for our primary analysis of latency encoding, with correlations computed in the smaller 50 ms windows (x-axis), which we utilized to examine the time course of latency encoding. This allowed us to assess whether the correlations in each bin were occurring in the same neurons whose phasic DS responses predicted port entry latency. Correlations computed based on the 300 ms post-DS were robustly correlated with those computed in smaller 50 ms bins within the 300 ms period, suggesting that these correlations from smaller bins (and therefore lower spike counts) are reliable indicators of the overall relationship between firing and latency. The decrease in correlation strength, and loss of significance 600 ms post-cue suggests that neurons with correlated activity at these later timepoints (after movement onsets) are not necessarily the same population that have immediate post-cue firing that predicts response latency. Because these later cue correlations are occurring during the bulk of movement initiation and locomotor activity, they are more likely to be contaminated by movement artifacts and/or responses related to port entry itself, which is why we focused our analysis on firing during phasic cue response prior to the bulk of movement onsets.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33107.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33107-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) &quot;Further, disruption of VP signaling increases the latency of instrumental but not Pavlovian reward seeking.&quot; Because the latency was tighter in instrumental conditions, is it possible that this condition was simply easier to disrupt (or at the very least easier to tell statistically if it was disrupted)?</p><p>Given that the reported behavioral similarities and differences between the two tasks was based on a relatively small number of animals, it seems like it would be useful to show the same analysis of behavioral data as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F and G</xref> for the 43 additional animals tested in the microinfusion studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also plotted and analyzed the behavioral training data from the microinjection study, as suggested by the reviewer, and include these data in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the training trajectory and differences for the two tasks was similar that of the electrophysiology groups, and while there were differences in average latency across the two tasks, we argue that these differences are not responsible for the selective functional effects for the following reasons. First, the lack of effect on latency after Pavlovian conditioning is not merely a problem of statistical detection, as more than half of the rats tested decreased their latency following VP inactivation (the opposite of the expected direction) and Bayes analysis suggests that the null hypothesis was more than twice as likely. Second, it is unlikely the lack of effect on latency in the Pavlovian rats was due to the slightly longer response latencies (making them more “difficult” to disrupt), as we found no relationship between port entry latency during the vehicle session and the change in latency following VP inactivation in either the instrumentally trained group (r(12)=-0.035, p = 0.91) or the Pavlovian conditioning group (r(12)=0.05, p = 0.88), suggesting that functional effects on latency in the instrumental task were not driven by those rats that had shorter latencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It appears as though the history of reward for the two tasks is different, which in principle could lead to different learned valuation of the cues or actions taken by the animals. Can the authors discuss, or control for this in their analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, because the delivery of reward is contingent on the rats’ behavior in the instrumental task, but not the Pavlovian, it is possible for differences in reward history to arise both between tasks and between rats. We have aimed, with the design of the training procedures for the instrumental task, to reduce the number of cue presentations in which the animal does not receive reward by presenting longer cues at the start of training, which progressively decrease in length across training days. To determine the impact of immediate reward history during recording sessions we assessed the number of the last 10 trials during which the animal made a response and whether that affected port entry latency on the current trial, and whether this differed depending on the relationship between port entry response and reward delivery (instrumental vs Pavlovian training). We found no effect (F(1,611)=0.03, p = 0.85), regardless of training history (F(1,611)=0.25, p = 0.61). Though our tasks were not designed with sufficient trials to reliably assess the impact of reward history within session on neural encoding, to assess whether neural encoding of latency was influenced by the number of cue-reward or cue-action-reward pairings on a larger scale, such as through overtraining, we assessed the impact of session number on the correlation coefficients between neural firing and port entry latency. We found no effect (F(1,691)=2.04, p = 0.15).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33107.023</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33107-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors describe the results in terms of incentive and conclude as to what the VP does not do (general motor envigoration) but remain extremely vague as to what they propose the VP does do (&quot;encode a motivational signal that may be uniquely integrated in the VP&quot;).

We disagree that framing VP neural responses that predict latency as an incentive or motivational signal is problematic. Our proposal, that cue-elicited activity in VP acts as an incentive signal, does not necessitate that incentive signals have distinct effects on reaction time versus response probability, as after instrumental conditioning, VP activity predicts and contributes to both. In the case of Pavlovian conditioning, the relationship between VP activity and response probability (which is weaker than after instrumental conditioning) may be driven by encoding of incentive value or may be related to a dissociable function of VP, such as encoding of reward expectancy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
