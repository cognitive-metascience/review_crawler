Although TP63 is an established lineage-survival oncogene in SCCs, therapeutic strategies have not been developed to target TP63 or it’s downstream effectors. In this study we demonstrate that TP63 directly regulates NRG1 expression in human SCC cell lines and that NRG1 is a critical component of the TP63 transcriptional program. Notably, we show that squamous tumors are dependent NRG1 signaling in vivo, in both genetically engineered mouse models and human xenograft models, and demonstrate that inhibition of NRG1 induces keratinization and terminal squamous differentiation of tumor cells, blocking proliferation and inhibiting tumor growth. Together, our findings identify a lineage-specific function of NRG1 in SCCs of diverse anatomic origin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NRG1</kwd><kwd>ERBB3</kwd><kwd>TP63</kwd><kwd>squamous cell cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TP63 regulates NRG1 in squamous cell cancers, and targeting of NRG1 induces cancer cell differentiation thereby NRG1 is a potential therapeutic target in squamous cell cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Within the past decade, lineage addiction has emerged as a common paradigm to explain how certain tumors depend on co-opted survival and self-renewal programs that drive the normal development of the tissues from which they arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</xref>). During normal development and tissue homeostasis, ‘master regulator’ transcription factors control large sets of genes regulating cellular identity, differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan and Kyba, 2013</xref>). Amplifications of master regulators act as oncogenic drivers in cancers arising in the tissues whose development they normally control. Examples include MITF, which directs melanocyte development and is amplified in some melanomas and NKX2.1, which directs development of the distal lung epithelium and is amplified in some lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kendall et al., 2007</xref>). Some cancers remain fully dependent on transcription factors expressed by precursor cells of the lineage from which they develop, even in the absence of genetic alterations in these genes. Examples include AR in prostate cancer and ESR1 in luminal breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garraway and Sellers, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite varied anatomic origins, squamous cell cancers (SCCs) share many common properties, including genetic and epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dotto and Rustgi, 2016</xref>). The TP63 transcription factor exemplifies an important lineage dependency in SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ramsey et al., 2013</xref>). Amplification of <italic>TP63</italic> is prevalent in SCCs, and TP63 expression is used to distinguish SCCs from other cancer subtypes in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dotto and Rustgi, 2016</xref>). SCCs arise in numerous organ systems that contain stratified or pseudo-stratified epithelia, including the lung, head and neck, esophagus, skin, bladder and cervix. Interestingly, like other lineage survival oncogenes, TP63 is a key regulator of the progenitor cells in the basal cell compartment during normal development and homeostasis of most stratified or pseudostratified epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mills et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). Despite its established role as a driver of lineage dependency, TP63 is a transcription factor, and as such is challenging to target therapeutically.</p><p>Here we show that NRG1 expression is directly regulated by TP63 in SCCs of various organs, and that co-expression of NRG1 and its receptor ERBB3 is prevalent in SCCs. Moreover, we find that many of the SCC models that co-express NRG1 and ERBB3 depend on NRG1 autocrine signaling in vivo, in contrast to non-squamous cancers that exhibit NRG1 autocrine signaling but are not dependent on it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TP63 regulates NRG1 expression</title><p>TP63 is highly expressed in basal cells of various epithelia and is required for the progenitor cell function. In addition, TP63 acts as a key survival factor and driver of SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rocco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Thurfjell et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, studies of normal mammary basal cells established that TP63 can directly activate NRG1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Forster et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated whether this transcriptional wiring exists in SCCs. We found that <italic>NRG1</italic> and <italic>TP63</italic> expression significantly correlated in both esophageal and lung squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) as determined from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TP63 has two isoform classes that either contain (TA-TP63) or lack (DeltaN-TP63) an N-terminal transactivation domain. Despite lacking this domain, deltaN-TP63, the major isoform expressed in SCCs, functions as both a positive and negative transcriptional regulator of different target gene subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hibi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moll and Slade, 2004</xref>). We evaluated whether TP63 regulates NRG1 expression in SCCs using siRNAs to knockdown all <italic>TP63</italic> isoforms (siTP63 # 14) or only the <italic>TA-TP63</italic> isoforms (siTA-TP63 # 13) and assessing expression of both isoforms of the NRG1 EGF-like domain, <italic>NRG1α</italic> and <italic>NRG1β</italic>, by qPCR in the OE-21 and KYSE-140 SCC cell lines. Knockdown of just the TA isoforms modestly reduced <italic>NRG1</italic> expression, whereas silencing of all isoforms robustly decreased <italic>NRG1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further expanded this finding in an additional cell line, KYSE-180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>deltaN-TP63</italic> significantly reduced <italic>NRG1</italic> transcripts, confirming that deltaN-TP63 regulates NRG1 expression in SCCs. Immunoblotting confirmed knockdown of deltaN-TP63 at the protein level. In addition, we determined whether NRG1 is a direct transcriptional target of deltaN-TP63 by ChIP-PCR using antibodies for TP63alpha and deltaN-TP63 and PCR primers that amplify the NRG1 promoter. Binding of both TP63 isoforms was significantly enriched at the region −30 kB from the transcriptional start site (TSS), which encompasses the TP63 binding motif, compared to the control locus at −21 kB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that deltaN-TP63 directly regulates NRG1 transcription in SCC.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46551.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TP63 regulates NRG1 in SCC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation of <italic>TP63</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> in LUSC (n = 223) and Esophageal (n = 263) patient samples in TCGA data set.

We reasoned that in order for NRG1 to promote SCC growth, tumors would have to co-express NRG1 and its receptor ERBB3. Interestingly, <italic>NRG1/ERBB3</italic> co-expression appeared prevalent in lung and head and neck SCCs, but was notably rare in lung adenocarcinoma across the various cancer datasets available in TCGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To ascertain whether SCCs co-expressing NRG1 and ERBB3 are responsive to inhibition of NRG1 signaling, we screened a panel of cell lines from SCC indications including lung, esophageal and skin for growth sensitivity to an NRG1 blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hegde et al., 2013</xref>) in vitro. Anti-NRG1 treatment modestly inhibited the growth of cell lines expressing both NRG1 and ERBB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because the p63 transcriptional program is critical for both maintenance and cell fate determination of epithelial progenitor cells, we reasoned that perturbation of this program would be more impactful in vivo. We assessed the effect of NRG1 inhibition on xenograft tumors derived from the FaDu head and neck, HCC95 lung and KYSE-180 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma lines. Importantly, anti-NRG1 treatment markedly inhibited tumor growth in each of these models to an extent that far exceeded that observed in vitro. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, increased keratinization and changes in tumor cell morphology were observed in tumors from anti-NRG1 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further evaluate the NRG1-dependency in ERBB3/NRG1 co-expressing squamous cell cancers, we tested the efficacy of anti-NRG1 in lung SCC PDX models. Again, anti-NRG1 significantly inhibited the tumor growth of three models that co-express NRG1 and ERBB3, resulting in tumor stasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46551.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Modest but significant growth inhibition of SCCs by anti-NRG1 treatment in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NRG1 and ERBB3 mRNA levels in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patient samples from TCGA.

Histological analysis revealed that in all models anti-NRG1-treated tumors exhibited a more well-differentiated appearance, with increased eosinophilic cytoplasm consistent with enhanced keratinization, indicating that anti-NRG1 treatment was driving differentiation in these tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, anti-NRG1-treated tumors showed a dramatic increase in the expression of KRT10, a differentiation-specific keratin normally restricted to the post-mitotic layers of stratified-keratinizing and cornifying epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Immunoblot analyses of treated tumors showed that anti-NRG1 inhibited ERBB3 activation and decreased the levels of multiple proliferation markers, consistent with a mechanism in which differentiation is induced at the expense of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Anti-NRG1 treatment caused significant changes in the levels of nearly all the genes in the panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, many of the genes upregulated by anti-NRG1 treatment are associated with differentiation of stratified epithelia, such as <italic>KLK7</italic>, <italic>BNC1</italic> and <italic>ADAMTS1</italic>, demonstrating a profound effect on the differentiation state of the tumor cells that becomes more pronounced with ongoing treatment. Of note, NRG1 is itself a marker of airway basal cells, and anti-NRG1 treatment resulted in downregulation of the NRG1 transcript. Upon differentiation, airway basal cells cluster with keratinocytes in unsupervised analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hackett et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated markers of keratinocyte differentiation and found that anti-NRG1 treatment resulted in strong upregulation of several well-established keratinocyte differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), while the expression of several lung progenitor cell markers was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Treatment of SCC cell lines with anti-NRG1 in vitro also increased expression of the differentiation markers <italic>KRT1</italic>, <italic>KRT10</italic>, <italic>IVL</italic> and <italic>KRTDAP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the magnitude of upregulation was much lower than in the tumors, consistent with the more modest effects of anti-NRG1 treatment on the proliferation of cell lines in vitro.</p><p>NRG1 signaling supports progenitor cell function and regeneration in a diverse set of normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>). Our data suggest that NRG1 may serve a similar function downstream of TP63 in tumors derived from squamous epithelia. We show that treating squamous tumors with an NRG1 blocking antibody reduced proliferation, concomitant with induced cellular differentiation and increased keratin production. The marked difference in response between in vitro and in vivo models is consistent with a pro-differentiation effect of anti-NRG1 treatment, as cancer cells are known to undergo dedifferentiation and lose tissue-specific expression patterns and differentiation capacity when cultured long term on plastic. In contrast, although NRG1 and ERBB3 co-expression is prevalent in ovarian tumors, ovarian cancer models did not respond to NRG1 inhibition in vivo. Our model predicts such a result, given that fewer than 10% of epithelial ovarian tumors express p63 and it is not a lineage oncogene in this cancer type.</p><p>EGFR signaling is known to be an important driver in SCCs and anti-EGFR therapies have been approved for the treatment of head and neck and lung SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sacco and Worden, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Thakur and Wozniak, 2017</xref>). In contrast, NRG1-ERBB3 signaling has been implicated as a resistance mechanism to anti-EGFR therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). However, dual inhibition of ERBB3 and EGFR did not show significant clinical benefit compared to EGFR inhibition alone. Our findings on the role of NRG1 in SCCs raise the possibility that NRG1 may still provide resistance to EGFR therapeutics through ERBB4 receptor activation when ERBB3 is inhibited, and provide rationale for exploring the clinical benefit of NRG1 inhibition in combination with EGFR inhibition in SCCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species)or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strainbackground <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td valign="bottom">C.B-17 SCID beige mice</td><td>Charles River Labs</td><td>CB17.Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>Lyst<sup>bg-J</sup>/Crl</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strainbackground <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td>Athymic nude mice</td><td>Harlan Sprague Dawley (Livermore facility)</td><td>Hsd:Athymic Nude-<italic>Foxn1<sup>nu</sup></italic></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M. musculus)</td><td><italic>Lgr5</italic><sup>CreERT2+</sup>;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.

Although NRG1 has already been established as a TP63 target in breast cells and NRG1/ERBB signaling has already been reported to play a role in squamous cell carcinoma biology, a strength of the work is the use of human material, murine models and cancer cell lines as well as an antibody to block NRG, which suggests that blocking NRG may affect tumor maintenance.

The reviewers were unclear whether the findings are true in all squamous tissues or are specific for a particular squamous epithelium. This should be addressed, and the title should be changed to more accurately reflect the findings presented in the manuscript.</p><p>2) Further evidence to support co-expression/co-localization of NRG and p63 in SCC would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) The use of the blocking antibody is powerful but the details of how specific this reagent is for NRG are lacking.

They found that p63 and NRG expression co-occurred in the TCGA lung and esophageal cancer datasets. They showed that suppressing p63 decreased NRG expression and was localized to the NRG. Using a NRG antibody they showed that there was a modest effect on cell proliferation but a stronger effect in some tumor models. They argue that the effects on tumors is due to SCC differentiation.</p><p>Overall these experiments are well described and well controlled. The observations are timely and important and may have therapeutic implications. However, there are a few points that require some additional clarification.</p><p>The authors argue that the NRG plays a key role in SCC or those that co-express NRG and p63. However, they do not show this directly. It would be helpful to perform experiments in a panel of cell lines in which these markers are noted so that the point can be made clear. This is particularly important since the authors show that some tumors don't respond to anti-NRG, suggesting that they don't co-express p63 and NRG but this is not shown.</p><p>It is also not clear whether the tumors regress or simply arrest. It would be helpful to show a waterfall plot for each tumor.</p><p>It is also not clear why squamous differentiation would not affect proliferation. Have the authors formally assessed whether there is evidence of squamous differentiation in the 2D cultures?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors show that NRG1 is a transcriptional target of p63 and argue that anti-NRG1 could be an effective therapy for a wide variety of squamous cell carcinomas. This data is interesting; however, the authors use a very limited number of cell lines and in vivo models. To strengthen the manuscript, the authors should focus on one type of SCC with a more robust number of cell lines and in vivo models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Hedge et al. show that TP63 directly regulates NRG1 expression in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. In addition, they show that treatment with an anti-NRG1 antibody inhibits the growth of SCC xenograft models and provide evidence that inhibition of NRG1 induces keratinization and terminal squamous differentiation of tumor cells. Although the data are potentially interesting, there are some major issues with the experimental design, which include the following:</p><p>1) All experiments aimed at elucidating NRG1 function utilize an NRG1 blocking antibody. However, the authors fail to demonstrate (e.g. by using genetic tools) that the phenotype observed in their model systems upon antibody treatment is specifically mediated by NRG1 inhibition.</p><p>2) NRG1 has already been established as a TP63 target in breast cells and NRG1/ERBB signaling has already been reported to play a role in squamous cell carcinoma biology. The authors provide some evidence that NRG1 inhibition decreases SCC cell proliferation and promotes cell differentiation. This hypothesis should be further investigated in properly controlled in 3D cell culture models where the role of ERBB3 and ERBB4 signaling could also be addressed.</p><p>3) In Figure 1, it would be important to perform double IHC/IF to demonstrate co-localization of deltaN-TP63 and NRG1 at the protein level in tumor cells within human SCC tissue samples.</p><p>4) In Figure 3, immunoblotting data documenting inhibition of <italic>Nrg1/ErbB</italic> signaling in the treated in vivo models should be provided.</p><p>5) In Figure 4, data for anti-Ragweed control (3 dose) should be showed for all experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46551.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The title is quite broad.

Unfortunately, the available NRG1 antibodies do not work for immunofluorescence, IHC or even western blot. We have tested many different antibodies for NRG1 in the past and have found them to be non-selective. We always perform shRNA knockdown of NRG1 to validate any commercial antibodies and so far, we have not found one that shows a specific staining pattern. Moreover, the blocking antibodies used in this paper are also not suitable for those applications. However, we would like to bring to the reviewer’s attention that we have provided TP63, NRG1, ERBB3 and ERBB4 mRNA levels in a table format just below the in vitro growth assay in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The use of the blocking antibody is powerful but the details of how specific this reagent is for NRG are lacking.

We have added a sentence pointing the readers to this publication for additional details on the antibody properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should clarify whether tumors regress or arrest after treatment with the antibody. A waterfall plot of all of the tumors would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a waterfall plot of all tumors as a supplementary figure. The tumors indeed undergo stasis not regression, consistent with the role of NRG1 in regulating differentiation, not cell survival. As discussed in our final paragraph, EGFR and other signaling pathways also play an important role in driving these tumors and inhibition of NRG1 could drive deeper responses when combined with EGFR inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is there squamous differentiation in cell lines? This needs to be assessed. If so, it is surprising that this did not affect proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this critical question. We carried out qPCR analysis of four differentiation markers in three different squamous cell carcinoma lines treated with anti-NRG1 or control antibody in vitro. The result are provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 3. Consistent with our in vivo findings, the cell lines treated in vitro also showed significant increases in multiple differentiation markers. However, the magnitude of induction was much lower in vitro, consistent with the more modest effects on proliferation observed in vitro compared to the tumor growth inhibition in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although several experimental models are used, it would be helpful to perform similar experiments in at least three cell lines or to determine whether there are specific squamous tissues in which these findings are most relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted additional experiments as mentioned above with 3 cell lines; FaDu (Head and Neck), HCC95 (lung) and KYSE-180 (esophageal) squamous cell carcinomas. The induction of differentiation markers upon treatment was highest in the lung and esophageal lines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
