Studies in humans and rodents suggest that retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in these computations. We developed an RSC-dependent behavioral task in which head-fixed mice learned the spatial relationship between visual landmark cues and hidden reward locations. Two-photon imaging revealed that these cues served as dominant reference points for most task-active neurons and anchored the spatial code in RSC. This encoding was more robust after task acquisition. Decoupling the virtual environment from mouse behavior degraded spatial representations and provided evidence that supralinear integration of visual and motor inputs contributes to landmark encoding. V1 axons recorded in RSC were less modulated by task engagement but showed surprisingly similar spatial tuning. Our data indicate that landmark representations in RSC are the result of local integration of visual, motor, and spatial information.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When moving through a city, people often use notable or familiar landmarks to help them navigate. Landmarks provide us with information about where we are and where we need to go next. But despite the ease with which we – and most other animals – use landmarks to find our way around, it remains unclear exactly how the brain makes this possible.</p><p>One area that seems to have a key role is the retrosplenial cortex, which is located deep within the back of the brain in humans. This area becomes more active when animals use visual landmarks to navigate. It is also one of the first brain regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, which may help to explain why patients with this condition can become lost and disoriented, even in places they have been many times before.</p><p>To find out how the retrosplenial cortex supports navigation, Fischer et al. measured its activity in mice exploring a virtual reality world. The mice ran through simulated corridors in which visual landmarks indicated where hidden rewards could be found. The activity of most neurons in the retrosplenial cortex was most strongly influenced by the mouse’s position relative to the landmark; for example, some neurons were always active 10 centimeters after the landmark.</p><p>In other experiments, when the landmarks were present but no longer indicated the location of a reward, the same neurons were much less active. Fischer et al. also measured the activity of the neurons when the mice were running with nothing shown on the virtual reality, and when they saw a landmark but did not run. Notably, the activity seen when the mice were using the landmarks to find rewards was greater than the sum of that recorded when the mice were just running or just seeing the landmark without a reward, making the “landmark response” an example of so-called supralinear processing.</p><p>Fischer et al. showed that visual centers of the brain send information about landmarks to retrosplenial cortex. But only the latter adjusts its activity depending on whether the mouse is using that landmark to navigate. These findings provide the first evidence for a “landmark code” at the level of neurons and lay the foundations for studying impaired navigation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. By showing that retrosplenial cortex neurons combine different types of input in a supralinear fashion, the results also point to general principles for how neurons in the brain perform complex calculations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retrosplenial cortex</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor integration</kwd><kwd>spatial navigation</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>population imaging</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS106031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harnett</surname><given-names>Mark Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harnett</surname><given-names>Mark Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NEC Corporation Fund for Research in Computers and Communications, MIT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harnett</surname><given-names>Mark Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Retrosplenial cortex encodes landmarks by integrating visual inputs with other task-related variables in a supralinear fashion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spatial navigation requires the constant integration of sensory information, motor feedback, and prior knowledge of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardcastle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McNaughton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taube, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>). Visual landmarks are particularly advantageous for efficient navigation, representing information-rich reference points for self-location and route planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etienne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gothard et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knierim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNaughton et al., 1991</xref>). Even in situations where the immediate surroundings may not be informative, distal landmarks can provide critical orientation cues to find goal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tolman, 1948</xref>). Their importance is further underlined by the fact that salient visuo-spatial cues anchor almost every type of spatially-tuned cells observed in the mammalian brain to date, including head-direction cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taube et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yoder et al., 2011</xref>), hippocampal place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffery, 1998</xref>), and grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pérez-Escobar et al., 2016</xref>). Even in scenarios where self-motion feedback is in conflict with external visual cues, landmarks exert powerful influence on the head-direction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Valerio and Taube, 2012</xref>). A number of theoretical studies have shown the importance of landmarks for error correction during spatial computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monaco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sreenivasan and Fiete, 2011</xref>). However, it remains poorly understood how visual information is integrated into spatial code for goal-directed behavior.</p><p>Converging evidence points to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) as an important locus for landmark computations. Studies in humans with damage to RSC, as well as functional imaging studies, suggest a key role for RSC in utilizing familiar visual cues for navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epstein and Vass, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, RSC exhibits some of the earliest measurable metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Minoshima et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pengas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Villain et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with the putative roles of RSC in general mnemonic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spiers and Maguire, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Svoboda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valenstein et al., 1987</xref>) and route-planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spiers and Maguire, 2006</xref>), both of which are hallmarks of cognitive decline in AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). Lesion studies in rodents indicate that RSC is also important for navigating based on self-motion cues alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elduayen and Save, 2014</xref>). These findings are congruent with known RSC anatomy: situated at the intersection of areas that encode visual information, motor feedback, higher-order decision making, and the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Groen and Wyss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kononenko and Witter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miyashita and Rockland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>), RSC is ideally positioned to integrate these inputs to guide ongoing behavior. Electrophysiological recordings in freely moving rats have shown that individual RSC neurons conjunctively encode space in egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>). When placed in a one-dimensional environment, RSC neurons exhibit single, spatially tuned receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2017</xref>), while in two-dimensional environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>) they were found to express multiple receptive fields. RSC neurons have further been shown to encode context as well as task-related cues such as goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vedder et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have focused on understanding multimodal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Minderer et al., 2019</xref>), accumulation of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koay et al., 2019</xref>), and how locomotion is differentially represented in RSC and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, a subset of cells in RSC also encode head-direction in a way that is particularly sensitive to local environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). A common theme across these studies is the importance of visual inputs for RSC function. While the role of proximal, non-visual cues, such as whisker stimulation, has not been thoroughly evaluated, it is clear that visual cues alone are sufficient to guide behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etienne et al., 1996</xref>). Together, these converging results strongly implicate RSC as an important neural substrate for landmark encoding.</p><p>We set out to identify how visual cues that inform an animal about a goal location are represented in RSC. We focus in particular on the dysgranular part of RSC (Brodmann Area 30) which is less well characterized compared to granular RSC (A29), but has been shown to express spatial receptive fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). We developed a task in which animals learn the spatial relationship between a salient visual cue and a hidden rewarded zone on a virtual linear track. The visual cue serves as a landmark indicative of the animal’s distance to a reward. Studies investigating how spatial tuning is influenced by the environment generally use a single orienting cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muller and Kubie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taube et al., 1990</xref>), visual cues directly indicating the presence or absence of a reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pakan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Poort et al., 2015</xref>), or cue-rich environments where understanding the visual surrounding was not required to locate rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gauthier and Tank, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saleem et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, our task requires mice to use allocentric inputs as reference points, and combine them with self-motion feedback to successfully execute trials. This task utilizes landmarks as an indicator of distance to a reward on a linear track, as opposed to as an orientation cue. While A30 does contain head-direction tuned neurons, they are unlikely to contribute to computations in this task. We found the majority of task-active neurons, as well as the population response, to be anchored by landmarks. Showing the same visual stimuli at a static flow speed while animals were not engaged in the task resulted in significantly degraded responses, suggesting that active navigation plays a crucial role in RSC function. Landmark responses were the result of supralinear integration of visual and motor components. To understand how visual information is translated into behaviorally-relevant representations in RSC, we recorded the activity of axons from the primary visual cortex (V1) during task execution. V1 sends strong projections to RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) which, in turn, sends a top-down projection back to V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>), creating a poorly understood cortico-cortical feedback loop between a primary sensory and associative cortex. Understanding this circuit could provide key insights into how sensory and contextual information combine to guide behavior. We found strikingly similar receptive fields as those expressed by RSC neurons, suggesting that V1 inputs may be key in shaping their receptive fields. Importantly, their activity was less modulated by active navigation, illuminating a key difference between primary sensory and associative cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An RSC-dependent visual landmark navigation task</title><p>We developed a behavioral task that required mice to learn the spatial relationships between visual cues and hidden rewards along a virtual linear corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Each trial began at a randomized distance (50–150 cm) from one of two salient visual cues with a vertical or diagonal stripe pattern respectively. Along the rest of the corridor, which appeared infinitely long, a gray-and-black dot uniform pattern provided optic flow feedback but no spatial information. An unmarked 20 cm wide reward zone was located at fixed distances from the visual landmarks (starting at 80 or 140 cm from the end of the landmark, respectively). At the end of each trial, the animal was ‘teleported’ into a ‘black box’ (black screens) for at least 3 s. A trial ended when an animal either triggered a reward by licking within the reward zone or received a ‘default reward’ when it passed the reward zone without licking. Default rewards were provided throughout the experiment but constituted only a small fraction of trials in trained animals (mean ± SEM: 14.24 ± 2.65% of trials, n = 12 sessions, 11 mice). The 3 s black box timeout was included in the task to give the animals a salient signal for the end and start of trials. It further ensured that GCaMP6f signals underlying different aspects of behavior (reward delivery and consumption versus the initiation of a new trial and changes in locomotion) could decay before the start of the next trial. Mice learned to use the visual cues to locate the reward zones along the corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, mean 32.3 ± 3.6 training sessions for n = 10 mice). In theory, animals could achieve a high fraction of successful trials by licking frequently but randomly, or in a uniform pattern. We tested if we could use licking as a behavioral assay for an animal’s understanding of the spatial relationship between visual cue and reward location by calculating a spatial modulation index using a bootstrap shuffle test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref> and Materials and methods). This test randomly shifted licking locations relative to the track location for each trial and evaluated whether the animal would have still triggered a reward based on randomized licking (at least one lick inside the reward zone). The overall fraction of successful trials is then calculated for the entire session using randomized licking locations. This process is repeated 1000 times. Finally, the z-score of the actual success rate relative to the shuffled distribution is calculated and checked whether it was significantly higher than the shuffled distribution. Licking behavior of expert animals was significantly spatially modulated (mean ± SEM: 13.48 ± 1.23, n = 12 session, 11 mice), making it an accurate behavioral assay.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Landmark-dependent navigation task in virtual reality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental setup: mice are head-fixed atop a cylindrical treadmill with two computer screens covering most of the animal’s field of view.

Location of first licks as opposed to mean lick location or lick frequency was used as it provided the most conservative measure of where animals anticipated rewards.

This restricted ChR2 expression to GABAergic neurons in RSC and allowed us to rapidly and reversibly inhibit local neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Ferrules were implanted on the surface of the skull over RSC to deliver light during behavior. Stimulation was delivered by a 470 nm fiber-coupled LED on a randomized 50% subset of trials. The stimulation light was turned on at the beginning of a given trial and lasted until the end of the trial or the maximum pulse duration of 10 s was reached. A masking light was shown throughout the session. Task scores on trials with stimulation was significantly lower compared to trials where only the masking light was shown within the same session (43.7 ± 7.4 cm vs. 24.3 ± 6.2 cm, n = 5 mice, paired t-test: p = 0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that RSC activity contributes to successful execution of this behavior. The fraction of successful trials, in contrast, was not significantly different in the mask only and stim condition (mask: 7.5 ± 2.0%, stim: 6.7 ± 1.9%, paired t-test: p=0.61), showing that the decrease in task score was not a result of a diminished ability to trigger rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Trial onset, landmark, and reward encoding neurons in RSC</title><p>We sought to understand which task features were represented by neurons in dysgranular RSC (A30). Mice injected with AAV expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f were trained until they reliably used landmarks to locate rewards. On average, we recorded 120.0 ± 17.56 RSC neurons per mouse (n = 7 mice). GCaMP signals of all active neurons (&gt;0.5 transients/min, n = 966) were tested for significant peaks of their mean response above a shuffled distribution (z-score of mean trace &gt;3, see Materials and methods) and for transients on at least 25% of trials. The calcium traces of individual neurons that met these criteria (n = 491) were grouped by trial type and aligned to each of three points: trial onset, landmark, and reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The peak activity of the mean GCaMP trace of each neuron was then compared across alignment points and classified based on which task feature resulted in the largest mean response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This analysis was carried out for short trials and long trials independently. The majority of RSC neurons found to be task engaged were aligned to the visual landmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, n = 55 short trial onset and 62 long trial onset, 206 and 235 landmark, 101 and 118 reward neurons, respectively; seven mice; mean ± SEM fractions of aligned neurons: trial onset: 5.6 ± 0.3%, landmark: 22.3 ± 1.6%, reward: 11.6 ± 0.7%; one way ANOVA<sub>short</sub>: p = 0.0023; ANOVA<sub>long</sub>: p&lt;0.001, Tukey’s HSD post-hoc pairwise comparison with Bonferroni correction). A smaller but sizeable fraction of RSC neurons were aligned to the reward point, suggesting that RSC also encodes behavioral goals as well, and the onset of a trial, regardless of where an animal was placed on the track relative to the visual landmark. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>), these data indicate that egocentric (trial onset) as well as allocentric (landmark and reward) variables are encoded in RSC during landmark-based navigation. The vast majority of neurons showed a single peak of activity in our task. Previous studies have found neurons with multiple peaks or sustained firing in RSC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>). Our task, however, did not contain repeating sections found in a W-shaped or plus-shaped maze which may explain the discrepancy in our findings. The peak response of a given neuron did not necessarily need to happen directly at a given alignment point, but could also occur at some distance from it. A landmark-aligned neuron, for example, did not have to exhibit its peak response at the landmark. Instead, it could be active close to the reward zone but its calcium trace was still best aligned to the landmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal responses in RSC during landmark-dependent navigation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: schematic of recording setup.

However, we found neurons that were differentially active within a session when we split the responses into the most and least accurate 25% of trials. A subset (21.6%) changed their activity by &gt;0.5 ∆F/F. These changes were bidirectional: some neurons increased their activity while others decreased their activity based on how well an animal predicted the location of a reward, measured as the distance of the first lick in a given trial to the start of the reward zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We employed a template matching decoder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montijn et al., 2014</xref>) to analyze how well trial type could be decoded from neural activity alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While trial onset or reward-aligned neurons provided only chance level decoding or slightly better (trial onset: median 53.44% correct; reward: 62.1%), trial type decoding by landmark neurons was significantly higher (82.56%, Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.015; post-hoc Mann-Whitney U pairwise testing with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons).</p><p>We examined how individual task features (landmark, trial onset, and rewards) are differentially represented in RSC layers 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 5 (L5).

Peak activity for each trial type was calculated separately. Only a small number of neurons were found to be tuned to landmark identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), with most neurons showing no specific preference. Similarly, trial onset neurons and reward neurons did not show trial type selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We tested which reference point anchored the neural representation of the animal’s location using population vector cross-correlation analyses for all task active neurons (n = 491, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gothard et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2017</xref>). Two activity vectors were constructed for each neuron by randomly taking data from one half of the trials for the first vector and the other half for the second vector. Data from the first vector was used to determine the location of a neuron’s maximum response while the second vector was used for correlation analysis. This process prevents introduction of artifactual spatial structure into the population code. Activity was binned into 5 cm wide bins and the mean across all included trials was calculated and normalized to 1. We found largely even tiling of space from the trial onset until reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). To test the spatial specificity of the population code, we calculated a population vector cross-correlation matrix using the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>) for each spatial bin. To ensure that randomly splitting data into halves didn’t lead to spurious results, we calculated the mean of 10 cross-correlation maps, each randomly drawing a different subset of trials. Slices of the cross-correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>, taken at the dashed lines indicated in 3B and 3E), reveal that the spatial code is sharpest at the landmark. The cross-correlation at the animal’s true location (i.e. along the diagonal from top left to bottom right) significantly increases as the animal approaches the landmark and remains elevated until it reaches the reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We tested how well we could reconstruct the animal’s location from the neural code by calculating how far the pixel with the highest cross-correlation was from the actual location for each row in the cross-correlation matrix. We observed a significantly lower location reconstruction error when neural activity was aligned to landmarks, rather than trial onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, mean ± SEM: 3.7 ± 0.61 vs. 5.27 ± 0.56 short trials; 3.23 ± 0.48 vs. 5.26 ± 0.42, unpaired, 2-tailed t-test: p&lt;0.016 (short), p&lt;0.001 (long)). Finally, we found no significant difference in reconstruction error between short track and long track trials, as most neurons are active on both trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

During this decoupled stimulus presentation paradigm (DC), the virtual corridor moved past the animals at two speeds: 10 cm/sec and 30 cm/sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref> for speed profiles during virtual navigation). Both trial types were interleaved in the pattern as during virtual navigation, but no rewards were dispensed when animals reached reward locations. We found a significant decrease in neuronal responses in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, mean ± SEM VR: 0.17 ± 0.005, mean decoupled: 0.059 ± 0.004, paired, two-tailed t-test: p&lt;0.001). This was true for neurons of all three categories: trial onset, landmark, and reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, median values VR: trial onset = 0.1, landmark = 0.19, reward: 0.13; decoupled: trial onset = 0.03, landmark = 0.04, reward = 0.02). This result suggests that activity in RSC is strongly dependent on active task engagement. Congruent with this, population activity showed significantly less spatial specificity during decoupled stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>, mean reconstruction error ± SEM: 3.7 ± 0.61 vs. 7.88 ± 0.78 short trials; 3.23 ± 0.48 vs. 11.16 ± 1.18, unpaired, Mann-Whitney U: p&lt;0.001 (short), p&lt;0.001 (long)). This indicates that encoding of behaviorally-relevant variables in RSC is modulated by ongoing behavior, rather than being driven solely by sensory inputs. We note that not providing a reward and decoupling the stimulus presentation from animal locomotion constitute simultaneous changes that may both influence neural activity. However, if reward anticipation was a key driver in the change in neural activity we would expect neurons anchored by trial onset or landmark to be less affected than reward driven neurons. We find that all neuron types are similarly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that reward anticipation is not the major cause for the change in activity we observed. A second potential factor modulating neuronal responses is whether the animal is attending to the cue or not. We have addressed this issue by analyzing responses during quiet wakefulness and locomotion in the next section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, attending to the stimuli and/or task may significantly impact the respective neural representation. We therefore recorded pupil dilation in three well trained animals. However, we found no significant difference in pupil dilation during active navigation and decoupled stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>), suggesting that attention is an unlikely explanation for our results. We sought to gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying the changes in neuronal activity during decoupled stimulus presentation by comparing GCaMP6f signals observed in both conditions. Individual events were detected when ∆F/F exceeded six standard deviations of a neuron’s baseline activity for at least two spatial bins (bin size: 2 cm) and lay within ±60 cm of the peak mean response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). We found that the standard error of the distance of individual transients to the peak of the mean trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, median jitter (cm): short<sub>VR</sub> = 4.67, short<sub>DC</sub> = 8.66; long<sub>VR</sub> = 5.75, long<sub>DC</sub> = 9.85) was lower during virtual navigation compared to decoupled stimulus presentation. In other words, transients were more tightly clustered around that neuron’s peak response when the animal was actively engaged in the task. Furthermore, we saw a significant reduction in the number of transients per trial during decoupled stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, median values (transients/trial): short<sub>VR</sub> = 0.45, short<sub>DC</sub> = 0.14; long<sub>VR</sub> = 0.45, long<sub>DC</sub> = 0.14), but only very little change in the amplitude of individual transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, median values (∆F/F): short<sub>VR</sub> = 1.48, short<sub>DC</sub> = 1.36; long<sub>VR</sub> = 1.4, long<sub>DC</sub> = 1.33, Kruskal-Wallis test p&lt;0.001; Mann-Whitney-U pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction results indicated, ***=p &lt; 0.001).

We therefore evaluated the evidence for nonlinear integration in landmark-anchored RSC neurons. During decoupled stimulus presentation, mice were free to spontaneously locomote on the treadmill or watch passively. Trials within a session were separated based on whether the animal locomoted as the virtual environment passed a neuron’s receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, ‘+ motor’ trials, running speed &gt;3 cm/sec in a ± 50 cm window). ‘No input’ and ‘motor only’ conditions were measured while the animal was in the black box in between trials using similar criteria as before but with a 1.5 s time window (instead of a spatial window) for locomotion. Thus, any brief spontaneous movements that may have occurred within that window, but were below threshold, were labeled passive viewing. Despite the possibility that such small movements impact neural responses, we find a striking contrast between locomoting and passively viewing animals. When landmark presentation occurred during locomotion, activity was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, n = 127 neurons, five mice, mean ± SEM number of trials/neuron: 13.0 ± 0.41 resting, 9.3 ± 0.3 running; peak mean ∆F/F ± SEM: VR: 0.93 ± 0.06, landmark + motor: 0.57 ± 0.06, landmark, no motor: 0.22 ± 0.04, Kruskal-Wallis test: p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U post-hoc comparison with Bonferroni correction: p&lt;0.001 for all shown comparisons). However, we found that visual inputs alone or visual inputs plus locomotion did not elicit the same response as virtual navigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test: p&lt;0.001; post-hoc Mann-Whitney-U and Bonferroni correction: p&lt;0.001 for all shown comparisons). We then evaluated the responses while animals were locomoting or stationary while in the ‘black box’ between trials to obtain estimates of population activity in ‘no input’ (neither visual nor motor inputs) and ‘motor only’ conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ∆F/F ± SEM: black box + motor = 0.16 ± 0.03, black box, no motor = −0.04 ± 0.03). Finally we asked whether the linear sum of ‘motor only’ and ‘landmark, no motor’ added up to ‘landmark + motor’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). We found that the linear sum approached, but remained lower than the mean amplitude recorded during ‘landmark + motor’. Analysis of GCaMP transient patterns during ‘no motor’ and ‘+ motor’ conditions revealed that neurons show significantly more transients while locomoting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, median values (transients/trial): no motor = 0.06, + motor = 0.33; VR = 0.42), however, transient amplitude and jitter were broadly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and I</xref>, median jitter (cm): no motor = 13.82, + motor = 10.7; VR = 5.69; median amplitude (∆F/F): no motor = 1.59, + motor = 1.89; VR = 2.28). Our results suggest that motor input drives RSC neurons, however it does not aid in anchoring their activity or modulating the number of spikes produced once it has reached firing threshold. We note that GCaMP6f may not provide linear translation from underlying spikes to fluorescence signal. However, our analysis focuses on relative differences within the same neuron under different conditions and thus nonlinearities of the calcium indicator are unlikely explain these results. Together these results provide evidence for substantial nonlinear integration of visual and motor inputs in RSC neurons during goal-directed virtual navigation as well as decreased, but still significant, nonlinear processing during decoupled stimulus presentation.</p><p>A possible explanation for this result is a correlation of between running speed and transient amplitude. To test this, we analyzed the modulation of transient amplitude by running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We found only a small number of neurons showing modulation of transient amplitude by running speed across the population of task-active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1B</xref>, 0.5% on short trials n = 29 neurons and 15.6% on long trials n = 51 neurons). Of these neurons, 22 were positively and 58 negatively correlated. As we find changes in the vast majority of landmark-anchored neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), it is unlikely that running speed modulation explains these results.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Changes in spatial encoding after task acquisition</title><p>During decoupled stimulus presentation, locomotion no longer influences the virtual environment or reward availability, which may change animals’ internal state. We therefore performed experiments imaging the same neurons before and after learning in a separate group of 3 mice (mean ± SEM task score on expert session: 47.21 ± 2.6); animals were required to perform the same behavior, with the same stimulus and reward contingencies, in both conditions. We found some neurons that previously had not expressed discernible spatially tuned activity, establishing spatial receptive fields, while showed amplified responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). When we identified task active neurons in expert animals and calculated the population vector cross correlation during naïve and expert sessions, we found that the encoding of space in the naïve animal was much degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). However, this result could be explained by different subsets of neurons being active in naïve and expert animals, as opposed to a robust spatial code emerging during learning. To test this, we identified task active neurons in naïve and expert sessions independently and calculated the population vector cross correlation. Neurons in the naïve animal showed significantly worse representation of the animal’s location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

To this end, we injected GCaMP6f into V1 in a separate group of trained animals and recorded the responses of axonal boutons in RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Use of a passive pulse splitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2008</xref>) in the laser path allowed us to image axons continuously during self-paced behavioral sessions with no photobleaching or toxicity. To prevent overrepresentation of axons with multiple boutons in a given FOV, highly cross-correlated boutons were collapsed and represented as a single data point (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In a separately injected and trained group of 4 animals we found a total of 77 unique, task-active axons. Unexpectedly, we found receptive fields that were strikingly similar to those we observed in RSC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Boutons also tiled space along the virtual linear track in a parallel manner to RSC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Furthermore, we found a similar preference of V1 boutons to be anchored by landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). However, when we quantified how active task engagement modulates activity in RSC neurons versus V1 boutons, we found that the former were significantly more modulated compared to the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>, Mann-Whitney U: p&lt;0.001). These results are consistent with a number of recent studies that describe the encoding of non-visual stimuli in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pakan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saleem et al., 2018</xref>). The specificity of these responses suggests that at least a subpopulation of RSC-projecting neurons in V1 is tuned to behaviorally-relevant visual cues to a previously unknown extent. Despite their specificity, however, they represent visual inputs more faithfully and are less modulated by context than RSC neurons themselves, pointing to the local computations performed in RSC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>V1 axonal bouton responses in RSC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of injection and recording site.

The task required animals to discriminate visual cues, use them to localize themselves in space, and navigate to a rewarded zone based on self-motion feedback. Using this paradigm, we found that landmarks anchored the majority of task-active neurons in dysgranular RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and significantly sharpened the representation of the animal’s current location in the population code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This spatial representation largely changed 2during learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Landmark responses were not the result of simple visual and/or motor drive: showing the same visual stimuli while the animals were not engaged in the task elicited significantly attenuated responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further dissection of neuronal activity provided evidence for supralinear integration of visual and motor information in RSC. Coinciding visual input and motor feedback during decoupled stimulus presentation did not elicit the same response amplitudes as observed during active navigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, receptive fields expressed by V1 axonal boutons in animals executing the same behavior were strikingly similar to those recorded from RSC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, they were less modulated by active task engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>), indicating a hierarchy of sequential processing.</p><p>A major challenge in understanding how computations in RSC contribute to behavior is the diversity and complexity of functions attributed to this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in humans suggest that RSC is key for utilizing environmental cues during navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maguire, 2001</xref>), while experiments in rodents found deficits in path integration (navigation based on self-motion cues) when RSC was lesioned or inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper and Mizumori, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elduayen and Save, 2014</xref>). We describe a task that combines both of these navigational strategies: animals are required to use visual landmarks for self-localization, followed by path integration to successfully find rewards. Using optogenetic inactivation on a randomized subset of trials we found a deficit in the animal’s ability to use landmarks to guide localizing rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This could potentially be explained by a pure path integration deficit. However, if this is the case, RSC should exhibit a purely ego-centric representation of space, that is aligned to the start of a given trial. In contrast, we find that spatial representations in RSC are anchored by allocentric (landmark) cues and maintained by self-motion feedback after the animal has passed the visual cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We note that in our task, trial onset is not an optimal reference point to test whether RSC acts as an internal odometer, represents sensory inputs, or, as we argue, integrates both. We found a degradation as a function of distance from the onset of the task. However, the onset of a trial is a poor reference point due to the randomized location at which the animal is placed on the track (50–150 cm before the landmark). Significantly more neurons are anchored by the landmark, compared to the trial onset. Therefore, what may look like a neural code that gets noisier as a function of distance from the trial start, may indeed only reflect the fact that landmarks are at varying distances from the trial start in a given session. Therefore, the landmark is a better reference point to test the accumulation of noise is therefore the landmark. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, we show that population vector cross correlation decreases slowly after the landmark with an uptick shortly before the animal gets to the reward zone. While this is not an optimal measure, and indeed this task was not designed to test error accumulation, we believe that this is evidence for error accumulation in VR.</p><p>Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have emphasized the importance of landmarks for anchoring spatially tuned cells during navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funamizu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gothard et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knierim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muller and Kubie, 1987</xref>), yet the mechanisms that combine inputs from different modalities to represent landmarks remain poorly understood. We found that simple linear summation of visual and motor inputs was insufficient to explain landmark encoding in RSC. Instead, a nonlinear mechanism (or multiple mechanisms) underlie the integration of these variables to produce robust visuo-spatial responses during navigation. Active navigation (in virtual reality) sharpened spatial tuning and increased robustness of encoding in RSC compared to viewing the movie without being engaged in the task. Interestingly, the amplitude of recorded transients was unchanged, suggesting the presence of a thresholding process in the circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref>). Locomotion during decoupled stimulus presentation significantly increased the robustness of encoding while having very little effect on the fidelity of spatial tuning or transient amplitude. This indicates that motor input broadly pushes neurons towards spiking but does not contribute to its spatial tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). Furthermore, our data show that visual input alone is insufficient to explain the fidelity of spatial tuning we observed during virtual navigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our results indicate that the most likely mechanism underlying supralinear integration in RSC is the multiplicative effects of significantly improved fidelity of spatial tuning and increased likelihood of emitting transients within a neurons receptive field. While the latter seems to be mediated by motor inputs, the nature and source of an anchoring signal is unclear but may originate in the hippocampal formation where landmarks have been found to sharpen spatial tuning of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gothard et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knierim et al., 1995</xref>). Animals developed a more robust code for space during task acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>), suggesting that this supralinear mechanism may be the result of learning the spatial significance of a visual landmark cue. Understanding how learning shapes the integrative properties of individual neurons is an exciting avenue for future studies.</p><p>The spatial tuning we observed in task active neurons in dysgranular RSC appears similar to those of place cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). This is consistent with findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al. (2017)</xref>, who report that spatial tuning in RSC is somewhat degraded when tactile or visual cues are removed from a belted treadmill. However, RSC may not exhibit spatial representations that differ from CA1 when sensory information regarding goals is absent. Consistent with this, we find that RSC is strongly biased to encode behaviorally relevant visual cues that inform the animal about the location of a reward. This robust code only emerges after learning the spatial significance of the visual cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings are complementary to previous studies showing that RSC conjunctively encodes information in egocentric and allocentric reference frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Nitz, 2017</xref>) as well as other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vedder et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>RSC’s bias to encode behaviorally relevant stimuli is particularly interesting in light of its relationship with axonal inputs from V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Using the same landmark-dependent navigation task, we found that V1 axons exhibited comparable receptive field tunings as RSC neurons. However, these responses were substantially less modulated by task engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), suggesting that V1 axons encode visual features more faithfully. Previous studies have shown that neurons in V1 are themselves locomotion modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>). We report less locomotion modulation in V1 compared to RSC. The exact nature of this difference may be either of a qualitative nature, in which individual neurons are impacted differently by locomotion, or quantitative, in which across the population fewer neurons are locomotion modulated in V1 compared to RSC. We cannot disambiguate between these possibilities, as the overall fraction of locomotion-modulated neurons in V1 has not yet been established. Furthermore, it is not clear if only a specific functional subset projects to RSC, which may be more or less locomotion-modulated relative to the rest of V1.</p><p>The modulation we did observe may be the result of strong top-down inputs from RSC itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>) or from other regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). This is congruent with a recent study showing that activity in RSC is more correlated with V1 during locomotion compared to quiescent periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, before learning the behavioral significance of visual features in a novel environment, RSC may initially receive purely visual inputs from V1. As the animal learns to navigate in the new environment, feedback from RSC to V1 (as well as other areas such as ACC) may lead to modulated responses based on behavioral relevance in primary visual cortex, as reported by an increasing number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pakan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saleem et al., 2018</xref>). Our data provide evidence that RSC may act as a critical processing node that gates behaviorally relevant visual inputs and relays them to the entorhinal cortex and other areas involved in spatial navigation, where its readout may be used to anchor spatially tuned neurons such as grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burak and Fiete, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>) or head-direction cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). While RSC receives inputs from V2, M2, and other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugar et al., 2011</xref>), functional imaging studies show RSC to be uniquely engaged during landmark-based navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epstein and Vass, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting RSC is indeed a key locus for integrating visual and spatial information compared to other association areas.</p><p>Finally, this work provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive computations. Our results are consistent with data from humans with RSC lesions who show an impaired ability to use environmental cues for navigation, as well as neuroimaging studies that show increased activity in RSC during spatial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Sharp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Julian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vann et al., 2009</xref>).

To minimize bleeding, particularly from the central sinus, the skull was thinned along the midline until it could be removed in two pieces.

Subsequently, the headplate was attached using cyanoacrylate glue and Meatbond (Parkell Inc NY, USA) mixed with black ink to avoid light leaking into the objective during recordings.</p><p>Mice prepared for imaging of V1 boutons in RSC had GCaMP6f injected into V1 (~2.49 mm lateral, 3.57 caudal) through small burr holes at a depth of 600 µm to target primarily layer 5 neurons. For the rest of the procedure, the same steps as for imaging of RSC neurons were followed.</p><p>For the optogenetic inactivation during behavior experiment, VGAT-Ires-Cre knock-in mice (VGAT is encoded by <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:028862">IMSR_JAX:028862</ext-link>) on a C57BL/6 background (The Jackson Laboratory) were injected with flexed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2, AAV5.ef1a.DIO.ChR2.eYFP, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core) in 2–3 locations along the AP axis of RSC (50–100 nl per injection). Prior to injection the location of the central sinus was identified by placing saline on the skull and waiting until it was translucent. This was done because the overlying sagittal suture can be inaccurate in identifying the midline of the brain. One ferrule was placed centrally on each hemisphere over RSC. Each ferrule was calibrated prior to implantation to ensure the same light intensity was provided into each hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Virtual reality setup</title><p>Head-fixed mice were trained to run down a virtual linear corridor by locomoting on a polystyrene cylinder measuring 8 cm in width and 20 cm in diameter (Graham Sweet Studios, Cardiff, UK). The cylinder was attached to a stainless-steel axle mounted on a low-friction ball bearing (McMaster-Carr #8828T112, Princeton, NJ, USA). Angular displacement of the treadmill was recorded with an optical encoder (US Digital E6-2500, Vancouver, WA, USA). A custom designed head-restraint system was placed such that animals were comfortably located on the apex of the treadmill. Rewards were provided through a lick spout (Harvard Apparatus #598636) placed within reaching distance of the mice’s mouth. Timing and amount were controlled using a pinch valve (NResearch 225PNC1-21, West Caldwell, NJ, USA). Licking behavior was recorded using a capacitive touch sensor (SparkFun #AT42QT1010, CO, USA) connected to the lick spout. The virtual environment was created and rendered in real time in Matlab using the software package ViRMeN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronov and Tank, 2014</xref>) as well as custom written code. Two 23.8’ computer screens (U2414H, Dell, TX, USA) were placed in a wedge configuration to cover the majority of the mice’s field of view.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral task design and training</title><p>After mice had undergone preparatory surgery, they were given at least one week to recover before water scheduling began. Initially, mice received 3 ml of water per day in the form of 3 g of HydroGel (ClearH<sub>2</sub>O, Watertown, MA, USA), which was gradually reduced to 1.0–1.5 g per day. During this period, mice were handled by experimenters and habituated to being head restrained as well as running on a cue-less version of the virtual corridor. During habituation, mice were given small water rewards to allow them to acclimate to receiving 10% sugar-water rewards through a spout during head-restraint. Behavioral training began once mice were locomoting comfortably, as assessed by posture and gait. Initially, mice were trained on one trial type alone (short track). Each trial started at a randomized distance from the landmark (150–50 cm, drawn from a uniform distribution). The wall pattern consisted of a uniform pattern of black dots against a dark gray background to provide generic optic flow information. The view-distance down the corridor was not limited.</p><p>The landmark cues were 40 cm wide and extended above the walls of the corridor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After passing the landmark, mice were able to trigger rewards by licking a fixed distance from the landmark. The reward zone was 20 cm long but not indicated in any way so that the animals had to use self-motion cues and the location of the landmark to locate it. If an animal passed through the reward zone without licking, an automatic ‘reminder’ reward was dispensed. Each reward bolus consisted of 4–6 µl of 10% sucrose water. Sucrose was added to maximize training success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Reward delivery marked the end of a trial and animals were ‘teleported’ into a ‘black box’ for at least 3 s. In some training and recording sessions, animals were required to not lick or run for 3 s, however that requirement was later removed. Training using only one trial type was carried out daily in 30 to 60 min sessions until licking behavior was reliably constrained to after the landmark. At that point, the second trial type (long track) was introduced. Training using two tracks was carried out until the licking behavior of mice indicated that they used landmark information to locate the reward (‘experts’, typically 2–4 weeks). An empirical bootstrap shuffle test was used to calculate confidence intervals and evaluate whether or not mean first lick locations where significantly different. At that point, mice were transferred to the 2-photon imaging rig. In some instances, a small number of training sessions with the recording hardware running were carried out on the imaging setup to acclimatize animals.</p><p>The spatial modulation z-score (SMZ) was calculated by randomly rotating the location of licks within each trial by a random amount. The fraction of correctly triggered trials within this new, shuffled session was calculated by evaluating whether at least one lick was within the rewarded zone. This process was repeated 1000 times and a null distribution of fraction successful from random licking was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetic inactivation experiment</title><p>Optogenetic inactivation was carried out on mice that had been trained to expert level. Once they reached proficiency at using landmarks to locate rewards, the masking light was introduced. Animals were allowed a small number of sessions to habituate to the masking light before inactivation trials were introduced. The masking stimulus was provided by two 465 nm wavelength LEDs mounted on top of the computer screens facing the animal (Thorlabs LED465E, Thorlabs, NJ, USA). Optogenetic stimulation light was provided by a 470 nm fiber coupled LED (Thorlabs M470F3) powered by a Cyclops LED driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newman et al., 2015</xref>). Stimulation consisted of a solid light pulse with a maximum duration of 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). Stimulation was provided on half of the trials in a random order, with the only exception that no two consecutive trials could be stimulation trials. Light intensity ranged from 1 to 10 mW and was calibrated individually for each animal. Each animal was observed during stimulation trials and checked for no visible effects on behavior such as change in posture or gait. No difference was found in mean running speed or licks per trial when the stimulation light on compared to when only the masking stimulus was shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The task scores on mask only trials were compared to the task scores on mask + stimulation trials to assess deficits in the mice’s ability to use the landmark as a cue to locate rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>A Neurolabware 2-photon microscope coupled to a SpectraPhysics Insight DeepSee II were used for GCaMP6f imaging. To prevent photodamage or bleaching during extended recording periods, a 4x pulse splitter was placed in the light path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2008</xref>). The virtual reality software ran on a separate computer that was connected to the image acquisition system. Start and end of recording sessions were controlled by the virtual reality software to ensure synchrony of behavior and imaging data. Animals were placed in the head restraint and had a custom-designed 3D printed opaque sleeve placed over their cranial window to block light from the VR screens from leaking into the objective. The scope was lowered and suitable FOV identified before recordings began. Neurons in RSC were recorded at a wavelength of 980 nm. During V1 bouton recordings, the wavelength was switched to 920 nm. This was done to minimize autofluorescence from the dura mater, which is more pronounced at 980 nm excitation, especially during superficial recordings. Images were acquired at a rate of either 15.5 Hz or 31 Hz. In a subset of recordings, an electronically tunable lens was used to record from multiple FOVs in the same animal and session. In all but one cases, dual-plane imaging was used at a rate of 31 Hz, resulting in 15.5 Hz per plane acquisition. In a single recording session, six planes were acquired at 5.1 Hz. The two planes with most somas where included in this study. Recordings were acquired continuously throughout each session as opposed to epoch-based on trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image processing, segmentation, and signal extraction</title><p>Custom written Mathworks Matlab code was used for image registration, segmentation and signal extraction. Each recording session was stabilized using an FFT based rigid algorithm to register each frame to a template created from a subset of frames drawn at random from the whole session. This was followed by creating a pixel-by-pixel local cross-correlation and global cross-correlation maps. Regions of interest were drawn semi-automatically based on local cross-correlation from an experimenter defined seed-point. In addition to cross-correlation, global PCA, mean intensity, and other maps were created to aid identification of neurons and axonal boutons. Since the FOV was the same for virtual navigation and decoupled stimulus presentation, the same ROI maps created during virtual navigation could be used for decoupled stimulus presentation. During signal extraction, the mean brightness value of all pixels within a single ROI was calculated. A neuropil ‘donut’ was automatically generated around each ROI to allow for subtraction of local brightness from ROI signal. ∆F/F was calculated using a 60 s sliding time window. For neurons, F<sub>0</sub> was calculated from the bottom 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of data points within the sliding window. For boutons, the bottom 50<sup>th</sup> percentile was used to calculate F<sub>0</sub>. Neuropil signal was subtracted from ROI signal prior to calculating ∆F/F. Each ROI time course was manually inspected prior to inclusion into analysis. ROIs were excluded if they had few transients (&lt;0.5/min). Transients were identified as detected whenever the ∆F/F signal was above six standard deviations for at least 500 ms. The ROI time course was then aligned and re-sampled to match behavioral data frame-by-frame using custom code and the Scipy signal processing toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2001</xref>). To test for long term imaging side effects despite using a pulse splitter, we tested for baseline drift of mean frame brightness for each included recording session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Experiments in which the same neurons were recorded in naïve and expert animals, field of views (FOV) were matched manually at recording time. For signal extraction, ROIs drawn on the naïve FOV were transferred to the expert FOV and, where necessary, manually adjusted overlay on the same neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neuron and axonal bouton classification</title><p>The time course of each neuron was split into individual trials and aligned to one of three anchor points: trial onset, landmark, and reward. For the neuron to be considered task engaged it had to fulfill the following criteria: 1) ∆F/F had to exceed three standard deviations of the ROI’s overall activity on at least 25% of all trials; 2) the mean ∆F/F across trials had to exceed a peak z-score of 3 at its peak. The z-score for each ROI was determined by randomly rotating its ∆F/F time course with respect to its behavior 500 times and the peak value of the mean trace was then used to calculate the peak z-score; 3) the minimum of the mean trace amplitude (i.e. highest – lowest value) had to exceed 0.2 ∆F/F. Criteria for axonal boutons were the same with the exception that the minimum mean trace amplitude was 0.1 ∆F/F. For the neurons that passed these criteria, the alignment point that resulted in the largest mean response was determined. To avoid edge-cases at the beginning and end of the track, the mean trace was only calculated for bins where at least 50% of trials were present. For the comparison of peak amplitude in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, the peak amplitude as a function of space, rather than time, was used. The landmark selectivity index was calculated for all neurons that were classified as landmark aligned on at least one trial type as LMI = <italic>(LM<sub>short</sub> – LM<sub>long</sub>)/(LM<sub>short</sub> + LM<sub>long</sub>),</italic> where LM<sub>x</sub> refers to the peak response to the respective landmark. Only neurons that were classified as landmark-aligned neurons were included in that analysis. The fraction of neurons classified as trial onset, landmark, or reward were calculated from the total number of neurons with a baseline activity of at least 0.5 transients/min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Template matching decoder</title><p>A template matching decoder was used to assess the accuracy by which the trial type could be identified based on the activity of the different categories of neurons (trial onset, landmark, reward). First, template vectors were constructed for each trial type by calculating the mean response across trials within a session. The responses of the same neurons in individual trials were then compared to the template vectors, resulting in a similarity index for each trial type:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup> <mml:mi/><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup> <mml:mi/><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="‖" open="‖" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="‖" open="‖" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the similarity index for trial type <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (short or long). <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> is the template vector for trial type <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> is a vector of the responses of all neurons in a given trial, and i…N are the indices of all neurons of a given category. Whichever similarity index was higher for a given trial was considered the decoded trial type and compared to the trial type the animal was actually on.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Population plot and population vector analysis</title><p>Population plots were created by binning the activity of each neuron as a function of space. Each bin was 5 cm wide and all data points falling within a bin were averaged to calculate the mean activity at that location. The first bin started at 100 cm distance from the landmark such that it contained data from at least 50% of trials on average. The activity in each bin was normalized to the bin with peak activity of the same neuron such that all data ranged from 0 to 1. To plot the mean activity of all neurons in this study, the data was split. Half the trials were randomly drawn to calculate the bin with peak activity. The other half of the trials was used to calculate activity to be plotted. The population vector cross-correlation was calculated similarly by randomly drawing half of the trials to construct one vector and using the other 50% trials to construct the other vector. For each spatial bin, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated. The location reconstruction error was calculated as the distance between the spatial bin with the highest cross-correlation value to the animals’ actual location. As randomly splitting trials into halves can lead to spurious cross-correlation maps, this process was repeated 10 times and the mean cross-correlation coefficient and position reconstruction error for each spatial bin was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Activity during decoupled stimulus presentation</title><p>The peak response during decoupled stimulus presentation was evaluated by aligning each neuron or bouton to its preferred alignment point during virtual navigation. The response was then measured at the same point relative to that alignment point (in space) where it showed its peak response during virtual navigation. To allow for small shifts in peak activity during decoupled stimulus presentation, a window of ± 20 cm was introduced and the peak value within that window was used for analysis. Transients were identified whenever ∆F/F in a given trial (binned into 2 cm spatial bins) rose above six standard deviations of that neurons baseline activity (70<sup>th</sup> percentile of data points) for at least two consecutive bins. Transients located outside ± 60 cm of the mean peak during virtual navigation were excluded. Jitter was calculated as the standard error of the difference between mean peak and transient peak locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Motor vs. no motor analysis</title><p>The effect of concurrent motor and visual inputs during decoupled stimulus presentation was assessed by grouping trials based on whether the animal was running or stationary. A trial was considered a ‘running’ trial if its average speed exceeded 3 cm/sec in a ± 50 cm time window around its peak response relative to the landmark during virtual navigation. Only neurons with at least three running and non-running trials were included. To allow for slight mismatches between a neuron’s peak response during virtual navigation and decoupled stimulus presentation, the peak within 20 cm of the VR peak was used. Activity in the black box was calculated as a neuron’s response 1.5 s after onset of showing black screens with a movement time window of ±1 s. The relative response amplitudes were calculated by normalizing the activity of each neuron to its activity during virtual navigation. Only sessions in which a given animal ran and was stationary were included in this analysis.</p><p>Running speed modulation analysis was carried out by calculating the average running speed during the transient (e.g. if the transient was 500 ms long, the average running speed during those 500 ms was calculated) and correlating it to the peak amplitude of the transient. Only neurons where at least 10 transients where present on the respective trial type were included in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Laminar analysis</title><p>To assess differences in neuronal responses of superficial vs deep neurons in RSC, the depth of the recordings was used to determine which layer neurons belonged to. RSC does not possess a layer 4, and layers 2/3 and 5 are separated by a section of relatively few cell bodies. In addition, layer five is comparatively superficial, starting at only 300 µm below the pia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). This made identification of cortical layers during in vivo 2-photon imaging possible. We split recordings into layer 2/3 and layer five recordings based on depth below the pia. In one recording, a Rbp4-Cre positive animal, which expresses Cre in many layer 5 cells, was used in conjunction with a flexed GCaMP6f construct. The recording depth for this animal was congruent with other recordings in which we located layer five based on recording depth alone.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Ben Scott, Jeff Gauthier, Elias Issa, Matt Wilson, and Ashok Litwin-Kumar for comments on the manuscript.

It elegantly demonstrates with two-photon calcium imaging recordings in naive and trained animals (even in some cases following the same neurons through the course of learning) that a representation of the task, linking the visual cues to the task parameters, emerges with learning in retrosplenial cortex. These findings will impact a broad range of fields of study, including network mechanisms of learning.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Representation of visual landmarks in retrosplenial cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Harnett and colleagues are studying coding for visual landmarks in a virtual reality task where different visual landmarks predict reward at different distances. They show that retrosplenial cortex inactivation worsens behavior. Using two-photon calcium imaging they show neurons whose firing is locked to running onset, visual landmark, or reward. The fidelity of firing decreases when visual stimuli are decoupled from behavior. V1 axons in retrosplenial cortex had similar responses but were less modulated by task engagement.</p><p>This is a very interesting study with novel results for the community. The experiments are performed carefully, for the most part, and the analysis is thorough. However, the manuscript is not always clear. Some issues could be better discussed, and the focus on navigation should be diminished, as the task, and the associated role of RSC, may very well be restricted to visual discrimination associated to path length estimation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have used genetically-modified mice to specifically target GABAergic cells optogenetically. But it is not clear how much of RSC is being manipulated by this approach. Authors say multiple injections were made along the rostro-caudal axis, but there is no histology. This does not make clear how much of the cortex would be covered by the laser. Some kind of additional corroboration would be helpful to see what extent of RSC is affected.</p><p>2) Regarding the task, it is important to carefully clarify where animals use landmarks to localize themselves in space or whether they have some sort of visually cued path integration strategy. This raises the question of whether, during RSC inactivation, spatial navigation is impaired or mice are unable to recognize the two landmarks/to associate a landmark with the correct distance to perform. The task score used by the authors does not distinguish between these possibilities. One way to answer this question is to more carefully analyze the mouse behavior. For example, when do animals stop during inactivation trials? Do they allocate short and long paths to the incorrect landmark? Or do they behave randomly? Do speed profiles change? Finally, it is important to discuss these two possibilities and to modify the statements in the manuscript about the impact of RSC on 'navigation' as the effect could be only on 'visual recognition'.</p><p>3) The authors showed in Figure 3 that, if the activity is aligned to the onset, this results in a very noisy coding. According to the authors, this result demonstrates that RSC activity is independent of an internal odometer that allows computing distances from a starting position. But, if RSC activity reflects an internal (i.e. self-motion based) odometer, one expects noisier activity at distances farther from the onset (due to error accumulation). From Figure 3, it seems that firing selectivity starts to be lost at around 30cm from the onset, for both short and long. The authors should discuss if this is compatible with error accumulation in virtual reality.</p><p>4) As a control for task-dependent landmark selectivity, the authors performed a decoupled stimulus presentation. In addition, trials in which mice were immobile and trials in which they moved were dissociated. The authors must clarify how these experiments were performed. Did the authors perform passive viewing and active locomotion independently? If this were not the case, how was optic flow controlled with respect to spontaneous movements? Please provide more precise explanations, and discuss the impact of spontaneous movements on the results.</p><p>5) The authors found a drastic modification in cell activity during the decoupled condition, particularly when animals were immobile. What happened during virtual navigation when animals stopped at the receptive field? From the corresponding figure (Figure 5B), it seems that in the decoupled experiment when the mouse was not moving the cell was silent, but when the mouse was moving the cell had the same receptive field but with lower activity. Can the effect seen during task engagement be explained by a modulation in animal movement speed? Please clarify this point in particular in the linearity analysis for visual responses and motor context. On the same line, the authors make the claim that, &quot;This indicates that encoding of behaviourally-relevant variables in RSC is dependent on ongoing behaviour&quot;. This statement should be mitigated, with respect to the analysis above.</p><p>6) How much do animals pay attention to landmarks? Is there any possibility that cell activity is modulated by this parameter? Is it possible that in the decoupled condition mice do not pay attention to the landmarks because they are irrelevant, thus reducing cell responses? Please discuss and ideally provide pupil dilation data.</p><p>7) The authors only show cell responses once the animals are well-trained on the task and then use a decoupling approach to show that the responses are task/navigation sensitive. It would be more convincing to show that the pattern of activity changes with task acquisition (i.e., changes in individual cell responses, changes in number of cells responding, or changes in the ensembles that are activated) to show that this isn't simply a stimulus response. A comparison with the first trials where the animals are seeing the cues and running without knowledge of rewards or reward locations would disambiguate this.</p><p>8) Overall number of cells responding does not necessarily equate to a greater role in a particular component of the task. What is more informative is how well the cell responses correlate with what the animals have learned in terms of distance prediction. And, patterns of cell activity may be more informative than absolute numbers. The authors should quantify this further (for example, using population activity).</p><p>9) Regarding laminar differences in landmark coding, the justification is unclear for this. There is no rationale as to what differences would be expected in terms of the connectivity of the different layers. The authors write &quot;….L2/3 may be key for encoding landmarks during ongoing behaviour&quot;. One may assume this is because there is a greater proportion of cells engaged, but greater overall numbers does not necessarily a greater role – it may be more informative to model how networks within RSC support behavior i.e., interactions between the layers.</p><p>10) The present study appears to be focused on dysgranular RSC; the main RSC subregions are known to have different connectivity and responsiveness, so the authors should be more specific in terms of which part of RSC they are referring to. Moreover, the authors distinguished different RSC layers but did not evaluate possible differences between granular and dysgranular parts of the RSC. Given that these two areas contain functionally different head-direction cell categories (Jacob et al., 2017), is there any possibilities that they respond differently to landmarks? This should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51458.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have used genetically-modified mice to specifically target GABAergic cells optogenetically.

We have now included confocal images of an animal injected with the same injection protocol as the animals used in the inactivation experiment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1N). This experiment shows ChR2 expression along the rostro-caudal extent of RSC. The ChR2 virus used in the study is conjugated with an eYFP marker which has been amplified using immunohistochemistry. This is evidence that many GABAergic neurons are transfected by ChR2 throughout the majority of RSC A30. We point out that in the optogenetic experiments we placed optical ferrules on top of the skull above each hemisphere, which increased the spread of the light by utilizing the skull as a diffuser. Therefore, most excitatory neurons in A30 are likely inactivated during the optogenetic stimulation in our experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the task, it is important to carefully clarify where animals use landmarks to localize themselves in space or whether they have some sort of visually cued path integration strategy.

For example, when do animals stop during inactivation trials? Do they allocate short and long paths to the incorrect landmark? Or do they behave randomly? Do speed profiles change? Finally, it is important to discuss these two possibilities and to modify the statements in the manuscript about the impact of RSC on 'navigation' as the effect could be only on 'visual recognition'.</p></disp-quote><p>Recognizing landmarks as such (i.e. understanding and recalling the navigational meaning of a given visual cue in the environment) versus associating a visual feature with a given path to a reward may both be functions of RSC. Our study was not designed to disambiguate these two possibilities. However, the revised manuscript now contains additional analyses, figures, and discussion to describe the specific behavioral changes animals exhibit on RSC inactivation trials. First, we looked at running speed profiles and found no significant difference between stimulation trials vs. mask only trials (Figure 1—figure supplement 1O,P), suggesting that locomotion behavior was not significantly affected by RSC inactivation. Second, we did a label-shuffle test (randomly switching the labels for long and short trials) and re-analyzed licking behavior. If animals were unable to discriminate, or even see, landmarks, then the task score resulting from a label-shuffle test should not be different from the task scores on stimulation trials. Instead, we see a decrease in task score, suggesting that they have diminished ability to locate rewards based on the landmark. These new analyses now provide a more precise evaluation of the behavioral deficits inactivation of RSC causes.</p><p>In addition, we are submitting with this rebuttal two separate experiments we used to test whether inactivating of RSC affects mouse vision or motor behavior. We used two simple derivative versions of our landmark navigation task: one required animals to discriminate between two visual cues and the other required them to locomote two different distances to visually cued reward locations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In both experiments, no effect of RSC inactivation (via muscimol) could be seen compared to sham injections. We acknowledge the different nature of muscimol inactivation compared to optogenetic inactivation: we provide these results in the rebuttal to corroborate the point that our optogenetic results are not a result of RSC-mediated visual or motor function impairment.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Muscimol inactivation on visual discrimination and motor control tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of visual discrimination task (top) in which reward was available at one visual cuebut not the other.

According to the authors, this result demonstrates that RSC activity is independent of an internal odometer that allows computing distances from a starting position. But, if RSC activity reflects an internal (i.e. self-motion based) odometer, one expects noisier activity at distances farther from the onset (due to error accumulation).

The authors should discuss if this is compatible with error accumulation in virtual reality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this constructive challenge of our interpretation of the data. We do not feel our data can be used to strongly argue either for or against error accumulation in VR. Aligning neurons by trial onset, as we did, can produce apparently “very noisy coding” because animals start each trial at randomized locations with respect to the landmark (50-150 cm). Significantly more neurons are anchored by the landmarks compared to the trial onset (as shown in Figure 2), which may well account for the “noisy coding” in Figure 3. We have added a discussion of this important point to the main text (Discussion paragraph two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As a control for task-dependent landmark selectivity, the authors performed a decoupled stimulus presentation. In addition, trials in which mice were immobile and trials in which they moved were dissociated. The authors must clarify how these experiments were performed. Did the authors perform passive viewing and active locomotion independently? If this were not the case, how was optic flow controlled with respect to spontaneous movements? Please provide more precise explanations, and discuss the impact of spontaneous movements on the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded and clarified our description of the decoupled experiments in the Results section. We now explicitly state that data from immobile and mobile periods were all collected during the same sessions (subsection “Nonlinear integration of visual and motor inputs in RSC”). Trials within a session were separated based on whether the animal locomoted as the virtual environment passed a neuron’s receptive field (Figure 5A and 5B, ‘+ motor’ trials, running speed &gt; 3 cm/sec in a ± 50 cm window). ‘No input’ and ‘motor only’ conditions were measured while the animal was in the blackbox in between trials using similar criteria as before but with a 1.5 second time window (instead of a spatial window) for locomotion. Thus, any brief spontaneous movements that may have occurred within this window, but were below threshold, were labelled passive viewing. Despite the possibility that these small movements could impact neural responses, we nonetheless observed a striking contrast between locomoting and passively viewing animals. During decoupled stimulus presentation, optic flow was set at a constant speed and therefore not controlled with regards to spontaneous movement. The time window sizes were deliberately chosen to be generous so that we compared trials when the animal was consistently locomoting to periods of passive viewing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors found a drastic modification in cell activity during the decoupled condition, particularly when animals were immobile. What happened during virtual navigation when animals stopped at the receptive field? From the corresponding figure (Figure 5B), it seems that in the decoupled experiment when the mouse was not moving the cell was silent, but when the mouse was moving the cell had the same receptive field but with lower activity. Can the effect seen during task engagement be explained by a modulation in animal movement speed? Please clarify this point in particular in the linearity analysis for visual responses and motor context. On the same line, the authors make the claim that, &quot;This indicates that encoding of behaviourally-relevant variables in RSC is dependent on ongoing behaviour&quot;. This statement should be mitigated, with respect to the analysis above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further analyses and clarifications to the manuscript to address these points (subsection “V1 inputs to RSC represent task features but are less modulated by active navigation”). Specifically, Figure 6A and B now show running speed modulation analysis for every task active neuron. We also carried out a Pearson correlation analysis between the amplitude of each transient and the average running speed of that animal at the location of the transient. We found that only a small number of neurons that showed a correlation between transient amplitude and running speed (10.5% for short trials and 14.4% on long trials). However, those neurons whose correlations were significant featured both positive and negative correlations (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), and therefore cannot explain the results we present in Figure 5. Expert mice typically did not stop along the track: they completed the vast majority of trials in one go. We therefore could not find a reasonable number of instances where animals stopped inside a given neuron’s receptive field in order to conduct the requested analysis. We modified the sentence suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How much do animals pay attention to landmarks? Is there any possibility that cell activity is modulated by this parameter? Is it possible that in the decoupled condition mice do not pay attention to the landmarks because they are irrelevant, thus reducing cell responses? Please discuss and ideally provide pupil dilation data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added pupil data for 3 expert mice, which shows no difference in pupil dilation during active navigation and decoupled stimulus presentation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F-H). Furthermore, we have added text regarding attentional issues during the decoupled stimulus presentation in the respective Results section (subsection “Active task execution sharpens spatial tuning and increases robustness of responses in RSC”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors only show cell responses once the animals are well-trained on the task and then use a decoupling approach to show that the responses are task/navigation sensitive. It would be more convincing to show that the pattern of activity changes with task acquisition (i.e., changes in individual cell responses, changes in number of cells responding, or changes in the ensembles that are activated) to show that this isn't simply a stimulus response. A comparison with the first trials where the animals are seeing the cues and running without knowledge of rewards or reward locations would disambiguate this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that comparing neural activity before and after learning represents a powerful complement to our VR vs. uncoupled stimulus presentation dataset. We therefore performed a whole new set of experiments to obtain data from a new group of animals that were imaged on their first day of exposure to the VR task and again when they were experts (Figure 6, subsection “Active task execution sharpens spatial tuning and increases robustness of responses in RSC”). We matched fields-of-view and neuron ROIs (Figure 6A) across sessions. Congruent with our results in the uncoupled condition, we found that coding is substantially different before and after task acquisition (Figure 6B). Indeed, before learning, neuronal population activity showed a less accurate encoding of space compared with the same population of neurons after learning (Figure 6C-E). This provides evidence for our contention that the pattern of neural activity in RSC in expert animals is not simply stimulus driven.</p><p>We would like to note that before-and-after analysis of neuronal population activity in behaving mice that learn a complex task is exceedingly challenging. Few existing studies have followed the activity of the same neurons learning over days, let alone weeks. Those that have done so were conducted in primary sensory or motor cortex in animals learning relatively simple tasks (Huber et al., 2012; Pakan, Currie, Fischer, and Rochefort, 2018; Peron, Freeman, Iyer, Guo, and Svoboda, 2015; Peters, Chen, and Komiyama, 2014; Poort et al., 2015). We followed the same neurons over weeks in a task that required animals to learn the spatial relationships between different visual cues and reward locations and then use path integration to successfully complete trials. A particular strength of our study is establishing a complex behavioral paradigm that is associative cortex-dependent, which exploits a previously underutilized capability of 2-photon imaging during task acquisition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Overall number of cells responding does not necessarily equate to a greater role in a particular component of the task. What is more informative is how well the cell responses correlate with what the animals have learned in terms of distance prediction. And, patterns of cell activity may be more informative than absolute numbers. The authors should quantify this further (for example, using population activity).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that fractions of task-active neurons do not directly correspond to computational output. When we analyzed the correlation between the fraction of task active neurons (anchored by trial onset, landmark, or reward) and the respective task score (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E), we found no significant correlation. However, we found neurons that were differentially active within a session when we split the responses into the most and least accurate 25% of trials. A subset (21.6%) changed their activity by &gt;0.5 ∆F/F. These changes were bidirectional: some neurons increased their activity while others decreased their activity based on how well an animal predicted the location of a reward, measured as the distance of the first lick in a given trial to the start of the reward zone (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D, subsection “Trial onset, landmark, and reward encoding neurons in RSC”). Population analyses further showed a significantly more accurate representation of space in expert compared to naïve animals (Figure 6C-E). These results provide evidence for both single neuron and population-based codes for landmarks and rewards in RSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Regarding laminar differences in landmark coding, the justification is unclear for this. There is no rationale as to what differences would be expected in terms of the connectivity of the different layers.

One may assume this is because there is a greater proportion of cells engaged, but greater overall numbers does not necessarily a greater role – it may be more informative to model how networks within RSC support behavior i.e., interactions between the layers.</p></disp-quote><p>The role(s) of different layers in any cortex is poorly understood. We thus had no strong conceptual framework upon which to base potential hypotheses for our L2/3 vs. L5 RSC imaging. We therefore deliberately present this data as an observation rather than an answer to a specific question. Very few studies have imaged from multiple layers in behaving animals anywhere in the cortex (Funamizu, Kuhn, and Doya, 2016; Mao, Kandler, McNaughton, and Bonin, 2017), making our data a useful resource for the field. Additionally, despite existing electrical recording data that originates from multiple layers, there are few experimental or theoretical studies that address the difference(s) in coding between L2/3 vs. L5. This makes it virtually impossible to formulate meaningful predictions about what functional differences we might expect between layers, particularly in an association cortex like RSC, during a complex task. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing framework for modeling how interactions among layers in any cortex support behavior. We believe that attempting to build an interacting multi-layer cortical model that explains behavior is outside the scope of this study. Additionally, our knowledge of RSC is still quite limited (which was the motivation for our study) and thus any model we could develop at this point would likely still not be appropriately constrained. The figure on laminar differences was removed from the main text and added as a supplemental figure due to space constraints. A brief section describing the findings has been added to the main text (paragraph three subsection “Trial onset, landmark, and reward encoding neurons in RSC”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The present study appears to be focused on dysgranular RSC; the main RSC subregions are known to have different connectivity and responsiveness, so the authors should be more specific in terms of which part of RSC they are referring to. Moreover, the authors distinguished different RSC layers but did not evaluate possible differences between granular and dysgranular parts of the RSC. Given that these two areas contain functionally different head-direction cell categories (Jacob et al., 2017), is there any possibilities that they respond differently to landmarks? This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the important distinction between granular (A29) and dysgranular (A30) portions of RSC. All our recordings were carried out in dysgranular (A30) RSC. We have adapted language throughout the manuscript to reflect this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
