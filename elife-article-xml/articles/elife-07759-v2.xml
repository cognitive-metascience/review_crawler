<italic>LMNA</italic>, resulting in a truncated form of lamin A called progerin. Progerin triggers loss of the heterochromatic marker H3K27me3, and premature senescence, which is prevented by telomerase. However, the mechanism how progerin causes disease remains unclear. Here, we describe an inducible cellular system to model HGPS and find that LAP2α (lamina-associated polypeptide-α) interacts with lamin A, while its interaction with progerin is significantly reduced. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that over 50% of telomeres localize to the lamina and that LAP2α association with telomeres is impaired in HGPS. This impaired interaction is central to HGPS since increasing LAP2α levels rescues progerin-induced proliferation defects and loss of H3K27me3, whereas lowering LAP2 levels exacerbates progerin-induced defects. These findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology underlying HGPS, and how the nuclear lamina regulates proliferation and chromatin organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07759.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07759.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07759.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disease in which individuals age prematurely. Newborns appear normal at birth, but start ageing rapidly when they are around a year old. Symptoms of the disease include stunted growth and joint stiffness, and individuals often die of heart failure during their teens.</p><p>A mutated version of a protein called lamin A causes HGPS; this mutant is known as progerin. In cells that produce progerin, the ‘telomeres’ that protect the ends of chromosomes (the structures that contain most of the cell's DNA) from damage, are unusually short. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres get shorter. If they get too short, the DNA is damaged and the cell stops dividing and enters a state known as senescence.</p><p>HGPS affects some of the tissues in the body more severely than others, and these tissues tend to produce high levels of progerin. By gradually raising the levels of progerin in human cells, Chojnowski et al. found that DNA damage and cell senescence only occur when the amount of progerin in a cell exceeds a particular threshold. Moreover, the expression of telomerase—a complex that can elongate telomeres—prevented progerin-induced DNA damage and premature senescence.</p><p>To find out how progerin affects cells, Chojnowski et al. compared how lamin A and progerin interact with other proteins. This revealed that progerin interacts with a protein called LAP2α more weakly than lamin A. LAP2α normally associates with telomeres, but using super-high resolution microscopy, Chojnowski et al. observed that this association is less likely to occur in the cells of people with HGPS. Importantly, increasing the amount of LAP2α in progerin-expressing cells prevented DNA damage and senescence and enabled these cells to continue dividing.</p><p>Chojnowski et al. propose that in HGPS, the weak interaction between LAP2α and progerin disrupts how LAP2α interacts with telomeres, which prevents cells from dividing. Understanding this process may help to design new ways of treating HGPS, and may also help us to understand other diseases that are caused by mutations in lamin proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07759.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07759.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lamin A</kwd><kwd>LAP2 alpha</kwd><kwd>progeria</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>progerin</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002287</institution-id><institution>Progeria Research Foundation (PRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Colin L</given-names></name><name><surname>Dreesen</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chojnowski</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Ong</surname><given-names>Peh Fern</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Esther SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>John SY</given-names></name><name><surname>Mutalif</surname><given-names>Rafidah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Navasankari</surname><given-names>Raju</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name><name><surname>Liow</surname><given-names>Yi Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Boudier</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Graham D</given-names></name><name><surname>Colman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Colin L</given-names></name><name><surname>Dreesen</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Expression of the lamina-associated polypeptide α (LAP2α) prevents premature cellular ageing caused by expression of progerin in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear lamina, a proteinaceous meshwork consisting of A-type and B-type lamins, underlies the inner nuclear membrane and is important for maintaining interphase nuclear architecture. In addition, it provides a structural scaffold for factors involved in DNA repair, replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke and Stewart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dechat et al., 2008</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene are responsible for a variety of human genetic disorders, collectively called the laminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke and Stewart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Worman et al., 2010</xref>). Laminopathies include forms of muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, lipodystrophy and the premature aging disease, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS).</p><p>HGPS patients appear normal at birth, but by 12–18 months begin to exhibit features associated with accelerated ageing, and usually die in their teens due to cardiovascular failure. HGPS is caused by an autosomal dominant C to T nucleotide substitution at position 1824 (G608G) in <italic>LMNA</italic>, which activates a cryptic splice site and results in a truncated and constitutively farnesylated version of lamin A called progerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>). HGPS fibroblasts have a greatly reduced proliferative capacity, abnormal nuclear architecture, persistent activation of DNA damage checkpoints and shortened telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bridger and Kill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker et al., 2009</xref>). Critically shortened telomeres elicit a DNA damage response and trigger senescence, resulting in irreversible growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</xref>). Previous results revealed that ectopic expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) extends the proliferative capacity of HGPS fibroblasts and rescues progerin-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remains unknown to what extent ectopic expression of TERT rescues all progerin-induced phenotypes, and whether physiological levels of TERT are sufficient. It also remains unclear how progerin triggers senescence and why specific tissues in HGPS patients are more affected than others.</p><p>Here, we describe a regulatable cellular model of progeria and show that upon induction in primary human fibroblasts, progerin leads to increased DNA damage, cellular senescence, senescence-associated reduction of lamin B1, nuclear morphology defects and altered expression of H3K27me3, in a dose-dependent manner. Exogenous TERT prevents the proliferative defects, DNA damage, lamin B1 reduction and gene expression differences induced by progerin, although nuclear morphology defects and altered deposition of H3K27me3 are not prevented by TERT.</p><p>To determine how progerin may induce these defects, we compared the protein interactome between lamin A and progerin. This revealed that the physical association between progerin and the α-isoform of the lamina-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP2α) is disrupted. Increased levels of LAP2α, but not LAP2β, suppressed many of the progerin-induced defects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation and reduction in heterochromatin, revealing that LAP2α plays a central role in the molecular pathology of progeria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Progerin impairs proliferation, induces premature senescence and loss of lamin B1 in primary fibroblasts</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of progerin's effects, we developed a tractable experimental system utilizing primary (telomerase-negative) and telomerase-positive (expressing pBABE-Neo-hTERT) (TERT+) human fibroblasts. These were then either induced to express V5-tagged lamin A or progerin to model the pathophysiology of HGPS fibroblasts. We used a doxycycline (DOX) inducible lentiviral based system to quantitatively induce the expression of progerin and lamin A to levels comparable to those present in HGPS fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B,H</xref>). The advantage of such a system is that it accurately tracks the replicative history of isogenic cell lines, removing the uncertainty in using HGPS-patient derived cells where passage number and telomere length may be unknown, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07759.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Telomerase rescues dose dependent progerin-induced proliferation defects, DNA damage and gene expression changes without alleviating chromatin changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence microscopy using v5-tag antibody showing doxycycline-dependent inducible expression of v5-progerin and its localization to the nuclear periphery.

All of these changes are consistent with previous findings from HGPS and senescent fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taimen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreesen et al., 2013</xref>). The expression of exogenous TERT prevented progerin-induced proliferative defects, loss of lamin B1, and reduced the number of SA-β-gal positive cells to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C,D,G</xref>). Consistent with these results, expression of TERT in HGPS patient derived fibroblasts increased telomere length, restored their proliferative capacity and reduced the number of cells with DNA damage foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). In contrast, expression of TERT did not ameliorate the nuclear abnormalities of HGPS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Lastly, expression of normal lamin A did not significantly affect the proliferation rates of primary- or TERT+ human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of HGPS and other premature aging syndromes is the tissue-specific manifestation of the disease. Different lineages derived from reprogrammed HGPS induced pluripotent cells (iPSC) expressed varying amounts of progerin, with neural lineages showing the lowest levels, consistent with the fact that they remain unaffected in HGPS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggested that progerin's detrimental effects depend on its levels of expression in a given tissue. To test this, we expressed increasing levels of progerin in primary and TERT+ fibroblasts by increasing the concentration of DOX (0–2000 ng/ml). This resulted in progerin inhibiting the proliferation of primary fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Defective proliferation was accompanied by a gradual increase in DNA damage levels, as quantified by the number of 53BP1 foci per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panel, p &lt; 0.01). The levels of progerin required to induce a phenotype corresponded to ∼30–40% of endogenous lamin A levels (at 100–250 ng/ml DOX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Progerin therefore must reach a certain threshold to induce DNA damage and inhibit proliferation. Both of these effects were suppressed by exogenous TERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Previous studies reported that progerin leads to a decrease in repressive histone marks including H3K27 trimethylation and loss of peripheral heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shumaker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCord et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether TERT would prevent progerin-induced chromatin alterations, we measured the levels of progerin and H3K27me3 in single cells by immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, a scatterplot analysis of &gt;9800 nuclei revealed an inverse correlation between progerin and H3K27me3 levels (Pearson r = −0.43 and −0.24 for TERT negative and TERT+ cells expressing progerin, respectively, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, inset). However, progerin mediated loss of H3K27me3 was not prevented by TERT. The inverse correlation between progerin expression and loss of H3K27me3 is also apparent in two primary HGPS cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, Pearson r = −0.70 and −0.52 for HGPS 01972 and HGPS 11513 respectively, p &lt; 0.001), as well as in one TERT+HGPS cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>, Pearson r = −0.5). To determine whether this altered chromatin state was sufficient to affect genome-wide gene expression, and whether TERT would prevent these changes, we performed a microarray analysis on primary and TERT+ cells expressing either lamin A or progerin at 4 weeks after induction. The expression of 142 genes was increased or decreased more than twofold in progerin vs lamin A expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Many of these gene expression changes were associated with senescence, including a reduction of Wnt2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2007</xref>), increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2003</xref>) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kortlever et al., 2006</xref>). Expression of TERT prevented nearly all these changes in the differentially expressed genes, and restored the gene expression profile to that seen in cells not expressing progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results show that the inducible system reliably phenocopies HGPS cell characteristics in isogenic cell lines, and that ectopic expression of TERT prevents dose-dependent DNA damage, premature cellular senescence and senescence-associated changes in gene expression induced by progerin, independent of its impact on H3K27 methylation.</p><p>To determine whether endogenous physiological levels of TERT would recapitulate the effects of exogenous TERT expression, we expressed lamin A and progerin in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). Endogenous TERT expression is a hallmark of ESCs and enables them to perpetually self-renew. Both lamin A and progerin were expressed in the ESC nuclei upon addition of DOX and localized to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Expression of the exogenous progerin or lamin A did not impair the proliferation of the pluripotent ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), induce significant changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), alter nuclear lamina structure, as measured by lamin B1 and emerin expression, nor affect the expression of the pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). TERT is expressed in undifferentiated ESC, but is repressed during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether ESC would become susceptible to progerin expression upon differentiation, we aggregated ESC into embryoid bodies (EB), plated them in tissue culture dishes and measured the size of the differentiating EB outgrowth upon plating. While the total EB size did not vary significantly between the different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the EB outgrowth of differentiated cells was significantly reduced in progerin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, p &lt; 0.01). As in primary fibroblasts, we observed an increase in 53BP-1 foci in the differentiated progerin expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

However, a previous report indicated that LAP2α may directly interact with chromatin and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechat et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, since exogenous telomerase suppresses progerin-induced defects, we investigated whether LAP2α localization to the telomeres was altered in TERT+HGPS cells. To address this with sufficient resolution, we used 3D-structured illumination microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schermelleh et al., 2010</xref>) to compare nuclei from TERT+ wild-type and TERT+HGPS cells. In normal nuclei, LAP2α was present as discrete foci distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), with many foci closely localized with telomeres, visualized by staining for TRF1, a component of the telomere-associated shelterin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Lange, 2005</xref>). We then measured the distribution profile of LAP2α along a ∼400 nm axis from the center of each telomere in 3D-SIM nuclear sections (544 nm thick), at 45° angle intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To eliminate any localization bias due to the observed differences in LAP2α amounts between WT and HGPS nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p &lt; 0.001, n = 17), we normalized the signal intensity to the maximum/minimum LAP2α intensity for each nucleus.

In contrast, in HGPS nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), the distribution of LAP2α in relation to the telomeres was significantly altered, and reached its maximum value roughly 360–400 nm from the center of each telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To address this, we developed a DOX-inducible expression system to regulate the levels and timing of progerin expression in isogenic primary and TERT-positive cells. By using this system, we find that progerin inhibits proliferation, causes DNA damage and entry into senescence in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that progerin's detrimental effects become apparent only when levels reach a critical threshold. This provides a compelling explanation as to why tissues expressing relatively high levels of lamin A/progerin are central to the pathology of HGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nissan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies showed that progerin-induced defects can be rescued by ectopic expression of TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether physiological levels of TERT would suffice, and to what extent TERT prevents progerin's defects. Our results confirm that ectopic expression of TERT prevents progerin-induced DNA damage, proliferation defects, premature senescence and senescence-associated loss of lamin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, by expressing progerin and lamin A in ESCs which express endogenous levels of TERT, and <italic>Tert</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> ESC, we demonstrate that physiological levels of TERT are sufficient to prevent progerin-induced proliferation defects and changes in gene expression. These results may be relevant to HGPS patients, as TERT expression during embryogenesis or in adult stem cell compartments may protect these cells from the detrimental consequences of progerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 1996</xref>). In this respect, HGPS may be quite different from dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a premature ageing disorder that is caused by defects in telomerase that particularly affects stem cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vulliamy et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here we have expanded the analysis as to what physiological and biochemical parameters are effected by progerin, and to what extent they are restored to normal levels by the simultaneous expression of TERT. Importantly, the microarray analysis revealed that the persistent loss of H3K27me3 in TERT-positive progerin expressing cells did not result in significant changes in gene expression. However in determining the levels of the heterochromatin marker H3K27me3, in primary and TERT-positive cells, we found that TERT does not prevent progerin-induced loss of heterochromatin. This, in turn, suggests that the changes in gene expression in primary fibroblasts expressing progerin are a consequence of premature senescence, rather than a direct consequence of progerin expression.</p><p>To determine the direct effects of progerin on other nuclear proteins, with the consequent impairment of cell proliferation and premature senescence, we compared the protein interactomes of lamin A and progerin. Previous studies showed that lamin A interacts with LAP2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dechat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubben et al., 2010</xref>). Our interactome analysis confirmed this interaction, but demonstrated that the physical interaction between LAP2α and progerin was significantly reduced. Furthermore, it had been suggested that LAP2α may transiently associate with telomeres during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechat et al., 2004</xref>), and cells with a disrupted nuclear lamina show abnormal telomere localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taimen et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore compared telomere distribution, and their association with LAP2α, in HGPS and normal nuclei. We found that a significant proportion of telomeres can be found at the nuclear periphery, and that their distribution is not perturbed by progerin. This suggests that other progeroid mutations (<italic>LMNA</italic> E145K), or loss of <italic>LMNA</italic> may have different effects on telomere localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez-Suarez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taimen et al., 2009</xref>). Although telomere distribution was unaffected, we find that the association of LAP2α with telomeres is reduced in HGPS.</p><p>To determine the functional relevance of these changes, we modulated LAP2α levels in normal and progerin-expressing fibroblasts. Depletion of LAP2 exacerbated the progerin-induced defects whereas increasing nuclear LAP2α levels prevented the proliferation defects, DNA damage and premature senescence resulting from progerin expression. This rescue was specific to the α-isoform of LAP2, as increasing LAP2β levels failed to restore normal rates of proliferation. Moreover, increased or decreased levels of LAP2α led to diametrically opposed effects between normal and progerin-expressing cells. Taken together, our data provide mechanistic evidence that LAP2α plays a key role in the HGPS pathophysiology and that progerin-induced defects are rescued by ectopic expression of LAP2α.</p><p>Changes in the levels of LAP2α are emerging as a consistent feature in at least some of the laminopathies. Loss of <italic>Lmna</italic>, that causes cardiomyopathy and muscular wasting/dystrophy results in a transient increase in LAP2α in muscle precursors and myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melcon et al., 2006</xref>). However, ablation of LAP2α in <italic>Lmna</italic> null mice significantly reduces the severity of the disease and increases longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>), a result similar to that observed following elimination of another nuclear envelope protein Sun1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Together these observations, and those presented here, suggest that the lamina/nuclear envelope forms an integrated and mutually regulated stoichiometric network of proteins. When the network is disrupted, for example by <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations, one of the consequences is that the levels of other protein components change, with this change being a major contributing factor to the consequent pathology.</p><p>Within this context, and based on the results presented here, we propose a model linking progerin and LAP2α to human telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this model, telomeres in normal cells are surrounded by LAP2α complexes, which in turn interact with nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In progeria, the impaired association between LAP2α and progerin disrupts this organization and ultimately leads to premature senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This can be prevented by expression of either telomerase or by increasing the levels of LAP2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). However, it is not clear if the effect of TERT mechanistically differs from the rescue by LAP2α. Our data suggest that this indeed might be the case: in contrast to LAP2α, TERT expression does not ameliorate the progerin-induced reduction in H3K27me3 levels. However, it remains to be investigated whether progerin affects H3K27me3 specifically at telomeric- or subtelomeric regions, and how expression of LAP2α ameliorates this loss. Telomeres are fragile sites and a reduction in heterochromatin has been associated with increased susceptibility to DNA damage and cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sfeir et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Micco et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, progerin expression destabilizes chromosome ends, causing DNA damage and premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al., 2014</xref>). By elongating telomeres, TERT counteracts such telomere loss and prevents the telomeric DNA damage associated with HGPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast to TERT, we found that increased LAP2α alleviates the progerin-induced loss of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Chromatin decondensation by treatment with valproic acid enhanced progerin-dependent proliferation defects. Taken together, our results suggest that increased LAP2α stabilizes chromatin structure by increasing H3K27me3 and prevents progerin-associated DNA damage that resulted in premature senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In support of this notion, both LAP2α and H3K27me3 decline during normal ageing in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naetar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreesen et al., 2013</xref>), and it has been suggested that sustaining heterochromatin levels may extend lifespan by protecting against DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larson et al., 2012</xref>). Our results have important implications in understanding the role of the nuclear architecture, in particular the lamina and nuclear envelope, in regulating cell proliferation, chromatin organization and in providing novel insights into the molecular pathology of progeria. They may also be relevant to other laminopathies that are associated with perturbations or mutations of components of the nuclear lamina.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07759.017</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Putative model of lamin A/progerin::LAP2α interaction mechanism with telomeres.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normal formation of lamin A::LAP2 complexes allows proper positioning of LAP2α near telomeres (green).

Your submission has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor), Karsten Weis (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers, one of whom, Claus Azzalin, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study describes a new cell culture model for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the progeroid phenotype, by expressing wild-type lamin A or progerin (the mutant form of lamin A expressed in HGPS) under an inducible promoter in normal primary human fibroblasts. This system recapitulates several phenotypes observed in patient cells and other cell culture models, and the authors demonstrate that exogenous TERT rescues most of these phenotypes. Furthermore they show that a well-known binding partner of lamin A, LAP2α, has reduced binding to progerin and begin to investigate the mechanism by which reduced lap2α binding may contribute to progeroid phenotypes.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript contains interesting information and that the newly developed cell culture model is very useful. However, there was also a consensus that key experiments and experimental details are missing from this study and that significant revisions are needed before the paper could be accepted in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key issue is that the authors use different cell types to come to their conclusions. For example, the conclusion that physiological levels of TERT are sufficient to prevent progerin-associated phenotypes is not supported. There are other unique features of embryonic stem cells that could explain this or contribute. Hence the authors need to test their hypothesis more directly, for example by inhibiting telomerase in ES cells.</p><p>2) Similarly, it is unclear why the authors switched to patient derived cells to investigate the association of lap2α with telomeres, especially after they highlight the advantages of the cell culture model they developed. Some validation experiments should also be conducted in the progerin inducible system.</p><p>3) The phenotypic analysis of lap2α expression on progerin-associated phenotypes is expected to mirror that of TERT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (main and supplement) to really determine whether these proteins operate by the same or different mechanisms. Again it is unclear why the authors are going back and forth between systems but proliferation data are shown in the inducible expression system, whereas heterochromatin data are shown for patient cells. The authors should include experiments addressing how exogenous expression of lap2α affects nuclear morphology, heterochromatin, proliferation, DNA damage foci, senescence, and importantly, telomere length/stability all in the same system. The telomere analysis is particularly obvious, given the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Finally, the controls used in this figure are different. Throughout the paper and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>, wild-type lamin A is used as a control for progerin. However, the authors switch to a ‘control vector’ in panels C-J. Is this because expression of lamin A alone has some effects?</p><p>4) The authors should test whether Lap2α is required for TERT to rescue the progerin-associated phenotypes (and perhaps vice versa, in cells that express endogenous TERT).</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, panel H: why is natural Progerin running much closer to LMNC than to LMNA, while it is the opposite for the V5-tagged Progerin (see same figure panel A or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)? It is unlikely that one V5 tag (10 aa) could explain this discrepancy.</p><p>2) The effects of over-expressing LAP2α on H3K27me3 levels need to be tested also in normal fibroblasts. Without this control it is not clear whether LAP2α and progerin control H3K27me3 levels within the same pathway.</p><p>3) It would be interesting to add data about the ability of LAP2α to prevent 53BP1 foci accumulation in progerin expressing cells.</p><p>4) The experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref> are difficult to interpret and are not helpful. Inhibition of HDACs leads to a plethora of cellular alterations, which are difficult to control. Whether the synergistic/additive effect observed on the growth rates of cells expressing progerin and treated with VPA derive from an ‘open chromatin’ state remains totally unclear. VPA treatment could, for example, lead to de-regulation of one or more transcripts encoding polypeptides responsible for the observed effects. Also, the authors have not directly tested the state of telomeric and subtelomeric heterochromatin but only looked at total H3K27me3 levels. The authors need to tone down their model, which is presented in a rather dogmatic way.</p><p>5) The authors neglect to consider in their manuscript the functional interaction between lamin A and the telomere binding protein TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wood et al., 2014</xref>, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms6467">10.1038/ncomms6467</ext-link>).</p><p>6) Proliferation is quantified in several different ways throughout the manuscript (growth rate (% of control), cell counts over time, growth index, and growth rate (AU), and the methods for these measurements are insufficiently described. It is important that these data are presented consistently across the figures for ease of comparison- the growth index with inset of growth rate seems to be the most useful.</p><p>7) Statistical analyses are unclear and inconsistent (for example, some growth rate graphs have asterisks, some do not); each figure legend should describe the statistical analysis of the experiments therein (the actual tests used, not just p-values and n). Throughout the text of the manuscript, it is not clear what trends/differences the authors are claiming to be statistically significant (for example, DNA damage foci in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and emPAI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>8) The Methods are sparse in detail and do not provide enough information (or references) for someone to reproduce the experiments.</p><p>9) Does TERT suppress progerin effects on nuclear morphology (as shown for mESCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)? Also, panels A/B seem more appropriate for supplemental, while a zoom image of nuclear morphology changes would be helpful in the main figure.</p><p>10) The authors note in the manuscript text (in the subsection “Super-resolution microscopy reveals impaired localization of LAP2α to telomeres in HGPS cells”) associated with this figure that previous studies have examined the interactome of lamin A and progerin, but they neglect to mention that at least one of these studies identified differential binding partners and LAP2α was not among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubben et al., 2010</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/nucl.1.6.13512">doi:10.4161/nucl.1.6.13512</ext-link>). Also, regarding the in vitro binding studies of LAP2α and wild-type lamin A vs. progerin: the use of the word ‘recombinant’ for proteins generated by in vitro transcription/translation is mis-leading. ‘Recombinant’ suggests the proteins are expressed and purified from bacteria. In this case, there are other proteins present which may affect the interaction. Furthermore, emerin is included as a control without the corresponding input blots or any description in the Methods.</p><p>11) Panel E is very confusing and the associated text (in the subsection “Super-resolution microscopy reveals impaired localization of LAP2α to telomeres in HGPS cells”) and figure legend need a simpler explanation (could be supplemental).</p><p>12) Panel B seems more appropriate for supplemental, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref> should be in the main figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref> – this set of experiments is somewhat contradictory to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> because ES cells have an ‘open chromatin’ configuration-perhaps cells that have ‘open chromatin’ need to express TERT to protect them from DNA damage? This should be addressed in the text (otherwise, the figure is dispensable).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07759.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) A key issue is that the authors use different cell types to come to their conclusions.

There are other unique features of embryonic stem cells that could explain this or contribute. Hence the authors need to test their hypothesis more directly, for example by inhibiting telomerase in ES cells</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is a very important point and had actually performed part of these experiments at the time of our initial submission. These additional results are presented at the end of the subsection “Progerin impairs proliferation, induces premature senescence and loss of lamin B1 in primary fibroblasts” of the revised manuscript, in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>:</p><p>a) It has been well documented that telomerase is downregulated during ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2000</xref>). To test whether physiological downregulation of telomerase would render the cells – derived from progerin expressing ESC – susceptible to progerin expression, we differentiated them. We generated embryoid bodies using the hanging drop method, and measured differentiation by analyzing the extent of the differentiated outgrowth upon plating the EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>). As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, expression of lamin A or progerin did not significantly alter the ability of these cells to aggregate and form embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the differentiated cell layer arising from the embryoid bodies after plating was significantly smaller in embryoid bodies expressing progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The impaired growth of the differentiated outgrowth layer was accompanied by an increase in 53BP-1 DNA damage foci staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>b) To further determine whether telomerase was responsible for protecting pluripotent mESC from the detrimental consequences of progerin expression, we derived mESC from telomerase deficient mice and expressed progerin in these cells. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-I</xref>, expression of progerin in pluripotent TERT-deficient mESC led to a dramatic decline in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and triggered widespread differentiation of the mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Consistent with these findings, progerin expressing TERT-/- mESC formed significantly smaller embryoid bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>c) Lastly, as the reviewers pointed out, there could be significant differences in the composition of the nuclear lamina and chromatin organization in mESC versus human fibroblasts. To investigate whether our BioID results can be recapitulated in mESC, we expressed BirA-progerin and BirA-lamin A in pluripotent mESC. In agreement with what we observed in our human fibroblasts model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), progerin exhibits a weaker “interaction” with LAP2 in mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these experiments support our conclusion that physiological levels of telomerase are sufficient to prevent progerin-induced phenotypes.</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, it is unclear why the authors switched to patient derived cells to investigate the association of LAP2α with telomeres, especially after they highlight the advantages of the cell culture model they developed. Some validation experiments should also be conducted in the progerin inducible system</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers' concern and conducted additional experiments in the progerin inducible system and vice versa.</p><p>a) In the original submission, we reported an inverse correlation between progerin levels and H3K27me3 loss in wild type cells (+/- TERT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We have now recapitulated these findings in two primary HGPS cells as well as a TERT+HGPS line and added these results as additional panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (panel F) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1K</xref>). These results are described in the revised manuscript in the subsection “Progerin impairs proliferation, induces premature senescence and loss of lamin B1 in primary fibroblasts”.</p><p>b) In the original submission, we observed that LAP2α was localized to telomeres, with a sharp drop of its signal immediately adjacent to the telomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B, D</xref>). We have now reproduced these findings in TERT+ wild type cells ectopically expressing progerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1H</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not observe a significant shift in LAP2α signal around the telomeres upon progerin expression in this system. This is in contrast to our previous results in HGPS cells, but may not be unexpected: the original analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) was performed on TERT+HGPS cells that have been exposed to progerin since their inception, whereas our model cells in Figure 4–figure supplement 4H have only been exposed to progerin for 5 days. They may therefore not have had time to develop an equally strong phenotype in this regard. We mentioned these results in the subsection “Super-resolution microscopy reveals impaired localization of LAP2α to telomeres in HGPS cells” of the revised manuscript.</p><p>c) We conducted additional key experiments in our progerin inducible system. These experiments are described in point 3 below.</p><p><italic>3) The phenotypic analysis of LAP2α expression on progerin-associated phenotypes is expected to mirror that of TERT in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>(main and supplement) to really determine whether these proteins operate by the same or different mechanisms.

Doing such an experiment has nevertheless one major shortcoming that may render its interpretation difficult: as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1I</xref> (and consistent with published data from the Lansdorp Group: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker et al., 2009</xref>), HGPS cells have dramatically shortened telomeres and prematurely senesce. Elongating telomeres will thus remain a limiting step in alleviating primary HGPS cells defects or performing genetic experiments, regardless of any potential effects from LAP2α.</p><p>Nevertheless, we previously transduced HGPS cells with constructs to express LAP2α or hTERT but only obtained clones with the hTERT construct after selection. Although this is no definitive proof, this result suggests that LAP2α does not activate endogenous telomerase, or by some other mechanism elongate telomeres.</p><p><italic>DNA damage foci, senescence</italic></p><p>We agree this is a very important point. As suggested by the reviewer, we analyzed the number of DNA damage foci (by 53BP-1 staining), and senescent cells (by β-gal staining) in progerin expressing cells +/- LAP2α. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2A</xref>, co-expression of LAP2α in progerin expressing cells reduced the number of DNA damage foci (as compared to cells expressing only progerin). In addition, we observed a significant reduction in senescence-associated β-gal positive cells. We added these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2A-C</xref>), described these results in the subsection “Increased LAP2α specifically rescues progerin-induced defects<italic>”</italic> and in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>[…] and importantly, telomere length/stability all in the same system.

Although somewhat speculative, we think telomere length per se does not appear to matter. Mouse cells have very long (50 kB) telomeres and are similarly susceptible to progerin as human telomeres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Throughout the paper and in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A-B</italic></xref><italic>, wild-type lamin A is used as a control for progerin.

Similar to the situation in WT cells, ectopic expression of LAP2α in lamin A expressing cells reduced their proliferation rate. In the same experiment, expression of LAP2α ameliorated progerin-induced proliferation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Lastly, since exogenous lamin A expression did not significantly affect the proliferation rate of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1F</xref>), their transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), the senescence associated loss of lamin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>), nor embryoid body formation and differentiation of WT mESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we used lamin A and vector controls interchangeably depending on the experiments (and vector system) designs.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should test whether LAP2α is required for TERT to rescue the progerin-associated phenotypes (and perhaps vice versa, in cells that express endogenous TERT)</italic>.</p><p>We demonstrate that LAP2 is not necessary for TERT to rescue progerin-induced proliferation defects.

It is unlikely that one V5 tag (10 aa) could explain this discrepancy</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting point: We have previously noted that even in patient derived HGPS cells, the migration pattern of progerin can differ between different studies and possibly different cell types (Zhang et al., Cell Stem Cell 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; Liu et al., Nature 2011, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>; McClintock et al., PLoS One 2007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We currently do not know whether progerin may be subject to some additional modifications.</p><p><italic>2) The effects of over-expressing LAP2α on H3K27me3 levels need to be tested also in normal fibroblasts. Without this control it is not clear whether LAP2α and Progerin control H3K27me3 levels within the same pathway</italic>.</p><p>We have performed this experiment – it is added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1H</xref>. Expression of LAP2α in wild type cells did not significantly alter H3K27me3 levels.

Inhibition of HDACs leads to a plethora of cellular alterations, which are difficult to control. Whether the synergistic/additive effect observed on the growth rates of cells expressing progerin and treated with VPA derive from an ‘open chromatin’ state remains totally unclear. VPA treatment could, for example, lead to de-regulation of one or more transcripts encoding polypeptides responsible for the observed effects. Also, the authors have not directly tested the state of telomeric and subtelomeric heterochromatin but only looked at total H3K27me3 levels. The authors need to tone down their model, which is presented in a rather dogmatic way</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the interpretation of this experiment is worded too strongly. Given the reviewers comments on this experiment, we would be agreeable to remove the VPA experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>) from the manuscript. At this stage, we changed the wording of the experiment / model in the subsection “Increased LAP2α specifically rescues progerin-induced defects<italic>”</italic>: “Based on these results we speculate that a reduction in heterochromatin may render cells more susceptible to progerin-induced proliferation defects.” We also added the following statement to the last paragraph of the Discussion. “However, it remains to be investigated whether progerin affects H3K27me3 specifically at telomeric- or subtelomeric regions, and how expression of LAP2α ameliorates this loss“.</p><p><italic>5) The authors neglect to consider in their manuscript the functional interaction between lamin A and the telomere binding protein TRF2 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61"><italic>Wood et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms6467">10.1038/ncomms6467</ext-link><italic>).</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the study by Wood et al., is interesting and thought-provoking. The authors of this paper show that telomeres / or ITLs are disrupted in HGPS cells. What remains unclear is whether the “disruption of ITLs in HGPS cells” is a cause of progerin-induced senescence – or a consequence. It would be interesting to see whether ITL disruption occurs in TERT+ HGPS cells – or whether ectopic LAP2α expression would prevent it. In addition, it would be interesting to see whether ITL disruption can be recapitulated in progerin expressing wild type cells. However, we think these experiments are beyond the scope of our study. Lastly, immunoprecipitation experiments with lamins are notoriously difficult to perform, as lamins require high salt concentrations to be solubilized. Having said this, we were unable to detect TRF2 in the BioID interactome of lamin A.</p><p><italic>6) Proliferation is quantified in several different ways throughout the manuscript (growth rate (% of control), cell counts over time, growth index, and growth rate (AU)), and the methods for these measurements are insufficiently described. It is important that these data are presented consistently across the figures for ease of comparison- the growth index with inset of growth rate seems to be the most useful.</italic></p><p>We agree and have now added the “growth index” as an inset in each figure panel: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A,D,F,K</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) Statistical analyses are unclear and inconsistent (for example, some growth rate graphs have asterisks, some do not); each figure legend should describe the statistical analysis of the experiments therein (the actual tests used, not just p-values and n).
