that is orchestrated by frontal cortex. The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood. To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions, we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict. We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times. These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), followed by medial frontal cortex (mFC) and then by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics, and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12352.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12352.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12352.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain adapts to control our behavior in different ways depending on the specific situation, which is particularly useful when deciding how to interpret conflicting sets of information. The 'Stroop task' is a classic demonstration of this process. In this task, individuals are shown words where the color and the meaning of the text conflict – for example, the word 'green' is written in blue. When asked what the color of the text is, individuals must suppress the instinct to read the word. This causes them to make more mistakes and take longer to decide on an answer than when they perform the same task using words that have no conflict (for example, when “red” is written in red).</p><p>Previous work has suggested that several regions within part of the brain called the frontal cortex play a role in this cognitive control process. However, the relative contributions of each of these regions, and the order in which they are activated, remain unclear. This is in part due to the fact that accurately measuring the electrical activity of the frontal cortex requires implanting electrodes into the brain.</p><p>Tang et al. took advantage of a rare opportunity to record this activity from a group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their frontal cortex to treat epilepsy. The electrical signals recorded by these electrodes as the subjects performed the Stroop task revealed that four regions in the frontal cortex altered their activity during trials where the color and the meaning of a word conflicted. These responses corresponded with the subject’s reaction time, changed depending on the exact nature of the task, and even reflected the subjects’ errors. These responses arose at different times in different regions, allowing Tang et al. to suggest how signals flow through the frontal cortex during cognitive control.</p><p>In the future it will be important to further understand how the regions of the frontal cortex identified by Tang et al. interact with each other and to establish their roles in cognitive control. These observations could then be used to produce a theoretical framework that describes how the brain adapts behavior to different circumstances.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12352.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12352.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>human neurophysiology</kwd><kwd>cognitive control</kwd><kwd>volitional control</kwd><kwd>computational neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreiman</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1358839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreiman</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCF-1231216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kreiman</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A dynamic and hierarchical sequence of steps in human frontal cortex orchestrates cognitive control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexible control of cognitive processes is fundamental to daily activities, including the execution of goal-directed tasks according to stimulus inputs and context dependencies. An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal (e.g. the word 'red' shown in green versus red). Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times, attributed to weaker signals (color processing) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stroop, 1935</xref>). The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control.</p><p>Neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>), yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood. Lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Servan-Schreiber, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perrett, 1974</xref>), human neuroimaging measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egner and Hirsch, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald, 2000</xref>), and macaque single unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botvinick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). The medial frontal cortex (mFC) also participates in cognitive control, possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botvinick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rushworth et al., 2004</xref>). Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Braver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothé et al., 2011</xref>)—an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonini et al., 2014</xref>). An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botvinick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>). Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botvinick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerns, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerns et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald, 2000</xref>) but the relative contributions of dlPFC, mFC, and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fellows and Farah, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansouri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milham and Banich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rushworth et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Previously, some neuroimaging studies have suggested that these frontal cortex regions can be differentiated based on the presence or absence of conflict signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald, 2000</xref>). The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions (attention, decision-making, uncertainty, cognitive control). These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>). Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control. We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses. We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color.</p><p>We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC, mFC, dlPFC, and also orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control. Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials, and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time, depended on the task, and exhibited adaptation over trials. We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence. Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC. These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded field potentials from 15 epilepsy patients implanted with intracranial electrodes in frontal cortex as they performed the Stroop task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This analysis was performed after removing stimulus repetition trials. The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions (F = 0.25, <italic>P </italic>= 0.86, ANOVA). To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons, we ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate (Materials and methods). The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002, multilevel model). We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions, with similar results (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01, multilevel model). Together, these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conflict responses in other frequency bands</title><p>The results presented above focus on the neural signals filtered within the gamma frequency band (70–120 Hz). We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals (1 to 100 Hz) as well as in the theta, (4 to 8 Hz), beta, (9 to 30 Hz), and low gamma (30–70 Hz) bands. No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band. We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–f</xref>). Across theta and beta frequency bands, we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task (theta: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>–5</sup>, beta: <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10<sup>–4</sup>, multilevel model). Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band, conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to the results in the gamma band, power in the theta and beta bands <italic>decreased</italic> during incongruent trials. Furthermore, power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times (theta: <italic>P</italic> = 0.43, beta: <italic>P</italic> = 0.09, sign-rank test).</p><p>In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands, an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies. In particular, several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oehrn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tort et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling. However, the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.52, sign-rank test).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Error monitoring signals</title><p>The conflict responses reported above are based on correct trials only. Yet, error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeung et al., 2004</xref>). To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring, we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials. In these trials, subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer. Given the high performance level of all subjects, the number of such trials is low. However, these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection (as opposed to error trials without any self-correction). An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. The subject initially made an incorrect response (green), which was rapidly followed with the correct response (red). Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response. In contrast, the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal. Additionally, these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and were consistent across the n = 11 self-corrected trials for this subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001, signed rank test). Another example electrode is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>. There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials (greater than five trials) for this analysis. For each electrode, we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction. Of those n = 7 electrodes, n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, sign-rank test). Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small, these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals. Furthermore, these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12352.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Responses during self-corrected error trials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example self-correction trial from the ACC electrode in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> when the word Green colored in red was presented.

To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs, we compared, across those four regional groups, the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated. Comparing latencies across regions is difficult, especially across subjects with varying reaction times. For a controlled and direct comparison, we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes. This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01, permutation test, post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure, Materials and methods). Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions, followed 207 ± 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 ± 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex. Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 ± 78 ms after dlPFC. This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms. For comparison, subjects’ behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 ± 49 ms. The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes. There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botvinick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kolling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacDonald, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niendam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oehrn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), dlPFC (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), mFC (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and OFC (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mFC and dlPFC have been previously implicated in cognitive control, and these structures are extensively connected to the rest of frontal cortex areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</xref>). The role of the OFC in cognitive control during Stroop-like tasks has not been reported previously, possibly because of technical challenges in neuroimaging near this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiskopf et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task. Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task, even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured, at least partly, by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial.</p><p>The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation (Gratton effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gratton et al., 1992</xref>]) were observed in the ACC, consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>), neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botvinick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerns, 2006</xref>) and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect, suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized. The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials (incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials) than iI trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botvinick et al., 1999</xref>), single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship (iI &gt; cI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation.</p><p>Another discrepancy between neuroimaging studies and single unit recordings is the presence of conflict responses and error signals. Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emeric et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>), see however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebitz and Platt, 2015</xref>), whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC. There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swick and Turken, 2002</xref>). Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials, high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations. A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonini et al., 2014</xref>), and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals. The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeung et al., 2004</xref>) and scalp EEG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes and Yeung, 2011</xref>). These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction, of which conflict and error detection are special cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Braver, 2005</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that ACC and supplementary eye field neurons in macaque monkeys respond to specific stimulus and/or behavioral combinations but are not directly modulated by conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here, the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and were also task dependent (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). In these patients, we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level.</p><p>Besides the high gamma band, we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands, but not the low gamma band (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kahana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ullsperger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000</xref>). There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components. Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior. Additionally, conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band, but decreased power in the theta and beta bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous scalp EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ullsperger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Driel et al., 2015</xref>) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power, suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales. We also observed a decrease in beta power, which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crone et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crone et al., 1998b</xref>). Differences across tasks, recording methods, and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution. The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood. One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitzdorf, 1987</xref>) and can act as channels for communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>), whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>). Along these lines, we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs, leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response.</p><p>While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex, the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset. By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes, we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms. Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC, and the two regions are often grouped together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavanagh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</xref>). Yet, conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds, suggesting an important distinction between the two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rushworth et al., 2004</xref>). The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade. The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shenhav et al, Neuron 2013</xref>). In particular, stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex, where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions, followed by dlPFC, and finally mFC, and OFC.</p><p>Since the local field potential pools over many neurons, latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization. Yet, at least in the ACC, the temporal profile of conflict responses we observed is similar to responses from human single unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>). The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing. There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet, it takes 100–200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Daily decisions require integration of different goals, contexts, input signals, and the consequences of the resulting actions. The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles. The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control, and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were 15 patients (10 male, Ages 10–50, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB), Johns Hopkins Medical Institution (JHMI), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), or Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH).

The latency at which congruent and incongruent stimuli could be discriminated was defined as the first time of this threshold crossing.

To control for this potential confounding effect in our measurements of trial history dependence, we applied two methods. First, for each electrode, we performed an ANCOVA on the gamma power with trial history (cI or iI, for example) as the group and reaction time as a covariate. We computed the regression line, extracted the RT-adjusted gamma power from the y-intercept and used this value in the group analysis. Second, we performed a matched reaction time analysis, where the distribution of reaction times was equalized by subsampling the trials in a histogram-matching procedure with 200 ms bins. This resulted in using only ~50% of the trials.

Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform. For the Stroop and Reading Task separately, the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution. For comparison between tasks, the number of trials was equalized. This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions. Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>). Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials.</p><p>To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions, we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count. This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all the patients for participating in this study, Sheryl Manganaro, Jack Connolly, Paul Dionne, and Karen Walters for technical assistance.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Cascade of neural processing orchestrates cognitive control in human frontal cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favourably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom, Hiram Brownell, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a human ECoG study, which provides evidence for conflict-related signals in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and shows that such signals propagate subsequently to dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortex. The results are important for two reasons: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) They add to another recent human intracranial study (by Sheth and colleagues) in strongly contradicting non-human primate studies, which have – at least until recently – found no evidence for conflict signaling in monkey cingulate, despite the apparent presence of such signals in a large number of human fMRI studies; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) they provide some of the strongest evidence yet that conflict signals arise earliest in dorsal cingulate, with dorsolateral PFC following later. This finding is consistent with a recent crop of theoretical perspectives on frontal lobe function, which have generally placed cingulate in the role of recruiting dorsolateral PFC when there is a demand for cognitive control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Add clarity about how electrodes were chosen to go into the analysis of the temporal hierarchy of conflict related signals. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> says there are 36 electrode pairs between DLPFC and OFC, yet <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> says there are only 24 electrodes in DLPFC that showed a significant difference in γ power between incongruent and congruent trials. Is the latter a prerequisite to be included in the former? The concern is that the peak timing in one or two electrodes might then become particularly influential in determining the calculated difference in timings. The authors should clarify whether this is a problem, and how they dealt with it when computing the statistics on latency difference.</p><p>2) Provide more detail about the distribution of significant electrodes in each individual subject for each region. (This will make clear whether electrodes were only clustered in a few subjects or evenly distributed across the population, and also make clear where the significant pairs of electrodes came from).</p><p>3) One reviewer suggested that it would make more sense to test/plot the logarithm of the γ power ratio when comparing the incongruent and congruent responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>/D/E). The ratio, if not log-transformed, is biased towards having values that are pushed further away from 1 if the numerator is larger than the denominator rather than vice versa (i.e. if incongruent power is double that of congruent, the ratio is 2; if congruent power is double incongruent, the ratio is 0.5). The log (ratio), by contrast, would show the same deviation from zero for an equivalent change in either numerator or denominator.</p><p>4) The OFC is said to show variable latencies across subjects, causing a flatter-looking response profile than other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Might this be because the OFC is more sensory-evoked than other areas recorded? It looks a bit like this from the example electrode, but of course there will be substantial heterogeneity across recordings. Consider adding including as a supplement helpful the sensory-locked equivalent of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> for all regions, as a supplement.</p><p>5) Earlier work by Nakamura and Olson in 2005 (J Neurophys 93, 884-908) looked at apparent conflict responses in monkey supplementary eye fields, and concluded that such signals were essentially epiphenomenal. The neurons they examined all showed response-selective activity, and the 'conflict' activity seen at the population level turned out to reflect non-linear modulation of response-related activity when responses competed. This always struck me as a very serious problem for the 'conflict monitoring' theory. The question is how the present authors can rule out this kind of explanation for their own results. The second paragraph of the subsection “Conflict responses in frontal cortex” reports that γ-band power was invariant to the particular word-color combination presented, which makes it sound like the neural responses being recorded were not response specific.

We first determined whether the neural responses were modulated by conflict and obtained n=51 electrodes across our electrode population (paragraph four, subsection “Conflict responses in frontal cortex”). From this subset of electrodes, we considered all possible pairs of <italic>simultaneously recorded electrodes</italic> across regions (i.e. within the same subject, subheading “Regional differences in conflict response latencies”). This requirement significantly lowers the number of possible pairs: electrode locations are purely dictated by clinical reasons and we did not always have simultaneous pairs for all possible combinations of regions. It is difficult to derive the number of electrode pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (e.g. 36 in the question above) from the number of electrodes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (e.g. 24 in the question above). We have now included a new table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to clarify this, describing the distribution of the 51 electrodes modulated by conflict in each subject. To follow up on the specific question above, there are 24 electrodes in DLPFC. The number 36 is derived from 7 subjects: 3x3+5x3+1x1+1x1+1x3+1x1+6x1.</p><p>The ACC-PFC latency difference is based on one ACC electrode and six PFC electrodes (a total of 6 pairs). We emphasize this point in the text (paragraph one, subheading “Regional differences in conflict response-latencies”). There is only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and we opted not to report this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> because it is only a single case. All the other region pairs we examined have contributions from multiple electrodes across multiple patients.</p><p>For the statistical analysis, we first assessed whether the average latency difference differed significantly across the four regions (non-parametric ANOVA). We generated a null distribution by randomly shuffling the region labels within each subject and recomputing the average latency difference between all possible pairs. This procedure preserves both the statistical properties of each electrode and the number of pairs. Thus, if there were few electrode pairs for a given comparison, the same few pairs would also be driving the latency differences in the null distribution. We assessed the statistical significance of latency differences in each region pair by comparing against the null distribution. This is discussed in the Methods, paragraph two, subheading “Group Analysis.”.</p><p><italic>2) Provide more detail about the distribution of significant electrodes in each individual subject for each region. (This will make clear whether electrodes were only clustered in a few subjects or evenly distributed across the population, and also make clear where the significant pairs of electrodes came from).</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> reports the total number of electrodes per subject. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> reports detailed response metrics for each of the electrodes modulated by conflict in each subject. We have now added <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> with a clearer description of the distribution of significant electrodes in each individual subject. The distribution of electrodes modulated by subject as well as the corresponding pairs can be more directly read from this Table. Because electrode locations are determined by the clinical needs, the coverage varies from subject to subject. To account for this subject-to-subject variation, we used a multilevel model in our group analysis, as noted in paragraph five, subheading “Conflict responses in frontal cortex” and subsection “Group Analysis”.</p><p><italic>3) One reviewer suggested that it would make more sense to test/plot the logarithm of the γ power ratio when comparing the incongruent and congruent responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>/D/E). The ratio, if not log-transformed, is biased towards having values that are pushed further away from 1 if the numerator is larger than the denominator rather than vice versa (i.e. if incongruent power is double that of congruent, the ratio is 2; if congruent power is double incongruent, the ratio is 0.5). The log (ratio), by contrast, would show the same deviation from zero for an equivalent change in either numerator or denominator.</italic> </p><p>We have replaced all the relevant panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) with log-transformed ratios. We note that the ratios are used for display purposes only, and the statistical analyses with the multi-level model use the raw γ power of each condition individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legend). Therefore, this change does not modify any of our statistical tests.</p><p>Based on this question, but unrelated to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we also realized that the same issue pointed out by the reviewers here could be subtly observed in our single electrode examples, particularly before t=0 in the stimulus aligned-responses, (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), where we had normalized the responses by dividing by the baseline and then averaged them. While the statistical analyses were computed on the raw responses without normalization and therefore this point did not affect any of the statistics or conclusions, some of the previous figures showed a slightly above 1 response before t=0. Therefore, we have now replaced these displays with the z-scored γ power in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The OFC is said to show variable latencies across subjects, causing a flatter-looking response profile than other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Might this be because the OFC is more sensory-evoked than other areas recorded?

From this figure averaging across electrodes, it does not seem that there is a stronger sensory evoked response in the OFC that is selective for conflict.</p><p><italic>5) Earlier work by Nakamura and Olson in 2005 (J Neurophys 93, 884-908) looked at apparent conflict responses in monkey supplementary eye fields, and concluded that such signals were essentially epiphenomenal. The neurons they examined all showed response-selective activity, and the 'conflict' activity seen at the population level turned out to reflect non-linear modulation of response-related activity when responses competed. This always struck me as a very serious problem for the 'conflict monitoring' theory. The question is how the present authors can rule out this kind of explanation for their own results. The second paragraph of the subsection “Conflict responses in frontal cortex” reports that γ-band power was invariant to the particular word-color combination presented, which makes it sound like the neural responses being recorded were not response specific. If this were indeed the case, then it would clearly rule out a Nakamura-Olson scenario. And this conclusion would be possible if the data being reported involved single-neuron recordings. However, it is not clear that the reported findings, in an ECoG setting where you're seeing population-level effects, can rule out this alternative interpretation.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important question. It is indeed the case that the neural responses where we observe conflict-selective signals were not response-selective. We do observe sensory responses selective to color or word along the ventral visual stream as well as motor selective responses in motor cortex (now mentioned briefly in paragraph three, Results). However, out of the n=51 conflict- selective electrodes in frontal cortex, we observe response-specific signals in only 1 electrode. Thus, <italic>at the level of EcoG field potentials</italic>, the modulation by conflict cannot be simply explained on the basis of selectivity to specific color/word combinations.</p><p>Unfortunately, in this set of patients, we did not have access to single neuron recordings. Although some investigators have claimed that γ power in field potential signals reflects population-firing rates from the underlying neuronal populations (Manning et al., 2009; Ray and Maunsell, 2011), the relationship between spikes and field potentials is more complex (Buzsaki et al., 2012). We cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons in these areas show stronger selectivity to specific color/word combinations and that this is averaged out in our signals. We now discuss this point in paragraph five, Discussion.</p><p>Additionally, we emphasize that the γ power signals that we observe correlates with several elements of behavior including correlation with reaction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), reflection of the Gratton effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and detection and correction of error trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These correlates suggest that the signals we measure are not just an epiphenomenon.</p></body></sub-article></article>
