Condensin complexes are pivotal for chromosome architecture yet how they shape mitotic chromatin remains unknown. Using acute inactivation approaches and live-cell imaging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, we dissect the role of condensin I in the maintenance of mitotic chromosome structure with unprecedented temporal resolution. Removal of condensin I from pre-established chromosomes results in rapid disassembly of centromeric regions while most chromatin mass undergoes hyper-compaction. This is accompanied by drastic changes in the degree of sister chromatid intertwines. While wild-type metaphase chromosomes display residual levels of catenations, upon timely removal of condensin I, chromosomes present high levels of <italic>de novo</italic> Topoisomerase II (TopoII)-dependent re-entanglements, and complete failure in chromosome segregation. TopoII is thus capable of re-intertwining previously separated DNA molecules and condensin I continuously required to counteract this erroneous activity. We propose that maintenance of chromosome resolution is a highly dynamic bidirectional process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26120.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26120.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26120.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells can contain huge amounts of genetic information encoded in long strands of DNA. In total several metres of DNA are packed into a small space inside each human cell and these strands can easily become entangled and knotted. When a cell divides to produce new cells the DNA is duplicated and the two copies must be reliably separated, meaning all the knots must be undone. If the DNA strands are not properly separated it can cause extensive damage to genes when the cell tries to divide.</p><p>Enzymes called topoisomerases work to undo the tangles in DNA allowing it to be divided into two cells. A large protein complex called “condensin I” plays also an important part in organising DNA, and it has also been implicated in helping to resolve knots in the DNA. However, it was not known how condensin I contributes to the successful separation of DNA into new cells, or when in the course of a cell dividing the knots finally get untangled.</p><p>Cell division is similar in humans and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and so the fly is often used as a simple way to study this process in the laboratory. Now, Piskadlo et al. have examined the role of condensin I in dividing fruit fly cells by using recently developed techniques that rapidly shut down key molecular machineries while cells divide. The results show that condensin I and an enzyme called Topoisomerase II work together to separate entangled DNA. Topisomerase II can both entangle and disentangle DNA strands and it is condensin I that guides this process to ensure that ultimately all the knots are removed.</p><p>These findings show that successful cell division requires constant attention from condensin I to make sure Topoisomerase II aids cell division, rather than making the DNA more tangled. Overall this requires more active and constant work to disentangle DNA than expected, and further work is now needed to explain why. Understanding how cells avoid DNA damage during division clarifies why errors in this process cause diseases. For example, changes to condensin I are common in certain cancers and can also lead to disrupted brain development (e.g. microcephaly).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26120.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26120.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome condensation</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRFH/BD/52172/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskadlo</surname><given-names>Ewa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCCIG321883/CCC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Raquel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG2778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Raquel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF/0085½012/CP0185/CT0004 WP1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Raquel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-STG-638917-ChromoCellDev</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Raquel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Condensin I maintains chromosome organization throughout metaphase by preventing erroneous topoisomerase II-dependent sister chromatid re-entanglements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic chromosome assembly, although poorly understood at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piskadlo and Oliveira, 2016</xref>), fulfils three major tasks essential for faithful chromosome segregation: First, it ensures chromosome compaction making cell division feasible within the cell space. Secondly, it provides chromosomes with the right mechanical properties (e.g. bendiness and rigidity) to facilitate their drastic movements during mitosis. Lastly, it ensures the resolution of the topological constrains that exist between the two sister DNA molecules, as well as between neighbouring chromosomes (chromosome individualization), a key requisite for efficient chromosome partitioning. At the heart of these structural changes are the condensin complexes. Condensin complexes, one of the most abundant non-histone complexes on mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ono et al., 2003</xref>), are composed of two structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins (SMC2 and SMC4) bridged by a kleisin subunit (Barren/Cap-H for condensin I and Barren2/Cap-H2 for condensin II)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ono et al., 2003</xref>). Despite extensive research over the last years, how condensins contribute to chromosome morphology is not completely understood. Biochemical and phenotypic analysis of condensin depletion suggest several possible activities for these complexes, including the resolution of DNA entanglements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffensen et al., 2001</xref>) and structural integrity by conferring chromosome rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houlard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>). Whether or not these complexes also promote chromatin compaction remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura and Hirano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffensen et al., 2001</xref>). The multiple phenotypes observed on mitotic chromosomes upon depletion of condensin complexes raise the possibility that these complexes may have distinct roles at different times of mitosis. Additionally, several lines of evidence support that these complexes also influence interphase chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cobbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartl et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it is difficult, if not impossible to interpret the results when condensins are depleted prior to mitotic entry using conventional depletion approaches. To circumvent this limitation, we adopt a ‘reverse and acute’ approach to dissect the role of condensin I in the maintenance of chromosome organization. We find that inactivation of one condensin I specifically during metaphase leads to over-compaction at the majority of chromosomal regions. We further demonstrate that upon condensin I cleavage previously separated sister DNA molecules undergo topoisomerase II-dependent re-intertwining and complete failure in chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A TEV-protease mediated system to inactivate condensin I in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></title><p>To study the role of condensin complexes in the maintenance of chromosome structure, specifically during metaphase, we developed a system to enable analysis of chromosomal structural changes upon rapid and temporally controlled inactivation of condensin in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

However, in both cases the inactivation of condensin complexes took place within over an hour after TEV protease induction. Direct injection of TEV-protease into syncytial embryos, in contrast, allowed cleavage and the removal of chromosome-associated Barren<sup>TEV</sup> within 8–15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>), enabling the analysis of the immediate consequences upon disruption of this complex. To confirm that TEV-protease was able to inactivate condensin I efficiently within a few minutes, by cleavage of Barren<sup>TEV</sup>, we injected TEV protease in embryos derived from females surviving solely on Barren<sup>TEV</sup> (ectopic expression of Barren<sup>TEV</sup> in a <italic>Barr<sup>L305</sup></italic> null background). Injection of TEV-protease in early interphase embryos leads to complete failure of the subsequent mitosis (which takes place within ~15 min in these embryos).

Whereas injection of buffer causes no change in the distance between centromeres, TEV protease injection in strains containing solely TEV-cleavable Barren results in rapid separation of centromeres, that appear to stretch towards the poles, leaving behind the majority of the chromatin mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>).

We defined chromosome compaction by degree of chromatin density, inferred from the signal of fluorescently labelled histone H2Av-mRFP1. To quantify the changes in chromosome compaction upon condensin inactivation, we used quantitative imaging analysis to monitor the mean voxel intensity, volume and surface area of each metaphase plate, over time, in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We found that injection of TEV protease in strains surviving only on Barren<sup>TEV</sup> leads to an overall over-compaction of the entire chromatin mass, as evidenced by an increase in the mean voxel intensity and a decrease in both the surface area and the volume of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). Injection of the protease in strains that do not contain TEV-cleavage sites does not result in any evident change in chromosome compaction relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that chromosome over-compaction is specific of condensin I inactivation.</p><p>In contrast, inactivation of Topoisomerase II (TopoII) using a small molecule inhibitor (ICRF-193), leads to rapid de-compaction of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). TopoII has been previously implicated in chromosome compaction although its role in the process remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piskadlo and Oliveira, 2016</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that chromosome decompaction may be exacerbated by the fact that ICRF-193 traps TopoII onto chromatin, our results support that TopoII may contribute to chromosome compaction in metaphase, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>), possibly by promoting self-entanglements within the same chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, combined inactivation of both TopoII and condensin I results in chromosome decompaction similar to TopoII inhibition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).

Enzymatically, TopoII can promote both the decatenation and the concatenation of DNA strands. Efficient chromosome segregation requires that TopoII is strongly biased towards decatenation prior to anaphase onset but it is conceivable that TopoII can additionally drive the concatenation of native metaphase chromosomes, in vivo. To test whether condensin I removal leads to re-catenation of previously separated sisters, we tested several predictions that arise from this hypothesis: First, the hyper-compaction observed in metaphase, if derived from sister-chromatid re-intertwining, should be dependent on the proximity between DNA molecules. The physical separation of sister chromatids will increase the distance between these two molecules, placing them too far apart, and consequently decreasing the likelihood of their re-entanglement, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). Secondly, re-intertwining in late metaphase should lead to severe segregation failures. And lastly, DNA entanglements and the consequent segregation defects should depend on TopoII activity.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of sister chromatid proximity in chromosome condensation upon condensin inactivation we combined TEV-mediated cleavage of condensin I and cohesin by the use of strains carrying TEV-sensitive Rad21 (cohesin) and Barren (condensin) proteins. We took advantage of the fact that Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> cleavage is more efficient than Barren<sup>TEV</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which allowed the analysis of changes in chromosome architecture upon condensin inactivation after artificial separation of sister chromatids.

To quantify the degree of movement, we used a displacement-quantification method that infers chromosome movement by the overlap between chromosome positions on consecutive frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mirkovic et al., 2015</xref>). Cohesin cleavage alone leads to strong shuffling of isolated single chromatids, as previously described. However, concomitant inactivation of condensin and cohesin results in much slower chromatid movements, with chromatids accumulating in the middle of the segregation plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). Condensin I is thus important for efficient movement of isolated chromatids. This may be due abnormal centromere/kinetochore structure and/or to a possible role for condensin in the error-correction process, as recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peplowska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Verzijlbergen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The reduced chromosome movement observed upon condensin I inactivation leads to considerable differences in chromatid positioning in both experimental set-ups. Thus, we restricted our chromosome morphology/compaction analysis to measurements of isolated single sisters, as quantifying the entire chromatin mass would include many confounding variables. Measurements of isolated single chromatids were performed at 20 min after injections and normalized to the values at 5 min after protease injection (once complete separation has occurred but no significant changes in chromosome structure was yet observed). Chromatids considerably change their shape, becoming thicker and shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ono et al., 2003</xref>). To directly measure the degree of compaction of these isolated sisters, we measured their mean voxel intensity. This analysis revealed that despite the significant changes in chromatid organization, there is no overall change in the mean voxel intensity of single chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), indicating that shape changes are not accompanied by an overall increase in chromatin compaction. We therefore conclude that condensin I inactivation does not promote further chromosome compaction if sister chromatids are physically apart, in contrast to the effect observed in metaphase-arrested chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results support that over-compaction observed in metaphase chromosomes may arise from sister chromatid re-intertwining, consistent with previous observations using yeast circular mini-chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that condensin I inactivation also promotes abnormal re-entanglement in cis (between distal regions of the same chromatid). The shape changes observed upon condensin inactivation from isolated sisters (shorter and thicker chromatids) could indeed be explained by an excess of concatenation within the same DNA molecule, leading to the shortening of the longitudinal axis. However, our compaction measurements indicate that such changes, if occur, do not lead to detectable increase in chromatin density.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26120.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Chromosome over-compaction depends on sister-chromatid proximity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Stills from metaphase-arrested embryos after injection of TEV protease in strains surviving solely on Rad21<sup>TEV</sup> (cohesin cleavage) or Rad21<sup>TEV</sup>+Barren<sup>TEV</sup> (cohesin and condensin cleavage); embryos also express HisH2B-RFP; scale bars, 5 μm.

These findings imply that in metaphase-arrested chromosomes the amount of unresolved catenations is residual. In contrast, inactivation of condensin I during metaphase leads to complete impairment of the segregation process, as revealed by the high frequency of ‘fused’ chromatin masses, with the chromosomes remaining in the centre of the segregation plane, and a significant decrease in the distance between segregating centromeres (6,08 ± 0,92 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>).

If TopoII-dependent re-catenation occurs upon condensin I inactivation, one would expect that the combination of TopoII and condensin I inactivation should reduce the amount of chromatin trapped in the middle of the segregation plane. On the contrary, if segregation defects result from pre-existing catenations, combined inhibition of condensin I and TopoII should increase, or at least maintain, the density of chromosome bridges and segregation impairment.</p><p>To address this issue, we used the same experimental layout as above but induced concomitant inactivation of condensin I and TopoII during the metaphase arrest. These experiments reveal a partial rescue of the retained chromatin mass, inferred by HisH2Av-mRFP1 profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). Chromosome positioning may not be linearly correlated with the amount of linkages bridging the two sister chromatids and thus the reduction on chromosome intertwines may be even more pronounced than inferred by histone profiles. In accordance with this notion, the efficiency of chromosome separation inferred by the position of centromeres returns to levels indistinguishable from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). Thus, concomitant inactivation of condensin I and TopoII significantly reverts the defects associated with condensin I removal. We therefore conclude that the segregation defects observed upon metaphase-specific condensin I inactivation are caused by de novo TopoII-dependent re-intertwining of previously separated sister chromatids.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media12" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26120-media12.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26120.027</object-id><label>Video 12.</label><caption><title>Induced anaphase after timely inhibition of Condensin I and topoisomerase II.</title><p>Embryos expressing solely Barren<sup>TEV</sup> were injected with 12 mg/ml of a dominant-negative form of the human E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UbcH10<sup>C114S</sup>), to induce a metaphase arrest, and subsequently injected with a mix of 280 μM ICRF-193 and 13 mg/ml TEV protease.

Here we provide evidence that temporally controlled inactivation of condensin I, specifically during metaphase, causes an increase in the overall levels of chromosome compaction in non-centromeric regions. These findings strongly argue that condensin I is required to maintain chromosomal architecture but not to sustain their compacted state. Studies using similar inactivation techniques in mouse oocytes have proposed that condensins confirm longitudinal rigidity, as chromosomes disassemble upon condensin inactivation (particularly condensin II)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Houlard et al., 2015</xref>). At first sight, these findings may be perceived as in sharp contrast to our current observations. It should nevertheless be noted that meiotic chromosomes are under very different force-balance than their mitotic counterparts. In particular, spindle attachment on meiotic bivalents imposes stretching along the longitudinal axis of chromosomes, similarly to what we report here for the pericentromeric region in mitotic chromosomes. Our results now demonstrate that when chromosomes are not subjected to significant additional forces, condensin I inactivation results in an overall chromatin over-compaction rather than chromosome de-condensation. This force-dependent phenotype may explain several inconsistencies in prior analysis on condensins depletion that as sample preparation, chromosome state, presence/absence of microtubules, or even the cell division type (mitosis vs meiosis) may play a major role in chromosome morphology. In contrast to condensin I inactivation, TopoII inhibition leads to rapid chromosome decompaction. These finding are consistent with the idea that metaphase chromosome structure is organized as a chromatin network resultant from self-entanglements of DNA strands, as initially proposed by biophysical studies on isolated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawamura et al., 2010</xref>). Restricting/favouring chromosome entanglements may thus dictate the state of chromosome compaction.</p><p>Condensin has been previously proposed to interplay with TopoII, both for chromosome compaction and sister chromatid resolution. The exact details for this interaction, however, remain elusive. Both condensins and TopoII inactivation impair sister chromatid resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ribeiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffensen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uemura et al., 1987</xref>), suggesting these two molecules have cooperative roles on chromosome resolution. In contrast, cytological analyses suggest that condensin and TopoII have opposite roles in shaping mitotic chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>), raising further doubts on their functional interaction. It has long been hypothesized that condensin may impose directionality on TopoII reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charbin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard et al., 2015</xref>), as this enzyme is able to both decatenate and catenate DNA strands. But this model has been very difficult to formally prove. Studies in yeast using artificial circular mini-chromosomes, in which the levels of catenation can be directly measured, support that full decatenation by TopoII requires condensin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charbin et al., 2014</xref>). Whether the same is true in large and linear native chromosomes remained to be addressed, particularly as circular chromosomes are under different topological constrains when compared to linear ones. The experimental approach used in our study allowed the manipulation of native chromosomes, in their natural environment, providing evidence that upon removal of condensin I, previously separated sister chromatids re-intertwine in a TopoII-dependent manner. These findings are in agreement with a recent study that revealed that the resolution of sister chromatids from circular minichromosomes can be reverted by increased expression of TopoII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). All together, these results support that condensin I is not directly necessary for TopoII catalytic activity, but rather to impose directionality on TopoII reactions, favouring resolution of the sister DNA molecules rather than their intertwine. Upon condensin I removal, creation of new links between previously separated DNA strands leads to their increased proximity, which may underlie the observed increase in chromosome compaction. Importantly, our studies reveal that TopoII is able to promote erroneous re-entanglements of sister chromatids throughout mitosis, an activity that needs to be constantly opposed by condensin I.</p><p>How condensin I is able to confer such directionality remains to be addressed. Condensins are enriched at the chromosome axis where they have been proposed to promote interactions within the same chromatid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ono et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steffensen et al., 2001</xref>). Condensin I was shown to display significant turn-over on mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oliveira et al., 2007</xref>) highlighting that its mode of action relies in dynamic reactions rather than statically holding chromatin loops. Bringing strands of DNA from the same chromatid in close proximity could alone favour sister chromatid decatenation by limiting the probability contacts between sister DNA molecules. Models that predict that DNA loops can extrude away from condensin have been hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goloborodko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>) and are better at explaining the directionally issue, as they provide a mechanism that inherently explains how condensins distinguish intra- versus inter-chromosomal looping. Random intrachromatid linkages are also possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>), although in this case additional mechanisms may ensure that connections in cis are favoured over linkages between sister- (and nearby) chromatids. Condensin I- mediated supercoiling of the DNA molecule has also been proposed to change DNA structure to favour DNA decatenation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2016</xref>), although it is yet to be determined whether the supercoiling activity of this complex can account for all the phenotypes associated with condensin loss.</p><p>Our analysis further reveals that maintenance of chromosome architecture, particularly sister chromatid resolution, is not a unidirectional process but instead a much more dynamic reaction than previously anticipated. It is conceivable that the highly compacted chromatin state present in metaphase chromosomes could, on its own, shift TopoII reaction towards sister chromatid re-entanglement given the increased proximity between DNA strands. Condensin I would thus counteract an inherent tendency of chromosomes to re-intertwine, a reaction necessary throughout metaphase. Additionally, it is possible that a dynamic balance of chromosome entanglements allows remodelling of chromosome architecture, providing chromosomes with plasticity to counteract the cytoplasmic drag faced during dynamic movements. Energy released during these reactions could potentially be used to further facilitate chromosome movement. Mitotic chromosomes should thus be visualized as highly dynamic structures during mitosis, whose re-shaping may be fundamental for the fidelity of their own segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>To destroy condensin by TEV protease-mediated cleavage, strains carrying solely TEV-sensitive Barren versions were produced.

The same metaphase was tracked over time and average values for mean voxel intensity, volume and surface area were normalized to the first frame after injection. For the fluorescence profiles presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b–e,a</xref> wide 15 μm-long line was placed manually along the segregation plane and measured using the ‘Plot Profile’ function on FIJI software. For each data set, values were normalized to the maximum. Measurements of single chromatids width and length were performed on projected images (maximum intensity projection), using FIJI software and single chromatids mean voxel intensity measurements were performed using Imaris software. Quantification of chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mirkovic et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, HisH2B-RFP was imaged at 1 min intervals. Images were segmented to select the chromosomal regions, based on an automatic threshold (set in the first frame after TEV injection), to create binary images. For each movie, a walking average of 3 frames was produced (using kymograph plug-in, written by J. Rietdorf and A. Seitz, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) creating a merged image in which the intensity is proportional to the overlap between consecutive frames. Intensity profiles were used to estimate the percentage of non-overlapping, 2- frame overlap and 3-frame overlap pixels.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luis Aragon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three reviewers have assessed your manuscript, and the consensus opinion is that the experimental system is powerful; that the technical execution of the experiments was outstanding; and that the material is suitable for publication after revisions have been undertaken. Below, the overall view, comments and concerns are listed.</p><p>A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of condensin complexes for the structural organization and segregation of mitotic chromosomes, but the precise molecular function of these protein complexes has remained incompletely understood. Oliveira and colleagues report the effects of inactivating condensin I by TEV protease-mediated cleavage of the kleisin subunit at metaphase in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. They observe that sister chromatids fail to resolve while centromeres stretch to the cell poles upon anaphase onset. Interestingly, the density of chromatin mass simultaneously increases in a Topo II-dependent manner, which suggests that sister chromatids that had been previously separated re-entangle in the absence of condensin function. This conclusion is supported by the facts that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1</xref>) the density of already separated sister chromatids does not increase upon condensin cleavage and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2</xref>) simultaneous inactivation of Topo II decreases the segregation defect caused by condensin cleavage. The authors conclude that condensin's role is to maintain sister separation beyond the initial condensation process by preventing re-catenation by Topo II.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>A) The authors miss an opportunity to make their discussion and interpretation of their data as incisive and authoritative as it could be. They need to make it clear that the interpretation that hyper-compaction of chromosome arms is a consequence of increased catenation is a hypothesis; it is not directly demonstrated, only inferred. Furthermore, central to the biological relevance of the observations made is a precise definition of the term 'condensation'. The authors here have a chance to clearly define 'condensation' [see below] and compare it with 'compaction' or 'over-compaction' which is the phenotype measured in the imaging assays; and which does not necessarily reflect a specific 'structure', determined by a specific mechanism. Does the intermingling of sister chromatids, which follows condensin inactivation, indeed reflect the same biological process that takes place during the folding of mitotic chromosomes during mitotic prophase? Presumably not. The statement that condensin removal leads to 'over-condensation' of chromatids is terribly misleading if all that happens is that chromatids get intertwined ['…leads to 'over-compaction as a consequence of chromosome intertwining' would work]. Condensation [the formation of an ordered (intra-chromatid) architecture that cannot just be achieved by compacting chromatin fibers in a random manner] is actually precisely the opposite of what is being observed in this case. The conclusions that &quot;Topo II may alone drive chromosome condensation&quot; is hence a conceptual misinterpretation, as is would suggest that TopoII would either actively drive intra-chromatid catenation of that condensation is a self-organizing principle of mitotic chromatin and TopoII facilitated this process. In either case, only limited conclusions about the principles of the formation of mitotic chromosomes during prophase (i.e. the condensation mechanism) can be drawn from the intertwining of metaphase sister chromatids that results from condensin inactivation.</p><p>B) It would be interesting to know whether when TopoII is depleted in metaphases arrested by SAC, if segregation is more defective than when TopoII is inactivated in metaphases obtained by UbcH10(C114S) (where SAC is not engaged). Yeast work (Farcas et al. 2011; Sen et al. 2016) has shown that plasmids contain higher levels of catenanes in nocodazole arrests than cdc20-depletion arrests, and that condensin activity is different in both arrest. Is this also the case here? The authors should comment on whether this experiment is technically feasible, whether they have this information, and whether they would consider it desirable to include this information and the result.</p><p>C) Could one compare the levels of sister chromatid (re-)entangling after condensin inactivation in metaphase to the levels of intertwining before mitotic chromosomes start to form (i.e. after S phase). Perhaps the authors could measure histone H2Av-mRFP1 densities after TopoII inhibition in G2 phase cells and compare these values to the values measured after condensin activation during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>)? The authors might consider whether this would be a 'doable' and informative experiment.</p><p>D) Does TEV cleavage remove Barren also from centromeres?

Indeed our experiments reveal mechanisms required for <italic>maintenance</italic> of chromosome architecture, which may or may not be similar to the process of chromosome condensation. We have changed the manuscript so that the term condensation is only used to refer to the normal process of mitotic chromosome assembly and used solely the term compaction to refer to the chromatin density we measure upon metaphase perturbations. We also defined specifically the term compaction. You can now read: “We defined chromosome compaction by degree of chromatin density, inferred from the signal of fluorescently labelled histone H2Av-mRFP1.”</p><p><italic>B) It would be interesting to know whether when TopoII is depleted in metaphases arrested by SAC, if segregation is more defective than when TopoII is inactivated in metaphases obtained by UbcH10(C114S) (where SAC is not engaged).

The authors should comment on whether this experiment is technically feasible, whether they have this information, and whether they would consider it desirable to include this information and the result.</italic></p><p>We agree that it would be very interesting to address the efficiency of DNA decatenation in a SAC-arrest situation, as the absence of spindle forces is likely to play a major role in this process. We have thus attempted to address this important issue by several means. However, several experimental limitations precluded a definitive answer. Below is a summary of our attempts to address the issue and the reasons why we considered these experiments inconclusive. A major technical limitation is the inability to measure the levels of catenation specifically in metaphase (a clear advantage of the referred studies in budding yeast, by the use of purifiable minichromosomes). Throughout the manuscript we used an alternative method, the efficiency of chromosome segregation during anaphase, as an indirect read-out for the amount of catenation. It is thus virtually impossible to access the catenation levels by this method in the absence of a functional spindle, as no anaphase takes place. We therefore opted for not including them in the manuscript.</p><p>1) We have attempted to drive cells into anaphase upon SAC-arrest imposed by spindle depolymerization. This was achieved by colchicine arrest to depolymerize microtubules followed by a Mad2deltaC injection, which works as a dominant negative for the SAC arrest. This method was efficient in driving cells out of mitosis. However, in these experiments, chromosomes simply exited mitosis without any evident separation (formed a tetraploid nucleus), and it was thus impossible to estimate catenation levels under these conditions.</p><p>2) We additionally attempted to use centromere separation in metaphase as an alternative measure of the amount of catenation. TEV-mediated cleavage of cohesin in embryos previously injected with colchicine resulted in a ~ 30% increase in the distances between sister-centromeres without full separation. The absence of full separation of sister chromatids could potentially be interpreted as a read-out of residual catenation, which would be sufficient to keep sister DNA molecules in proximity. However, ongoing studies in the lab revealed that chromatids that have been previously fully separated have a tendency to stay together upon disruption of the mitotic spindle. We therefore trust that the proximity between sister-chromatids observed upon cohesin cleavage is not a reliable read-out of the amount of DNA catenation as chromatids tend to “stick to each other” even when fully separated.</p><p>If the reviewers have any suggestions for an alternative experimental setup that could conclusively address this point we would be happy to consider it.</p><p><italic>C) Could one compare the levels of sister chromatid (re-)entangling after condensin inactivation in metaphase to the levels of intertwining before mitotic chromosomes start to form (i.e. after S phase). Perhaps the authors could measure histone H2Av-mRFP1 densities after TopoII inhibition in G2 phase cells and compare these values to the values measured after condensin activation during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>)? The authors might consider whether this would be a 'doable' and informative experiment.</italic></p><p>We have included this comparative analysis as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As expected, Topo II inhibition before mitotic entry leads to thick chromatin bridges. By contrast, inactivation in metaphase chromosomes produces a much milder phenotype, reinforcing that the degree of catenation in metaphase chromosomes is indeed residual. It was also interesting to note that the defects associated with condensin inactivation before mitosis were, by contrast, milder than observed upon condensin inactivation in metaphase-arrested chromosomes. This further supports the notion that TopoII dependent re-entanglement should be actively suppressed during metaphase, as the degree of re-entanglement in a prolonged metaphase may be even higher than the starting point.</p><p><italic>D) Does TEV cleavage remove Barren also from centromeres? This is difficult to judge, since the CID-EGFP signal masks the Barren-TEV-EGFP signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. It might be useful to show images without a labelled version of CID [it would also be useful if the authors defined 'CID' at its first use].</italic></p><p>To address this point, we performed similar cleavage experiments in strains that do not express CID-GFP maker. This enables tracing Barren<sup>TEV</sup>-EGFP alone, confirming that after TEV injection Barren is rapidly removed from all chromosome regions, including centromeres. We replaced the previous figure with this new result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have also included a description of CID, as suggested (see subsection “A TEV-protease mediated system to inactivate condensin I in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
