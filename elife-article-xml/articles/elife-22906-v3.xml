trophectoderm (TE) from the inner cell mass (ICM) in the mouse blastocyst is determined by position-dependent Hippo signaling. However, the window of responsiveness to Hippo signaling, the exact timing of lineage commitment and the overall relationship between cell commitment and global gene expression changes are still unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing during lineage segregation revealed that the TE transcriptional profile stabilizes earlier than the ICM and prior to blastocyst formation. Using quantitative Cdx2-eGFP expression as a readout of Hippo signaling activity, we assessed the experimental potential of individual blastomeres based on their level of Cdx2-eGFP expression and correlated potential with gene expression dynamics. We find that TE specification and commitment coincide and occur at the time of transcriptional stabilization, whereas ICM cells still retain the ability to regenerate TE up to the early blastocyst stage. Plasticity of both lineages is coincident with their window of sensitivity to Hippo signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22906.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22906.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22906.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In female mammals, conception is a complex process that involves several stages. First, an egg is released from the ovary and travels along a tube called the oviduct, where sperm from a male may fertilize it. If the egg is fertilized, the newly formed embryo moves into the womb, where it will then implant into the walls. In mice, it takes around four days for the embryo to implant and during this time, the cells in the embryo divide several times and start to specialize to form distinct cell types called lineages.</p><p>The first two lineages to form are known as the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm. The inner cell mass forms a ball of cells within the embryo and contains the precursors of all cells that build the animalâs body. The trophectoderm forms a layer that surrounds the inner cell mass and will become part of the placenta (the organ that supplies the embryo with nutrients while it is in the womb). The embryo can organize these lineages without any instructions from the mother. However, it is still not clear when the cells start to differ from each other, and when they âcommitâ to stay in these lineages.</p><p>Cells in the inner cell mass and trophectoderm have different gene expression profiles, meaning that many genes display different levels of activity in these two lineages. Posfai et al. use a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to analyse gene activity as the inner cell mass and trophectoderm form in mouse embryos. By measuring changes in gene activity, it is possible to track their development and show which genes change expression levels when each lineage specifies and commits.</p><p>The experiments reveal that the inner cell mass and trophectoderm lineages develop at different times. As the inner cell mass forms, cells adopt the inner cell mass âidentityâ before they commit to remaining in this lineage, revealing a window of time where different signals could still change the fate of the cells. However, when the early trophectoderm cells show the first signs of specialization, they also commit to their new identity at the same time.</p><p>These findings suggest that the different timings at which these cell lineages form might provide embryos with the means to organize their own cells. An important future challenge is to understand exactly how the cells commit to their fate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22906.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22906.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>inner cell mass</kwd><kwd>trophectoderm</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>preimplantation</kwd><kwd>cell plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossant</surname><given-names>Janet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007459</institution-id><institution>Ragnar SÃ¶derbergs stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M67/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lanner</surname><given-names>Fredrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen fÃ¶r Strategisk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICA12-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lanner</surname><given-names>Fredrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.0096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lanner</surname><given-names>Fredrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>VetenskapsrÃ¥det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-2570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lanner</surname><given-names>Fredrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Restracomp Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Posfai</surname><given-names>Eszter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mats Sundin Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petropoulos</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lineage specification and commitment are synchronized in the developing trophectoderm lineage of the mouse embryo, but are asynchronous events in the maturing inner cell mass, revealing a window of plasticity in this lineage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first two lineages to segregate during mammalian development are the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE). The TE is an extraembryonic tissue, giving rise to the trophoblast lineages of the placenta. The ICM will form two additional lineages before implantation - the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), giving rise to all germ layers of the embryo, and the primitive endoderm (PE), largely forming the endoderm layers of the yolk sacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockburn and Rossant, 2010</xref>). At the blastocyst stage, the TE forms a monolayer tight junction-coupled epithelium enclosing the blastocoelic cavity, at one end of which lies the ICM. Inside and outside cell populations first form following the 8 to 16 cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). During the 16 cell stage and during the 16 to 32 cell divisions, division-independent and dependent cell internalization leads to dynamic morphological rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MaÃ®tre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Samarage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). From the 32 cell stage onwards, apart from the relatively rare event of division-independent cell internalization, inside and outside positioning is generally a good indicator of ICM and TE lineage fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McDole et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole and Zheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedersen et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toyooka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During the 8 to 16 cell divisions, cells inherit varying amounts of apically localized proteins from the apical domain â the polarized outside surface forming at the 8 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and Ziomek, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korotkevich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). Inside cells are apolar, while outside cells can either be apolar or polar. Interestingly, outside apolar cells were identified as the cells that internalize during the 16 cell stage in a division-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MaÃ®tre et al., 2016</xref>). Although there is some evidence that individual blastomeres show variation in gene expression and epigenetic marks prior to the 8 cell stage, and that these differences may bias their future fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biase et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plachta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">White et al., 2016</xref>), it is also clear that polarity differences are key to final assignment of cell fate. Polarity differences result in differential activation of the Hippo signaling pathway: active Hippo signaling in apolar cells sequesters the transcriptional co-activator Yap into the cytoplasm, while inactive Hippo in polar cells allows nuclear accumulation of Yap, and its interaction with the transcription factor Tead4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). Nuclear Yap/Tead4 complexes are required for TE formation and are upstream regulators of Cdx2, a key TE-specific transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko and DePamphilis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rayon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>). Activation of Cdx2 expression in TE progenitors leads to downregulation of the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niwa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>), while in ICM progenitors Hippo signaling leads to upregulation of Sox2, a co-factor with Oct4 in pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>). Thus differential Hippo activity is a key driver of ICM-TE lineage segregation. However, the exact time when differential Hippo signaling is instructive to establish cell fate is not known.</p><p>Moreover, the timing of cell fate commitment to ICM or TE is also not fully understood. A number of early studies attempted to define this timing by isolating inside and outside cells at different stages of development and then assessing cell potential in chimeras or re-aggregated embryos. However, these experiments yielded conflicting results. For example, inner cells were reported to have lost TE-forming potential by the 32 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarkowski et al., 2010</xref>), the early-mid blastocyst (~64 cell) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Handyside, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossant and Lis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephenson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">SuwiÅska et al., 2008</xref>) or the late blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grabarek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan and Tilly, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spindle, 1978</xref>). Outside cells were found to retain some plasticity up to the 32 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant and Vijh, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarkowski et al., 2010</xref>) but lost ICM potential when cavitation occurred during 32 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">SuwiÅska et al., 2008</xref>). Using inside/outside position during cleavage as a marker for ICM and TE progenitors cannot be entirely accurate, given the dynamic rearrangements that take place, and so caution is needed in interpreting the conclusions of most of these experiments. This has led to considerable discrepancy between studies regarding the timing of restriction of developmental potential of the ICM.</p><p>In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the temporal dynamics of gene expression during lineage segregation and identify known, as well as novel, markers of the process. We show that quantitative Cdx2-eGFP protein expression is an accurate readout of Hippo signaling activity and thus of the process of ICM-TE specification. We could then experimentally assess the potential of individual blastomeres scored for their level of Cdx2-eGFP expression and correlate with single-cell transcriptional profiles. We were able to resolve discrepancies in the literature and provide novel insights into the dynamics of lineage segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cdx2-eGFP is an early readout of the Hippo signaling environment and the developing TE lineage</title><p>Using a Cdx2-eGFP fusion knock-in mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole and Zheng, 2012</xref>) we confirmed that eGFP expression faithfully mimics endogenous Cdx2 expression dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For example âearly 16 cellâ embryos were harvested at E2.5 â a time point when the population of embryos are between 8 and 16 cell stages â but only 16 cell embryos were used (embryos with average of 12 visible Cdx2-eGFP positive cells). Or âlate 16 cellâ embryos were harvested at E2.75 -when embryos are between 16- and 32 cells - however only strictly 16 cell embryos (embryos with average of 12 visible Cdx2-eGFP positive cells) were used from this time point. We established criteria for staging using the number of Cdx2-eGFP positive cells in live embryos. Graph above shows average number of Cdx2-eGFP positive cells in live staged embryos at each stage (8 cell nÂ =Â 10, early 16 cell nÂ =Â 14, late 16 cell nÂ =Â 19, early 32 cell nÂ =Â 21, late 32 cell nÂ =Â 24,Â ~64 cell nÂ =Â 11 andÂ ~80 cell nÂ =Â 14).

We found that even from the early 16 cell stage onward, inside cells expressed on average significantly lower eGFP levels than outside cells. However, initially some inside and outside cells had overlapping eGFP levels, which gradually segregated by the late 32 cell stage.</p><p>Cdx2 expression is initiated in a heterogeneous, Tead4-independent manner at the morula stage, whilst later expression requires nuclear Yap/Tead4 activity in TE progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2008</xref>). Yap localization is in turn regulated by Hippo signaling in the preimplantation embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cockburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). To visualize how Hippo signaling differences take control of Cdx2 expression, we correlated nuclear/cytoplasmic (n/c) Yap ratios and Cdx2-eGFP levels in embryos at different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that as soon as shuttling of nuclear Yap to the cytoplasm was initiated at the early 16 cell stage, Cdx2-eGFP levels started to show a positive correlation with n/c Yap ratios. This positive correlation progressively increased up to the early 32 cell stage. Thus, emerging Hippo signaling differences, starting at the early 16 cell stage, rapidly seize control of Cdx2 expression and up-regulation in TE progenitors is layered over initial heterogeneous, Tead4-independent signals.</p><p>At the 16 cell stage differential Hippo signaling has been shown to be dictated by differences in cell polarity, rather then position per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MaÃ®tre et al., 2016</xref>). While most outside cells are polarized and have nuclear Yap/Tead (inactive Hippo signaling), a population of apolar outside cells with cytoplasmic Yap (active Hippo signaling) has been reported. Moreover apolar outside cells have been shown to be ICM progenitors, which will eventually contribute to the inside compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MaÃ®tre et al., 2016</xref>). To examine Cdx2-eGFP levels in different outside cell populations at the 16 cell stage we co-stained embryos with a polarity marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and found that apolar outside cells express low eGFP, similar to levels measured in inside cells. Similar results were obtained when n/c Yap ratios were used to distinguish between different outside cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results indicate that upregulation of Cdx2-eGFP is downstream of polarity-induced Hippo inactivation (nuclear Yap localization), rather than position per se at the 16 cell stage.</p><p>Overall, this suggests that Cdx2-eGFP expression level, which is a downstream readout of nuclear Yap/Tead4, rather than position is the more appropriate way to sort putative ICM and TE progenitor cells at different stages of development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals gene expression dynamics in developing ICM and TE lineages</title><p>To explore the molecular dynamics underlying lineage segregation we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of individual cells isolated from <italic>Cdx2-eGFP</italic> embryos ranging from early 16 cell to 64 cell stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Transgenic embryos were generated with a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible dominant-negative Lats2 (DN Lats2) tagged with mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and induced at different stages for 24 hr. Following treatment, embryos expressing high levels of mCherry were analyzed for ICM (Sox2 and Sox17) and TE (Cdx2) lineage markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Our approach to generate transgenic embryos typically resulted in mosaic integration of inducible DN Lats2-mCherry, which allowed us to analyze both transgenic (mCherry positive) and non-transgenic (mCherry negative) ICM cells within the same embryo. Up to the early 32 cell stage, DN Lats2 expression in inner cells could induce fate change as indicated by gain of Cdx2 and loss of ICM markers in most mCherry positive inner cells. At the late 32 cell stage we observed some mCherry positive inner cells (14%) co-expressing Cdx2 and ICM markers, while majority (80%) of cells still fully converted to expressing only Cdx2. When DN Lats2 was induced at the 64 cell stage, however, most inner cells maintained ICM marker expression and did not re-express Cdx2. Only 1% of mCherry positive inner cells switched to expressing only Cdx2 and 4% expressed markers of both lineages. All inner cells in embryos induced atÂ &gt;64 cell stage showed commitment to ICM. Additionally, we noted that expression of only mCherry (without DN Lats2) did not influence cell fate at any stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These results are in good agreement with our findings from embryo reconstruction experiments, indicating that on a mechanistic level, loss of ICM potential of Cdx2-eGFP high cells and loss of TE potential of Cdx2-eGFP low cells corresponds to the time when cells become refractory to Hippo signaling activity or inactivity, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Discussion</title><p>While existing expression profiling datasets provide only limited or partial coverage of ICM-TE lineage segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2011</xref>), our study offers a large, comprehensive single-cell global transcriptional dataset spanning the entire window of lineage segregation with remarkable temporal resolution. We show a gradual separation of ICM and TE lineages starting at the 16 cell stage, where the first transcriptional changes to distinguish cell populations are the activation of TE-specific genes, including <italic>Cdx2. Cdx2</italic> is the only known downstream target of nuclear Yap/Tead4 in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rayon et al., 2014</xref>).

While we detected the initiation of lineage segregation in some cells at the 16 cell stage, others were still in a state of co-expression. The division to the early 32 cell stage marked a drastic transcriptional change, resolving the co-expressing state into ICM or TE profiles. Interestingly, we found that as the TE profile appeared, it also stabilized. On the other hand, the emerging ICM profile underwent considerable maturation until the 64 cell stage, at which point segregation into EPI and PE lineages is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurimoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>); and in this study [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>]).</p><p>Importantly, we link global gene expression patterns to functional measures of cell fate and potential, by charting different experimental readouts as a function of developmental time and level of Cdx2-eGFP expressed in individual cells. We experimentally tested the potential of single cells to contribute to developing lineages of the early embryo using a morula aggregation assay and found that cell behaviors observed in this test reflected the progress of lineage separation apparent from transcriptional profiling. We suggest that in this assay, a single cell finds itself in a competitive host environment and thus can act according to its intrinsic lineage identity: a specified TE progenitor will remain on the outside and contribute to the TE, while a specified ICM progenitor will move in and contribute to the ICM. Live imaging of chimera formation further supported such dynamic behaviors of ICM and TE progenitor cells. Thus we propose that despite the experimental manipulations involved, the morula aggregation assay reports cell fate specification. In contrast, when an entire embryo is reconstructed from only ICM or only TE progenitor cells, competition with the host cells is removed and some cells are inevitably forced inside and others outside. As such, this assay reveals the full potential of cells to change fate when forced into different positions. In this assay, ICM cells showed an extended period of lineage plasticity when compared with the results of the morula aggregation assay. We further showed that loss of responsiveness towards Hippo signaling manipulation coincided with the timing of fate restriction in ICM and TE progenitors, as read out by the reconstruction assay. Thus in the intact embryo and even in the morula aggregation assay, transcriptional profiles predict TE and ICM fates, while in the reconstruction assay and the Hippo manipulation experiments, the full potential of cells to respond to positional changes and associated signaling environments is revealed.</p><p>Importantly, in previous studies only one type of assay was used - either morula aggregation or reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grabarek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Handyside, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hogan and Tilly, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossant and Lis, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spindle, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stephenson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">SuwiÅska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarkowski et al., 2010</xref>). By performing these two assays side by side, we can observe that the morula aggregation assay largely tests cell fate, while the reconstruction assay reveals full developmental potential, thus reconciling differences reported among the previous studies.</p><p>When comparing the dynamics of fate restriction shown by cells in the different assays (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we observed that TE progenitors exhibited similar timing of fate restriction in all assays employed. A majority of Cdx2-eGFP high cells at the early 32 cell stage produced only TE in all three assays, which also corresponded to the time by which most co-expression profiles resolved, as shown by RNA sequencing. On the other hand, ICM progenitors showed fate restriction earlier in the morula aggregation test (by the early 32 cell stage) than they did in the embryo reconstruction and Hippo-inactivation assays (by the 64 cell stage), revealing a time window between lineage specification and commitment. Correspondingly, gene expression dynamics in the ICM lineage also reflected this prolonged maturation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22906.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Graphical summary of specification and commitment of ICM and TE progenitors.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22906.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22906.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-22906-fig7-v3"/></fig></p><p>Why should there be asynchronous lineage commitment in the developing embryo? During the 16 to 32 cell divisions a number of outside cells are internalized as a result of the cleavage plane orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recent study revealed that daughter cells pushed inwards during mitosis often sort back to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that the timely commitment of majority of TE cells that we observe between the late 16 and early 32 cell stages may be the driving force of this sorting process, allowing generation of a differentiated polarized epithelial layer that would stabilize the inside compartment. Cell divisions do not cause spatial perturbation in the ICM, thus functional commitment to this lineage may not be needed at this stage. Instead, we find that the ICM loses the ability to become TE when the first heterogeneities in gene expression demarcating the start of the second lineage segregation arise. This is in line with an earlier study, which showed that outer cells of isolated ICMs of early blastocysts mostly formed trophoblast outgrowths, while isolated ICMs from later stage blastocysts mostly formed PE-like outgrowths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nichols and Gardner, 1984</xref>). We suggest a possible functional relationship between loss of ICM plasticity and initiation of EPI and PE differentiation programs, which requires further investigation. In conclusion, we propose that asynchronous lineage commitment may be a mechanism contributing to the regulative nature of the preimplantation embryo, ensuring that the correct number of cells is allocated to inside and outside compartments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mouse lines and embryos</title><p>ICR (Crl:CD1(ICR) breeding stock from Charles River, Montreal, Canada), <italic>Cdx2-eGFP</italic> (knock-in fusion to endogenous locus) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_KOMP:VG12984">IMSR_KOMP:VG12984</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole and Zheng, 2012</xref>), <italic>DsRed</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005441">IMSR_JAX:005441</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vintersten et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Tead4 fl/fl</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3763368">MGI:3763368</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Zp3-cre</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003651">IMSR_JAX:003651</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>) mouse lines were used in this study.

Briefly, gene-variability statistic was calculated that adjusted for the mean-variance relationship present in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. This was done by assuming that the expression distribution of a gene follow a negative binomial for which the variance depends on the mean, v = mÂ +Â m<sup>2</sup>/r, where r is the overdispersion, implying that cv<sup>2</sup> = v/m<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 1/mÂ +Â 1/r.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroshi Sasaki (Reviewer #1); Anna-Katerina Hadjantonakis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an important paper, which provides a comprehensive data set clarifying the relationships between global gene expression, lineage specification and commitment, and responsiveness to the Hippo signaling pathway during segregation of TE and ICM fates in preimplantation-stage mouse embryos. The performed experiments are of high quality and the results produced are novel and very important to the field. The provided comprehensive single-cell global transcriptional dataset, which covers the entire lineage segregation period with high temporal resolution, is a valuable resource. The importance of the paper resides not only in revealing the changes in global gene expression profiles during segregation of the cell fates, but also in experimentally linking these to the broader concepts of developmental biology, cell fate specification and commitment, and responsiveness to Hippo signaling, a key cell fate control signal. Although there has been a lot of work over the years to address these questions, this manuscript is the first to combine so many approaches to generate confirmatory data. The previous literature has generally been well incorporated and on the whole suitably attributed. Performing these assays in parallel resolved inconsistencies found in previously published literature. In conclusion, this is an excellent paper providing valuable information to the field. There is a request for inclusion of some additional experiments the reviewers would like to see addressed.</p><p>1) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C, D</xref> are incomplete. First, the number of embryos examined is small. Only two to three embryos were examined at the early 32- to 64-cell stages, and only one embryo was examined for the &gt;64-cell stage. Importantly, the two 64-cell stage embryos showed different responses. It is expected that such variability is present amongst embryos. Therefore, it is important to analyze a larger number of embryos, (e.g., &gt;10 embryos, or at least five embryos per stage), to reach a convincing conclusion. This experiment also lacks appropriate controls: expression of Cdx2 and Sox2+Sox17 in inner cells of the normal embryos, and mCherry-only expressed embryos. Finally, quantitative results should be summarized in a graph with statistical analyses, as shown in other experiments, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22906.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦] 1) The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C, D</xref> are incomplete.

We have also quantified the results and presented them in a graph with statistical analysis. Importantly, our conclusions from these additional data are essentially the same as our previous findings. Generation of inducible DN Lats2 transgenic embryos required the simultaneous integration of two PiggyBAC constructs. This proved to be an inefficient approach when we generated transgenic embryos by microinjecting the pronucleus of zygotes â hence the limited number of embryos analyzed previously. We now discovered that generating transgenic embryos by microinjecting into the cytoplasm at the 2-cell stage was markedly more efficient, allowing us to increase numbers of transgenic embryos.</p></body></sub-article></article>
