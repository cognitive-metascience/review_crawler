Tumor monitoring requires imaging methods to assess treatment effects and disease progression. Until now mapping of the tumor vasculature has been difficult. We have developed a combined magnetic resonance and optical toolkit to study neoangiogenesis in glioma models. We use in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and correlative ultramicroscopy (UM) of ex vivo cleared whole brains to track neovascularization. T2* imaging allows the identification of single vessels in glioma development and the quantification of neovessels over time. Pharmacological VEGF inhibition leads to partial vascular normalization with decreased vessel caliber, density, and permeability. To further resolve the tumor microvasculature, we performed correlated UM of fluorescently labeled microvessels in cleared brains. UM resolved typical features of neoangiogenesis and tumor cell invasion with a spatial resolution of ~5 µm. MR-UM can be used as a platform for three-dimensional mapping and high-resolution quantification of tumor angiogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11712.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11712.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11712.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels are the body’s highways that allow blood to transport oxygen, nutrients, hormones and waste products quickly and efficiently around the body. Tumors are made up of particularly active cells and so their growth heavily depends on blood vessels. Indeed, a fundamental hallmark of tumor progression is for nearby blood vessels to form more quickly. Tumor blood vessels also differ in structure from their normal counterparts for reasons that need to be investigated in more detail.</p><p>Compounds that block the formation of blood vessels have been developed for treating highly malignant brain tumors called gliomas. However, although many of these compounds show promising effects in preclinical trials, clinical trials on humans have been less successful. Having the ability to image the blood vessels in high detail during preclinical trials would help to reveal how treatments that inhibit blood vessel formation work and how tumors might develop resistance to these drugs. However, studying tumor blood vessels remains a challenge due to technical restrictions: techniques that are able to capture how the vessels change over time are unable to show individual cells in much detail, and vice versa.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging is a versatile tool that can monitor how the blood vessel system of a tumor changes over time in living animals. On the other hand, ultramicroscopy is able to determine the structure of single cells of a particular type. By combining these techniques, Breckwoldt, Bode et al. have now developed a imaging platform that allows the formation of tumor blood vessels to be precisely mapped in the setting of a preclinical study. It also enables detailed investigations into how the structure of the blood vessels is altered by treatments that aim to inhibit the formation and growth of new vessels.</p><p>Using this approach on mice with gliomas, Breckwoldt, Bode et al. demonstrated that drugs that inhibit the formation of the blood vessels that supply tumors also cause the blood vessels to take on a more normal structure. Furthermore, treating the mice with a single inhibitory drug was unable to stop tumor growth, mirroring the situation in humans.</p><p>Currently, new inhibitors are being developed, offering the possibility of combined treatments that may be more effective than using a single drug on its own. The imaging platform developed by Breckwoldt, Bode et al. will allow the therapeutic effects obtained by these new treatments to be analyzed in detail during preclinical studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11712.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11712.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>Ultramicroscopy</kwd><kwd>Tissue Clearing</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Faculty, University of Heidelberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Breckwoldt</surname><given-names>Michael O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurz</surname><given-names>Felix T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoffmann</surname><given-names>Angelika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008657</institution-id><institution>CHS Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tews</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name><name><surname>Bode</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Correlated magnetic resonance imaging and ultramicroscopy resolves macro- and microvasculature in glioma models and allows treatment monitoring of antiangiogenic therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gliomas are highly malignant brain tumors with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by high cellular proliferation rates and a rapid induction of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wen and Kesari, 2008</xref>). Angiogenesis is a hallmark of malignant tumors, and most tumors show an exponential ingrowth of neovessels upon a certain tumor size to accommodate their metabolic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). This phenomenon is called 'angiogenic switch' and is characterized by the upregulation of pro-angiogenic molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2) that induce fast tumor angiogenesis. The angiogenic switch is a central feature of malignant tumors and leads to a transition toward a more invasive and aggressive tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bruno et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, many efforts have been made to develop antiangiogenic therapies to 'starve' tumors off their resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2003</xref>). So far, this approach of using anti-VEGF agents like bevacizumab has shown clinical benefit in certain tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>) but, despite significant improvement of progression-free survival, does not prolong overall survival of primary GBM in an unselected patient cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinot et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) inhibition, despite strong preclinical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batchelor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Winkler et al., 2004</xref>), has not been successful in neuro-oncology yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batchelor et al., 2013</xref>). New methods are currently developed to better identify those patients who might benefit from antiangiogenic therapies: Next to molecular approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sandmann et al., 2015</xref>), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could be used for patient stratification. In fact, accumulating data suggest that vascular normalization that occurs early after the initiation of therapy, might be such a marker which could aid clinical decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emblem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu-Emerson et al., 2015</xref>). However, improved imaging techniques that faithfully and non-invasively characterize vessel architecture and antiangiogenic treatment effects are needed to facilitate the understanding of biological actions of these therapies, and the development of clinical trials.</p><p>We employed a MR imaging approach to monitor tumor vessels at single vessel resolution. The technique is based on T2*-weighted (T2*-w) high-resolution Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) venography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park et al., 2008</xref>) with standard gadolinium (Gd) contrast agents at ultrahigh-field strength (9.4 Tesla, isotropic 80 µm resolution). This visualizes substantially more vascular detail compared to conventional T2*-w imaging. We performed pre- and post-contrast MR scans to define angiogenesis during glioma development in two different glioma models. Also, we assess treatment effects of anti-VEGF or radiation therapy on the vascular compartment. We further mapped the tumor vascularization by correlated, dual-color ultramicroscopy (UM) of cleared, unsectioned brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). Fluorescent labeling of the microvasculature using lectins resulted in complementary 3D MR and UM data sets (dubbed 'MR-UM') of the entire tumor 'macro-' and 'microvasculature', which can be compared side-by-side. Thus, MR-UM bridges the gap between MR and optical imaging and may serve as a platform to better understand underlying mechanisms of antiangiogenic treatment and to identify novel druggable targets for preclinical therapy development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell culture and glioma models</title><p>The mouse glioma cell line GL261 was purchased from National Cancer Institute (NCI Tumor Repository, Frederick, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany). The 1x10<sup>5</sup> GL261 cells diluted in 2-µl sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) were stereotactically implanted into the right brain hemisphere of 6- to 8-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice (n=45 mice, Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) using a Hamilton syringe, driven by a fine step motor (coordinates: 2 mm lateral and 2 mm ventral of bregma; injection depth: 3 mm below the dural surface). Animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and unresponsive to stimuli during the intracranial injection; GL261 cells were routinely tested for viral or mycoplasma contamination, and mouse cell identity was confirmed by the multiplex cell contamination test (Multiplexion GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schmitt and Pawlita, 2009</xref>). The human S24 cell line was derived as a primary glioblastoma culture from a resected glioblastoma (after informed consent) and GBM typical genetic changes were confirmed by comparative genomic hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>). For the S24 glioma model, 5x10<sup>4</sup> S24:td-tomato cells (stably transduced by lentivirus) were transplanted orthotopically in 8- to 10-week-old male NMRI nude mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany, n=3 mice). The cells were cultivated under serum-free conditions in DMEM-F12 as sphere cultures (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) supplemented with 2% B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 5 µg/ml human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO), 12.8 ng/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation), 0.4 ng/ml EGF (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and 0.4 ng/ml FGF (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Cell lines were regularly checked for mycoplasma infections and authenticity (species control). Mycoplasma testing was done using the LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All animal experiments were approved by the regional animal welfare committee (permit number: G187/10, G188/12 and G145/10, Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MR imaging</title><p>MR imaging was performed on a 9.4 Tesla horizontal bore small animal NMR scanner (BioSpec 94/20 USR, Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) with a four-channel phased-array surface receiver coil. MR imaging included a standard RARE T2-w and T1-w post-Gd-contrast sequence to monitor tumor volume (T2-w parameters: 2D sequence, 78 µm in plane resolution, TE: 33 ms, TR: 2500 ms, flip angle: 90°, acquisition matrix: 200 x 150, number of averages: 2, slice thickness: 700 µm duration: 2 min 53 s; T1-w parameters: 2D sequence, 100 µm in plane resolution, TE: 6 ms, 1000 TR: ms, flip angle: 90°, acquisition matrix: 256 x 256, number of averages: 2, slice thickness: 500 µm, duration: 5 min). To assess the tumor vasculature, we used a T2*-weighted gradient echo sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park et al., 2008</xref>) and acquired pre- and post-contrast scans (3D sequence, 80 µm isotropic resolution, TE: 18 ms; TR: 50 ms; flip angle: 12°; number of averages: 1, acquisition matrix: 400 x 188 x 100, duration: 15 min 40 s). Pre-contrast images were used to differentiate susceptibility artifacts caused, for example, by tumor microbleedings from vessel signals that were only detectable after contrast administration. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging (TE: 1.8 ms; TR: 16 ms; flip angle: 10°; slice thickness: 700 µm, acquisition matrix: 66 x 128, 3 slices acquired, number of averages: 1, 300 repetitions; 700 µm in plane resolution; duration: 10 min, time resolution 2 s) was used to assess vascular permeability (K<sub>trans</sub>). 0.2 mmol/kg Gadodiamide (Omniscan, Nycomed, Ismaningen, Germany) was administered by tail vein injection for DCE and post-contrast scans. In five animals, 50 µl Gadodiamide was administered by intraperitoneal injection (ip), which had been determined before to match an iv dose of 0.2 mmol/kg. To assess the validity of the T2*-w sequence with an iron-based contrast agent, we performed blood pool imaging pre- and post-iv injections of crossed linked iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO, CLIO-FITC, 15 mg/kg, particle size: 31 nm, kind gift by R. Weissleder, MGH, Boston). MR imaging was started 7 to 14 days post GL261 tumor cell implantation and repeated weekly up to 5 weeks after tumor cell implantation. For MR imaging, animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. Anesthesia was maintained with 1–2% isoflurane. Animals were kept on a heating pad to keep the body temperature constant. Animal respiration was monitored externally during imaging with a breathing surface pad controlled by an in-house developed LabView program (National Instruments Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Vascular permeability imaging</title><p>DCE imaging was post-processed with OLEA software (OLEA Medical, La Ciotat, France).

Two 360° scans were obtained on a small animal CT (Quantum FX, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using the following parameter: 90 kV, 200 µA, 24 mm field of view, 40 µm isotropic resolution. Image reconstruction was performed using a standard filtered backprojection algorithm implemented in the vendor’s software. The maximum brain dimensions were determined in transversal slices and compared before and after clearing. We found that the brain volumes shrinks by ~40% but that the ratio of maximum length/width stays constant before and after clearing (length and width pre clearing: 1.33 ± 0.54 cm x 1.05 ± 0.38 cm; post clearing: 0.79 ± 0.24 cm x 0.62 ± 0.17 cm; ratio: 1.25 ± 0.01 and 1.28 ± 0.03, p&gt;0.05 for ratio comparison).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Image processing and analysis of MR data</title><p>The vascularized area was quantified in Osirix software (V.4.12, Pixmeo, Geneva) by manually selecting region of interests (ROIs) around tubular vessel-like structures on post-contrast T2*-w images.

Injection of isolectin-FITC (12 mg/kg, Sigma) or lectin-texas red from <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (12 mg/kg; Vector laboratories) was performed via the tail vein in 100 µl PBS after MRI. Animals were sacrificed 5 min after lectin injection by a ketamine/xylazine overdose and transcardially perfused with 5 ml PBS followed by 10 ml 4% paraformaldehyde (Histofix, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe). For the assessment of BBB-D, animals (n=2) were iv injected with 150 µl of 2% Evans blue (EB, Sigma) diluted in PBS. Animals were sacrificed 10 min after EB injection and cleared using the FluoClearBABB protocol (see below).

For UM-analysis, whole brains were optically cleared using organic solvents. Clearing was performed according to the 3DISCO protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ertürk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012</xref>). Brains were transferred into glass vials for tetrahydrofuran (THF; Sigma Aldrich) dehydration. Two milliliter of 50 % THF were gently added using a pipette. Vials were placed into black 50-ml Falcon tubes and then mounted onto an overhead turning wheel (program C3, 15 rpm, Neolab, intelli-mixer). Clearing was performed at room temperature. After 12 hr, the 50 % THF solution was exchanged by a 70 % THF solution. Vials were again put into black Falcon tubes and mounted onto the turning wheel for another 12 hr. The procedure was repeated with 80% and 100% THF solutions, respectively. Samples were incubated for 12 hr in 100 % THF for three times. The dehydrated brains were placed in benzyl ether for 48 hr in order to clear the samples (98 % dibenzyl ether, DBE, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). To avoid degradation of the fluorescent signal, samples were kept in the dark and imaged immediately after the clearing procedure. S24 tumor-bearing brains were cleared with the recently published protocol FluoClearBABB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). This protocol is based on benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate clearing in combination with a basic pH, which is maintained throughout the clearing procedure. The protocol is especially suited for effective clearing of aged mouse brains. Mice were perfused with lectin-FITC as described. After dissection, brains were kept in PBS at 4°C. For the dehydration of brains, analytical grade alcohol (t-butanol, Sigma) was diluted with double-distilled water. Brains were dehydrated using t-butanols ranging from 30 to 100 %. The clearing solution BABB was prepared by mixing benzyl alcohol (Merck, analytical grade) and benzyl benzoate (Sigma, 'purissimum p.A.' grade) in a 1: 2 volume ratio. The pH levels of dehydration and clearing solutions were adjusted using an InLab Science electrode suited for organic solvents (Mettler-Toledo). pH levels were adjusted with triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Acquisition of ultramicroscopy data sets</title><p>The cleared brains were scanned with a light sheet microscope (LaVision BioTec GmbH, Bielefeld, Germany).

For the detection of blood vessels, the following filters were used: lectin-FITC, excitation 470 / 40 nm; emission 525 / 50 nm; lectin-texas red excitation 545 / 25; emission 585 / 40.</p><p>Z-stacks with 5 µm step size and a total range of up to 1500 to 2000 µm for the transversal measurement of the whole brain were acquired.

Vessels were identified with the FIJI plugin 'tubeness' that finds linear structures in an image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sato et al., 1998</xref>). The resulting images were binarized individually to ensure maximal congruence with the respective vessels on the original image slice. For each binarized ROI, vessel objects were identified and skeletonized using Matlabs built-in functions 'bwmorph' and 'regionprops'. After subtracting vessel branch points of the skeletonized image, the length of each vessel segment was determined. To obtain the vessel diameter and to avoid very small vessel cross-sections with minimal length, only those segments were considered whose lengths were longer than the difference of mean and standard error of the segment length distribution.

Tumors could be clearly visualized by Gd-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Tumors grew rapidly and untreated mice got symptomatic and were sacrificed 4–5 weeks post implantation when they had developed large intracranial tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To monitor vascularization both in the healthy brain and under pathological conditions, we employed a gradient echo, T2*-w sequence with high spatial resolution (80 µm isotropic resolution). This sequence allows the visualization of venules due to the BOLD effect of deoxygenized blood and the resulting susceptibility signals before contrast administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). After administration of a clinically applied Gd-contrast agent, arterioles and venules show strong tubular vascular susceptibility signals that allow the assessment of the vascularization status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Also, an iron-based experimental contrast agent (ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticle, USPIO) resulted in a good delineation of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Contrast-enhanced T2*-w imaging allowed the visualization of neovessels in the 50–100 µm range. In the GL261 model, angiogenesis started 2 weeks post-tumor implantation and massively increased until week 3. One limitation of MRI concerns its resolution, which was limited to ~80 µm in our study. To overcome this limitation, we employed correlated 3D UM of cleared specimen. For UM, we applied iv perfusion with fluorescent lectins that bind specifically to endothelial glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wälchli et al., 2015</xref>) and subsequent optical clearing of whole adult mouse brains using the well-established 3DISCO and the recently published FluoClearBABB protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). We obtained high-quality images with both clearing methods that were used to reconstruct the entire tumor anatomy and blood vessel architecture including bulk mass and invasive zone. Tissue clearing and UM has not been employed for the study of neurooncological disease. Previous UM studies investigated microvessels under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jährling et al., 2009</xref>) and in the context of solid visceral tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobosz et al., 2014</xref>). We have extended this work to the field of neurooncology and combined it with advanced MRI techniques. This bridges the gap between MRI and whole brain optical microscopy, which represent separated domains so far. Optical clearing methods have recently undergone a rapid development and evoked large interest in the neuroscience community as they promise to allow 'connectomic' and circuit reconstruction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dodt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ertürk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keller and Dodt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>). Clearing techniques are, however, also amenable to the study of pathological states: First reports have highlighted how 3D information obtained by tissue clearing can give new insights into pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jährling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spence et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The combination with MR, the most widely used clinical imaging technique, offers added value by correlating spatiotemporal information obtained by MR with high-resolution optical imaging. In the preclinical arena MR and UM with tissue clearing appear as natural partners as both produce 3D datasets, which can be compared side-by-side. The advantages of both techniques can be combined: Namely, MR is a versatile tool for longitudinal in vivo studies. UM of cleared specimen can resolve cellular and subcellular processes and utilize the vast toolbox of genetic and chemical fluorescent labels with their high molecular specificity, thus complementing the information gained by MRI. Also, a combination of the two techniques allows cross-correlation of in vivo signals with molecularly defined optical methods. To show the additive power of both methods, we used a neovascularization paradigm since neovessels are hallmarks of many diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goveia et al., 2014</xref>). Using cross-correlated MR-UM we achieved single vessel resolution and found pathological vessel permeability, tortuosity, and calibers, all of which could be partially reversed by VEGF treatment.</p><p>Our data indicate that similar to the human situation, mono-modality antiangiogenic treatment is not sufficient to halt glioma growth. Thus, novel antiangiogenic treatment regimes, possibly in combination with chemotherapy in recurrent disease (as done with promising results in the Dutch Belob Trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Taal et al., 2014</xref>), and the ongoing EORTC 26,101 and 26,091 trials), or in combination with additional treatment modalities (i.e.immunotherapy, chemotherapy) are warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kamoun et al., 2009</xref>). Anti-angiogenic treatment development and clinical trials require imaging biomarkers to assess vascularization status and treatment effects. The developed T2*-w sequence is suitable to map tumor arterioles and venules in a preclinical setting. Future studies at high-field clinical MR systems should address a possible translation of our MRI approach to the clinical arena.</p><p>One limitation of our study relates to the differentiation of the various hierarchical parts of the vascular system. Tumors harbor a manifold of different vascular compartments (veins and arteries of different calibers and sizes with highly variable, but mostly pathological perfusion). Neither MR nor optical methods are able to capture the entire complexity of these compartments. Also, we found that in the bulk tumor some CD31 positive vessels were negative for lectin-FITC, indicating that some tumor vessels were hypo- or non-perfused. This implies that the visualization and quantification of the microvasculature by lectin-injection might slightly underestimate the vascular tumor compartment. The fact that hypo- or non-perfused vessels with abnormal flow exist in tumors is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>). Another drawback might be that clearing methods may lead to an alteration in brain size, that is, due to dehydration. For 3DISCO, we quantified the apparent reduction of brain volume using CT imaging before and after clearing. This revealed a volume reduction of ~40%, which however occurred in a uniform fashion and did not change macroscopic tissue proportions. Anatomical structures and substructures of the brain remained fully intact. Vessel diameters obtained by UM could therefore be corrected by a multiplication factor of ~1.6. However, microscopic shrinkage may slightly differ from the macroscopic factor obtained by CT.</p><p>Also, when using endogenous fluorescent proteins such as GFP or RFP in combination with exogenous fluorescent markers such as FITC, preservation of fluorescent signals during the clearing process might vary and should be carefully controlled for.</p><p>In summary, the present study shows the additive power of correlative MR and UM for assessing the vascular system and the dynamic changes that occur in tumors over time. The applied principles should be easily transferable to additional targets like the immune cell compartment that are amenable to MR and optical labeling strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kircher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weissleder et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, MR-UM should be useful for translational approaches to aid preclinical therapy development. In our study, mono-antiangiogenic treatment with a murine VEGF inhibitor was insufficient to halt tumor growth which mirrors current human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinot et al., 2014</xref>). Dual angiogenesis inhibitors are currently being developed and therapeutic effects could be assessed in detail using our toolkit. Thus, we believe that MR-UM can provide a versatile platform for translational research approaches to cross-correlate MR and optical signals.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the kind gift of the murine VEGF inhibitor (Roche, pRED Innovation Center, Penzberg) and of USPIOs (Ralph Weissleder, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pascal Sati and Hans-Ulrich Dodt (peer reviewers). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Breckwoldt et al. investigate angiogenesis in a mouse glioma model. They clearly show that the combination of MRI and ultramicroscopy can provide both longtime observation and high resolution of the tumor as well as the effect of VEGF treatment and photon irradiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Methodology: a major concern is the use of dye injection to assess tumor vascularization. The use of contrast agents is of course justifiable for MR, but to correlate in vivo data with ex vivo structural quantifications, authors should rule out the possible involvement of perfusion in the diffusion of the injected dyes. For a thorough anatomical correlation in the same samples, authors should use well-characterized protocols of whole-mount immunohistochemistry (IHC) using specific vascular markers (e.g. CD31, such as used by iDISCO), which would ascertain that the whole vasculature is visualized. The use of IHC would also allow better staining of smaller capillary beds in which perfusion might have been affected by the presence of the tumor. One option would be to validate, in a subset of samples, the structural data with anti-CD31 IHC. Finally, vascular permeability should be assessed/validated using tracers and conventional methods (e.g., conjugated dextrans, Evans blue) such that, as for tumor angiogenesis and vascular morphology, authors could correlate in vivo and ex vivo data.</p><p>2) Interpretations: In the manuscript, one can read terms such as &quot;high-resolution quantification&quot;, &quot;single vessel resolution&quot;, &quot;ultramicroscopy&quot;, or &quot;visualization of venules&quot;. However, according to MR data, such resolution is not reached. Larger vessels can indeed be observed at the brain surface under MR, but the resolution is pretty poor (e.g., magnifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Moreover, from panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, one can ask whether the strong signals are due to presence of vessels or to tracer leakage. In addition, it is dangerous to talk about &quot;neovessels&quot; and &quot;massive angiogenesis&quot; from MR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Knowing that this MR intrinsically lacks resolution, the reader is hardly convinced that these signals are actually blood vessels. The fact MR relies on perfusion, it seems difficult to decipher between newly formed vessels or increased perfusion in the tumor area. It is only from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, in correlative experiments with cleared brains, that the reader starts to observe increased vascularization in tumor. Moreover, strong terms such as &quot;increased caliber and tortuousness&quot; are used to describe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> but none of these features appear in the panels. Finally, it is puzzling why authors chose to analyze &quot;single image planes&quot; from light sheet microscopy in order to quantify vascular morphology. The power of this imaging technique should be leveraged to perform 3D analysis and obtain more detailed measures within tissue volumes (effects would probably reach significance if analyzed in 3D).</p><p>3) Translational aspect: Anti-angiogenic therapy to target tumor growth is a classic approach and there is a need to develop better tools to investigate tumor vascularization. However, since apparently the anti-VEGF treatment did not reduce tumor size (as claimed in the text, but unfortunately not illustrated), the rationale for this translational approach is unclear. The authors also mention: &quot;Despite the efficient blockade of neoangiogenesis, anti-VEGF therapy did not lead to reduced tumor growth (…), reflecting current clinical data&quot;. This is very vague and one can wonder where these data come from (Method? Number of animals? Graphs? Ref?). Maybe authors can offer an interpretation of why it is failed using their vessel imaging data?</p><p>4) An additional technical detail we would mention is that the problem of fluorescence preservation is only severe for endogenous fluorescent proteins like GFP, not really for exogenous fluorescent markers that are much more stable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11712.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) Methodology: a major concern is the use of dye injection to assess tumor vascularization.

This resulted in a perfect co-localization of both stainings outside of the tumor mass. In the tumor, however, there were a number of vessels that stained only positive for CD31 but had no apparent lectin staining, indicating non-perfused vessels that were not reached by the lectin injection. We calculated that 49.3% of vessels were double positive for lectin and CD31 within the tumor (179/363 tumor vessels, n=3 mice). 50.7% were only positive for CD31 but not for lectin. The fact that hypo- or non-perfused vessels with abnormal flow exist in tumors is well established (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011). Our utilized method using injected lectins assesses perfused blood vessels and does not account for all tumor vessels. We have added this information to the Results and Discussion and include immunohistochemistry data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement c.</p><p><italic>Finally, vascular permeability should be assessed/validated using tracers and conventional methods (e.g., conjugated dextrans, Evans blue) such that, as for tumor angiogenesis and vascular morphology, authors could correlate in vivo and ex vivo data.</italic> </p><p>We have performed correlated in vivo and ex vivo imaging to assess permeability using Gd and Evans blue (EB) (n=2 mice). We find a good agreement of both tracers that show the increased permeability in the tumor area (correlation coefficient: 0.87, p&lt;0.001). Example images are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2a-c</xref>. One concern would be certainly if there was major leakage of lectin into the extracellular space due to blood-brain-barrier disruption (BBB-D). This however, we don’t see in our model, probably because lectins are much bigger than either gadodiamide or EB and do not passively cross the compromised BBB.</p><p> <italic>2) Interpretations: In the manuscript, one can read terms such as &quot;high-resolution quantification&quot;, &quot;single vessel resolution&quot;, &quot;ultramicroscopy&quot;, or &quot;visualization of venules&quot;. However, according to MR data, such resolution is not reached. Larger vessels can indeed be observed at the brain surface under MR, but the resolution is pretty poor (e.g., magnifications in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Moreover, from panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, one can ask whether the strong signals are due to presence of vessels or to tracer leakage. In addition, it is dangerous to talk about &quot;neovessels&quot; and &quot;massive angiogenesis&quot; from MR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Knowing that this MR intrinsically lacks resolution, the reader is hardly convinced that these signals are actually blood vessels. The fact MR relies on perfusion, it seems difficult to decipher between newly formed vessels or increased perfusion in the tumor area. It is only from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, in correlative experiments with cleared brains, that the reader starts to observe increased vascularization in tumor. Moreover, strong terms such as &quot;increased caliber and tortuousness&quot; are used to describe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref> but none of these features appear in the panels.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that MRI has intrinsic limitations in terms of resolution (like any other imaging technique). The judgment to call the hypointense structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-d</xref> vessels is based on the fact that most of these hypointense structures are only seen after intravenous contrast administration. We now provide subtraction images of pre and post T2* scans of tumor animals to show the vessel outline that occurs after contrast administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1a</xref>). The concept of blood pool imaging by MR contrast agents is not new (Dosa et al., 2011) but has not been widely exploited in the context of tumor vasculature imaging. We agree with the reviewer that MR images need to be interpreted with caution as susceptibility signals are not specific to the vasculature but can be also caused e.g. by bleeding or calcification. Therefore, careful controls and pre- and post-contrast imaging are necessary for interpretation. In our opinion, however, the term “neovessels” and “increased vascularity” seems justified also based on MRI. Our careful longitudinal study allows us to denominate newly appearing hypointensities as neovessels because such structures only appear after contrast administration and can be blocked by VEGF inhibition (longitudinal imaging of one animal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1b</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11712.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>MR-UM of tumor vascularization. a) T2* subtraction images of an animal two and three weeks after Gl261 tumor implantation. b) Occurrence of vessel-like T2* signals over time. c) Tumor size before (week two) and after VEGF or isotype control treatment (week three).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11712.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11712.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11712-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The term “neoangiogenesis” is mostly referring to the microvasculature (5-10 µm vessels) which we cannot visualize directly by MRI. The vascular signals on MRI most likely represent dilated tumor arterioles and venules that are a result of neoangiogenesis but are not strictly neoangiogenesis itself. We have therefore eliminated the term “neoangiogenesis” from the MRI result section. Permeability and leakage of contrast material into the tissue is certainly a concern. We believe, however, that the linear, vascular-like patterns of the post contrast images (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) show the tumor blood pool and not mere leakage (as this should result in a uniform signal decrease within the entire tumor). Nevertheless, we have taken care to not “over-interpret” our MR data and have eliminated interpretations from the Result section. We now refer to vascular patterns mostly in the ultramicroscopy section and the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Finally, it is puzzling why authors chose to analyze &quot;single image planes&quot; from light sheet microscopy in order to quantify vascular morphology. The power of this imaging technique should be leveraged to perform 3D analysis and obtain more detailed measures within tissue volumes (effects would probably reach significance if analyzed in 3D).</italic> </p><p>We now perform 3D analysis of entire ultramicroscopy data stacks (100-200 single planes) using Amira software. The vasculature is segmented in 3D and vessel radii and pathlength are quantified. Both parameters show highly significant differences between tumor and healthy brain. This data is now included in the extended <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e-h</xref> and described in the methods and Results section.</p><p> <italic>3) Translational aspect: Anti-angiogenic therapy to target tumor growth is a classic approach and there is a need to develop better tools to investigate tumor vascularization. However, since apparently the anti-VEGF treatment did not reduce tumor size (as claimed in the text, but unfortunately not illustrated), the rationale for this translational approach is unclear. The authors also mention: &quot;Despite the efficient blockade of neoangiogenesis, anti-VEGF therapy did not lead to reduced tumor growth (</italic>…<italic>), reflecting current clinical data&quot;. This is very vague and one can wonder where these data come from (Method? Number of animals? Graphs? Ref?). Maybe authors can offer an interpretation of why it is failed using their vessel imaging data?</italic> </p><p>As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> we performed VEGF or isotype control treatment, monitored by MRI (4 mice per group, i.p. treatment with 10 mg/kg VEGF inhibitor or IgG control, every three days). The tumor size increased significantly after one week of treatment (p=0.02) and was not significantly reduced by VEGF treatment compared to the isotype control group (mean tumor size before treatment: 0.076 cm2; after VEGF inhibitor treatment: 0.22 cm2; after isotype treatment: 0.22 cm2; p=n.s., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1c</xref>). Along these lines two recent clinical trials did <italic>not show</italic> an increased overall survival for bevacizumab treatment compared to standard radio-chemotherapy treatment for primary or recurrent glioblastoma (Chinot et al., 2014; Taal et al., 2014). This information is now included in the Results section. There has been speculation that inhibition of angiogenesis and vascular normalization leads to an activation of tumor stem cells with potential deleterious effects (Lathia et al., 2015). Also our ultramicroscopy data showed only partial vascular normalization and VEGF inhibition did not completely prevent vessel caliber increases and the formation of pathological vessels. This might explain the persistent tumor growth, which was not halted by VEGF inhibition.</p><p> <italic>4) An additional technical detail we would mention is that the problem of fluorescence preservation is only severe for endogenous fluorescent proteins like GFP, not really for exogenous fluorescent markers that are much more stable.</italic></p><p>In this manuscript we use td-tomato as fluorescent protein and FITC/Texas-red as fluorescent dyes and both are preserved by our clearing protocols. However we have added the following cautionary note to the Discussion: “When using endogenous fluorescent proteins such as GFP or RFP in combination with exogenous fluorescent markers such as FITC, preservation of fluorescent signals might vary during clearing and should be carefully controlled for.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
