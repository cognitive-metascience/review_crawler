In budding yeast, various aging factors segregate to the aging (mother)-lineage, with poorly understood consequences. In this study, we show that yeast mother cells form a protein aggregate during early replicative aging that is maintained as a single, asymmetrically inherited deposit over the remaining lifespan. Surprisingly, deposit formation was not associated with stress or general decline in proteostasis. Rather, the deposit-containing cells displayed enhanced degradation of cytosolic proteasome substrates and unimpaired clearance of stress-induced protein aggregates. Deposit formation was dependent on Hsp42, which collected non-random client proteins of the Hsp104/Hsp70-refolding machinery, including the prion Sup35. Importantly, loss of Hsp42 resulted in symmetric inheritance of its constituents and prolonged the lifespan of the mother cell. Together, these data suggest that protein aggregation is an early aging-associated differentiation event in yeast, having a two-faceted role in organismal fitness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06197.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06197.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06197.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging is a complex process. Studies involving a single-celled organism called budding yeast are commonly used to investigate the factors that contribute to aging. When these yeast cells divide, a small daughter cell buds out from a large mother cell. A mother cell has a limited lifespan and produces a finite number of daughter cells and then dies (a phenomenon referred to ‘replicative aging’). However, when a daughter cell forms, the daughter's age is reset to zero, giving it the full potential to produce new offspring.</p><p>Previous research on budding yeast has shown that damaged or aggregated proteins accumulate in the mother cells but not the daughter cells, and that this accumulation of proteins contributes to shortening the lifespan of the mother cell. Furthermore, protein aggregation has also been associated with a number of age-related diseases in humans, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, it remains unclear how cells respond to protein aggregation that occurs during aging.</p><p>Many studies that have previously investigated this question have relied on exposing cells to stressful conditions, such as high temperatures, in order to trigger proteins to aggregate. But now, Saarikangas and Barral have studied how proteins aggregate under normal, unstressed conditions in budding yeast as they age. The experiments revealed that most unstressed yeast cells develop a single deposit of aggregated proteins already during early aging. This age-associated structure proved to be a different type of response than the protein aggregation that occurs during stress.</p><p>Furthermore, the deposit did not form as a consequence of the cell having obvious problems with folding its proteins, nor did the deposit hinder cells from coping with stressful conditions that trigger protein misfolding. Rather, this deposit supported the ability of the cell to degrade defective proteins. This suggests that the deposit represents an early adaptive response to aging, which might consequently provide aged cells some advantage over their younger counterparts.</p><p>Saarikangas and Barral also found that this protein deposit was always retained in the mother cell and not passed onto the daughters at cell division. Further experiments showed that an enzyme called heat shock protein 42 was responsible for collecting target proteins and bring them together to form the single deposit. Reducing the levels of this enzyme prevented the deposit from forming and extended the lifespan of the mother cells. Thus, these findings suggest that mother cells collect harmful protein aggregates into a single deposit and prevent them from entering the daughter cells. Further work is needed to understand how the deposit is preferentially retained within the mother cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06197.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06197.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fate determination</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FEBS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saarikangas</surname><given-names>Juha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003125</institution-id><institution>Suomen Kulttuurirahasto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post Doc Pool</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saarikangas</surname><given-names>Juha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BarrAge 250278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saarikangas</surname><given-names>Juha</given-names></name><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saarikangas</surname><given-names>Juha</given-names></name><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The aging lineage of budding yeast is differentiated by an early-appearing protein deposit that promotes protein quality control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging results in an increasing decline of the organism's fitness over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopez-Otin et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, this process segregates asymmetrically during budding yeast division: the mother cell forms an aging lineage, whereas the daughters generated by these mothers rejuvenate to form eternal lineages, similar to the segregation of soma and germ lineages in metazoans.

Studies on budding yeast have shown a correlation between the accumulation of protein aggregates and replicative aging by demonstrating that Hsp104-mediated protein disaggregation is required for full replicative life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>), and that over-expression of Mca1, which counteracts the formation of stress- and age-associated protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), extends the life span of yeast mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>How cells respond to protein aggregation that occurs specifically during aging has remained elusive since most studies investigating the cellular responses to protein aggregation have relied on over-expression of non-native, aggregation prone proteins, proteostasis inhibitors, or other stressors, such as heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malinovska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have uncovered specific modes of cytosolic compartmentalization that take place when cells encounter proteotoxic stress. For example, cells stressed with heat respond by forming multiple protein aggregates (referred to as peripheral aggregates, stress foci, Q-bodies, or CytoQ) at the surface of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>).

Simultaneously, Q-bodies are being rapidly resolved by the protein disaggregase Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parsell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>), together with other heat shock responsive chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp82 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). The formation of Q-bodies seems to aid stress survival, as the deletion of <italic>HSP42</italic> resulted in defective tolerance of prolonged heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). The asymmetric inheritance of Q-bodies by the mother cells is promoted by the geometry of the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), tethering to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), and by actin cable-mediated retrograde transport, which is dependent of Hsp104 and Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, Sir2 is also a key player in processes that underlie the asymmetric segregation of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Higuchi et al., 2013</xref>) and the accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>) to the aging mother cell.</p><p>Prolonged Q-body-inducing stress (heat or over-expression of thermolabile proteins) combined with proteasome inhibition can lead to the formation of a dynamically exchanging deposit of ubiquitylated proteins named the juxtanuclear quality compartment, JUNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). This structure is regulated by the Upb3 deubiqutinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oling et al., 2014</xref>), by proteosomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>) and by lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moldavski et al., 2015</xref>), and it was also shown to appear during replicative aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oling et al., 2014</xref>). The faithful inheritance of this structure by the mother cell is dependent on its association with the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spokoini et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, it was shown that the ‘JUNQ’ might actually reside inside the nucleus, and it was thus renamed as intranuclear quality control compartment, INQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). The JUNQ/INQ assembly is dependent on Btn2-aggregase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>), a protein also found to be involved in prion curing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kryndushkin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>). Apart from the JUNQ/INQ structure, terminally aggregating proteins, such as the amyloidogenic prions Rnq1 and Ure2, were shown to partition to an non-dynamic, vacuole-associated deposit called the insoluble protein deposit IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tyedmers et al., 2010b</xref>), which has remained less well characterized.</p><p>Despite this wealth of data, it remains unclear how these exogenous/stress-induced aggregation models relate to protein aggregation that takes place during physiological ‘healthy’ aging. Particularly, it is unclear why/how protein aggregates arise during aging, how are they segregated during cell division and, importantly, what is their consequence to the protein quality control of the aging cell, as well as to the aging process itself. To illuminate these aspects, we probed the role of protein aggregation during unperturbed replicative aging. Our findings indicate that protein aggregation is a prevalent and highly coordinated event of early aging and is not solely associated with proteostasis deterioration. Instead, we provide evidence that age-associated protein aggregation may initially benefit the cytosolic protein quality control, but eventually becomes involved with age-associated loss of fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of a protein deposit during early replicative aging</title><p>To address the role of protein aggregation in unperturbed, physiological aging, we analyzed microscopically the replicative age-associated protein aggregation landscape in budding yeast by visualizing different chaperone proteins that mark aberrantly folded and aggregated proteins.

This showed that most mother cells started to form this aggregate already after budding three to four times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, 390 min). The fastest growth phase of the aggregate took place during the first half an hour following its detection, after which the Hsp104 signal intensity increased only marginally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). While the aggregates initially underwent occasional dissolution, they became stable within a few hours from nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Pedigree analysis of aggregate inheritance in cells of different age showed that they faithfully segregated to the aging mother cell (98% of divisions), irrespective of its age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). To further analyze the persistence and behavior of the deposits over the entire replicative life span of cells, we used a microscope-coupled microfluidic dissection platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This showed that the aggregate was efficiently maintained as one compartment, and whenever new foci emerged, they typically merged soon after with the pre-existing deposit. We quantified the number of Hsp104 foci (1 or &gt;1) and its post-nucleation stability in cells that were tracked for at least 10 divisions after the aggregate had appeared. These cells preferentially (&gt;80% of time) displayed only a single Hsp104 focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>), which was very stable, typically persisting until the last divisions of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,I</xref>). Moreover, this structure was largely non-dynamic, displaying limited exchange of Hsp104 with the cytoplasm, as determined by fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis in diploid cells that expressed one GFP- and one mCherry-tagged copy of <italic>HSP104</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We bleached and measured the recovery of the mCherry signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) and by fitting nine recovery curves, found that on average a large fraction (59%) of Hsp104 was immobile, while the mobile fraction displayed a half-time recovery rate of 8.9 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Together, these data show that a large majority of unstressed yeast cells develop a protein deposit early during replicative aging. This deposit displays limited exchange with the cytoplasm (assessed by Hsp104), is efficiently maintained as a single compartment, and is faithfully inherited by the aging mother cell.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06197-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06197.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Age-associated protein deposit is a stable structure that is faithfully inherited by the aging mother cell lineage.</title><p>Aged yeast cell expressing Hsp104-mCherry (in green) to mark protein aggregates and Cdc10-GFP (in red) to mark the mother bud interface undergoing four consecutive divisions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06197.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06197.006</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The physiological constituents of the age-associated protein deposit include prion protein Sup35</title><p>To better understand how the age-associated protein deposit forms and what are its physiological constituents, we selected two proteins containing glutamine- and/or asparagine-rich domains, Sup35 and Dcp2, which are known to undergo conformational switches and to aggregate, and we monitored their localization in respect to the age-associated protein deposit. Sup35 (eRF3) is a translation termination factor that can undergo stable amyloid-like prion conversion from non-prion [<italic>psi–</italic>] to prion state [<italic>PSI+</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chernoff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wickner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paushkin et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, we tested whether Sup35-GFP is targeted to the age-dependent aggregate and if the prion status plays a role in the targeting to and/or in the formation of the age-associated protein deposit. Importantly, Sup35-GFP clearly accumulated into Hsp104-mCherry-labeled age-associated protein deposit in 33% of [<italic>PSI+</italic>] cells that contained such a deposit, whereas no accumulation was detected in the non-prion [<italic>psi</italic>−] cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). As expected, the formation of this bright Sup35 focus was age-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in line with earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derdowski et al., 2010</xref>), but interestingly the [<italic>PSI+</italic>] state did not have an overall effect on Hsp104-labeled deposit formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, the elimination of the [<italic>RNQ+</italic>] prion by deleting <italic>RNQ1</italic> did not negatively influence the formation of the age-associated deposit (data not shown). Notably, time-lapse imaging showed that Sup35 was recruited into the pre-existing age-associated protein deposit (marked by Hsp104-mCherry). These Sup35-enriched age-associated protein deposits segregated asymmetrically towards the aging mother cell in 98% of mitoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). These data provide evidence that the Hsp104-labeled focus is a <italic>bona fide</italic> deposit site for aggregating proteins, and that prion conversion of Sup35 promotes its gradual storage into the age-associated protein deposit, but does not potentiate its formation per se.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06197.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prion form of Sup35 is deposited to the age-associated protein deposit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Co-localization of Sup35-GFP and Hsp104-mCherry in diploid <italic>[psi−]</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>[PSI+]</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) cells, where a single locus of the respective gene was tagged with the fluorescent marker indicated.

We first looked at the behavior of Q-bodies, which assemble in response to heat-stress. In stark contrast to the age-associated aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,I</xref>), Q-bodies induced upon heat stress (42°C, 30 min) were transient and readily solubilized after the removal of the stress factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wallace et al., 2015</xref>).

To this end, we induced the GAL-promoter-driven expression of the JUNQ/INQ marker, the unstable proteasome substrate human von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>), and monitored the accumulation of Hsp104-mCherry into the newly forming VHL-foci. VHL typically formed a single focus, which in 87% of the cases did not accumulate Hsp104-mCherry within 30 min after its appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, N = 29). However, the VHL expression was often associated with overall increased Hsp104-mCherry expression over time, suggesting that its expression activates a stress response. Hence, we visualized the JUNQ/INQ without over-expression of exogenous substrates. To accomplish this, we used an Hsp82-GFP, Hsp104-mCherry expressing strain deleted of the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene, leading to increased burden of proteasomal substrates, due to decreased amount of functional proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>). Indeed, many of <italic>rpn4</italic>Δ cells displayed numerous Hsp82-Hsp104 double-positive Q-body-like puncta (data not shown). In addition, we found cells that displayed two puncta: a Hsp104-Hsp42 double-positive JUNQ-like deposit, and a Hsp104-positive, Hsp82-negative deposit that fills the criteria of the age-associated deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To consolidate this further, we investigated the co-localization of the endogenous JUNQ/INQ marker Btn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>) together with the age-associated protein deposit (Hsp104). This analysis showed that in 98.6% of the cases, Btn2 did not localize to the age-associated Hsp104-foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, from all thirty identified cells displaying endogenous Btn2 foci, we found only one case in which Hsp104 was enriched at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, N = 1268 cells). Together, these data suggest that the age-associated protein deposit and the JUNQ/INQ are discrete structures that may exist in parallel.</p><p>Finally, we monitored the resemblance between the age-associated protein deposit and IPOD. To visualize cells during IPOD appearance, we imaged Hsp104-mCherry-expressing cells together with the canonical IPOD marker, the galactose-inducible Rnq1-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>), immediately after placing cells to galactose-containing media. This showed that the IPOD typically appeared as a single focus to which Hsp104 rapidly accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>) (&gt;98% of Rnq1-foci displayed accumulation of Hsp104 within 30 min after their appearance, N = 53). However, by dissecting the Rnq1-GFP appearance dynamics in cell with a pre-existing age-associated protein deposit (marked by Hsp104-mCherry), we found that the aggregating Rnq1-GFP did not accumulate to the age-associated deposit (see white arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), but rather it formed a new aggregate to which Hsp104 then strongly accumulated, while its intensity at the age-associated protein deposit declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To rule out possible artifacts induced by Rnq1-GFP over-expression, we also looked at the co-localization between the age-associated protein deposit and GFP-tagged endogenous Rnq1 in its prion [<italic>RNQ+</italic>]-state. We analyzed altogether 117 Hsp104 foci-containing [<italic>PIN+, PSI+</italic>] cells and found that in 98.3% of the cases, Rnq1-GFP did not accumulate to this deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Within this cohort, we found two cells with an Rnq1-GFP-aggregate, which was in both cases enriched with Hsp104-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). However, both of the Rnq1-aggregate containing cells also displayed an additional Hsp104 focus to which Rnq1 had not accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Together with the results from the Rnq1 over-expression, these data suggest that Rnq1 aggregate is likely to represent a structure that is different from the majority of the age-associated protein deposits.</p><p>In sum, these data point out marked differences between the age-dependent protein deposit and the previously characterized Q-bodies, IPOD, and the JUNQ/INQ that could derive from context dependent (stress vs aging) differences in cellular responses to protein aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Age-associated protein deposits do not compromise the clearance of stress-induced protein aggregates</title><p>Appearance of protein aggregates has commonly been associated with defects in protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tyedmers et al., 2010a</xref>).

These results indicate that mild exposure to proteotoxic stress conditions counteract the formation of age-associated protein deposits and demonstrate that cells with an age-associated deposit prior to encountering the stress predominantly reverted back to this state. Altogether, these data indicate that despite forming a protein deposit, aged cells are still fit to coping with acute proteotoxic stress and suggest that the formation of the age-dependent protein deposit is not due to the overload of the general quality control machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Age-associated protein deposit-containing cells display enhanced degradation of cytosolic ubiquitin–proteasome system substrate</title><p>The notion that aged cells with a protein deposit handled proteotoxic stress comparably to their young counterparts prompted us to test the effect of the age-associated deposit on the function of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), which has an important role in yeast replicative aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33a">Kruegel et al., 2011</xref>). Pathological polyQ protein fragments have been shown to impair the UPS function both in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2013</xref>), and UPS substrates have been shown to accumulate in aged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>).

We therefore wanted to analyze the contribution of the age-associated deposit on the functionality of the UPS. In order to selectively measure the effect of the age-associated protein deposit on UPS function, we made use of the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>), which enabled us to measure the degradation rate of cytosolic (AID-GFP) and nuclear (AID-GFP-NLS) UPS substrates in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Cells co-expressing Hsp104-mCherry and AID-GFP were switched to auxin-containing media at the onset of imaging, and the GFP intensities were measured over time from neighboring cells containing or not an Hsp104-puncta. The normalized values were pooled and fitted with a non-linear one-phase decay function. Importantly, this showed that the decay rate of AID-GFP was significantly accelerated in cells with an age-associated deposit when compared to neighboring cells that did not contain an Hsp104-focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>) (rate constant (K): 0.155 ± 0.007 (with) vs 0.129 ± 0.006 (without), p &lt; 0.01, N = 91 cells/category).

Molecular chaperones generally recognize, refold, or sort aberrantly folded proteins, making them prime candidates to regulate the age-associated protein deposit assembly. Thus, we addressed the contribution of chaperones localizing to the age-associated protein deposit to its formation. Time-lapse microscopy showed that in 24 out of 25 cells, Hsp42 was at the age-associated protein deposit before Hsp104 and was the first protein we find to mark this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Ssa1 and Hsp104 were recruited subsequently, appearing concurrently up to 120 min after appearance of the Hsp42-focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and data not shown). To identify the role of these chaperones in the assembly of the age-associated protein deposit, we investigated the consequences of their deletion. Interestingly, loss of the Hsp70 proteins Ssa1 and Ssa2, which act synergistically with the disaggregase Hsp104 in protein refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), resulted in rapid formation of the Hsp104 focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>) and a similar, but milder effect was detected upon deletion of <italic>HSP26.</italic> In stark contrast, deletion of <italic>HSP42</italic> abolished age-associated protein deposit formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), which parallels to its function in Q-body assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). To probe the role of Hsp104 and Hsp42 further, we analyzed the consequences of their over-expression on age-associated protein deposit formation (monitored by endogenous Hsp104-GFP). Over-expression of Hsp42 caused precocious nucleation of age-associated protein deposit and promoted its growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). On the contrary, a significantly smaller fraction of cells over-expressing Hsp104 contained an age-associated protein deposit and while age-associated deposits still occasionally formed, they were rapidly destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that these chaperones functionally oppose each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>): the Hsp104/Hsp70 proteins prevent age-associated protein deposit formation possibly by refolding cytoplasmic substrates, whereas Hsp42 coordinates the collection of these substrates from the cytoplasm into the age-associated protein deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06197.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of the roles of chaperones in age-associated protein deposit assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative time-lapse images of cells expressing endogenously tagged Hsp42-GFP (upper panel) and Hsp104-mCherry (middle panel).

Importantly, simultaneous reintroduction of Hsp104 and Hsp42 was sufficient to clear the cytoplasm of Ssa1-GFP speckles already within 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, no foci). In contrast, introducing Hsp42 alone resulted in rapid disappearance of cytoplasmic speckles with concurrent formation of a single Ssa1-GFP focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, one focus).

Together, these data imply that the Hsp104/Hsp70 system, which counteracts protein aggregation, is essential for longevity, while the Hsp42-dependent circuit promotes aging in the mother lineage, presumably by building the age-associated protein deposit and thereby establishing the asymmetric inheritance of age-associated protein aggregates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protein aggregation has been frequently associated with aging and aging-associated diseases. Here, by using the budding yeast as a model for replicative aging, we identify an Hsp42-promoted and Hsp104/Hsp70-counteracted pathway that deposits age-associated protein aggregates and thereby ensures their biased segregation to the aging mother-lineage upon cell division (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This might represent a common mechanism to drive asymmetric segregation of aberrant proteins in dividing cells, as stressed fission yeast cells utilize a similar Hsp16-dependent mechanism for asymmetric partitioning of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coelho et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, our data suggest that depositing age-associated protein aggregates to the mother cells might be a mixed blessing. On one hand, the age-associated deposit can promote spatial protein quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>) and promote cell diversity as an asymmetrically dividing structure that may harbor protein conformation encoded epigenetic information, such as the prion fold of Sup35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At the same time, the long-term consequences of this pathway appear negative for the aging lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Why the deposit-forming pathway ultimately becomes associated with age-dependent loss of fitness remains to be determined. In this regard, it will be of great importance to elucidate how age-associated deposit relates to other aging pathways, such as those influencing the function of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McMurray and Gottschling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>), vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>) and nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Webster et al., 2014</xref>), and how the deposit localizes relative to these organelles and their components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Protein deposit-containing cells efficiently coped with acute proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and displayed improved degradation of cytosolic UPS substrate during early- to mid-life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is important to note, however, that our assays were conducted with relatively young cells that had recently acquired the protein deposit, and hence it is possible that UPS function starts to decline later during the aging process, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>). Curiously, the decline in proteostasis has been associated with protein aggregation pathologies such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>). The decreased degradation of cytosolic UPS substrates in a polyQ disease model was found to be due to the sequestration of the Hsp40 protein Sis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2013</xref>)—a protein that was not associated with the age-associated deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is thus plausible that the presence of the deposit might, for example, lead to increased levels of available (substrate unbound) Sis1, thereby allowing more efficient nuclear import and degradation of cytosolic UPS substrates. Altogether, these data suggest that there is a need to better differentiate between pathophysiological protein aggregation and ‘homeostatic’ protein aggregation that takes place during physiological aging, of which the latter might initially help to coordinate chaperones and UPS factors involved in protein quality control. Related to this, the age-associated protein deposit did not clearly fill out the set criterion for any of the previously characterized cytosolic deposits, including Q-bodies, JUNQ/INQ, or IPOD, but rather seems to exist in parallel with the JUNQ and IPOD structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)—although, for example, the chaperones regulating these deposits were often shared between these structures. This favors the notion that pathological aggregation processes (mimicked e.g., by VHL and Rnq1 over-expression) can hijack endogenous proteostasis regulatory mechanisms, possibly underlying their harmful effects in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these apparent differences between the stress-induced, pathological, and aging-associated protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrates that protein aggregates are not all equal in their composition or in the way they are being recognized and dealt by the cell and reinforces the importance to discriminate between different aggregation models.</p><p>In the future, it will be important to identify the cargo deposited to the age-associated protein deposits. In this aspect, it is interesting to note that many of the long-lived asymmetrically retained proteins that accumulate to mother cells as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thayer et al., 2014</xref>) were among those localizing to the age-associated protein deposit (including Hsp104, Ssa1, Ssa2, and Hsp26). One example of an age-associated deposit resident protein was the prion-like Sup35. This storage rendered Sup35 to be inherited by the mother cells (unlike a prion, analogous to a mnemon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caudron and Barral, 2013</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which is consistent with the size-dependent transmission model of Sup35-aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derdowski et al., 2010</xref>). However, aging does not enhance Sup35-dependent [<italic>PSI+</italic>] prion generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shewmaker and Wickner, 2006</xref>). Together, these notions suggest that Sup35 cannot escape the age-associated deposit under normal growth conditions, perhaps owing to the rigid amyloid-like packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saibil et al., 2012</xref>), being consistent with the durable and non-dynamic nature of these deposits. However, this notion may come with a caveat: we found that the age-associated deposit could be, at least temporarily, disassembled by the heat shock response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests the captivating possibility that changes in the environment might trigger the spread from the age-associated deposit. For cells facing fluctuating environments in the wild, the strategy to stochastically store prion-like proteins in aged cells might prove beneficial, as it could allow stress-dependent spread of the prion conformers from a subpopulation of aged-cells to their daughters, promoting faster adaptation to the changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newby and Lindquist, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since asymmetric inheritance of damaged proteins and protein aggregates seems to be conserved in metazoan stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bufalino et al., 2013</xref>) that are also subjected to both replicative decline and segregation of lineages, we hypothesize that similar pathways that selectively segregate protein-aggregate based fate determinants asymmetrically during cell division are likely to be conserved and may contribute to cellular lineage specification across species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The over-expression of Rnq1-GFP and VHL-GFP was induced by switching cells to 2% galactose at the onset of imaging. The auxin-mediated degradation assays were performed similarly as above by placing cells to 0.5 mM 3-Indoleacetic acid (Sigma–Aldrich, #12886) at the onset of imaging. The MEP was performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown in log phase for 15 hr before coupling the cell wall with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce). Following 2 hour recovery period, the MEP was engaged by addition of estradiol to a 1 μM final concentration. After desired incubation period, cells were coupled to uMACS Streptavidin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and affinity purified with MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Calcofluor staining was done by incubating cells with 5 μg/ml Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Sigma–Aldrich) for 1 min prior to centrifugation and resuspension to SC media. The Q-bodies were induced by incubating cells in a water bath at +42 °C for 30 min, or by using a temperature-controlled microfluidic chamber (see microfluidics). For the mating experiments, cells (1.85×10<sup>7</sup>) of the opposite mating type were centrifuged 500 g for 5 min and resuspended to 40 μl SC media, mixed and immediately imaged with 1-min intervals (see microscopy for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Wide-field microscopy was performed at 30 °C with a DeltaVision microscope coupled to a coolSNAP CCD HQ2 camera (Roper), 250W Xenon lamps and 100X/1.40 and 60x/1.42 NA Olympus oil immersion objectives. Z-sectioning was performed with 500-nm spacing (unless otherwise indicated), obtaining 9 or 11 (live-cell imaging) or 15 (calcofluor stained cells) stacks.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We consider the work to be technically well done, but largely redundant with a lot of published literature – which you have not referenced properly. In addition there are specific concerns raised by the reviewers that we feel would require substantial experimental work, beyond the normal we suggest for a manuscript that could be returned with revisions. Consequently, in its current form, we believe this work does not advance the fields of aging or protein aggregation as far as other manuscripts that have been published recently in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we do like the direction you have taken and think there are “good bones” in this work. Please take the advice of the reviewers into account in designing a new manuscript that you may wish to have us consider at a future date.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors observe a single dot of Hsp104-GFP that forms in mother cells after several buddings, and is retained in the mother cell indefinitely. This focus is labeled as well by Ssa1 and Ssa2 (the major cytoplasmic Hsp70s), Hsp42 (a “small” heat shock protein) and Ydj1p (an Hsp40). These foci are shown to be distinct from “Q-bodies” (multiple aggregates formed after heat-stress) or “P-bodies”.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>1) There has been a proliferation of “foci” of protein aggregates. What is the relation of the AIDOPOD to the JUNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich, Kopito and Frydman, 2008</xref>) locus, both of which are juxtanuclear? Are these the same aggregates that Nyquist has described (without this name) as retained in the mother cell in an Hsp104-dependent process? Are these the Hsp42 foci of aggregated proteins described by Bukau's group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>)? Btn2p forms foci of prion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kryndushkin and Wickner, 2008</xref>) and non-prion aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kryndushkin and Shewmaker, 2012</xref>) and binds well to Hsp42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malinovska and Alberti, 2012</xref>): are the AIDOPOD foci the same as the Btn2 aggregation foci?</p><p>2) In the subsection “AIDOPOD formation is required for asymmetric inheritance of protein aggregates and may promote aging”, the authors state that “Altogether, these data provide evidence that collection of protein aggregates into a single deposit (AIDOPOD) by Hsp42 promotes their asymmetric retention in the mother cell during cell division.” This is not established by the data presented, which examines only the presence of various chaperones in these foci: Hsp104, Hsp70s (Ssa1p, Ssa2p), and Hsp42. Are there protein aggregates in these foci? Or do the authors mean that these are foci of aggregated Hsp104, Hsp70 and Hsp42? I doubt that. It is not established that there are any protein aggregates in the AIDOPOD foci, and they might even be membrane-bound collections of soluble proteins.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: In [<italic>PSI+</italic>] cells, Sup35-GFP forms multiple dots (shown by many groups, but first by Patino and Lindquist in 1996). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, there is just one big dot, and otherwise, the GFP seems to been even across the cell, just like the [<italic>psi-</italic>] cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. And Sup35-GFP dots in [<italic>PSI+</italic>] cells are seen in over 50% of the cells, not just in older cells.

Their findings join a fairly extensive literature about protein aggregates, but the authors propose that the aggregates they define are distinct from previously described protein deposits and furthermore, that they contribute to replicative lifespan.</p><p>Background:</p><p>Protein aggregates have been observed and studied in cells for 50 years. But in the last nearly 20 years, there has been a steady appreciation that canonical heat-shock induced proteins are associated with aggregates (Lindquist lab and others). In yeast, Hsp104 was found to promote “disaggregation” of stress-induced protein aggregates, along with the aid of the Hsp70 family of chaperones and the Hsp26 and Hsp42 families of small heat-shock proteins.</p><p>More recently it has become clear that not all aggregates are equal. For instance, stress induced “Q bodies” initially form as numerous small protein aggregates that eventually coalesce into one or two larger, terminal aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). Q-body formation is promoted by Hsp42 and antagonized by the disaggregase Hsp104. The best-characterized terminal protein aggregates are the juxtanuclear quality control (JUNQ) compartment and the vacuole-associated insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) compartment. JUNQ is composed of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins near proteasomes on the ER, whereas IPOD consists of vacuole-associated aggregates of terminally misfolded proteins that appear unable to be degraded.</p><p>Protein aggregates were first appreciated in yeast replicative aging when carbonylated proteins (a marker of oxidative damage – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>) were found to be retained in the mother cell. These damaged proteins reside within Hsp104 foci (aggregates – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>) and their retention in the mother is dependent upon Sir2 and actin.</p><p>More recently, the kinetics of Hsp104 foci formation after stress induction has been characterized (Zhou et al., 2014). The foci initiate during translation at the ER and ultimately form aggregates at the ER and mitochondria. The aggregates on mitochondria are retained in the mother in Fis1-dependent process.</p><p>Critique :</p><p>In the current manuscript, Saarikangas and Barral characterize an age-induced protein aggregate, which they call the AIDOPOD. It forms under normal, non-stressed conditions and is retained in mother cells. The experiments in this manuscript are technically sound and presented clearly. However, some of the data overlap substantially with previously published work, which is discussed below along with a list of the major findings.</p><p>1) AIDOPOD properties: forms naturally in old mother cells, usually within the first three generations; composed of heat-shock proteins Hsp104, Ssa1, Ssa2, Hsp42, and Ydj1, but not Hsp26, Sis1, or Hsp82; inherited asymmetrically to the mother.</p><p>Most of the AIDOPOD properties (age-induced foci, asymmetric retention) have been previously described for Hsp104-GFP foci. The current manuscript adds the observation that these foci co-localize with several other heat-shock proteins, although most of these markers have been characterized previously in stress-induced aggregates in young cells.</p><p>2) The AIDOPOD fusion-after-mating assays are largely novel and may represent a generally useful tool for studying the effects of different chaperones on protein aggregate formation/disassembly. However, as noted above, previous work has demonstrated by other means that stress-induced foci coalesce into larger aggregates, which presumably aids in asymmetric retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coelho et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>3) AIDOPOD formation is Hsp42-dependent and antagonized by Hsp104.</p><p>A paradigm in which Hsp42 promotes aggregate formation while Hsp104 dissolves aggregates is already well-established and extensively tested in stress-induced aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). The current manuscript extends this paradigm to age-induced protein aggregates.</p><p>4) <italic>hsp42Δ</italic> cells lacking an AIDOPOD are long-lived, whereas <italic>hsp104Δ</italic> cells, which form an AIDOPOD at an earlier age, are short-lived. <italic>hsp104Δ</italic> double mutants have many protein aggregate foci that distribute more symmetrically between daughter and mother, and these cells are as short-lived as the <italic>hsp104Δ</italic> single mutant.</p><p>The short lifespan of <italic>hsp104Δ</italic>mutants has been reported, as well as the inability of Hsp104 overexpression to extend lifespan (not reported here, but reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>). The current authors appear to be the first to demonstrate and interpret the long lifespan of <italic>hsp42Δ</italic> mutants. The authors argue that Hsp104 is essential for a normal lifespan, whereas Hsp42, by aggregating misfolded or damaged proteins into the AIDOPOD in the mother, initiates mother/daughter aging asymmetry. Both aspects of this model have been proposed separately, but this work is the first to unify the models with regards to aging. A likely prediction from their model is that Hsp42 overexpression might shorten lifespan, as these cells accumulated an AIDOPOD at an earlier age than wild-type cells. The current manuscript would benefit substantially from this experiment.</p><p>Summary :</p><p>Taken together, the data presented here will provide a valuable resource for future studies on age-induced protein aggregates. However, much of the manuscript has merely extended existing models from protein aggregates that are stress-induced, particularly Q-bodies, to protein aggregates that are age-induced. Furthermore, previous studies on age-induced Hsp104 aggregates demonstrated that their asymmetric retention is actin and Sir2-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>), and that their presence is intimately linked to proteasome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>). The current manuscript ignores this existing framework with respect to characterizing the AIDOPOD and provides minimal mechanistic insight. Therefore, although valuable, the current manuscript does not substantially advance the field or lead to new paradigms, and would be better suited to a journal that accepts more modest advances.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Yeast cells have been proposed to model diverse aspects of aging related to aging in humans. But this argument has failed to capture the imagination of colleagues studying other organisms. This paper could make an important difference.</p><p>Even more importantly, the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants is of great importance in biology and there are no systems to study this that are as tractable as yeast.</p><p>This paper provides an elegant demonstration of the organism's potential for rigorous thoughtful dissection of these problems. For example, the distinction between the age-related deposits and general stress deposits is surprising and important. The same is to be said for the distinction with P-bodies. The results of mating were fascinating. As were the results of the Hsp42 deletion and the interplay between Hsp42 deletion/OE and the deletion/OE of Hsp104, and of mating to further dissect their roles relative to that of Hsp70.</p><p>The paper is very well written (except see below) and the diversity and thoughtfulness of the experiments is very impressive.</p><p>That said, there are several points that need to be addressed.</p><p>Background information, writing, and referencing:</p><p>The paper has the abbreviated feeling of having been contributed to another journal with extreme pressure for publication space.</p><p>It should be re-written for <italic>eLife</italic>. For example, no information – or referencing – is provided about the biochemical function of Hsp42, which emerges as such a key player here. Nor is there any reference to phenotypes of Hsp42 mutants. In fact there are very few phenotypes reported, which makes the role of this protein in the aggregation foci particularly interesting.) There is virtually no referencing about Hsp104. Saibil's important work on Hsp104 and Ssa1 localization to specific unique foci in prion-containing cells isn't referenced. Nor are any of the foundational papers on Hsp104 function with Hsp70 in protein disaggregation.</p><p>Too many uses of “remarkably”.</p><p>Technical points:</p><p>Since so much of the work depends on the localization of fusion proteins, the ability of these proteins to rescue WT activity (that is, their functionality) should be referenced or established.</p><p>It was very convincing that Hsp104 “aggregation foci” remain in the mother cells. But it was very difficult to see the aggregation foci that are newly arising after several cell divisions in daughters that are becoming aging mothers – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green arrowheads, and movies. This is such a crucial initial point, the evidence has to be convincing. The Materials and methods section here is very brief. Since these foci are difficult to see, was there an objective measure of the formation of these foci? For example, through quantitative high-content imaging? That is clearly implied by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, but not established. I have no doubt that the authors are seeing what they claim, but it isn't demonstrated adequately in the figures for readers to appreciate.</p><p>Biology:</p><p>A very substantial fraction of yeast cells contain a prion known as [<italic>RNQ+</italic>]. This prion is known to require Hsp104, to interact with Hsp104 and Hsp40, and to localize to specific cellular sub-compartments. Moreover, it is the one prion that most profoundly influences the aggregation of other proteins. It must be determined whether the cells the authors are studying contain this prion or not. And for at least the beginning phenomena, it should be looked at in [<italic>RNQ+</italic>] and [<italic>rnq-</italic>] cells.</p><p>I assume the cells they are analyzing for Sup35 foci are negative for the prion it forms? This should be stated. (It would be great to know if this mechanism of Sup35 concentration influenced prion formation. What is the effect of an Hsp42 KO? BUT this is outside the scope of this paper. I am just suggesting it to the authors as an interesting subject. I didn't find it at all surprising that Sup335 didn't influence Hsp104 organization – it shouldn't if the protein aggregating foci are a result of general aging. Perhaps the authors should explain the reasoning behind these observations.)</p><p>Is it accurate to compare the foci to an “organelle”? Or to call it a “compartment”? I think their own experiments suggest they are in much more dynamic association with cytoplasmic aggregates than is suggested by that terminology. I am asking the authors to think about whether this phrasing is necessary.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Protein aggregates are associated with replicative aging without compromising protein quality control” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Major Comments):</italic></p><p>I believe that the authors have largely responded to my comments. The comparison of the current work's age-related aggregate site to other aggregate-collecting sites described by others is an important addition to this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic></p><p>The work of Nyström is referenced more extensively, but I am not sure there is a frank statement in the paper like that in the response to reviews: “It is likely that the Hsp104-labeled aggregates observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al. (2007)</xref> in aged cells refer to the same structure as those described in our work.”</p><p>Moreover, the statement at the end of the Introduction – “Our findings unveil a prevalent and highly coordinated early aging-associated aggregation response that opposes the view of aging and age-associated protein aggregation as a purely stochastic deterioration event” – I never thought it was thought to be “purely stochastic”. Rather, Nyström showed quite clearly that the retention of aggregates in the mother cell was very specific and directed. An opinion to the contrary from another group seems to have been refuted. And “unveils” is a little too strong.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed the concerns I had with the earlier version of this manuscript. While there are similarities between the characterization of Hsp104 foci as described by Nyström and this work, the new characterization of the AIDOPOD and its differences between all the previously described stress induced foci (IPOD, JUNQ, Q-bodies) has never been explored before. Hence I feel it provides a bit of clarity to an otherwise confusing field – especially with respect to the aging field. Note that in the revised manuscript, the authors do a much better job of explaining differences between aging and external stress derived aggregates. Hence, I believe the manuscript is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper is much improved. Its importance is nicely summarized in the last paragraph of the Introduction. I would also add that the pace with which protein foci are being reported in human diseases of aging, in yeast models of these proteinopathies, in the prion field, for diverse RNP granules, purinosomes, liquid-to-solid phase transitions of intrinsically disordered proteins, etc. has been accelerating at an amazing rate. Hence there is all the more need to have some distinctions and order brought to the field, for these distinct highly organized age-related deposits.</p><p>Wading into the realm of this literature is formidable for the naive reader. So I would suggest that the author note and comment on two recent papers that came out since they submitted their work.</p><p>Drummond's group has reported a fascinating formation of profuse, functional protein “aggregates” by particular groups of proteins in response to stress.

We showed that the dynamics of this structure are dependent of the interplay between Hsp42-aggregase and Hsp104/Hsp70-disaggregase-activities. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the prevention of the deposit formation resulted in the inheritance of its constituents by the daughter cells, and prolonged the life span of the aging mother-cell-lineage, altogether providing evidence that protein aggregates are involved in the specification of the yeast-aging lineage.</p><p>All three reviewers of the original submission were overall positive about the quality of our work, but raised some concerns, which we have now addressed. In particular we have:</p><p>1. Expanded our analysis on the role of the age-associated protein deposit in protein quality control. We employed transient proteotoxic stress assays to show that aged cells with a protein deposit efficiently clear proteotoxic stress, and that exposure to proteotoxic heat stress counteracts the formation of the age-associated protein deposit. This provides evidence that the deposit formation is not a consequence of defective protein quality control.</p><p>2. Examined the relationship between the age-associated protein deposit and the previously described quality control “foci” (Q-bodies, JUNQ, IPOD and INQ). By visualizing these foci in the context of the age-associated deposit, we now provide evidence that the age-associated protein deposit does not fulfil the typical characteristics of any of the previously characterized protein deposit sites. This validates the originality of our findings and demonstrates an important distinction between age-induced, stress induced and pathological protein aggregation modes.</p><p>3. Analyzed the degradation kinetics of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteasome substrates at the single cell level in vivo. This demonstrated that the presence of the age-associated protein deposit aids the degradation of cytosolic proteasome substrates, providing evidence that this deposit has a functional role in promoting protein quality control. A point-by point-discussion is included below. Altogether, our results shed light on the poorly described aspects of aging, protein quality control, asymmetric cell division and cellular fate determination.

Below, please find a detailed explanation of our results:</p><p>Relation to JUNQ/INQ:</p><p>We expressed the classical JUNQ-marker VHL-GFP and found that the resulting VHL-foci typically did not (87% of cases, N=29) recruit the age-associated deposit marker Hsp104 within 30 minutes from their appearance. In our hands, the VHL expression often led to an overall increase in Hsp104 expression, which made the overall interpretation regarding the age-associated deposit difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>).</p><p>As an alternative approach, we used a strain carrying Hsp82-GFP, Hsp104-mCherry and a deletion of rpn4, which results in a decreased amount of proteasomes and consequently in an accumulation of proteasome-destined material (JUNQ cargo). Hsp82 does not localize to the age-associated protein deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but localizes to Q-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which are considered to be the early representation of JUNQ-destined material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). Hsp104 marks Q-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), JUNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>) and the age-associated deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While most of the cells displayed several Q-body like aggregates enriched both with Hsp82 and Hsp104, we were also able to identify cells that displayed two discrete deposits: a JUNQ-like focus (Hsp82 and Hsp104 positive), and an age-associated deposit-like puncta (Hsp82 negative, Hsp104 positive) (see an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that these two compartments can co-exist.</p><p>Relation to Btn2-foci (JUNQ/INQ):</p><p>The “JUNQ” was renamed as the “INQ” by a recent work showing that this compartment resides inside the nucleus and requires Btn2 for its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We conducted rigorous analysis on the coexistence of Btn2 and Hsp104-deposits during aging. By analyzing altogether 1268 cells we found 30 examples where cells displayed a Btn2 focus, but only one of them was enriched in HSp104 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>). Furthermore, the appearance of the Btn2 focus was not associated with replicative aging (average age of Btn2-focus containing cells was 1.2 generations).</p><p>Relation to Q-bodies and the Hsp42 foci of aggregated proteins described by Bukau's group:</p><p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Specht et al. (2011)</xref> identified the requirement of Hsp42 for the formation of “peripheral aggregates”, which are analogous to the Q-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). Our data shows that the Q-bodies and age-associated deposits can be distinguished by their durability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and by the difference in associated chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, although both structures require Hsp42 for their formation, they are likely not the same structures.</p><p>The JUNQ formation results from prolonged proteotoxic stress (formation of Q-bodies) associated with defective degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>). We found that exposure to proteotoxic heat stress does not promote, but rather mildly inhibits the formations of age-associated protein deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-I</xref>), suggesting that presence of JUNQ destined material does not promote age-associated deposit formation.</p><p>Relation to IPOD:</p><p>We also expanded this analysis to look at the IPOD structure (undynamic aggregate formed by Rnq1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to what we observed with the JUNQ marker VHL, the Rnq1-aggregates were efficiently recognized by Hsp104 (&gt;98% of Rnq1-foci accumulated Hsp104 within 30 min of their appearance, N=53). However, we did not observe accumulation of Rnq1 to a pre-existing age-associated protein deposit (see arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed 117 Hsp104 foci-containing [<italic>PIN+</italic>, <italic>PSI+</italic>]-cells and found that in 98.3% of the cases, Rnq1-GFP did not accumulate to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). The two examples of cells that had and Rnq1-focus, both displayed &gt;1 Hsp104 foci, of which only one was Rnq1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Together with the results of the Rnq1-over-expression, this suggests that the Rnq1-aggregate is probably not equivalent to the “typical” age-associated deposit.</p><p>Relation to the age-associated aggregates that Nyström lab has described:</p><p>It is likely that the Hsp104-labeled aggregates observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erjavec et al. (2007)</xref> in aged cells refer to the same structure as those described in our work. There are some differences regarding the appearance (the number of foci per cell appears higher in their work) and segregation (we did not observe a segregation defect of age-associated aggregates in hsp104 mutant cells). These disparities could be due to different experimental approaches used by these studies.</p><p>Although we acknowledged their seminal papers in the original submission, we have now paid attention to discuss them in more detail in the Introduction and refer to them where appropriate.</p><p>Collectively, these results provide evidence that the age-associated deposit is not identical with Q-bodies, JUNQ/INQ, Btn2-foci, or IPOD, but rather that it can co-exist with these deposit sites. These results are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and discussed in the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection “AIDOPOD formation is required for asymmetric inheritance of protein aggregates and may promote aging”, the authors state that “Altogether, these data provide evidence that collection of protein aggregates into a single deposit (AIDOPOD) by Hsp42 promotes their asymmetric retention in the mother cell during cell division.” This is not established by the data presented, which examines only the presence of various chaperones in these foci: Hsp104, Hsp70s (Ssa1p, Ssa2p), and Hsp42. Are there protein aggregates in these foci? Or do the authors mean that these are foci of aggregated Hsp104, Hsp70 and Hsp42? I doubt that. It is not established that there are any protein aggregates in the AIDOPOD foci, and they might even be membrane-bound collections of soluble proteins.</italic></p><p>We show that the age-associated deposit collects endogenous protein aggregates formed by Sup35 in its prion [<italic>PSI+</italic>] form, and that this Sup35-enriched deposit is asymmetrically retained by the mother cells during cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-G</xref>). Since the non-prion [<italic>psi-</italic>] form of Sup35-GFP did not accumulate to the age-associated deposit, we assume that the deposit recruits amyloid-like substrates.

However, we do not share the notion that most of the properties we characterized for the age-associated deposit would have been characterized before. We appreciate the reviewer for these sentiments, as it helped us to recognize that we were not able to phrase our findings and conclusions clearly and gave us an opportunity to clarify these aspects. We have now revised on our paper substantially and focused on what we feel are the key unresolved issues in the field. In particular, owing to the variable use of reporters and model systems, it has remained unclear to which extend the age-associated protein aggregation can be modeled by these reporter systems (i.e. whether they truly represent the same pathway or rather parallel pathways that share the same molecular components). Thus we have endeavored to answer the following questions:</p><p>1. What is the relationship between the age-associated protein aggregation and the formation of Q-bodies, IPOD and JUNQ/INQ?</p><p>2. What is the role of the age-associated protein deposit in the functionality of protein quality control?</p><p>These efforts resulted in the following results, which are now included in the work:</p><p>The age-associated deposit is not analogous the Q-bodies, JUNQ/INQ or IPOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, see response to reviewer #1).</p><p>Cells with an age-associated deposit respond and dissolve proteotoxic stress as fast as their clonal counterparts without an aggregate, providing the evidence that their formation is not due to inability of cells to clear protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>).</p><p>Proteotoxic stress (Q-bodies) does not enhance, but rather counteracts the formation of the age-associated deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref>).</p><p>Cells with an age-associated protein deposit display accelerated degradation rate of cytosolic proteasome substrate, demonstrating a direct functional role for the age-associated protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Together, these added data provide evidence that age-associated protein aggregation has initially a positive influence on protein quality control and resolves its relation to the previously described deposit sites.</p><p><italic>2) The AIDOPOD fusion-after-mating assays are largely novel and may represent a generally useful tool for studying the effects of different chaperones on protein aggregate formation/disassembly. However, as noted above, previous work has demonstrated by other means that stress-induced foci coalesce into larger aggregates, which presumably aids in asymmetric retention (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"><italic>Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><italic>Coelho et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p>Please see our reply below.</p><p><italic>3) AIDOPOD formation is Hsp42-dependent and antagonized by Hsp104.</italic></p><p><italic>A paradigm in which Hsp42 promotes aggregate formation while Hsp104 dissolves aggregates is already well-established and extensively tested in stress-induced aggregates (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62"><italic>Specht et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17"><italic>Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>).

Our work brings upon one important distinction to this model: unlike with stress associated aggregates, in the context of aging, Hsp104 is unable to dissolve the age-associated structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) – unless cells experience stress response, which can lead to transient disassembly of the age-associated deposit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The current authors appear to be the first to demonstrate and interpret the long lifespan of</italic> hsp42Δ <italic>mutants. The authors argue that Hsp104 is essential for a normal lifespan, whereas Hsp42, by aggregating misfolded or damaged proteins into the AIDOPOD in the mother, initiates mother/daughter aging asymmetry. Both aspects of this model have been proposed separately, but this work is the first to unify the models with regards to aging. A likely prediction from their model is that Hsp42 overexpression might shorten lifespan, as these cells accumulated an AIDOPOD at an earlier age than wild-type cells. The current manuscript would benefit substantially from this experiment.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have now measured the life span of Hsp42 over-expressing cells. This pedigree analysis showed that Hsp42 over-expression did not have any effect on median life span compared to wild type cells (22 vs. 22 divisions, N=141 each, see below). This suggests that the effect of Hsp42 on aging is already fully attained with the wild type protein levels, which is not surprising since most cells in both groups (WT and Hsp42-OE) formed the deposit already during the first quarter of their life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In this regard, it is important to note that we still do not exactly understand how does the deposit influence life span. We have now discussed this result in the subsection “Age-associated protein deposit formation is required for asymmetric inheritance of protein aggregates and may promote aging”.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06197.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06197.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06197.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06197-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>Taken together, the data presented here will provide a valuable resource for future studies on age-induced protein aggregates. However, much of the manuscript has merely extended existing models from protein aggregates that are stress-induced, particularly Q-bodies, to protein aggregates that are age-induced. Furthermore, previous studies on age-induced Hsp104 aggregates demonstrated that their asymmetric retention is actin and Sir2-dependent (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>Erjavec et al., 2007</italic></xref><italic>), and that their presence is intimately linked to proteasome function (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><italic>Andersson et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>). The current manuscript ignores this existing framework with respect to characterizing the AIDOPOD and provides minimal mechanistic insight. Therefore, although valuable, the current manuscript does not substantially advance the field or lead to new paradigms, and would be better suited to a journal that accepts more modest advances.</italic></p><p>We have now extensively discussed the existing framework in the Introduction, Results and Discussion.

The formation of the age-associated deposit was followed in time-lapse movies, where their dynamic maturation process could be followed frame-by-frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>).

In the prion negative [<italic>psi-</italic>] cells, Sup35 did not accumulate to the age-associated deposit, suggesting that prion (amyloid)-like fold directs it to be stored at the age-associated protein deposit.
