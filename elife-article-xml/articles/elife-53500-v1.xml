the dawn of the genomic era. There are two dominant explanations for orphan genes: complete sequence divergence from ancestral genes, such that homologues are not readily detectable; and de novo emergence from ancestral non-genic sequences, such that homologues genuinely do not exist. The relative contribution of the two processes remains unknown. Here, we harness the special circumstance of conserved synteny to estimate the contribution of complete divergence to the pool of orphan genes. By separately comparing yeast, fly and human genes to related taxa using conservative criteria, we find that complete divergence accounts, on average, for at most a third of eukaryotic orphan and taxonomically restricted genes. We observe that complete divergence occurs at a stable rate within a phylum but at different rates between phyla, and is frequently associated with gene shortening akin to pseudogenization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>orphan genes</kwd><kwd>genetic novelty</kwd><kwd>sequence divergence</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>conserved synteny</kwd><kwd>de novo gene emergence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>309834</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLysaght</surname><given-names>Aoife</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>771419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLysaght</surname><given-names>Aoife</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM108865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvunis</surname><given-names>Anne-Ruxandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvunis</surname><given-names>Anne-Ruxandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Homology information implicit in regions of conserved synteny allows quantification of gene origination by complete sequence divergence, revealing a larger-than-expected role for other mechanisms of origin, including de novo origination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extant genomes contain a large repertoire of protein-coding genes which can be grouped into families based on sequence similarity. Comparative genomics has heavily relied on grouping genes and proteins in this manner since the dawn of the genomic era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubin, 2000</xref>). Within the limitations of available similarity-detection methods, we thus define thousands of distinct gene families. Given that the genome and gene repertoire of the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) was likely small relative to that of most extant eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becerra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldman et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), what processes gave rise to these distinct gene families? Answering this question is essential to understanding the structure of the gene/protein universe, its spectrum of possible functions, and the evolutionary forces that ultimately gave rise to the enormous diversity of life on earth.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>From a limited set of genes in LUCA to the multitudinous extant patterns of presence and absence of genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the LUCA gene repertoire and extant phylogenetic distribution of gene families (shown in different colours, same colour represents sequence similarity and homology). Dashed boxes denote different phylogenetic species groups. Light grey and dark blue gene families cover all genomes and can thus be traced back to the common ancestor. Other genes may have more restricted distributions; for example, the yellow gene is only found in group b, the black gene in group c. The phylogenetic distribution of gene family members allows us to propose hypotheses about the timing of origination of each family. (<bold>B</bold>) Sequence divergence can gradually erase all similarity between homologous sequences, eventually leading to their identification as distinct gene families. Note that divergence can also occur after a homologous gene was acquired by horizontal transfer. Solid boxes represent genes. Sequence divergence is symbolized by divergence in colour. (<bold>C</bold>) De novo emergence of a gene from a previously non-genic sequence along a specific lineage will almost always result in a unique sequence in that lineage (cases of convergent evolution can in theory occur). Hashed boxes represent non-genic sequences.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53500-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To some extent, the distinction between gene families is operational and stems from our imperfect similarity-detection ability. But to a larger extent it is biologically meaningful because it captures shared evolutionary histories and, by extension, shared properties between genes that are useful to know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gabaldón and Koonin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koonin, 2005</xref>). Genes that cannot be assigned to any known gene family have historically been termed ‘orphan’. This term can be generalized to Taxonomically Restricted Gene (TRG), which includes genes that belong to small families found only across a closely related group of species and nowhere else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>By definition, orphan genes and TRGs can be the result of two processes. The first process is divergence of pre-existing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>). Given enough time, a pair of genes that share a common ancestor (homologous genes) can reach the ‘twilight zone' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doolittle, 1981</xref>), a point at which similarity is no longer detectable. From a sequence-centric standpoint, we can consider such entities as bearing no more similarity than expected by chance. They are the seeds of two new gene families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An example of this was found when examining yeast duplicates resulting from whole genome duplication (WGD) where it was reported that about 5% of the ~500 identified paralogue pairs had very weak or no similarity at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolfe, 2004</xref>). Divergence of pre-existing genes can occur during vertical descent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as following horizontal transfer of genetic material between different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunning Hotopp, 2011</xref>). The second process is de novo emergence from previously non-genic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vakirlis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLysaght and Guerzoni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For a long time, divergence was considered to be the only realistic evolutionary explanation for the origin of new gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2003</xref>), while de novo emergence has only recently been appreciated as a widespread phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Long et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tautz, 2014</xref>). De novo emergence is thought to have a high potential to produce entirely unique genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlötterer, 2015</xref>) (though examples of convergent selection exist, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baalsrud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhuang et al., 2019</xref>), whereas divergence, being more gradual, can stop before this occurs. What is the relative contribution of these two mechanisms to the ‘mystery of orphan genes' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dujon, 1996</xref>)?</p><p>We set out to study the process of complete divergence of genes by delving into the ‘unseen world of homologs' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolfe, 2004</xref>). More specifically, we sought to understand how frequently homologues diverge beyond recognition, reveal how the process unfolds, and explicitly identify resulting TRGs. To do so, we developed a novel synteny-based approach for homology detection and applied it to three lineages. Our approach allowed us to trace the limits of similarity searches in the context of homologue detection. We show that genes which diverge beyond these limits exist, that they are being generated at a steady rate during evolution, and that they account, on average, for at most a third of all genes without detectable homologues. All but a small percentage of these undetectable homologues lack similarity at the protein domain level. Finally, we study specific examples of novel genes that have originated or are on the verge of originating from pre-existing ones, revealing a possible role of gene disruption and truncation in this process. We show that in the human lineage, this evolutionary route has likely given rise to at least two mammal-specific, cancer-related genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A synteny-based approach to establish homology beyond sequence similarity</title><p>To estimate the frequency at which homologues diverge beyond recognition, we developed a pipeline that allows the identification of candidate homologous genes regardless of whether pairwise sequence similarity can be detected. The central idea behind our pipeline is that genes found in conserved syntenic positions in a pair of genomes will usually share ancestry. The same basic principle has been previously used to detect pairs of WGD paralogues in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolfe and Shields, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kellis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietrich, 2004</xref>) and more recently to identify homologous long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrera-Úbeda et al., 2019</xref>). Coupled with the knowledge that biological sequences diverge over time, this allows us to estimate how often a pair of homologous genes will diverge beyond detectable sequence similarity in the context of syntenic regions. This estimate can then be extrapolated genome-wide to approximate the extent of origin by complete divergence for orphan genes and TRGs outside of syntenic regions, provided that genes outside regions of conserved synteny have similar evolutionary rates as genes inside syntenic regions. The estimates that we will provide of the rate of divergence beyond recognition inside synteny blocks are best viewed as an upper-bound of the true rate because some of the genes found in conserved syntenic positions in a pair of genomes will not be homologous. If we could remove all such cases, the rate of divergence beyond recognition would only decrease, but not increase, relative to our estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Summary of the main concept and pipeline of identification of putative homologous pairs with undetectable similarity between pairs of genomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of the reasoning we use to estimate the proportion of genes in a genome that have diverged beyond recognition. (<bold>B</bold>) Pipeline of identification of putative homologous pairs with undetectable similarity. 1) Choose focal and target species. Parse gene order and retrieve homologous relationships from OrthoDB for each focal-target pair. Search for sequence similarity by BLASTP between focal and target proteomes, one target proteome at a time. 2) For every focal gene (<italic>b</italic>), identify whether a region of conserved micro-synteny exists, that is when the upstream (<italic>a</italic>) and downstream (<italic>c</italic>) neighbours have homologues (<italic>a’</italic>, <italic>c’</italic>) separated by either one or two genes. This conserved micro-synteny allows us to assume that <italic>b</italic> and <italic>b’</italic> are most likely homologues. Only cases for which the conserved micro-synteny region can be expanded by one additional gene are retained. Specifically, if genes <italic>d</italic> and <italic>e</italic> have homologues, these must be separated by at most one gene from <italic>a’</italic> and <italic>c’</italic>, respectively. A per-species histogram of the number of genes with at least one identified region of conserved micro-synteny can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. For all genes where at least one such configuration is found, move to the next step. 3) Check whether a precalculated BLASTP hit exists (by our proteome searches) between query (<italic>b</italic>) and candidate homologue (<italic>b’</italic>) for a given E-value threshold. If no hit exists, move to the next step. 4) Use TBLASTN to search for similarity between the query (<italic>b</italic>) and the genomic region of the conserved micro-synteny (-/+ 2 kb around the candidate homologue gene) for a given E-value threshold. If no hit exists, move to the next step. 5) Extend the search to the entire proteome and genome. If no hit exists, move to the next step. 6) Record all relevant information about the pairs of sequences forming the <italic>b – b’</italic> pairs of step 2). Any statistically significant hit at steps 3–5 is counted as detected homology by sequence similarity. In the end, we count the total numbers of genes in conserved micro-synteny without any similarity for each pair of genomes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53500-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Total number of genes in the focal species genome for which a region in conserved micro-synteny was identified in a given target species (x axis).</title><p>Species are ordered in increasing divergence times from their corresponding focal species.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53500-fig2-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> illustrates the main steps of the pipeline and the full details can be found in Materials and methods. Briefly, we first select a set of target genomes to compare to our focal genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, step 1). Using precomputed pairs of homologous genes (those belonging to the same OrthoDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kriventseva et al., 2008</xref>] group) we identify regions of conserved micro-synteny. Our operational definition of conserved micro-synteny consists of cases where a gene in the focal genome is found within a conserved chromosomal block of at least three genes: the immediate downstream and upstream neighbours of the focal gene must have homologues in the target genome that are themselves separated by at most one or two genes and, if the genes immediately next to these neighbours (second neighbours of the focal gene) have homologues in the target genome, these must also be separated from the homologues of the immediate neighbours by at most one gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, step 2; see Materials and methods for details). Since the choice of synteny criterion can have an impact on downstream analyses we have also used one more relaxed and one more stringent definition (see Materials and methods; results using these alternative definitions are presented later). All focal genes for which at least one region of conserved micro-synteny, in any target genome, is identified, are retained for further analysis. This step establishes a list of focal genes with at least one presumed homologue in one or more target genomes (i.e., the gene located in the conserved location in the micro-synteny block).</p><p>We then examine whether the focal gene has any sequence similarity in the target species. We search for sequence similarity in two ways: comparison with annotated genes (proteome), and comparison with the genomic DNA (genome). First, we search within BLASTP matches that we have precomputed ourselves (these are different from the OrthoDB data) using the complete proteome of the focal species as query against the complete proteome of the target species. Within this BLASTP output we look for matches between the query gene and the candidate gene (that is, between <italic>b</italic> and <italic>b’</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, step 3). If none is found then we use TBLASTN to search the genomic region around the candidate gene <italic>b’</italic> for similarity to the query gene <italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, step 4, see figure legend for details). If no similarity is found, the search is extended to the rest of the target proteome and genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, step 5). If there is no sequence similarity after these successive searches, then we infer that the sequence has diverged beyond recognition. After having recorded whether similarity can be detected for all eligible query genes, we finally retrieve the focal-target pairs and produce the found and not found proportions for each pair of genomes.</p><p>We applied this pipeline to three independent datasets using as focal species <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fly) and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (human). We included 17, 16 and 15 target species, respectively, selected to represent a wide range of evolutionary distances from each focal species (see Materials and methods). The numbers of cases of conserved micro-synteny detected for each focal-target genome pair is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selecting optimal BLAST E-value cut-offs</title><p>Homology detection is highly sensitive to the technical choices made during sequence similarity searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendsee et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore sought to explore how the choice of E-value threshold would impact interpretations of divergence beyond similarity. First, we performed BLASTP searches of the focal species’ total protein sequences against the total reversed protein sequences of each target species. Matches produced in these searches can safely be considered ‘false homologies’ since biological sequences do not evolve by reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frith, 2011</xref>) (see Materials and methods). These false homologies were then compared to ‘undetectable homologies’: cases with conserved micro-synteny (presumed homologues) but without any detectable sequence similarity.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we can see how the ratios of undetectable and false homologies vary as a function of the BLAST E-value threshold used. The proportion of undetectable homologies depended quasi-linearly on the E-value cut-off. By contrast, false homologies depended exponentially on the cut-off, as expected from the E-value definition. Furthermore, the impact of E-value cut-off was more pronounced in comparisons of species separated by longer evolutionary distances, whereas it was almost non-existent for comparisons amongst the most closely related species. Conversely, there seems to be no dependence between percentage of false homologies and evolutionary time across the range of E-values that we have tested (all lines overlap in the graphs in the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This means that, when comparing relatively closely related species, failing to appropriately control for false homologies would have an overall more severe effect on homology detection than failing to account for false negatives.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Proportions of false and undetectable homologies for a range of E-value cut-offs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proportions of false and undetectable homologies as a function of the E-value cut-off used.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domazet-Loso et al., 2007</xref>), gene age underestimation due to BLAST ‘false negatives’ has been considered a serious issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2014</xref>), although the importance of spurious BLAST hits generating false positives has also been stressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domazet-Lošo et al., 2017</xref>). We defined a set of E-value cut-offs optimised for phylostratigraphy, by choosing the highest E-value that keeps false homologies under 5%. This strategy emphasizes sensitivity over specificity. We have also calculated general-use optimal E-values by using a balanced binary classification measure (see Materials and methods). The phylostratigraphy optimal E-value thresholds are 0.01 for all comparisons using yeast and fly as focal species and 0.001 for those of human, except for chimpanzee (10<sup>−4</sup>). These are close to previously estimated optimal E-value cut-offs for identifying orphan genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, found in the range of 10<sup>−3</sup> - 10<sup>−5</sup>, see ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>). These cut-offs have been used for all downstream analyses.</p><p>We find that, for the vast majority of focal genes examined that do have matches, the match occurs in the predicted region (‘opposite’), that is within the region of conserved micro-synteny. In 36/48 pair-wise species comparisons, at least 90% of the focal genes in micro-synteny for which at least one match was eventually found in the target genome, a match was within the predicted micro-syntenic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This finding supports the soundness of our synteny-based approach for homologue identification.</p><p>In total, we were able to identify 180, 81 and 156 unique focal species genes in the dataset of yeast, fly and human respectively, that have at least one undetectable homologue in at least one target species but no significant sequence similarity to that homologue or to any other part of the target genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for two exemplars of these findings).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The rate of ‘divergence beyond recognition’ and its contribution to the total pool of genes without similarity</title><p>How quickly do homologous genes become undetectable?

The five most distant species in the fly dataset are shown on a separate, logarithmic scale for visual purposes, since the ‘stringent’ definition greatly reduces the number of identified conserved regions. Notice that this is true as well in other cases, such as for ‘Vpol’ and ‘Tbla’ in the yeast dataset. (<bold>B</bold>) Estimated ‘proportions explained by divergence’ for the pairwise (left) and the phylogeny-based (right) approaches, using three different definitions of conserved synteny blocks (explained in A). Note that the ‘relaxed’ definition introduces some known false positives (non-homologous genes which due to rearrangements are placed ‘opposite’ each other), and it is for this reason that the current definition was eventually preferred (see Materials and methods for more details). As expected from the presence of these false positives the results show a limited increase but are generally similar: pairwise overall mean 23% (relaxed) vs. 20.6% (current), phylogeny-based overall mean 33.7% (relaxed) vs. 30% (current). The ‘stringent’ definition becomes problematic in many cases, especially in the comparison of distant species, as the number of genes for which the synteny criterion is satisfied becomes too small (as shown in A). A comparison including only species with &gt;200 conserved micro-synteny regions (i.e. excluding ‘Vpol’, ‘Tbla’, ‘Tpha’, ‘Ecym’, ‘Agam’, ‘Aaeg’, ‘Bmor’, ‘Tcas’, ‘Amel’, ‘Drer’) shows that in the pairwise case the mean drops from 16% in the current one to 10.9% in the stringent one. Applying the same cut-off in the phylogeny-based case (meaning that we exclude the four more distant phylostrata of the fly dataset), we get an average of 14% for stringent compared to 27.4% for current.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53500-fig6-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny-based approach to estimate the contribution of divergence to TRGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>n</italic>: number of total genes; <italic>X</italic>: number of Taxonomically Restricted Genes (TRGs). Graphical representation of the of the phylogeny-based approach to estimate the proportion of genes that lack similarity beyond a specific phylogenetic level because of sequence divergence. The phylogenetic tree on the left-hand side of the vertical line shows an example of a TRG: a focal species (F) gene that has a homologue (defined by sequence similarity) only in its closest neighbour and nowhere else (absence of homologue is shown with a red 0). This permits the inference of the branch origin of this gene (phylostratum of the gene) as the branch just prior to the divergence of the lineages that carry the gene (highlighted in grey). For each phylostratum we can calculate the proportion of genes originated since (<italic>X</italic>) out of all genes in the genome (<italic>n</italic>). On the right-hand side of the vertical line we show an example of a gene (a) that is also a TRG as in the left-hand side, but that also has a region of conserved micro-synteny with a species outside of the phylostratum, that is an outgroup. Thus, we can infer that this TRG can be explained by sequence divergence, as it appears to have an undetectable homologue in one of the outgroups. Similarly to the pairwise case then, we can calculate the proportion of TRGs explained by divergence (<italic>d</italic>) as the number of such cases (TRGs with conserved micro-synteny with at least one outgroup and hence a putative undetectable homologue in an outgroup) out of all the genes with conserved micro-synteny with at least one outgroup.

Using a more relaxed conserved synteny definition (only one syntenic homologue on either side of the focal gene) had limited impact on these results (overall average of 23% explained by divergence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>; Materials and methods). We also used a more stringent definition of conserved micro-syntenic regions (an additional syntenic homologue on either side), but the number of regions identified was too low to extract meaningful conclusions with the more distant species pairs in our data sets (e.g. &lt;5 for comparisons to all non-<italic>Drosophila</italic> species in the fly dataset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the species where the number of identified regions was sufficient, the average proportion explained by divergence dropped from 16% (using our current definition in this subset of species) to 10.9% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>; Materials and methods). The more pronounced difference in the stringent-current comparison could be explained by the fact that these proportions are calculated as the ratio of two small ratios (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which can be sensitive as the small ratio in the numerator changes with the conserved synteny definition. An alternative explanation is that as the synteny criterion becomes stricter, genes that satisfy it could be under stronger evolutionary constraints and therefore less likely to diverge. For both reasons, we recommend avoiding the application of stringent conserved synteny criteria when undertaking similar analyses, although ultimately the choice depends on the evolutionary distance and the more general degree of synteny conservation between the species being compared.</p><p>We also applied the same reasoning to estimate how much divergence beyond recognition contributes to TRGs. To this aim we calculated the fraction of focal genes lacking detectable homologues in a phylogeny-based manner, in the target species and in all species more distantly related to the focal species than the target species (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref> for a schematic explanation). Again, the observed proportion of TRGs far exceeded that estimated to have originated by divergence (the contribution of divergence ranging from 0% to 52% corresponding to the first and before-last ‘phylostratum’ of the fly dataset tree respectively, with an overall average of 30%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B C</xref>). Changing the conserved synteny definition impacted the proportions of TRGs explained by divergence similarly to what was seen in the pairwise case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We estimate that the proportion of TRGs which originated by divergence-beyond-recognition, at the level of Saccharomyces, melanogaster subgroup, and primates are at most 45%, 20% and 24%, respectively (Materials and methods). Thus, we conclude that the origin of most genes without similarity cannot be attributed to divergence beyond recognition.

Our approach identified thirteen human genes that underwent complete divergence along the human lineage and have no detectable homologues outside of mammals (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>).

It is curious that three out of three of these genes are associated with disease, two of which with cancer, although the small number prevents us from drawing conclusions.

Studies in the past 20 years have mainly pointed to two mechanisms: de novo gene emergence and sequence divergence of a pre-existing gene, either an ancestrally present or one acquired by horizontal transfer. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms have remained elusive until now. Here, we have specifically addressed this problem and demonstrated that sequence divergence of ancestral genes explains only a minority of orphans and TRGs.</p><p>We were very conservative when estimating the proportion of orphans and TRGs that have evolved by complete divergence inside regions of conserved micro-synteny. Indeed, we simultaneously underestimated the number of orphans and TRGs while overestimating the number that originated by divergence. We underestimated the total number of orphans and TRGs by relying on relaxed similarity search parameters. As a result, we can be confident that those genes without detectable similarity really are orphans and TRGs, but in turn we also know that some will have spurious similarity hits giving the illusion that they have homologues when they do not in reality. Furthermore, the annotation that we used in yeast does not include the vast majority of dubious ORFs, labelled as such because they are not evolutionarily conserved even though most are supported by experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We overestimated the number of genes that have undergone complete divergence by assuming that all genes in conserved micro-synteny regions share common ancestry. There are however limitations in using synteny to approximate common descent. First, with time, genome rearrangements shuffle genes around and synteny is lost. This means that when comparing distantly related species, the synteny signal will be more tenuous and eventually completely lost. Second, combinations of evolutionary events can place non-homologous genes in directly syntenic positions. Loss of a gene in a lineage followed by tandem duplication of a neighbouring gene, translocation of a distant one, or de novo emergence, could potentially contribute to placing in syntenic positions pairs of genes that are not in fact homologous. As such, the results of our pipeline can be viewed as an upper bound estimate of the true rate of divergence beyond recognition.</p><p>Previous efforts to measure the rate of complete divergence beyond recognition have done so using simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vakirlis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albà and Castresana, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyers and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain et al., 2019</xref>), within a different context and with different goals, mainly to measure ‘BLAST error’. Interestingly, our estimates are of the same order of magnitude as previous results from simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyers and Zhang, 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, using the term ‘BLAST error’ or talking about ‘false negatives’ would be epistemologically incorrect in our case. When focusing on the outcome of divergence itself, it is clear that once all sequence similarity has been erased by divergence, BLAST, a <italic>similarity</italic> search tool, should not be expected to detect any.</p><p>Simulation-based studies have been valuable in quantifying the link between evolutionary distance and absence of sequence similarity. They are however limited in that they can only show that sequence divergence <italic>could</italic> explain a certain proportion of orphans and TRGs, not that it actually <italic>does</italic> explain it. Making the jump from ‘could’ to ‘does’ requires the assumption that divergence beyond recognition is much more plausible than, for example, de novo emergence. This is a prior probability which, currently, is at best uncertain. Our approach, on the other hand, does not make assumptions with respect to the evolutionary mechanisms at play, that is we do not need prior knowledge of the prevalence of divergence beyond recognition to obtain an estimate.</p><p>Many studies have previously reported that genes without detectable homologues tended to be shorter than conserved ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wissler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Toll-Riera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ekman and Elofsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palmieri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vakirlis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalturin et al., 2009</xref>). This relationship has been interpreted as evidence that young genes can arise de novo from short open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLysaght and Guerzoni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siepel, 2009</xref>) but also as the result of a bias due to short genes having higher evolutionary rates, which may explain why their homologues are hard to find (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moyers and Zhang, 2017</xref>). Our results enable another view of these correlations of evolutionary rate, gene age and gene length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tautz and Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albà and Castresana, 2005</xref>). We have shown that an event akin to incomplete pseudogenization could be taking place, wherein a gene loses functionality through some disruption, thus triggering rapid divergence due to absence of constraint. After a period of evolutionary ‘free fall' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>), this would eventually lead to an entirely novel sequence. If this is correct, then it could explain why some short genes, presenting as young, evolve faster.</p><p>Disentangling complete divergence from other processes of orphan and TRG origination is non-trivial and requires laborious manual inspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prabh and Rödelsperger, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Our approach allowed us to explicitly show that divergence can produce homologous genes that lack detectable similarity and to estimate the rate at which this takes place. We are able to isolate and examine these genes when they are found in conserved micro-synteny regions, but at this point we have only a statistical global view of the process of divergence outside of these regions. Since, for example, in yeast and in Arabidopsis,~50% of orphan genes are located outside of syntenic regions of near relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendsee et al., 2019</xref>), the study of their evolutionary origins represents exciting challenges for future work. Why do genes in yeast and fly appear to reach the ‘twilight zone’ of sequence similarity considerably faster than human? One potential explanation is an effect of generation time and/or population size on evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Palumbi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bromham and Penny, 2003</xref>) and thereby on the process of complete divergence.</p><p>Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that multiple evolutionary processes are responsible for the existence of orphan genes and suggest that, contrary to what has been assumed, divergence is not the predominant one. Investigating the structure, molecular role, and phenotypes of homologues in the ‘twilight zone’ will be crucial to understand how changes in sequence and structure produce evolutionary novelty.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All data and scripts necessary to reproduce all figures and analyses are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019">https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vakirlis, 2020</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019">copy archived at </ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019</ext-link>).

For each focal protein-coding gene, if it does not overlap more than 80% with either its +1 or −1 neighbour, we retrieve the homologues of its +1,+2 and −1,–2 neighbours in the target genome, from the list established previously with OrthoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kriventseva et al., 2008</xref>). We then examine every pair-wise combination of the +1,+2 and −1,–2 homologues and identify cases were the +1,–1 homologues are on the same chromosome and are separated by either one or two protein-coding genes. Out of these candidates, we only keep those for which, if it exists, the homologue of the −2 neighbour is adjacent or separated by one gene from the homologue of the −1 neighbour, and the homologue of the +two neighbour, if it exists, is adjacent or separated by one gene from the homologue of the +one neighbour. We further filter out all cases for which the homologues of +1 and −1 belong in the same OrthoDB group, that is they appear to be paralogues. The intervening gene(s) 'opposite' the focal gene (between the homologues of its −1 and +one neighbours) are stored in a list. The specific choice of synteny criterion was made after we conducted an initial trial with a minimum of one homologue on either side, which showed limited false positives, revealed by visual inspection (obvious cases of non-homologous genes which, due to rearrangements such as micro-inversions were placed ‘opposite’ each other, even though they did not originate by divergence). One of these false positives was the well-studied de novo yeast gene <italic>BSC4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2008</xref>). Requiring the additional syntenic homologous gene on both sides (when the homologues exist), provided a balanced solution: it removed the <italic>BSC4</italic> gene along with all other identified similar cases, again verified by extensive visual inspection and comparison to other genomic synteny resources (ENSEMBL, Yeast Gene Order Browser), while retaining a number of conserved micro-syntenic regions that was high enough to allow us to perform our analyses. To explore the impact of the synteny definition on our main finding, namely that divergence accounts for a minority of orphan genes, we replicated the analysis using one more relaxed and one more stringent synteny criterion. The relaxed definition considered only one syntenic homologue on either side, with no examination of the homologues of the −2,+2 neighbors. The stringent definition added an additional syntenic homologue to either side relative to the current one: three genes on either side need to have syntenic homologues that are separated by one gene at most and, again, we retain cases where the outer neighbors (−3,+3) have no homologues at all to the target genome.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Identification of similarity:</italic> Once all the focal genes for which a region of conserved micro-synteny has been identified have been collected for a focal-target genome pair, we test whether similarity can be detected at a given E-value threshold. First, we look at whether a precomputed (previously, by us, whole proteome-proteome comparison) BLASTp match exists between the translated focal gene and the its translated ‘opposite’ genes (taking into account all translated isoforms), where we predict the match should be found most of the time. If no match exists at the amino acid level there, we perform a TBLASTN search with default parameters, using the focal gene as query and the genomic region of the ‘opposite’ gene plus the 2 kb flanking regions as target. The search is repeated using the reversed genomic region as target. If no match is found, we look whether a BLASTP match exists to any translated gene of the target genome. Finally, for the genes for which no similarity has been detected, we perform a TBLASTN search against the entire genome of the target species. This final TBLASTN step is not included in the setting of the optimal E-value and a fixed E-value threshold of 10<sup>−6</sup> is used.</p></list-item></list><p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; relevant scripts: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019/blob/master/scripts/Figure3A.R">Figure3A.R</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019/blob/master/scripts/Figure3B_4_fig2-supp1.R">Figure3B_4_fig2-supp1.R</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Calculation of undetectable and false homologies and definition of optimal E-values</title><p>For every focal-target pair and for every E-value cut-off, the proportions of focal genes with at least one identified region of conserved micro-synteny for which a match was found ‘opposite’ or elsewhere in the genome were calculated. The remaining proportion, that is those with conserved micro-synteny but no match, constitutes the percentage of putative undetectable homologies. To estimate the ‘false homologies’, we calculated the proportion of the focal proteome that had a BLASTp match to the reversed target proteome, or to their corresponding reversed syntenic genomic region for the ones with identified micro-synteny (see step 4 of previous section). Based on these proportions, we chose the highest value limiting ‘false homologies’ to 0.05 for our analyses.</p><p>We also calculated the Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure of binary classification accuracy for every E-value cut-off. This is a balanced measure that takes into account true and false positives and negatives which can be used even in cases of extensive class imbalance. At every E-value cut-off, we treated undetectable homologies as False Negatives, and false homologies (matches to the reversed proteome) as False Positives. Similarly, sequence-detected homologies (defined based on micro-synteny) were treated as True Positives and genes for which the reversed-search gave no significant hit were treated as True Negatives. The MCC measure was then calculated at each E-value cut-off based on these four values using the <italic>mcc</italic> function of R package mltools.

The pairwise approach is calculated as follows (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for a schematic explanation): an <italic>X</italic> number of the total <italic>n</italic> of focal genes will have no similarity with the target, based on a BLASTP search of the target’s proteome using the corresponding optimal E-value cut-off and a TBLASTN search of the target’s genome with an E-value cut-off of 10<sup>−6</sup>. We have also estimated the proportion <italic>d</italic> of total genes that have lost similarity due to divergence. This was calculated over genes in conserved micro-synteny but we assume that it can be used as a proxy for the entire genome since presence in a conserved micro-syntenic region does not significantly impact evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By calculating the ratio of <italic>d</italic> over <italic>X</italic>/<italic>n</italic> we can obtain the contribution of divergence to the total genes without similarity. Note that, for this calculation to be unbiased, <italic>d</italic> here is based on the same similarity searches used to define <italic>X</italic> (i.e. it does not include the local TBLASTN search shown in step 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The phylogeny-based approach is performed as follows: for a given ‘phylostratum’ (a given ancestral branch of the focal species), we estimate the proportion of genes restricted to this phylostratum due to divergence, again calculated over genes in conserved micro-synteny and extrapolated to all genes as in the pairwise case. This is done by taking the number of genes restricted to the phylostratum (TRGs, i.e. those for which the phylogenetically farthest species with a sequence similarity match falls within the subtree defined by the phylostratum) that have a putative undetectable homologue (based on micro-synteny) in at least one lineage outside of that phylostratum, and dividing them by the number of all genes that are predicted to have a homologue (based on micro-synteny) in at least one lineage outside the phylostratum. In other words, the proportion out of all genes with at least one micro-synteny conserved region, and thus a putative homologue, with a species outside the phylostratum, that are restricted, based on sequence similarity, within the specific phylostratum. As in the pairwise case, this proportion is compared to the proportion calculated based on sequence similarity alone out of all genes, meaning the proportion of TRGs for a given phylostratum, out of all genes.</p><p>The proportion of TRGs that we predict can be explained by divergence at the phylostrata of Saccharomyces (<italic>S. kudriavzevii</italic>, <italic>S. arboricola</italic>), melanogaster subgroup (<italic>D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae</italic>) and primates (<italic>P. trogrolydes, G. gorilla</italic>) is obtained by the phylogeny-based approach described above, at the phylostrata with branches of origin at 15, 37 and 9 million years ago respectively.</p><p>Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>; relevant scripts: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019/blob/master/scripts/Figure6_fig6-supp2.R">Figure6_fig6-supp2.R</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019/blob/master/scripts/Figure6-supp3.R">Figure6-supp3.R</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Nikos22/Vakirlis_Carvunis_McLysaght_2019/blob/master/scripts/Figure_5_7_8.R">Figure_5_7_8.R</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein and CDS properties</title><p>Pfam matches were predicted using <italic>PfamScan.pl</italic> to search protein sequences against a local Pfam-A database downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam">ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eddy, 2011</xref>).

substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>When the first orphan genes were discovered in the yeast genome project, there was a discussion that suggested that genes that do not match with other genes in the database would become fewer over time, once the databases are better filled. Now the databases are filled, but orphan genes are still identified in every evolutionary lineage. Hence, the discussion turned into the assumption that this is due to a lack of sensitivity of detecting remote homologues and that better algorithms need to be devised. Vakirlis et al. now argue that a careful analysis of syntenic genome stretches allows to distinguish between fast sequence divergence beyond recognition and de novo evolution out of non-coding stretches of DNA. By running this comparison in three major evolutionary lineages, they show that only about a third of the genes may be orphans due to rapid divergence, while the remainder are likely truly newly evolved orphan genes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

To my knowledge this is the first study entirely focused on this question which is essential for understanding which mechanism (divergence or de novo route) prevails in creating evolutionary innovations at the genome/proteome level. The authors devised a very neat protocol that detects conserved synteny regions between species and then looks for proteins that lack sequence similarity in the target genome but are otherwise embedded within these conserved synteny regions. By extrapolating the findings from the conserved synteny regions to the whole genome the authors conclude that divergence mechanism accounts for at most a third of eukaryotic novel genes.</p><p>1) Subsection “Selecting optimal BLAST E-value cut-offs”, Figure 3A – It is really elegant how the authors estimated the proportion of false positive and false negative homologues. From their figures it is clear that the proportion of false positives changes quite differently from the proportion of false negatives depending on the e-value. The authors mention this in the text, but they don't discuss that controlling of false positives is more critical when deciding on the appropriate e-value cutoffs. This is evident from the shape of the Figure 3A curves, where false negatives show linear-like dependence and false positives exponential-like dependence, plus the false positive curves are not dependent on the evolutionary distance. In practice, this means that failing to properly control for false positives would generate spurious sequence similarity hits all over the place, whereas not perfectly adjusted e-value would not have a such profound effect on false negatives, especially in the phylogenetic context.</p><p>2) Linked to the previous comment: The authors discuss the BLAST &quot;false negatives&quot; debate but miss the balance by omitting to cite Domazet-Loso et al., 2017 paper which stresses the importance of evaluating BLAST &quot;false positives&quot;. Given that the manuscript specifically deals with the false positives this paper should be cited.</p><p>3) Subsection “Calculation of undetectable and false homologies and definition of optimal E-values” – I had problems to understand how Mathews Correlation Coefficient was used to decide on the E-value cut-off.

Could you please make some schematic representation of this part of the protocol?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have made a comprehensive attempt to quantify the contribution of sequence divergence as a source of orphan genes. They have ingeniously used micro-synteny to identify the orphan genes created by divergence. They estimate that at most one-third of the genes within the micro-syntenic regions result from sequence divergence. Subsequently, they extrapolate this result to the entire genome and conclude that the majority of orphan genes are not formed through sequence divergence. Although several studies have investigated orphan genes in various organisms, the relative contribution of processes such as de novo gene creation and sequence divergence in the formation of orphan genes remains largely unexplored. Hence, I consider that this work can significantly contribute to the progress of the field.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>The authors assume that the similar distribution of evolutionary rates within and outside the syntenic blocks indicates that the proportion of orphan genes created through sequence divergence within the syntenic block can be extrapolated to the whole genome (Subsection “The rate of “divergence beyond recognition” and its contribution to the total pool of genes without similarity” paragraph 2). Given that the evolutionary rates cannot be estimated for the orphan genes lacking detectable homologs, the assumption made by the authors about the comparability of evolutionary rates across the genome is most likely based on a dataset that excludes such genes. Thus, their argument, although correct for the overall distribution of evolutionary rates, should not be used to extrapolate the proportion of orphan genes originated by divergence within the syntenic blocks to the whole genome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Orphan genes are an exciting addition to our understanding of speciation and adaptation of organisms to new environments. This research represents a unique and important approach to validate that rapidly-changing genes exist. The manuscript is well-written and clearly presents a very complex set of concepts.</p><p>The authors did something new. Rather than assuming (as many have done, but with no basis for this assumption) that any orphan gene that cannot positively be IDed as de novo is &quot;rapidly changing divergent duplicates&quot; the research in this manuscript take the opposite tact, and directly IDs the orphans genes that have arisen by rapid evolution. Indeed, this manuscript is the best evidence for orphans that arose via a &quot; rapidly changing divergent duplicate gene mechanism&quot;.</p><p>Providing positive evidence for the set of genes that have rapidly diverged is particularly important because it opens the path for researchers to explore the mechanisms whereby particular genes can evolve so much more quickly than the typical gene.</p><p>The table with the abbreviations (e.g., ggor) should be moved from supplementary to the main text. That way the reader doesn't need to access supplementary to understand Figure 6.</p><p>In both yeast and Arabidopsis, ~50% of orphan genes are NOT located in (micro) syntenic regions of near relatives (Arendsee et al., 2019). These genes (and how they arose) are really interesting as well.

Only one reviewer has some small concerns and this review is provided in full below. Given that you had already indicated in your response letter that this issue is minor, we would hope that you can easily integrate this into your manuscript and that no further reviewing will be necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have made a sincere effort to highlight the caveats of their method and adjusted their manuscript as requested by the reviewers. The only remaining concern I have is with the formula used to calculate the contribution of divergence (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). It’s a ratio of two ratios. The numerator is the ratio of orphan genes to all genes within the syntenic blocks, and the denominator is the ratio of orphan genes to all genes across the genome. Here, the criterion to define a syntenic block is pivotal, and to ensure that false positives are excluded the authors limit the block to minimum two homologues on either side of the focal gene separated by either one or two genes. This criterion leaves the majority of genes outside the syntenic blocks in all pairwise comparisons, especially the &quot;match not found&quot; genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—source data 3: Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The authors accept that the proportion of orphan genes within the syntenic blocks decreases as the criterion is made more stringent. They suggest this is because a lesser number of genes were found within the syntenic regions, but the indicated change in the proportion of orphan genes suggests that as more genes are included within syntenic blocks, the proportion of orphan genes within the blocks rises. This is quite intuitive because in many pairwise comparisons (19/48) the number of &quot;match not found&quot; within syntenic blocks is in single-digit and can potentially increase many folds by the mere addition of few more genes (Supplementary Table: Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Thus, with more relaxed criteria, the calculated divergence contribution will increase as higher fractions of orphan genes are included within syntenic blocks, but the total fraction of orphan genes does not change. Here, the compatibility of the evolutionary rates within and outside the blocks can still be maintained, while the calculated contribution made by divergence will vary.</p><p>In the rebuttal, the authors write:</p><p>&quot;Note that, although, as expected, stricter synteny criteria led to fewer genes being found in conserved micro-syntenic blocks, overall results changed minimally between the two versions and hence can be considered robust.&quot;</p><p>It has to be clearly shown, that increasing the stringency of the synteny criterion does not specifically exclude &quot;match not found&quot; genes and their proportion within the syntenic blocks is not a function of this criterion. The authors are advised to make this clarification within the manuscript before making genome level extrapolation. The method established by the authors is robust, and certainly, it will be extensively used in the future. However, the formula used for the genome-level extrapolation appears extremely sensitive to the synteny criterion, unless shown otherwise. Given that the authors have data supporting that synteny criterion does not affect the overall result, they should show it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53500.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart of this, the reviewers were mostly positive, although some critical issues need close attention.

It should be moved to supplementary material (with the updates suggested by Tomi).</p></disp-quote><p>While we understand the reason for this comment (the same idea has indeed been explored in the past) we feel that this approach is novel in methodology and in phylogenetic space. Additionally, reviewer #1 found this part interesting and “elegant” and requested that we discuss the impact of false positives compared to false negatives some more. To balance these different viewpoints, we have significantly shortened the relevant section of the manuscript and made the novelty more evident. We note that it is particularly interesting that, with our updated methodology and expanded species comparisons, we arrive at similar conclusions as past efforts, including those of this reviewer.</p><p>Here is the updated text from the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Homology detection is highly sensitive to the technical choices made during sequence similarity searches7,27. We therefore sought to explore how the choice of E-value threshold would impact interpretations of divergence beyond similarity. First, we performed BLASTP searches of the focal species’ total protein sequences against the total reversed protein sequences of each target species. Matches produced in these searches can safely be considered “false homologies” since biological sequences do not evolve by reversal28 (see Materials and methods). These false homologies were then compared to “undetectable homologies”: cases with conserved micro-synteny (presumed homologues) but without any detectable sequence similarity. In Figure 3A, we can see how the ratios of undetectable and false homologies vary as a function of the BLAST E-value threshold used. The proportion of undetectable homologies depended quasi-linearly on the E-value cut-off. By contrast, false homologies depended exponentially on the cut-off, as expected from the E-value definition. Furthermore, the impact of E-value cut-off was more pronounced in comparisons of species separated by longer evolutionary distances, whereas it was almost non-existent for comparisons amongst the most closely related species. Conversely, there seems to be no dependence between percentage of false homologies and evolutionary time across the range of E-values that we have tested (all lines overlap in the graphs in the bottom panel of Figure 3A). This means that, when comparing relatively closely related species, failing to appropriately control for false homologies would have an overall more severe effect on homology detection than failing to account for false negatives. In the context of phylostratigraphy (estimation of phylogenetic branch of origin of a gene based on its taxonomic distribution29), gene age underestimation due to BLAST “false negatives” has been considered a serious issue30, although the importance of spurious BLAST hits generating false positives has also been stressed31. We defined a set of E-value cut-offs optimised for phylostratigraphy, by choosing the highest E-value that keeps false homologies under 5%. This strategy emphasizes sensitivity over specificity. We have also calculated general-use optimal E-values by using a balanced binary classification measure (see Materials and methods). The phylostratigraphy optimal E-value thresholds are 0.01 for all comparisons using yeast and fly as focal species and 0.001 for those of human, except for chimpanzee (10-4). These are close to previously estimated optimal E-value cut-offs for identifying orphan genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, found in the range of 10-3 – 10-5, see ref 32. These cut-offs have been used for all downstream analyses. We find that, for the vast majority of focal genes examined that do have matches, the match occurs in the predicted region (“opposite”), i.e., within the region of conserved micro-synteny. In 36/48 pair-wise species comparisons, at least 90% of the focal genes in micro-synteny for which at least one match was eventually found in the target genome, a match was within the predicted micro-syntenic region (Figure 3B). This finding supports the soundness of our synteny-based approach for homologue identification.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;(we find no, or very limited, difference in evolutionary rate between the two groups in terms of dN, dS, dN/dS; see Materials and methods and Supp Figure 4).&quot; – this is a key statement that needs to be properly presented in the text, including appropriate statistics. To make it valid, it would have to consider the possibility of different rates in different pairwise comparisons. (See also the comments by reviewer #2)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important remark. Detailed statistics including effect sizes and better presentation of the results of evolutionary rate comparisons have now been added to the main text of the revised manuscript (Figure 5). We have added the following text:</p><p>“We calculated the non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates of genes found inside and outside regions of conserved micro-synteny relative to closely related species (Materials and methods). […] Despite these minimal caveats, evolutionary rates are globally very similar inside and outside regions of conserved micro-synteny, allowing to extrapolate with confidence.”</p><p>We were not entirely sure what the reviewers mean in the clause “consider the possibility of different rates in different pairwise comparisons.”. We interpreted it as a concern over evolutionary rates varying across the different focal-target pairwise species comparisons and therefore not being captured by our dN and dS calculations. If this is an accurate interpretation of the comment, we would like to reassure the reviewer that, even if such a difference existed, it would not affect the comparison of rates of genes inside and outside of conserved syntenic blocks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We therefore searched ENSEMBL and UniProt for phenotypes and involvement in</p><p>disease for the ten genes within micro-synteny regions that we predict originated through complete divergence along the human lineage&quot; – this is a standard orphan gene search, unclear what it adds to the message in the present paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. The way this was written in our original submitted manuscript did not make sufficiently clear the motivation and purpose of the search. The point of this analysis is not a general scan of UniProt and ENSEMBL, but rather a search for how the specific taxonomically restricted genes that have arisen in the human lineage through complete sequence divergence impact human biology, and especially evidence of involvement in disease. Since it has been reported that human novel genes in general are often associated to cancer and cancer outcomes, it is worth seeing whether our results seem to support previous findings or not. Since our study is the first to isolate novel genes that have evolved by complete divergence, this is the first look at the function of these genes in the human lineage. We have now rephrased the relevant part of the manuscript to clarify this point:</p><p>“Finally, we investigated how orphan genes that have originated by divergence beyond recognition might impact human biology. Our approach identified thirteen human genes that underwent complete divergence along the human lineage and have no detectable homologues outside of mammals (see Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Examining the ENSEMBL and UniProt resources revealed that three of these thirteen genes are associated with known phenotypes. One of them is ATP-synthase membrane subunit 8 (MT-ATP8), which has been implicated with infantile cardiomyopathy40 and Kearns-Sayre syndrome41 among other diseases. The other two are both associated with cancer: DEC142 and DIRC143. It is curious that three out of three of these genes are associated with disease, two of which with cancer, although the small number prevents us from drawing conclusions. Nonetheless, this observation is consistent with previous findings showing that multiple novel human genes are associated with cancer and cancer outcomes suggesting a role for antagonistic evolution in the origin of new genes44.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We find that at most 33% of orphans and TRGs have possibly originated by complete</p><p>divergence.&quot; – it is not completely clear where this number comes from. It needs to be properly justified, given that it is the key message of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this insufficiency. This figure (which in the revised manuscript has dropped to 30% due to removal of <italic>C. elegans</italic>) is the average proportion, across the three datasets, of TRGs originated through divergence as estimated by our most stringent phylogeny-aware approach. We have now removed this discussion phrase from our revised manuscript; instead, the exact manner how the average proportion is calculated can be found with the appropriate context in the Results section.:</p><p>“We also applied the same reasoning to estimate how much divergence beyond recognition contributes to TRGs. To this aim we calculated the fraction of focal genes lacking detectable homologues in a phylogeny-based manner, in the target species and in all species more distantly related to the focal species than the target species (see Materials and methods and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A for a schematic explanation). Again, the observed proportion of TRGs far exceeded that estimated to have originated by divergence (the contribution of divergence ranging from 0% to 52% corresponding to the first and before-last “phylostratum” of the fly dataset tree respectively, with an overall average of 30%; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>This is important work that tries to estimate relative contribution of sequence divergence in the origin of novel genes (also known as orphan genes or taxonomically restricted genes).

At every E-value cut-off, we treated undetectable homologies as False Negatives, and false homologies (matches to the reversed proteome) as False Positives. Similarly, sequence-detected homologies (defined based on micro-synteny) were treated as True Positives and genes for which the reversed-search gave no significant hit were treated as True Negatives. The MCC measure was then calculated at each E-value cut-off based on these four values using the <italic>mcc</italic> function of R package mltools. When multiple E-value cut-offs had the same MCC (rounded at the 3rd decimal), the highest (less stringent) E-value was retained. The results for each focal-target genome pair are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (“general E-value” column).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “The rate of “divergence beyond recognition” and its contribution to the</p><p>total pool of genes without similarity” – Presentation of the results in Figure 4B and 4C (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) is quite confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

They have ingeniously used micro-synteny to identify the orphan genes created by divergence. They estimate that at most one-third of the genes within the micro-syntenic regions result from sequence divergence. Subsequently, they extrapolate this result to the entire genome and conclude that the majority of orphan genes are not formed through sequence divergence. Although several studies have investigated orphan genes in various organisms, the relative contribution of processes such as</italic> de novo <italic>gene creation and sequence divergence in the formation of orphan genes remains largely unexplored. Hence, I consider that this work can significantly contribute to the progress of the field.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concern:</p><p>The authors assume that the similar distribution of evolutionary rates within and outside the syntenic blocks indicates that the proportion of orphan genes created through sequence divergence within the syntenic block can be extrapolated to the whole genome (Subsection “The rate of “divergence beyond recognition” and its contribution to the total pool of genes without similarity” paragraph 2). Given that the evolutionary rates cannot be estimated for the orphan genes lacking detectable homologs, the assumption made by the authors about the comparability of evolutionary rates across the genome is most likely based on a dataset that excludes such genes. Thus, their argument, although correct for the overall distribution of evolutionary rates, should not be used to extrapolate the proportion of orphan genes originated by divergence within the syntenic blocks to the whole genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful remark. Indeed, in our comparison of evolutionary rates inside and outside of syntenic blocks, orphan genes are not included, as it is impossible to do so. We wholeheartedly agree that is important to make this fact clear to the reader and explain its consequences for the conclusions of the article. Yet, while this is undoubtedly a caveat of our approach, it is crucial to understand that it is only a minor one.</p><p>We estimated the extent of the issue and found that the TRGs at the relevant phylogenetic levels only account for 0.0013, 0.008 and 0.029 of all genes in fruit fly, human and yeast respectively. This means that there is only a tiny fraction of the total information of genome-wide evolutionary rates not incorporated in the comparisons. Any effect of such a small percentage of genes can only be very limited. Yes, we cannot categorically reject the notion that, for this small fraction of genes, the same mutational processes that results in loss of synteny may also somehow result in more TRGs (although we show that they do not result in higher evolutionary rates in other genes). We therefore acknowledge this as a minor caveat of our methodology.</p><p>We now properly introduce this caveat when presenting the comparison of the evolutionary rates:</p><p>“It is impossible to directly compare the evolutionary rates of genes lacking homologues inside and outside conserved micro-synteny. However, such genes only account for a miniscule percentage of all genes in the genome: 0.0013, 0.008 and 0.029 in fly, human and yeast respectively. Despite these minimal caveats, evolutionary rates are globally very similar inside and outside regions of conserved micro-synteny, allowing to extrapolate with confidence”</p><p>We have also specified in all appropriate places in the revised manuscript that the extrapolation is approximative:</p><p>• In the schematic representation of the pipeline in Figure 2: “approximately extrapolated”.</p><p>• In the subsection “A synteny-based approach to establish homology beyond sequence similarity”: “This estimate can then be extrapolated genome-wide to approximate the extent of origin by complete divergence for orphan genes and TRGs outside of syntenic regions”.</p><p>• In the subsection “The rate of divergence beyond recognition and its contribution to the total pool of genes without similarity”: “can be used as a proxy for the genome-wide rate of origin-by-divergence for genes without detectable similarity”</p><p>• In the legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 2: “can be approximately extrapolated genome-wide”</p><p>In summary, thanks to the reviewer’s remark, we have taken great care to adjust the language around the extrapolation, to make evident in our revised manuscript that it is an approximation. We would like to stress that, since this is a novel solution to a hard, hitherto unsolved problem, this approximation still has much value despite certain caveats. Hence, we believe that, framed appropriately as in the revised manuscript, the extrapolation can and should be used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Providing positive evidence for the set of genes that have rapidly diverged is particularly important because it opens the path for researchers to explore the mechanisms whereby particular genes can evolve so much more quickly than the typical gene.</p><p>The table with the abbreviations (e.g., ggor) should be moved from supplementary to the main text.

They suggest this is because a lesser number of genes were found within the syntenic regions (Rebuttal: Reviewer 2, Minor comment 3), but the indicated change in the proportion of orphan genes suggests that as more genes are included within syntenic blocks, the proportion of orphan genes within the blocks rises. This is quite intuitive because in many pairwise comparisons (19/48) the number of &quot;match not found&quot; within syntenic blocks is in single-digit and can potentially increase many folds by the mere addition of few more genes (Supplementary Table: Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Thus, with more relaxed criteria, the calculated divergence contribution will increase as higher fractions of orphan genes are included within syntenic blocks, but the total fraction of orphan genes does not change. Here, the compatibility of the evolutionary rates within and outside the blocks can still be maintained, while the calculated contribution made by divergence will vary.</p><p>In the rebuttal, the authors write:</p><p>&quot;Note that, although, as expected, stricter synteny criteria led to fewer genes being found in conserved micro-syntenic blocks, overall results changed minimally between the two versions and hence can be considered robust.&quot;</p><p>It has to be clearly shown, that increasing the stringency of the synteny criterion does not specifically exclude &quot;match not found&quot; genes and their proportion within the syntenic blocks is not a function of this criterion. The authors are advised to make this clarification within the manuscript before making genome level extrapolation. The method established by the authors is robust, and certainly, it will be extensively used in the future. However, the formula used for the genome-level extrapolation appears extremely sensitive to the synteny criterion, unless shown otherwise. Given that the authors have data supporting that synteny criterion does not affect the overall result, they should show it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their in-depth analysis of this aspect of our work. Clearly, the reviewer has perfectly understood the methodological details and has laid out a potential problem that could affect the main finding of our manuscript. We wholeheartedly agree that it is important that the reader and any future adopters of this method understand the relationship of the synteny criterion to the proportion explained by divergence. In order to be as exhaustive as possible, we performed additional analyses using one more relaxed and one more stringent conserved synteny definition. Our results clearly show that relaxing the synteny definition compared to the one we used in the study has only minimal impact on the proportion explained by divergence, despite allowing some known false positives and raising the number of conserved synteny regions almost by a factor of two. Using the even more stringent definition was problematic because in many cases the number of identified regions was too low to allow further analyses. Hence such a definition would be impractical for our study. Nevertheless, analysis of a subset of cases where the number of identified regions was sufficient, showed a larger impact than in the previous comparison (relaxed vs. the one used in the study) which was nonetheless still not dramatic.</p><p>We now mention these results in our Results section and include details in the legend of a new supplementary figure:</p><p><bold>“</bold>We extrapolated the proportion of genes without detectable similarity that have originated by complete divergence, as calculated from conserved micro-synteny blocks (Figure 4), to all genes without similarity in the genome (Figure 6, see Materials and methods and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 for detailed description). […] This implies a substantial role for other evolutionary mechanisms such as de novoemergence and horizontal gene transfer, although horizontal gene transfer is not known to be frequent in metazoa.”</p><p>We also provide methodological details in Materials and methods:</p><p>The specific choice of synteny criterion was made after we conducted an initial trial with a minimum of one homologue on either side, which showed limited false positives, revealed by visual inspection (obvious cases of non-homologous genes which, due to rearrangements such as micro-inversions were placed “opposite” each other, even though they did not originate by divergence). […] The stringent definition added an additional syntenic homologue to either side relative to the current one: three genes on either side need to have syntenic homologues that are separated by one gene at most and, again, we retain cases where the outer neighbors (-3,+3) have no homologues at all to the target genome.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
