RESOLFT nanoscopy is particularly suited for live cell imaging because it requires relatively low light levels to overcome the diffraction barrier. Previously, we introduced the reversibly switchable fluorescent protein rsEGFP2, which facilitated fast RESOLFT nanoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, as in most other nanoscopy studies, only cultivated single cells were analyzed. Here, we report on the use of rsEGFP2 for live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy of sub-cellular structures of intact <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae and of resected tissues. We generated flies expressing fusion proteins of alpha-tubulin and rsEGFP2 highlighting the microtubule cytoskeleton in all cells. By focusing through the intact larval cuticle, we achieved lateral resolution of &lt;60 nm.

Still, entire research fields such as those focusing on the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have been reluctant in adapting live-cell nanoscopy. Indeed, nanoscopy of thick specimen is mostly performed on optically transparent samples such as cleared and fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Stelzer, 2015</xref>). The relatively few reported examples of nanoscopy in living tissues typically relied on specimen in which individual cells overexpressed a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nägerl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chéreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berning et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Testa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tønnesen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To overcome this shortcoming, we previously reported the generation of rsEGFP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>), a very photostable reversibly switchable fluorescent protein (RSFP). The green fluorescent rsEGFP2 can be reversible photo-switched between a fluorescent 'On-' and a non-fluorescent 'Off-'state with light of ~405 nm and ~488 nm. rsEGFP2 was designed to be used within the framework of live-cell RESOLFT (reversible saturable optical fluorescence transition) nanoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brakemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>). In its initial application, however, rsEGFP2 was only used to study sub-cellular dynamics in single-layered cultivated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hell, 2009</xref>), in RESOLFT nanoscopy, a light pattern such as a 'doughnut' featuring an intensity zero at is center is scanned across the sample. Several variations of RESOLFT microscopy have been established, including single-beam and parallelized scanning approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brakemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chmyrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>). The RESOLFT principle using RSFPs has also been extended to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy (PA NL-SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoyer et al., 2016</xref>). In RESOLFT, the scanned light pattern typically induces the transition into the Off-state, so that the On-state molecules are confined to a sub-diffraction volume. RESOLFT nanoscopy stands out from all other far-field super-resolution microscopies that overcome the diffraction barrier by the relatively low light dose that is required to achieve nanoscale resolution. The light intensities used are up to six orders of magnitude lower than those in STED-microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klar et al., 2000</xref>) and are comparable to those typically applied in live-cell confocal fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wäldchen et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, the total light dose impinging on the sample is lower by 3–4 orders of magnitude compared to stochastic single-molecule based nanoscopy approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, when implemented in a beam scanning approach, RESOLFT can be combined with confocal detection, which is particularly suitable for the imaging of highly fluorescent tissues because it rejects the out-of-focus fluorescence. Altogether, this suggests that RESOLFT microscopy is particularly suitable for live-cell imaging of complex samples such as tissues.</p><p>Still, to our knowledge, neither RESOLFT nor any other diffraction-unlimited super-resolution microscopy approach has so far been used to image subcellular details in living transgenic animals ubiquitously expressing a fusion protein. In this study we demonstrate live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy on living transgenic fly tissues and intact larvae whose microtubule network was labelled in all cells by ubiquitously expressing rsEGFP2 fused to α-tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of transgenic flies expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin</title><p>In order to enable RESOLFT nanoscopy of living <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we generated flies expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin ubiquitously under the transcriptional control of the ubiquitin 68E promotor ensuring moderate expression levels of the fusion protein. Confocal images of resected tissues from transgenic adult flies revealed a large variation of the arrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–J</xref>). At 25°C, the half-time of the life span of these flies was ~41 days, similar to the isogenic wild type strain. The flies were propagated for more than 50 generations without detecting any loss in fitness. The fact that even during oogenesis and spermatogenesis the microtubule network was labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) suggests no adverse effects of the ubiquitous expression of rsEGFP2-α-tubulin on the embryogenesis and demonstrates the versatility of rsEGFP2 as a live-cell label. Western blots of larval protein extracts probed with antiserum against α-tubulin demonstrated that the fusion protein was expressed at moderate levels, so that the ratio of endogenous α-tubulin to rsEGFP2-α-tubulin was about 3:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15567.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ubiquitously expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin.</title><p>Confocal recordings of living resected tissues of transgenic wandering third instar larvae (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>, <bold>F</bold>–<bold>J</bold>) and of adult flies (<bold>D</bold>,<bold>E</bold>) ubiquitously expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin.

This approach excludes the occurrence of erroneous small resolution values, which otherwise may arise from statistical outliers in the signal intensity of individual pixels. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these line profiles was determined by fitting a Lorentz curve to the measured data. The FWHM values were consistently around 50–60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which represents an ~4-fold improvement over the diffraction limited resolution.</p><p>So far, the RESOLFT microscope was used in the 2D mode, i.e. the optical resolution was improved only in the lateral plane, whereas in the axial direction it was diffraction limited. The confocal detection allows optical sectioning of the tissue. To make use of this property, we recorded 14 RESOLFT images of resected body wall muscle tissue with 250 nm axial distance between each image. Thereby one can track individual microtubules in the tissue volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), albeit at relatively poor axial resolution. In order to track the microtubules more reliably in 3D, we replaced the 2D-doughnut by a 3D-doughnut, which confines the On-state rsEGFP2 molcules in all room directions, thus increasing the resolution along the x,y, and z-axes. Using this we imaged 33 RESOLFT images in a 2 µm thick volume element with an ~4 fold improved axial resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-15567-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15567.008</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Animation of a 3D stack recorded with a RESOLFT microscope featuring a 2D-doughnut for off-switching.</title><p>The axial resolution was diffraction limited (confocal detection).

In order to evaluate the strength of 2D-RESOLFT microscopy for imaging of sub-cellular structures buried in a highly fluorescent and scattering tissue, a wandering third instar larvae ubiquitously expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin was cut into half and the inverted front half of the larva was mounted in physiological Schneider’s cell culture medium. We equipped the microscope with a silicone oil immersion objective in order to match the refractive index of the tissue. Still, the confocal images exhibited reduced signal-to-noise ratios already at an imaging depth of 10 µm due to the pronounced scattering in the tissue. This undesirable effect strengthened with increasing imaging depths such that at an imaging depth of 42 µm the rsEGFP2-α-tubulin labeled microtubules were barely discernible when imaged in the confocal mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Using RESOLFT nanoscopy, the highest attainable resolution and the best signal-to-noise ratio were recorded in the top layer of the opened larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, also at deeper cell layers, we resolved individual microtubule filaments with a substantially better signal-to-noise ratio than in the confocal case. We attribute this advantage of RESOLFT to the beneficial effect of transferring the rsEGFP2 molecules outside of the focus to a non-fluorescent state before probing the fluorescence, thus improving the contrast. The resolution decreased with the penetration depth, but was always better than in the corresponding confocal images. Hence the RESOLFT mode allows retrieving image information deep within scattering and highly fluorescent tissue that is inaccessible by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vivo RESOLFT nanoscopy of larvae</title><p>Living intact <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are difficult samples for fluorescence microscopy, not only because of their challenging optical properties, but also because of their frequent irregular movements and the cuticle induced light scattering. Moreover, in samples that express the fusion proteins in all cells, very pronounced out-of-focus fluorescence may occur. To enable RESOLFT microscopy in intact larvae, living rsEGFP2-α-tubulin expressing second instar larvae were placed between two spacers that separated the object slide and the cover glass, forming a cavity filled with Schneider’s cell culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By this, the overall movements of the larvae were largely restrained, although movements of body muscles still occurred. For RESOLFT imaging, we focused through the intact larval cuticle into the underlying tissue without any further treatment of the larvae. Despite the occasional movements of the larvae, we could reliably record RESOLFT images of the microtubule network in these intact animals. Co-aligned microtubules that were fully blurred in the corresponding confocal images could be resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). As in resected tissues, the measured resolution in the intact larvae was also ≤60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), despite the fact that we were focusing through the opaque cuticle into tissue. We conclude that RESOLFT imaging is feasible even on living larvae expressing rsEGFP2-fusion proteins without removing the cuticle and thus leaving the larvae entirely intact.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15567.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In vivo RESOLFT imaging of intact living <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Living second instar larva expressing rsEGFP2-α-tubulin were placed under a coverslip between two spacers in Schneider’s medium.

We extended the use of rsEGFP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>) to in vivo RESOLFT imaging of tissues and larvae.</p><p>During this study we did not observe detrimental effects of the ubiquitous expression of rsEGFP2-α-tubulin fusion proteins to the flies. Importantly, we also did not observe phototoxic effects during imaging. We attribute this to the relatively low light intensities required in RESOLFT nanoscopy to overcome the diffraction barrier. Moreover, because of the utilized scanning approach, the individual irradiation times are short and consequently the overall light dose deposited in the imaged volume is small. Nonetheless, the light intensities in RESOLFT microscopy are still higher than what is sometimes regarded as critical intensity threshold in long-term imaging to follow developmental processes over hours or even days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">(Stelzer, 2015</xref>). It should be noted, however, that in in vivo RESOLFT microscopy, typically only a very small part of the sample organism is imaged, whereas the remaining parts are not illuminated. Generally, the phototoxic effects that manifest themselves after the actual experiment are irrelevant as long as the cellular dynamics during the imaging are not disturbed.</p><p>The relatively low light intensities required for RESOLFT nanoscopy and the flexibility of the method offer additional freedom in the choice between resolution and recording time: In RESOLFT nanoscopy, the attained resolution can be adjusted so that, for example, the resolution is decreased in favor of reduced phototoxicity, increased recording speed, or the number of images taken before bleaching. Although in this manuscript we only show raw image data, the RESOLFT data could be deconvolved to increase the contrast and resolution even further if required. As shown here, the RESOLFT modality offers the benefit of allowing to image deeper in tissue. This observation relys on the fact that fluorescence from outside the focal region is precluded because the molecules located in that region are transferred into a non-fluorescent state; their signal cannot perturb the image.</p><p>Since the release of rsEGFP2 in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grotjohann et al., 2012</xref>), a number of novel switchable fluorescent proteins have been reported. Of these, the rsEGFP/rsEGFP2 variants rsFolder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Khatib et al., 2016</xref>), rsGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duwé et al., 2015</xref>), and rsEGFP-N205S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chmyrov et al., 2013</xref>), the red fluorescent rsCherryRev1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lavoie-Cardinal et al., 2014</xref>), and the positive switching Kohinoor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tiwari et al., 2015</xref>) have been successfully used in RESOLFT nanoscopy. Also organic dyes were used in this concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>). Still, for the applications shown in this manuscript, namely beam scanning RESOLFT nanoscopy in tissues, rsEGFP2 seems to unite the necessary properties in the most suitable combination. Although rsEGFP2 dramatically outperforms earlier RSFPs such as Dronpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 2004</xref>) or rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>), we expect generation of superior RSFPs in the future that are even more photostable, brighter, and exhibit better contrast.</p><p>We conclude that with the ongoing developments both on RSFPs as well as on instrumentation, it can be anticipated that the application range of low light RESOLFT nanoscopy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as in other multicellular organism will be further expanded in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and fly generation</title><p>A synthetic gene sequence encoding the fluorescent protein rsEGFP2 (GenBank #AGE84598.1) attached to the N-terminus of the α-tubulin 84B (cg1913, UniProt #P06603) protein was synthesized.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.

However, in vivo fluorescence nanoscopy has been challenging because it requires fast imaging speed and minimal photodamage. In this aspect, RESOLFT nanoscopy is a very promising tool due to its low dosage of illumination although its imaging speed is somewhat slower than STED microscopy. RESOLFT uses lower doses than STED as well as PALM/STORM techniques and filters out out-of-focus light with the pinhole of the confocal scanning geometry. This combination, in concert with fluorescent proteins, makes it the best-suited super-resolution technique for in vivo imaging. In this manuscript, the authors present significant advances over their 2012 <italic>eLife</italic> publication on the development of rsEGFP2 as a genetically encodable RESOLFT probe and its application in live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy.</p><p>They demonstrate (i) a successful preparation of transgenic <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stably expressing RSFP-tubulin, and (ii) the extension of applications of RESOLFT nanoscopy to fruit fly tissue sections, deep tissue imaging (&gt; 40 um) and imaging of intact embryo, which are almost impossible for most of fluorescence nanoscopy. The manuscript is written concisely, is easy to understand and the results are presented transparently. The experiments were executed beautifully. The work represents an important milestone in the development of super-resolution microscopy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We understand 3D imaging is not a main part of this manuscript. However, a volumetric imaging is essential to visualize three-dimensional distributions of fluorescent markers of interest in tissues. We request adding 3D RESOLFT images of small volume as supplementary data. If it is not viable, please specify its reason in the main text.</p><p>2) Since the introduction of RSFP by Grotjohann in 2011, there has been significant progress in the development of diverse RSFP. The authors need to elaborate on this at Discussion section.</p><p>3) In terms of temporal and spatial resolution, RESOLFT nanoscopy is in competition with the recently demonstrated photoactivatable nonlinear SIM (PA NL-SIM) microscopy [Li et al., Science (2015)]. Although they imaged cultured cells in that paper, it looks straightforward to apply it for tissue imaging. How would you compare the current RESOLFT nanoscopy with PA NL-SIM microscopy for in vivo imaging? It would be great to briefly address it in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15567.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) We understand 3D imaging is not a main part of this manuscript.

We added two new data sets to the revised version of the manuscript to demonstrate 3D RESOLFT:</p><p>A) In all images shown in the original manuscript we used a 2D doughnut that facilitated improved lateral resolution and conventional confocal axial resolution. Of course, the latter allows optical sectioning. In the revised version of the manuscript we demonstrate that this property can be used to follow individual microtubules in space. To this end, we imaged a tissue volume of 4.2 µm x 3.9 µm x 3.5 µm and took 14 xy RESOLFT images, each separated by 250 nm. This allowed a 3D rendering of the tissue section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Movie 1</xref>).</p><p>B) Following this suggestion by the reviewers further, we re-designed our microscope and implemented a spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM allows to generate a 3D doughnut, enabling a resolution of ~140 nm along the z-axis. Using this 3D doughnut we imaged a volume of 8.5 µm x 6.8 µm x 2 µm dimensions. We recorded 33 xy-images, each separated by 60 nm. This data set shows that it is indeed possible to record 3D RESOLFT images on living tissues that have an improved resolution in all directions. These new data are represented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Since the introduction of RSFP by Grotjohann in 2011, there has been significant progress in the development of diverse RSFP. The authors need to elaborate on this at Discussion section.</italic></p><p>Again, we are thankful for this suggestion. In the revised version of the manuscript we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion to highlight new developments in the field of RSFPs for RESOLFT.</p><p>It reads: “Since the release of rsEGFP2 in 2012 (Grotjohann et al. 2012), a number of novel switchable fluorescent proteins have been reported. Of these, the rsEGFP/rsEGFP2 variants rsFolder (El Khatib et al. 2016), rsGreen (Duwe et al. 2015), and rsEGFP-N205S (Chmyrov et al. 2013), the red fluorescent rsCherryRev1.4 (Lavoie-Cardinal et al. 2014), and the positive switching Kohinoor (Tiwari et al. 2015) have been successfully used in RESOLFT nanoscopy. Also organic dyes were used in this concept (Kwon et al. 2015). Still, for the applications shown in this manuscript, namely beam scanning RESOLFT nanoscopy in tissues, rsEGFP2 seems to unite the necessary properties in the most suitable combination. Although rsEGFP2 dramatically outperforms earlier RSFPs such as Dronpa (Ando, Mizuno, and Miyawaki 2004) or rsEGFP (Grotjohann et al. 2011), we expect generation of superior RSFPs in the future that are even more photostable, brighter, and exhibit better contrast.”</p><p><italic>3) In terms of temporal and spatial resolution, RESOLFT nanoscopy is in competition with the recently demonstrated photoactivatable nonlinear SIM (PA NL-SIM) microscopy [Li et al., Science (2015)]. Although they imaged cultured cells in that paper, it looks straightforward to apply it for tissue imaging. How would you compare the current RESOLFT nanoscopy with PA NL-SIM microscopy for in vivo imaging? It would be great to briefly address it in the main text.</italic> </p><p>The publication by Eric Betzig and colleagues is an important and also controversially discussed manuscript. Indeed, the shown RESOLFT microscopy and PA NL-SIM are highly related as both approaches rely on the reversible switching of RSFPs to overcome the diffraction barrier. However, the technical implementations are different, as PA NL-SIM relies on structured illumination and widefield detection and our RESOLFT approach on focused excitation and confocal detection. Therefore, we think that it would be rather challenging to implement PA NL-SIM for highly fluorescent tissues.</p><p>Two of the authors of this paper (TG and SJ) have contributed to a Technical Comment on the manuscript by Li et al. that was recently published in Science (Science, 2016, 352 (6285): 527); Li and Betzig responded in Science (Science, 2016, 352 (6285): 527). We think that it would not be appropriate to extend this discussion into this paper. Therefore, we prefer to cite the manuscript by Li et al., and to refer readers to the original manuscript by Li et al. without contributing to this ongoing scientific discussion within this publication.</p><p>In the revised version of our manuscript it reads: “Several variations of RESOLFT microscopy have been established, including single-beam and parallelized scanning approaches (Brakemann et al. 2011, Chmyrov et al. 2013, Grotjohann et al. 2011). The RESOLFT principle using RSFPs has also been extended to nonlinear structured illumination microscopy (PA NL-SIM) (Li et al. 2015) and light sheet microscopy (Hoyer et al. 2016).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
