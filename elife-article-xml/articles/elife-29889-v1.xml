No previously described crustacean possesses a mushroom body as defined by strict morphological criteria although crustacean centers called hemiellipsoid bodies, which serve functions in sensory integration, have been viewed as evolutionarily convergent with mushroom bodies. Here, using key identifiers to characterize neural arrangements, we demonstrate insect-like mushroom bodies in stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimps). More than any other crustacean taxon, mantis shrimps display sophisticated behaviors relating to predation, spatial memory, and visual recognition comparable to those of insects. However, neuroanatomy-based cladistics suggesting close phylogenetic proximity of insects and stomatopod crustaceans conflicts with genomic evidence showing hexapods closely related to simple crustaceans called remipedes. We discuss whether corresponding anatomical phenotypes described here reflect the cerebral morphology of a common ancestor of Pancrustacea or an extraordinary example of convergent evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29889.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>With more than four million species, arthropods are the largest and most diverse group of animals on the planet and include, for example, crustaceans, insects and spiders. They are defined by their segmented bodies, hard outer skeletons and jointed limbs. All arthropods share a common ancestor that lived more than 550 million years ago. Exactly how this ancestral arthropod gave rise to the myriad species that exist today is unclear but we know that at some point the arthropod family tree split into branches, one of which went on to become the crustaceans. The crustacean branch then split again, giving rise to a line of descendants that would become the insects.</p><p>But although insects evolved from crustaceans, the brains of insects possess structures that those of crustaceans do not. Known as mushroom bodies, these structures help to form and store memories. Their absence in crustaceans has therefore been an enduring mystery. Wolff et al. now add a piece to the puzzle by showing that one group of modern-day crustaceans, the mantis shrimps, does in fact possess mushroom bodies.</p><p>By visualizing cells and pathways within the brains of mantis shrimps, and also a number of closely related species, Wolff et al. show that only these shrimps possess true mushroom bodies. However, some of the mantis shrimp’s close relatives possess a few attributes of these structures. This suggests that mushroom bodies are evolutionarily ancient structures that arose in a common ancestor of insects and crustaceans, before being lost or radically modified in most of the crustaceans.</p><p>So why did this happen? Mantis shrimps are top predators with excellent vision that hunt over considerable distances, requiring them to evaluate and memorize complex features of their environment. These cognitive demands, which might not be shared by other crustaceans, may have led to the mantis shrimps retaining their mushroom bodies. Further research into the brains and behavior of the mantis shrimp may provide insights into how mushroom bodies construct memories of a complex sensory world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pancrustacea</kwd><kwd>Stomatopoda</kwd><kwd><italic>Neogonodactylus oerstedii</italic></kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd><kwd>neural organization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006602</institution-id><institution>Air Force Research Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA8651-13-1-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strausfeld</surname><given-names>Nicholas James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Asian Office of Aerospace Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AOARD- 12-4063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL140100197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Fellowship 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thoen</surname><given-names>Hanna Halkinrud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The paper describes an insect-like mushroom body in one group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda), suggesting either an ancient origin of this center and its reduction and loss in other crustaceans, or an extraordinary example of convergent evolution with the insect mushroom body.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mushroom bodies are paired centers first identified in the brains of Hymenoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dujardin, 1850</xref>). They have been defined anatomically as a discrete neuropil composed of an abundance of parallel fibers originating from densely packed cell bodies, called globuli cells or Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schürmann F-W, 1973</xref>). Together, the parallel fibers form a distinctive peduncle that divides into two or more columnar tributaries termed lobes. Input and output neurons intersect parallel fibers down the length of each lobe, partitioning the lobe into discrete territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mobbs, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Strausfeld, 1999</xref>). In most neopteran insects (those insects possessing wings that bend over the abdomen), parallel fibers provide systems of dendrites that form a distal cap- or cup-like domain called the calyx that receives afferents from olfactory neuropils and, in many species, from the optic lobes and gustatory centers as well. Calyces are absent in palaeopteran insects, such as odonates and Ephemeroptera (dragonflies, darters, mayflies), as well as in secondarily aquatic Neoptera such as diving beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>). Additional characters conventionally attributed to mushroom bodies include the presence of inhibitory feedback pathways from proximal to more distal levels of the lobes and calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leitch and Laurent, 1996</xref>). Mushroom bodies are further defined by enriched expression of proteins that are known to be essential for learning and memory functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skoulakis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Skoulakis and Davis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). The exclusive location of the paired mushroom bodies is laterally in the protocerebrum (forebrain), as they are in another mandibulate group, Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mushroom body function has been attributed to learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>). Currently, much of our knowledge about the roles of mushroom bodies comes from studies showing that convergence of populations of relay neurons from the antennal lobes onto sparse subsets of mushroom body Kenyon cells underlies multiple representations of odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2014</xref>); that mushroom bodies mediate appetitive and aversive long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waddell, 2013</xref>); and that they support allocentric and sequential place memory such as during trap-line foraging and obligate parasitoidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mizunami et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farris and Schulmeister, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given that mushroom bodies have been identified in Myriapoda (centipedes and millipedes) and Chelicerata (arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>), it might be assumed that these centers would be ubiquitous across arthropods. However, that assumption is awkward because the paired higher centers in the lateral protocerebrum of crustaceans share few, if any, of the identifying characteristics of lobed mushroom bodies as described above. These paired centers are the domed hemiellipsoid bodies.</p><p>Particularly in malacostracan crustaceans, such as crayfish and shrimps, hemiellipsoid bodies may correspond functionally to mushroom bodies. In many species the hemiellipsoid bodies are subdivided into discrete lateral domains and levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sullivan and Beltz, 2004</xref>). Their neurons originate from a dense population of minute cell bodies situated at the dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces of the lateral protocerebra, like the perikarya of globuli cells associated with the insect mushroom body. However, only in one group of crustaceans, the Anomura (hermit crabs), has there been any description of enriched proteins involved in learning and memory that characterize insect mushroom body lobes. In the land hermit crab <italic>Coenobita clypeatus</italic>, these proteins are confined to discrete concentric layers arranged at intervals through the depth of the hemiellipsoid body. Planar arrangements of pre- and postsynaptic neurons in these strata are comparable to orthogonal networks observed in the mushroom body lobes of insects. Hence, the hemiellipsoid bodies of land hermit crabs are interpreted as homologues of insect mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Wolff, 2012</xref>). But the question remains whether such circuits have evolved convergently, particularly because marine hermit crabs show no evidence of orthogonal circuitry, nor do species of the related orders, Astacidea (crayfish and lobsters) and Brachyura (true crabs). Nevertheless, crustaceans might be expected to have evolved insect-like mushroom bodies if, like insects, they engage in behaviors that demand high level sensory associations and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Withers et al., 2008</xref>), such as trap-line foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>), rational courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbuthnott et al., 2017</xref>), individual recognition, establishment and defense of territories, and obligate predation by stealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Libersat and Gal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berens et al., 2017</xref>;﻿ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcock and Bailey, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Stomatopoda (mantis shrimps), which is the sister group of all eumalacostracan crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wolfe et al., 2016</xref>), engage in such behaviors. Stomatopods possess the most elaborate visual systems of any arthropod, where each eye moves independently of the other, and is endowed with binocular vision and numerous color- and polarization-sensitive channels, including channels for detecting circular polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marshall et al., 2007</xref>). Mantis shrimps frequent established hunting territories distant from their lair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cronin et al., 2006</xref>). Like insects, mantis shrimps form associative memories of kin and place through sensory integration employing the modalities of vision and olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caldwell and Lamp, 1981</xref>) and can be trained in discrimination-learning paradigms using color and polarized light stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marshall et al., 1999</xref>). Individuals remember conspecifics with which they have had aversive or non-aversive encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caldwell, 1992</xref>). These behaviors require a brain equipped for memory of places, territories and individual recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>). Here we report the first comprehensive description of centers in Stomatopoda that correspond in detail to the mushroom bodies of insects.</p><p>Their similarity of brain structures has suggested phylogenetic proximity of insects and malacostracan crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strausfeld and Andrew, 2011</xref>). However, genomic evidence argues strongly that insects are instead most closely related to blind, morphologically simple cave-dwelling crustaceans, called remipedes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Regier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oakley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Reumont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwentner et al., 2017</xref>), which like all crustaceans other than stomatopods lack mushroom bodies. The identification of mushroom bodies in mantis shrimps sheds new light on insect-crustacean relationships. We show that, within more recently radiating eumalacostracan lineages, the neuronal composition and organization of mushroom body morphology appear to have undergone radical modification resulting in centers unrecognizable as mushroom bodies but retaining the function of a sensory integrator. The earlier identification of a hexapod-malacostracan-like brain in a fossil stem arthropod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2015</xref>) together with the present results argues for an elaborate ancestral cerebral organization already present in the lower Cambrian.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of mushroom bodies in crustaceans</title><p>We have surveyed a broad range of Crustacea, particularly Malacostraca, for evidence of centers that would correspond to mushroom bodies identified in insects. Surprisingly, as outlined above, there have been very few criteria employed for identifying insect mushroom bodies. Those criteria are the presence of lobes, with or without an outer ‘calyx’ or ‘cap’, arising from many hundreds of minute cell bodies clustered laterally in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flögel, 1878</xref>). Original descriptions of mushroom bodies emphasized a distal dendritic elaboration, called a calyx, although subsequent studies have shown that many insect groups lack this, as do Myriapoda and Chelicerata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, just these few characters have sufficed historically for claiming homology of lobed centers across Hexapoda. However they are hardly adequate to claim homology of neuropils in divergent arthropod lineages such as the two sub-phyla, Crustacea and Hexapoda, that comprise the clade Pancrustacea. Here we expand neuroanatomical criteria to unique characters that we view as necessary and sufficient to claim a center’s identity as a mushroom body and hence support possible phenotypic homology across species. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> lists these characters and their occurrence in representative insects (<italic>Drosophila</italic> and the cockroach <italic>Periplaneta americana</italic>) and, within eumalacostracan crustaceans, Stomatopoda and five decapod species.

These are exceptionally capacious in mantis shrimps due to the voluminous nested optic lobe neuropils, which serve the largest and most complex compound eyes yet described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The eyestalk also accommodates elaborate neuropils that in the literature have been collectively referred to as the ‘medulla terminalis.’ These neuropils comprise the lateral protocerebrum, just as they do in insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the mantis shrimp, the largest of these neuropils originates from a dorsal cell body cluster of about 170,000 (in <italic>N. oerstedii</italic>) minute and tightly clustered neuronal perikarya, which we here refer to as globuli cells. This population provides the neurons that form four columnar neuropils, each comprising thousands of parallel fibers. Only one of the four columns is surmounted by a large calyx-like neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) composed of layers of dendritic arborizations. The four columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which extend latero-caudally, together demarcate the proximal margin of the eyestalk neuropil, near its junction with the eyestalk nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Globuli cells provide one very large dome-like neuropil (here termed the calyx, indicated Ca in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) from which one of the smaller columns originates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Globuli cells also provide parallel fibers constituting three additional columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), one of which is equipped with a small calyx distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The two other columns lack distal dendrites entirely. Neurites from globuli cells converge at the origin of each column, as they do at the pedunculus (or initial stalk) of an insect mushroom body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Each cell body neurite then increases in girth and extends for hundreds of microns as a thicker process decorated with varicosities and spines representing, respectively, pre- and postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strausfeld and Meinertzhagen, 1998</xref>). Like Kenyon cells in insect mushroom bodies, globuli cells in stomatopods lack a proper axon: each globuli cell’s parallel fiber serves as a local interneuron, corresponding in shape and decoration to the parallel fibers of the insect mushroom body lobes, exemplified by <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). And by comparison to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body lobe, each parallel fiber is assumed to contribute to local computational circuits within its column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>). Comparing the columns of the stomatopod mushroom body and the mushroom body lobes of the cockroach <italic>Periplaneta americana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>) further demonstrates that parallel fibers in both species are regularly intersected by the branched processes of efferent and afferent neurons. As in the insect mushroom body, in the stomatopod mushroom body orthogonally organized neurons and local circuits provided by parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) offer many thousands of possible sensory associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huerta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>In insects, the packing density of globuli cells associated with a mushroom body exceeds the packing density of neuronal cell bodies elsewhere in the brain. Our measurements show that the packing density of globuli cells supplying the stomatopod mushroom body is comparable to that of globuli cells supplying the mushroom bodies of insects, here exemplified by <italic>P. americana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). An important identifier of mushroom bodies in insects is the morphology of its Kenyon cells and their specializations; in particular, clawed specializations that partially wrap around large terminal boutons of sensory afferents in the calyces of flies and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yasuyama et al., 2002</xref>). These are also identified in stomatopods, but only on dendrites contributing to the smaller of the two calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the larger calyx, spined dendritic processes correspond to the spined dendrites of the mushroom body calyx of <italic>P. americana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the stomatopod calyx is deeper than is an insect calyx and is composed of four distinct levels, the second of which is characterized by hundreds of thousands of synaptic clusters comparable to microglomeruli identified in the calyces of insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29889.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Correspondences of stomatopod and insect mushroom bodies.</title><p>(<italic>A1, A2 upper panels</italic>) Globuli cell domains reconstructed from serial sections from <italic>Neogonodactylus oerstedii</italic> (<bold>A1</bold>) and <italic>Periplaneta americana</italic> (<bold>A2</bold>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, such neurons at specific loci along the lobes have been shown to encode the adaptive values of sensory information associated with learned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). The same type of organization typifies the stomatopod mushroom body columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). And, as in the insect mushroom body, this arrangement is further demonstrated by the organization of aminergic neurons, the processes of which invade the columns at specific sites. In <italic>N. oerstedii</italic> GAD-immunoreactive neurons extending across the two largest columns are representative of centrifugal pathways back to the calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Other aminergic afferents are resolved using antisera against serotonin (5HT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). These also demonstrate discrete territories along the length of the mushroom body columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). These arrangements of TH-immunoreactive neurons, first identified in the mushroom body lobes of the fly <italic>Calliphora erythrocephala</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nässel and Elekes, 1992</xref>), correspond to discrete dopaminergic territories in the mushroom body of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Thermogenetics, optogenetics, and mutant analysis have demonstrated the pivotal role of these neurons in appetitive and aversive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Waddell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Waddell, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Three-dimensional reconstructions of the stomatopod mushroom bodies confirm that only one of the four columns (Clm 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) originates from the extensive volume of dendritic processes that constitute the elaborate calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Golgi impregnations resolve a smaller column (Clm 4) capped by a much smaller cluster of outer dendrites constituting a second calyx. The remaining two columns (Clm 1, 2) are the largest and are composed of ‘naked’ globuli cells entirely lacking distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). That all four columns are supplied by globuli cells is another correspondence with the organization of the insect mushroom body, which develops from four cell lineages, the clonal progeny of which do not remain separated but merge to form a single neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farris et al., 2004</xref>). In the mantis shrimp, four distinct columns originate from the same globuli cell population but remain separate from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of a cap or calyx crowning two of the stomatopod mushroom body columns is comparable to the organization of mushroom bodies in palaeopteran insects (mayflies, damselflies), which entirely lack calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>). This ‘calyxless’ condition also typifies mushroom bodies in Myriapoda, another mandibulate taxon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>). Ancestral morphology is also suggested by mushroom body development in insects, where outgrowth of the lobes precedes the development of the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farris et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, the combination of neuroanatomical characters that distinguish the insect mushroom body also distinguish the stomatopod mushroom body (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

In the cockroach lateral protocerebrum, all three antibodies selectively resolve the mushroom body lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Molecular phylogenies favor blind, morphologically simple anchialine crustaceans, called remipedes as the closest relatives of the insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Regier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oakley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Reumont et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwentner et al., 2017</xref>). This view conflicts with neural cladistics, which resolves insect brain organization closely corresponding to that of phylogenetically distant malacostracan crustaceans (e.g., Decapoda) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strausfeld and Andrew, 2011</xref>). One source of conflict is that molecular phylogenies cannot provide reliable information about morphological changes that have occurred since related groups diverged. It is expected that through the course of evolution there will have arisen both genetic and structural novelties, as well as reversals and losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jenner, 2004</xref>), the latter impossible to code in relational trees based on morphological characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strausfeld and Andrew, 2011</xref>). For example, branchiopod crustaceans, closely related to both hexapods and remipedes, lack most features that define the brains of those two groups, and possess only a pair of nested optic neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cephalocarids, a lineage closely related to Hexapoda and Remipedia, are also blind crustaceans, whose brains comprise predominantly olfactory centers and lack other cerebral neuropils common to hexapods and malacostracans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stegner and Richter, 2011</xref>). Compared with Branchiopoda and Cephalocarida, the Remipedia midbrain shares more neural features with Malacostraca than it does with Hexapoda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fanenbruck et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Similar cerebral arrangements in crustaceans and insects have frequently been ascribed to convergent evolution rather than to genealogical correspondence. This view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lozano-Fernandez et al., 2016</xref>) can refer particularly to fundamental differences in insect and crustacean olfactory systems, even in crustaceans adapted to terrestrial life. In crustaceans, olfactory receptor neurons exclusively express ionotropic receptors, whereas in insects most olfactory receptor neurons are defined by their G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stensmyr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). A neuropil ascribed exclusively to crustaceans is the dome-like second-order olfactory center called the hemiellipsoid body, which is supplied by the axons of thousands of projection neurons from numerous subunits of the olfactory lobe and its satellite neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sullivan and Beltz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sullivan and Beltz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt and Mellon, 2011</xref>). Hemiellipsoid bodies also integrate olfactory, haptic and visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt and Mellon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mellon et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>A comparable arrangement pertains to insects, with a few notable differences. Fewer and smaller relay neurons, most restricted to single glomerular subunits of the antennal lobe (the primary olfactory lobe) send axons to second-order centers, the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galizia and Rössler, 2010</xref>). These inputs relay information about odorants, airborne molecules that are detected by the ligand-gated olfactory receptors.

Recordings from this center showed long-term habituation in response to repetitive visual stimuli. It was proposed that this center is homologous to the insect mushroom body on the basis of a cluster of small cell bodies located ventro-medially in the eyestalk neuropil providing a columnar domain showing elevated p-CAMKII-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maza et al., 2016</xref>). Two territories populated by branched processes were referred to as vertical and medial lobes, adopting terms for insect mushroom body lobes. We have been unable to reconcile those neuroanatomical observations with characters defining the insect and stomatopod mushroom bodies. Parallel fibers comprising pedestal-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maza et al., 2016</xref>) are shown as smooth, lacking spines and varicosities.

No other eumalacostracan crustacean outside Stomatopoda has yet provided clear evidence of an insect-like mushroom body.</p><p>Comparisons across this pancrustacean phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) thus suggest two interpretations. One is that mushroom bodies evolved convergently in insects and stomatopods. The other is that the mushroom body is an ancestral attribute of the pancrustacean brain that has been retained in just the hexapod and stomatopod lineages but modified or lost in all others. Fossil brains described from the lower Cambrian stem arthropod <italic>Fuxianhuia protensa</italic> suggest that optic lobe and neuromeric arrangements of the brain of this ancient stem arthropod typify those of extant malacostracans and insects: the presence of three nested visual centers arising from a cerebrum comprising a fused forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain, each neuromere denoted by its relationships with the compound eyes, antennules and paired post-antennular appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Although fossils cannot reveal the organization of centers within the brain, those preserved features described above are cardinal indicators of an ancestral ground pattern that originated more than half a billion years ago at the onset of the lower Cambrian. Subsequent lineages originating at an estimated time of 487 million years ago provide today’s crown Pancrustacea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collette and Hagadorn, 2010</xref>). Taking neuropils that have been identified as common to Pancrustacea and superimposing these onto the ancestral ground pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>) suggests a plausible ancestral arrangement in such a brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). That mushroom bodies have been demonstrated in Myriapoda, the sister group of Pancrustacea, and Chelicerata the sister group to all mandibulate arthropods, further supports a very ancient origin of this center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Attendant to such considerations is that many elements of the ancestral ground pattern have been lost or drastically reduced in numerous crustacean lineages, even to just a few neurons such as in Cirripedia and Cephalocarida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Callaway and Stuart, 1999</xref>). Simplification from genealogically ancient complexity is common in nature at many phylogenetic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collin et al., 2009</xref>). It should come as no surprise to find examples of simplification or independent retentions of past complexity in the neuromorphological landscape.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Are insect and stomatopod mushroom bodies homologous or convergent?</title><p>The demonstration that phenotypically identical organs in widely separated species can be ascribed to convergent genomic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pankey et al., 2014</xref>) suggests caution in claiming homology of identical phenotypes. Thus, although corresponding morphologies in stomatopods and insects suggest mushroom body homology, transcriptomic evaluation must, eventually, be the arbiter of whether these centers indeed correspond genealogically. At present, the strongest argument against is that the sister group of all hexapods (Remipedia) and the sister group of all Malacostracans (Leptostraca) possess simple hemiellipsoid bodies, not mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fanenbruck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kenning et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Convergent evolution would imply that mushroom bodies in insects and stomatopods evolved independently in response to comparable selective constraints. The most obvious would be the appearance of biotopes requiring superior vision. Stomatopods and certain insects possess superior optics and underlying optic lobe circuitry that enable the detection and discrimination of visual flow fields, chromatic features, patterns and structures. However, speaking against this are archaeognathan insects, the sister group of all other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Misof et al., 2014</xref>), which have a more elaborate visual system than those of apterygote Zygentoma, the sister group of all winged insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Misof et al., 2014</xref>). Yet archaeognathans lack mushroom bodies. <italic>Lepisma saccharina</italic>, which is a typical zygentoman insect, has diminutive eyes and reduced optic lobes but possesses robust mushroom bodies equipped with calyces and elaborate lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farris, 2005</xref>). Amongst crustaceans, many eumalacostracan species possess prominent eyes surmounting elaborate visual centers. Shore crabs, for example, have excellent vision and highly elaborated optic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sztarker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berón de Astrada et al., 2001</xref>), but they lack mushroom bodies. Given these contradictions, what aspects of behavior specific to stomatopods and insects might be relevant to mushroom body evolution? One proposed driver of the evolution of large mushroom bodies is the requirement to recall the exact locations and properties of places from which to obtain nourishment. Heliconid butterflies maintain their enlarged mushroom body lobes when allowed repeated visits to distributed foraging sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2016</xref>). The large mushroom bodies of social hymenopterans are suggested to have evolved in conjunction with the evolution of parasitic behavior, where individuals learn the many locations of potential hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farris and Schulmeister, 2011</xref>). It may be significant, therefore, that the only eumalacostracan groups in addition to stomatopods that evidence memory of exact locations are cleaner shrimps, pistol shrimps, and land hermit crabs, all of which have mushroom body-like attributes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2A</xref>). Cleaner shrimps are renowned for their fidelity to specific locations visited by the fish they clean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Limbaugh et al., 1961</xref>). Pistol shrimps are the only crustaceans to have evolved eusociality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duffy, 1996</xref>), an attribute requiring memory of position both outside and within the community. And land hermit crabs are known for their navigational skills and memory of sites at which they socially interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rotjan et al., 2010</xref>). There are, then, valid grounds to suppose convergent evolution of mushroom bodies in certain crustaceans and hexapods.</p><p>Stomatopod and insect mushroom bodies also pass three crucial tests for phenotypic homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patterson, 1988</xref>). These are their similarity, the exclusion of competing structures that might suggest a similar interpretation (conjunction), and the co-existence of additional homologies (congruence). The present results have demonstrated structural identicalities. Reniform bodies, proposed as a homologue of the insect mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maza et al., 2016</xref>), are excluded because in stomatopods they coexist with mushroom bodies. The third condition, that structures in two species are more likely to be homologues if they share other homologies, is supported by the locations of other corresponding brain centers in insects and stomatopods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specific examples are the fan-shaped central complex neuropils in the midbrain of stomatopods and insects connected to identical suites of satellite neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thoen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We are obliged to conclude that there is, as yet, no definitive conclusion. Phenotypic and genomic homology would support the hypothesis that mushroom bodies evolved very early in pancrustacean or even in panarthropod evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2016</xref>). That identical centers of such stunning complexity may have evolved convergently in stomatopods and insects is just as fascinating and should lead to a greater understanding of the overarching significance of mushroom bodies in arthropod behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>One hundred and eight mature stomatopods (both sexes), <italic>Neogonodactylus oerstedii</italic>, were obtained commercially from waters off the coast of Florida.

Next, the brains were left in fresh fixative overnight at 4°C (but see below for TH immunostaining). The following day brains were washed three times, 10 min each, in PBS and then embedded in albumin gelatin. Embedded tissue was cut into 60 µm serial sections using a vibratome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). Individual sections were placed in wells of a well plate (1 ml capacity) for further processing.

Secondary antibody treatment lasted for 24 hr followed by several washes in PBS-TX, cleared in glycerol and then mounting in welled glass slides under glycerol for confocal microscopy. Tissue was subjected to the two cycle microwave treatment described above once every 24 hr while the tissue was incubating in either primary or secondary antibody.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kei Ito (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. There were two critical issues identified that need to be resolved: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dujardin, 1850</xref>) The justification for the 15 criteria of MB identification should be improved. Each criterion should be independent from others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2</xref>) The authors should provide a more convincing argument that the observed similarity is homology instead of convergence. i.e., why can't this be just convergence?</p><p>The comments of the three reviewers are provided below more or less in entirety because we think it is important for you to see &quot;where they are coming from&quot; as they phrase their positions. Note that they are not asking for new experimental work, but are challenging some of the ways you are analyzing and interpreting the findings. We ask that you revised the manuscript to address the major concerns and look forward to receiving a revision.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study the authors employed an approach to characterize the feature of the mushroom body with 15 morphological and biochemical criteria, and identified a specific neuronal structure in the lateral protocerebrum of the mantis shrimp Stomatopoda brain that is likely to correspond to the insect mushroom body. This approach has been proven to be a powerful tool by their previous publications for identifying correspondences between the brains of distant species while excluding superficial resemblance.

HEBs are found in a number of crustacean taxa, including some outside of the Malacostraca. In the few species studied in detail such as <italic>C. clypeatus</italic>, the HEBs share many characteristics with insect MBs, providing a basis for proposing that the complex HEBs of stomatopods through modification of HEBs. That HEBs gave rise to MB-like HEBs in one taxon of Crustacea, as simpler MBs gave rise to more complex MBs in some insects as a result of similar selective pressures for visual behavior is a far more parsimonius interpretation of the data presented and the existing literature. The rationale provided by the authors for homology is inconsistent and unconvincing.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;An insect mushroom body in a crustacean brain&quot; Gabriella H. Wolff and co-authors give an in-depth neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical analysis of a prominent neuropil in the lateral protocerebrum of mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda), that serves as second stage of the central olfactory pathway and traditionally has been known as hemiellipsoid body (HB). With this analysis the authors provide substantial evidence supporting the notion that this neuropil is in fact homologous to the well-known mushroom body (MB) of the insect brain. By additionally analyzing the expression of a protein required for learning and memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (DC0) in the HB in some other crustacean taxa, the authors arrive at a detailed reconstruction of the phylogenetic development of the HB/MB within Pancrustacea, the monophyletic taxon comprised of Crustacea and Hexapoda. Furthermore, the authors provide a less-detailed neuroanatomical description of a hitherto unknown neuropil in the lateral protocerebrum of crustaceans, the 'reniform body' – which in some neuroanatomical aspects is similar to the HB/MB.</p><p>Overall, the study is very well executed and the main results are presented in detailed and very informative reconstruction drawings as well as in numerous images of original neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical data.</p><p>There is, however, one main conceptual issue that the authors should address as well as numerous minor suggestions and comments. The main conceptual issue on which the paper hinges, is what constitutes a MB and distinguishes it from a HB – and the authors should improve their definition(s) substantially. First, there is some contradiction within the paper itself that needs to be reconciled: In Results paragraph two the authors state that a MB is identified by 12 of the 15 criteria provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> – but they fail to identify this set of 12 criteria (the 'HBs' of stomatopods correspond to the MBs of insects in a 15 criteria according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, later in the Results (subsection “Divergent evolution of the mushroom bodies”) the authors talk about 'mushroom body lobes' within HBs (which is a truly confusing description and concept) that apparently are identified solely by the expression of DC0. Even more problematic is the lack of a definition of what constitutes a 'lobed center' in the lateral protocerebrum: This is the first criterion given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> that distinguishes MBs from other neuropils in the lateral protocerebrum, which at least for Varunidae according to the authors' data include the 'reniform body' that they describe as a 'lobate center'. So why then is that not a lobed center? In fact, the term 'lobe' may be one of the least distinct anatomical terms and without a crystal-clear definition it seems impossible to exclude neuropil structures of typical HBs (or other neuropils in the lateral protocerebrum) by it. Most of the other criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1 (8</xref> of the remaining 14) depend on the presence of a 'lobe' and therefore do not provide additional independent characters differentiating between HBs and MBs (it is odd that for Anomura which do not have lobed centers the density of cell bodies supplying lobes is checked). The terms 'dome' and 'calyx' also prominently appear in the Table – and they need to be rigorously defined to be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29889.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.

Intervening neuropils occur between the mushroom body columns – which flank the inner margin of the lateral protocerebrum – and the innermost optic neuropil, which is the lobula. However, the reviewer’s suggestion is a good one. We have Golgi evidence that lobula outputs extend to the reniform body, and that the reniform body then sends further connections to the mushroom body columns.

Is there any systematic correlation between the degree/tendency of structural alteration and the behavioral/functional complexity of the organisms in the respective branches?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises the fundamental question: if mushroom bodies are ancestral, then why have they been lost in most crustaceans? One possible explanation is that stomatopods behave like winged insects in that they are graceful and acrobatic swimmers “flying through the water” during which they use a multitude of sensory cues, including visual flow, to compute fast decisions for navigation and the pursuit of prey or conspecifics. Stomatopods establish working knowledge of their terrain; they are able to recall places (an essential property of line-trap forging, where the predatory stomatopod will visit numerous familiar hunting sites before returning to its burrow). Allocentric memory (“the organism knowing where it is in a complex sensory world”) is a property shared by many, possibly all insects that rely on visual information for visual/olfactory recognition of foraging sites, roosts, and hives. Decapods such as crabs, shrimps, and lobsters also have defined territories, but they do not engage in fast marine “flights” over substantial distances that require detailed memory of the aquatic terrain. It is also significant that species that use place memory of specific locations to accomplish certain functions, such as cleaner shrimps tending fish, or social pistol shrimps using sponges as hives, possess mushroom body-like features in their lateral protocerebra.</p><p>Very many lineages of crustaceans are wholly adapted to life in the water column, including copepods, which have the highest crustacean biomass, and on which the food pyramid rests. If mushroom bodies are pivotal for recollecting places and events associated with them, then evolving in a visually impoverished ecology speaks against retention of a metabolically costly neuropil such as a mushroom body.</p><p>Some interesting studies of stomatopod behaviors, in addition to ones cited:</p><p>· Extreme aggressiveness and territoriality: Dingle H, Caldwell RL. 1969.

For example, starburst beetles, which are aquatic and anosmic (they have no antennal (olfactory) lobes) have mushroom bodies that lack calyces entirely. The lobes exclusively receive the afferent supply. Nor does the absence of a calyx obviate specific types of postsynaptic specializations.

However, this does not force that stomatopods and insects will share the most characters. It might have turned out that Stomatopoda shared significantly fewer characters than those defining an insect mushroom body. In those species for which data is lacking, the absence of lobe-like extensions from domed HEB-like neuropils automatically excludes characters that define lobed/columnar mushroom-bodies.</p><p>In response to comments regarding mushroom bodies that lack calyces: the table now includes odonates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In conclusion, this reviewer feels that factors described in the literature and discussed by the authors strongly support not homology, but convergence of the stomatopod HEBs and insect MBs. HEBs are found in a number of crustacean taxa, including some outside of the Malacostraca. In the few species studied in detail such as C. clypeatus, the HEBs share many characteristics with insect MBs, providing a basis for proposing that the complex HEBs of stomatopods through modification of HEBs. That HEBs gave rise to MB-like HEBs in one taxon of Crustacea, as simpler MBs gave rise to more complex MBs in some insects as a result of similar selective pressures for visual behavior is a far more parsimonius interpretation of the data presented and the existing literature. The rationale provided by the authors for homology is inconsistent and unconvincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns about homology versus homoplasy. Whether or not one interpretation is more parsimonious that another is very much open to debate. But essentially we agree with the reviewer: it is justified to say that mushroom body convergence is no less likely than homology and we have revised the manuscript Discussion accordingly. Criteria used for proposing phenotypic homology, such as those by Patterson, 1988 are fulfilled here. However, the reviewer is certainly not alone in advocating that stomatopod and insect mushroom bodies may be convergent and we now discuss this at length in the revised manuscript. Proof of homology between any phenotypic arrangements must eventually come from studies of their genetic organization and a recent transcriptomic study has demonstrated that detailed morphological correspondence is not necessarily indicative of genomic homology (Pankey et al., 2016).</p><p>The reviewer poses a central question: why might not the stomatopod and hexapod mushroom bodies have independently evolved from a simpler hemiellipsoid body-like ancestral state? And, might these independent evolutionary events have been driven by requirements related to superior vision, considering that many insect species and all stomatopods possess superior vision in terms of their optics, underlying optic lobe circuitry, and visual performance. We address this in the revised Discussion suggesting those aspects alone are unlikely to be coupled with the evolution of i mushroom bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;An insect mushroom body in a crustacean brain&quot; Gabriella H. Wolff and co-authors give an in-depth neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical analysis of a prominent neuropil in the lateral protocerebrum of mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda), that serves as second stage of the central olfactory pathway and traditionally has been known as hemiellipsoid body (HB). With this analysis the authors provide substantial evidence supporting the notion that this neuropil is in fact homologous to the well-known mushroom body (MB) of the insect brain. By additionally analyzing the expression of a protein required for learning and memory in Drosophila (DC0) in the HB in some other crustacean taxa, the authors arrive at a detailed reconstruction of the phylogenetic development of the HB/MB within Pancrustacea, the monophyletic taxon comprised of Crustacea and Hexapoda. Furthermore, the authors provide a less-detailed neuroanatomical description of a hitherto unknown neuropil in the lateral protocerebrum of crustaceans, the 'reniform body' – which in some neuroanatomical aspects is similar to the HB/MB.</p><p>Overall, the study is very well executed and the main results are presented in detailed and very informative reconstruction drawings as well as in numerous images of original neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical data.</p><p>There is, however, one main conceptual issue that the authors should address as well as numerous minor suggestions and comments. The main conceptual issue on which the paper hinges, is what constitutes a MB and distinguishes it from a HB – and the authors should improve their definition(s) substantially. First, there is some contradiction within the paper itself that needs to be reconciled: In Results paragraph two the authors state that a MB is identified by 12 of the 15 criteria provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> – but they fail to identify this set of 12 criteria (the 'HBs' of stomatopods correspond to the MBs of insects in a 15 criteria according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been clarified by providing a supplement 1 linked to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which has now been coded appropriately. We also emphasize that the characters have been chosen from observations of insect mushroom bodies. Throughout the revision characters relate to specific illustrated examples in the main manuscript and to citing published descriptions of specific features, such as mushroom body feedback neurons (Leitch and Laurant, 1996).</p><p>While we propose phenotypic correspondence we do also draw attention to distinctions, such as the layered organization of the stomatopod calyx shown in the revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>The reviewer is perfectly correct in that the observed similarities beg the question whether stomatopod and insect mushroom bodies are homologous or whether they have evolved independently and are thus convergent. This is now discussed at length in the revised Discussion, emphasizing on the need for caution in interpreting phenotypic correspondence, and providing reasons for the possibility of convergent evolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, later in the Results (subsection “Divergent evolution of the mushroom bodies”) the authors talk about 'mushroom body lobes' within HBs (which is a truly confusing description and concept) that apparently are identified solely by the expression of DC0.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it was confusing and we have changed this description to refer to a lobe-like extension arising from an HB-like center, specifically as the cleaner shrimp [Stenopodidae].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even more problematic is the lack of a definition of what constitutes a 'lobed center' in the lateral protocerebrum: This is the first criterion given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> that distinguishes MBs from other neuropils in the lateral protocerebrum, which at least for Varunidae according to the authors' data include the 'reniform body' that they describe as a 'lobate center'. So why then is that not a lobed center? In fact, the term 'lobe' may be one of the least distinct anatomical terms and without a crystal-clear definition it seems impossible to exclude neuropil structures of typical HBs (or other neuropils in the lateral protocerebrum) by it. Most of the other criteria in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1 (8</xref> of the remaining 14) depend on the presence of a 'lobe' and therefore do not provide additional independent characters differentiating between HBs and MBs (it is odd that for Anomura which do not have lobed centers the density of cell bodies supplying lobes is checked). The terms 'dome' and 'calyx' also prominently appear in the Table – and they need to be rigorously defined to be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed this reviewer’s advice, almost to the letter. It is regrettable that during the writing of the insect brain terminology paper (Ito et al., 2014) we didn’t jettison the term mushroom body “lobe.” Mushroom bodies actually have column-like extensions from the calyces. “Lobe” is an anatomical term to describe a rounded outgrowth from a body or organ (justified for naming the optic lobe, or antennal lobe, or ear lobe!). But the term “lobe” has become engrained in the mushroom body literature, so we can’t change that now. Nevertheless, in this revision we explain that the stomatopod mushroom body’s “lobes” are best described as columns and the use of that term is now explained for describing the stomatopod mushroom body. We have also thrown out the term ‘lobe’ when discussing the reniform body and instead refer to its bundled axons as a “pedestal” that supplies discrete volumes of neuropils, referred to as named zones. The neuropil that surmounts the stomatopod’s mushroom body column is referred to as its “calyx,” the term used to denote for the neuropil surmounting the insect’s mushroom body lobes. A calyx can be cup- or dome-shaped.</p><p>We appreciate concerns regarding character linkage, a perennial issue in cladistics.
