temporally coordinated neuronal ensembles—coupling distant brain regions, gating processing windows, and providing a reference for spike timing-based codes. In phase amplitude coupling (PAC), the amplitude of the envelope of a faster oscillation is larger within a phase window of a slower carrier wave. Here, we characterized PAC, and the related theta phase-referenced high gamma and beta power (PRP), in the olfactory bulb of mice learning to discriminate odorants. PAC changes throughout learning, and odorant-elicited changes in PRP increase for rewarded and decrease for unrewarded odorants. Contextual odorant identity (is the odorant rewarded?) can be decoded from peak PRP in animals proficient in odorant discrimination, but not in naïve mice. As the animal learns to discriminate the odorants the dimensionality of PRP decreases. Therefore, modulation of phase-referenced chunking of information in the course of learning plays a role in early sensory processing in olfaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>phase amplitude coupling</kwd><kwd>local field potential</kwd><kwd>dimensionality</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC000566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Restrepo</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Losacco</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tetrode recordings show that the amplitude of gamma oscillations encodes for information on contextual odorant identity when observed at the peak phase of the theta oscillation in the olfactory bulb.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals must modulate early sensory processing to optimize navigation of their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pakan et al., 2018</xref>). This experience-dependent shaping involves an interplay between sensory input, behavioral state, arousal and motor activity. Neuronal activity, temporally organized by local field potential (LFP) oscillations, carries distinct information at different phases of each cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>). For example, in the hippocampus different phases of the theta LFP (2–12 Hz) preferentially encode present and future spatial locations, illustrating temporal ‘chunking’ of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amemiya and Redish, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Place cell preferred fields are encoded temporally through phase precession in relation to hippocampal theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buzsaki, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lisman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, LFP oscillations in different frequency bandwidths can be related through cross frequency coupling (CFC), which can further enhance information carrying capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Canolty and Knight, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Engel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Florin and Baillet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fries, 2005</xref>).</p><p>One example of CFC is PAC, wherein the amplitude of a faster oscillation (e.g. gamma, 35–95 Hz) is related to the phase of a slower oscillation (e.g. theta, 2–12 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chrobak and Buzsáki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Soltesz et al., 1993</xref>). PAC occurs during task engagement in rodent hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Soltesz et al., 1993</xref>), rodent orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Wingerden et al., 2014</xref>), macaque auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Márton et al., 2019</xref>), human hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lega et al., 2016</xref>) and human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Daume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seymour et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Wingerden et al. (2014)</xref> described how theta-gamma PAC strengthens in rat orbitofrontal cortex with learning for trials in which the correct decision was made in the olfactory go no-go task.</p><p>The study of PAC in the earliest sensory processing brain areas is virtually non-existent. The olfactory bulb (OB) is an ideal location to study whether PAC is relevant to sensory processing; its intrinsic oscillatory activity is linked to odorant signal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gschwend et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smear et al., 2011</xref>). The rhythmic activation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) through breathing generates a theta-frequency (2–12 Hz) respiratory-related LFP in the target region of the OSNs, the OB, that is coherent with oscillations in downstream processing areas such as piriform cortex (PC) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gourévitch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nguyen Chi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tort et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, PAC is present in human PC, and the respiratory phase for presentation of stimuli modulates the ability to retrieve episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zelano et al., 2016</xref>). Downstream neural networks receiving olfactory information from the OB could be tuned to respond to sensory input at certain phases of this theta LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buzsáki, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen, 2001</xref>) and could send back modulatory signals during other phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Decades of work have characterized LFP activity in the OB in various states of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adrian, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2012</xref>) and olfactory task engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gourévitch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martin and Ravel, 2014</xref>). Surprisingly, this LFP signal changes in response to prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Courtiol and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gire et al., 2013</xref>). Work in the go no-go operant conditioning task where the animal learns to respond to the reinforced odorant for a water reward has revealed broadband LFP power changes for the rewarded versus the unrewarded odorant with discrimination learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beshel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Stopfer and Laurent, 1999</xref>). Additionally, changes in the balance of sensory and corticofugal inputs to OB interneurons can alter timing of beta and gamma oscillatory states, suggesting that information transfer from the OB is influenced by top-down signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">David et al., 2015</xref>). Also, these investigators posited that slower theta oscillations gate temporal windows for sensory and centrifugal inputs to ascend and descend, respectively, suggesting an important role for PAC in gating information transfer. Since PAC exists in the OB in anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buonviso et al., 2003</xref>) and awake, idle rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rojas-Líbano et al., 2014</xref>), we wondered whether PAC changes with learning, reflecting unsupervised Bayesian learning or supervised learning through top-down modulation sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hiratani and Latham, 2019</xref>), and whether encoding this information by the power of high frequency oscillations differs as a function of the phase of the theta LFP.</p><p>Here, thirsty mice implanted with tetrodes in the OB learned to associate an odorant with water reward in the go no-go task, discriminating between two monomolecular odorants (e.g. between isoamyl acetate vs acetophenone, IAAP) or between a monomolecular odorant and an odorant mixture (between ethyl acetate and a mixture of ethyl acetate and propyl acetate, EAPA). LFP was analyzed over task learning for changes in PAC and for the ability of theta phase-referenced high frequency oscillatory power—termed phase referenced power (PRP) hereafter—to encode for the perceived contextual identity of the odorant.</p><p>We demonstrate that the strength of PAC, quantified as the modulation index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tort et al., 2010</xref>), changes for the rewarded odorant (S+) as the animals learn. Interestingly, the variance of the angle of theta with the strongest gamma oscillation (peak angle) increases for the unrewarded odorant (S-) over the course of learning. These changes in PAC raised the question whether a downstream observer focused on high frequency oscillations at different theta phases would find a difference in stimulus prediction with learning. We found that the ability to decode stimulus identity by PRP improves with task proficiency and the dimensionality, a measure of separable representation within signals, decreased as the animal learned to differentiate the odorants, suggesting that a stable and unambiguous representation of odor identity arises in PRP after learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The experiments were designed to study encoding of odorant identity by cross-frequency coupling.

When the animal enters the port the air flow is diverted by turning the final valve output to the exhaust and the odorant valve is turned on. At this time the odor builds up to steady-state concentration flowing away from the animal for 1–1.5 s. At time 0 the final valve air flow is turned towards the odor port for 2.5 s resulting in odor onset 100 ms after the valve is actuated. In order to trigger water reward for the rewarded odorant the mouse must lick at least once during each 0.5 s block for four blocks in the response area.

Hilbert transform is used to calculate the theta phase (iv) and the amplitude envelope of higher oscillations such as high gamma (65–95 Hz) (red line in v).

The odorant is delivered at a random time 1–1.5 s after nose poke (the time course for odorant concentration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mice must decide to either lick a waterspout at least once during each 0.5 s bin in the 2 s response area (green blocks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to obtain a water reward for the rewarded odorant or refrain from licking for the unrewarded odorant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We did not punish for licking for the unrewarded odorant, and mice refrain because of the effort it takes to lick. Behavioral performance was termed naïve or proficient when their performance estimated in a 20-trial window was ≤65% for naïve and ≥80% for proficient. After three 20-trial blocks of proficient performance, the session was ended; valence was reversed the next day or another odorant was tested. We recorded the LFP using four tetrodes (16 electrodes) implanted in the OB, and we analyzed the data to determine whether information carried by cross-frequency coupling can encode for the contextual identity of the odorant for naïve or proficient mice. Importantly, reversal experiments from previous studies where we switched the rewarded and unrewarded odorants have shown that the power of the LFP in the OB and mitral/tufted cell spiking encodes for the <italic>contextual</italic> identity of the odorant (is the odorant rewarded?) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doucette and Restrepo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, when we refer to identity in this publication we do not mean the chemical identity of the odorant, we mean whether the odorant is rewarded or unrewarded. Finally, to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in oscillatory parameters estimated in this study the estimates were either averaged in the time period of odorant application (0.5 to 2.5 s after diverting the odorant to the odor delivery spout) or the statistical significance was evaluated for the entire time course with time points every 0.1 s using a generalized linear model (GLM, see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we complement testing of statistical significance using p values with estimation of bootstrapped confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Halsey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phase amplitude coupling analysis of the LFP recorded in the go no-go behavioral task</title><p>In order to understand whether odorant identity is encoded by cross-frequency coupling in the OB we characterized PAC, which is a cross-frequency coupling mechanism where high frequency oscillation bursts take place at specific phases of low frequency theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tort et al., 2010</xref>).

The strength of PAC was estimated as the modulation index (MI), a measure computed as the Kullback–Leibler (KL) distance to the uniform phase distribution normalized to range from 0 (uniform distribution) to 1 (sharp gamma bursts at a specific theta phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tort et al., 2010</xref>).

The AUC was normalized and it ranged from zero (random decoding at 50%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Ai</xref>) to 1 (100% decoding during the odor period, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1Aii</xref>). AUC is plotted for all odorant pairs for peak and trough PRP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> for theta/beta (i and ii) and theta/high gamma (iii and iv) for naïve (i,iii) and proficient (ii,iv) conditions.

Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows that the AUC was larger for Exp2 (GLM p value &lt; 0.001 for experiment, 6386 d.f.).</p><p>Finally, we asked the question whether decoding performance differs when mice make mistakes in the go-no go task. If PRP encodes for the chemical identity of the odorant we would expect that decoding performance would be similar between Hit/Miss and CR/FA during the first second of the trial when the animal keeps their head in the odor port. If PRP encodes for contextual odorant identity decoding performance would differ between correct responses (Hit and CR) and mistakes (Miss, FA) shortly after the animal detects the odorant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows the results of the per trial analysis of decoding performance for LDA with theta/beta PRP (i) and theta/high gamma PRP (ii) sorted by behavioral outcome. Interestingly, shortly after addition of the odorant there is a divergence in decoding performance between trials with correct decision (Hit, CR) and mistakes (Miss, FA). Shortly after addition of the odorant decoding performance for FA drops below 50% (it tends to encode for the opposite odor), and for Miss trials the decoder performs like the shuffled trials. Decoder performance increases above 50% for both FA and Miss towards the end of the trial. Taken together with the shift of PRP in the reversal experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) the difference in LDA encoding between correct trials and mistakes is further evidence that PRP encodes for the contextual identity of the odorant (as opposed to the chemical identity). A GLM analysis indicates that there are significant differences between all behavioral outcomes except for Hit vs. CR for theta/high gamma (p&lt;0.001 for all outcome pairs, except for Hit vs CR for theta/beta PRP that has p&lt;0.01 and Hit vs. CR for theta/high gamma that has p&gt;0.05, 2110 d.f.).

The 16 electrodes are closely spaced (12.5 μm diameter electrodes in the same tetrode are directly abutted against each other and tetrodes are separated by 100–200 μm in both preparations: Exp1 with optetrodes and Exp2 with tetrodes). Because of this close proximity the extracellular field potentials would not be expected to differ greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gold et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore the dimensionality of the PRP LFP space would be expected to be close to one. Interestingly, when the dimensionality was calculated on a per mouse basis where the maximum dimensionality (M) is 16 we found that the average dimensionality for theta/high gamma PRP LFP for electrodes in Exp2 was indeed close to one, but it was significantly higher (2-4) in Exp1, with the highest dimensionality for PRP LFP trough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1Ai</xref>, GLM p value &lt; 0.001 for peak vs. trough and Exp1 vs. Exp2, 379 d.f.).

Specifically, we asked whether information on contextual odorant identity conveyed by LFP power of high gamma and beta frequency oscillations of the OB differs when the downstream observer filters the input through different theta LFP phase windows. We focused on the OB where it has been suggested that amplitude modulation may be used by higher-order processing centers such as PC to decode stimulus identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Freeman and Schneider, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heck et al., 2019</xref>). We found that identity could not be decoded from beta or high gamma OB LFP power when the mouse was naïve to the identity of the reinforced odorant (left panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the contextual identity of the odorant could be decoded from the PRP after the animal learned to discriminate between the odorants (right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, decoding was more accurate when the high gamma LFP power was observed at the peak of the theta oscillation, but it was similar at both the peak and trough phases for beta LFP oscillations. LDA correctly identified the stimulus with a time course for decision-making similar to the behavioral readout (licking on the water-delivery spout, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, stimulus representation by theta phase-referenced beta and high gamma oscillations of the OB evolves over the course of learning. Importantly, our findings were replicated in two different experiments (Exp1 and Exp2) differing in genotype, electrode location, device implanted (tetrode or electrode) and odorant pairs used (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Table S1). We did find differences in measured parameters between experiments, and these are likely due to methodological differences between Exp1 and Exp2 such as electrode location and genotype. Regardless of the reason for differences between experiments it is important for this study that the findings on PRP are found for both experiments under substantially different experimental conditions. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that decoding of stimulus identity from theta phase-referenced high gamma oscillations, reflecting synchronized neuronal firing, changes with learning in brain areas involved in early sensory processing.</p><p>The importance of PAC in information processing is based on the notion that different information is carried at different phases of the slow carrier oscillation. This discretization of information is a potential mechanism for encoding short-term memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lisman and Idiart, 1995</xref>) and more broadly as a neural communication protocol, the theta-gamma neural code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hopfield, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lisman and Jensen, 2013</xref>). Circuit activation at theta frequency was discovered to be essential for long-term potentiation in the rabbit hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>), arguing that neural information transfer may go beyond mean rate codes and involve spike timing with respect to oscillatory timekeepers. Subsequent studies indicated that temporal windows set by theta cycles allow for local circuit interactions and a considerable degree of computational independence in subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>). For CA1, it was hypothesized that theta partitions the encoding of new information versus the retrieval of stored information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, optogenetic recruitment of fast spiking inhibition in CA1 delivered at specific theta phases altered murine performance in a spatial navigation task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). When the mice were encoding a location, triggering of inhibition of CA1 at theta peaks improved performance, whereas inhibition at theta troughs improved performance during the retrieval phase. Recently, age related cognitive decline in working memory in humans was reversed temporarily via transcranial alternating-current stimulation frequency-tuned to the endogenous theta peak frequency of each individual’s frontotemporal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>). It appears that working memory is undergirded by theta-gamma PAC and that inter-regional communication is facilitated by theta phase coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Daume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Reinhart and Nguyen, 2019</xref>). Thus, the theta LFP which has been cited as one of the most global oscillations in the brain acts as a timekeeper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>) that is coherent across numerous cortical and subcortical structures arguing for its role in transfer of discrete chunks of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here we asked whether odor identity information was carried at different phases of theta.

The OB circuit is characterized by beta and gamma oscillations nested in a slower theta carrier wave pertaining to respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buonviso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rebello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rojas-Líbano et al., 2014</xref>). However, Granger directionality analysis shows that the theta oscillation in the OB is also influenced by hippocampal slow oscillations indicating that the origin of OB slow carrier oscillations is complex, involving both respiration and centrifugal input from downstream brain regions whose relative contribution likely changes under different behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Nguyen Chi et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the classification of these two bandwidths as carrying learning vs. odor identity information is not always appropriate, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frederick et al.

We contributed to the understanding of which information is carried by different frequency oscillations by asking whether the high gamma and beta oscillations carry different information when they are observed within particular phase windows of the theta carrier wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We hypothesized that PAC may be used to convey olfactory stimulus information to theta phase-synchronized downstream regions like PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kepecs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lisman and Buzsáki, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that PAC changes in the OB during associative learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Peak angle variance increased for the unrewarded odorants with learning. The theta phase-referenced PRP of the high gamma and beta LFPs also follows this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), increasing for S+ and decreasing with S- over learning. The changes in PRP correlating with learning may reflect contrast enhancement that facilitates the discrimination between similar stimuli by a downstream observer. Neuronal adaptation to facilitate contrast enhancement has been shown at the level of the OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Haney et al., 2018</xref>), the glomerular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavarretta et al., 2016</xref>), and the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2019</xref>) of the OB. We speculate that the concurrent increase in PRP for S+ and decrease in PRP for S- reflects adaptational mechanisms in the OB to enhance contrast between similar stimuli with different associated values. Finally, given that there is coordination of oromotor actions through brainstem circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Moore et al., 2014</xref>), and that studies have shown development of coordinated sniffing and licking as rodents learn to differentiate odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lefèvre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rosero and Aylwin, 2011</xref>) it is likely that the changes found in PRP as the animals learn to differentiate the odorants reflect an interaction with changes in licking and sniffing.</p><p>To quantify whether these changes in PAC increased discriminability between odorants using PRP we asked whether the stimulus that was delivered could be decoded from PRP data. Previous investigations have decoded olfactory stimuli from spike counts aligned to sniffing in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gschwend et al., 2012</xref>), in the antennal lobe of the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Stopfer and Laurent, 1999</xref>), and M/T neural activity assayed through calcium transients in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2016</xref>), but trial classification via PAC remains unexplored. Here, we performed LDA on PRP data to determine whether a single hyperplane could differentiate between stimuli as the animals learned the task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicates that the identity of the stimuli cannot be decoded from PRP recorded in the naïve mice, but that the stimuli can be decoded when the mice learn to discriminate the odorants. Furthermore, decoding the stimuli from peak high gamma PRP is significantly better than trough PRP. Thus, decoding of the odorant identity by downstream observer using a phase window for the slow carrier oscillation could detect the identity of the odorants after the animal learns to differentiate between odors in the go no-go task. Finally, this study contributes to the mounting evidence that the OB is an important locus for learning-related activity changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Doucette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doucette and Restrepo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koldaeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We wondered how timing for decision-making would relate comparing stimulus decoding with PRP with decision-making estimated from the behavioral readout of the olfactory-driven decision in the go no-go task (differential licking between the two odorants). The time course for the behavioral decision, reflected in the graph of p value for differential licks, is overlaid by the p value time course for peak PRP decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right) with trough PRP lagging behind. Neither beta nor high gamma peak PRP p values are discriminable from lick p values in terms of decision time in this task. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, for proficient animals licking differs between odorants within about 0.5 s from stimulus onset, at the same time that PRP decoding becomes significant. This is slower than discrimination times for odorant responses recorded in mice performing two alternative forced choice odorant discrimination or receiving odors passively where discrimination takes place within the first respiratory cycle (~250 ms) after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Short and Wachowiak, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>). However, the 0.5 s decision-making time is consistent with studies with the go no-go task where there is not a strong motivation for the animal to stop licking for the unrewarded odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doucette and Restrepo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rinberg, 2006</xref>)—with the exception of rapid detection of optogenetic activation of glomerular input in the go no-go task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smear et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we conclude that PRP is an accurate reflection of decision-making in olfactory discrimination.</p><p>Interestingly, in contrast with theta/high gamma PRP where the decoding performance for peak and through differ substantially, for theta/beta PRP there is no difference in decoding performance between peak and trough (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii and 5Biv</xref>). Increases in OB beta LFP for rodents engaged in odorant discrimination tasks take place after the onset of changes in gamma LFP and it has been postulated that beta LFP represents systemwide coherent states perhaps conveying centrifugal modulation from downstream brain areas to the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">David et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frederick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kay, 2014</xref>). If beta oscillations indeed represent centrifugal feedback our findings suggest that centrifugal modulation does not differ through phases of the theta oscillation and would therefore excerpt modulation on high frequency circuit activity occurring at different theta phases. Here we show that peak-referenced high gamma oscillation power encodes for the contextual identity of the odorant (is the odorant rewarded?). What information could be conveyed at other theta phases is an open question. Perhaps asynchronous M/T firing carries chemical odorant information in the theta trough.</p><p>Finally, we turn to dimensionality. The measurements in the experiments presented here are inherently low dimensional because: 1) The animal is discriminating between two odors, and the behavior is constrained by the go no-go task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) and 2) While the number of independent degrees of freedom for inputs to the OB is potentially large (~2000 glomeruli), the four tetrodes are close together and they should sample a small subset of these input dimensions. Indeed, because the tetrodes are within 200 μm of each other (and electrodes are adjacent within tetrodes), the LFP recorded from each electrode is likely to be similar, assuming that the cellular milieu around the electrodes does not separate the inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gold et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the dimensionality measured from the 16 electrodes (four tetrodes) varies between 1 and 6 suggesting that subsets of electrodes are detecting different signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, when the mice learn to discriminate the dimensionality decreases in the presence of the relevant odorant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), suggesting that population representation is a modifiable aspect of OB processing. This likely reflects experience-dependent, attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Canas and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Niv et al., 2015</xref>). In the naïve state, relevant (rewarded) dimensions are unknown to the mouse, and a downstream structure sampling from the recorded population would receive ambiguous signaling in the presence of the rewarded odorant without decoding or reducing the input information. We find a large decrease in dimensionality post-learning, suggesting that OB now enhances a relevant and invariant signal to allow for unambiguous odor detection. Attention, guided by reward prediction error, likely biases/constrains the learning to the relevant dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Leong et al., 2017</xref>)—in this task, odor identity.</p><p>The changes in signal processing elicited by learning, habituation, and passive odorant exposure in the OB, the earliest processing center in the olfactory system, are remarkable. Why is processing in this circuit so plastic and influenced by centrifugal input from downstream targets, such as PC, and from a variety of neuromodulatory centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Linster and Cleland, 2016</xref>)? Likely the reason is that this processing center receives massive parallel glomerular input and projects M/T output of high dimensionality to downstream brain processing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chae et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, unsupervised learning modifying cellular interactions in the OB would increase dimensionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hiratani and Latham, 2019</xref>). Therefore, odors must be identified in the midst of a high dimensionality cocktail party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rokni et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the present data showing a large increase in the accuracy for decoding of contextual odor identity from the PRP as the animal learns to differentiate the odorants we speculate that when a subset of the degrees of freedom of the sensory input become behaviorally relevant, centrifugal feedback elicits supervised learning that results in a decrease in dimensionality of the output from the OB to downstream brain areas. Thus, the fact that peak theta-referenced high gamma power encodes information on whether the odorant is rewarded may simply reflect the fact that the transfer of sensory information on the rewarded odorant is being prioritized in the OB circuit. This would result in more accurate discrimination of the input channels that are relevant to the current task. Whether (and how) supervised learning-induced OB circuit plasticity results in a decrease in dimensionality of the output remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Reagent or <break/>resource</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Isoamyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#123-92-2</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ethyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 141-78-6</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Propyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 109-60-4</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Mineral oil</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 8042-47-5</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Acetophenone</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 98-86-2</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ethyl benzoate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# 93-89-0</td><td valign="top">Odorant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Nickel-chrome wire</td><td valign="top">Sandvik</td><td valign="top">Cat#PX000002</td><td valign="top">Tetrode fabrication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">16 Channel Electrode Interface Board</td><td valign="top">Neuralynx</td><td valign="top">EIB-16</td><td valign="top">Tetrode fabrication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">LFP Data</td><td valign="top">GigaDB</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.5524/100699">http://doi.org/10.5524/100699</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Losacco et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Analysis code</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Available on github and by request</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/restrepd/drgMaster">https://github.com/restrepd/drgMaster</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Mouse: C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Lab</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Male mice</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Mouse: Tg(Dbh-cre)KH212Gsat/Mmucd</td><td valign="top">Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center</td><td valign="top">032081-UCD, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC">MMRRC</ext-link></td><td valign="top">All sexes used</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Mouse: eNpHR3.0, 129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm39(CAG-hop/EYFP) Hze/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Lab</td><td valign="top">014539, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004633">SCR_004633</ext-link></td><td valign="top">All sexes used</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB_R2018a</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Illustrator</td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010279">SCR_010279</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Photoshop</td><td valign="top">Adobe</td><td valign="top">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014199">SCR_014199</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top">Mouse: OMP-hChR2V</td><td valign="top">In house</td><td valign="top">OMP-hChR2V</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2014</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The study was performed in two sets of experiments.

For optetrode fabrication the tetrode boards received the addition of a fiber optic cannula 105 μm in diameter (Thorlabs FG105UCA) with 1.25 mm OD ceramic ferrule (Precision Fiber Products) for coupling to a DPSS laser (473 nm, Shanghai Laser and Optics Century).

In the rest of the text we refer to the inserts as (op)tetrode with the understanding that optetrodes were implanted for Exp1 while optetrodes or tetrodes were implanted for Exp2.

Intraperitoneal ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively) was then administered along with 100 μl of 2% lidocaine injected subcutaneously over the skull. After the mouse was found to be unresponsive to a toe pinch, the animal’s head was then secured in the stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige SR-5M-HT) and the skull was leveled (≤50 μm difference DV between bregma and lambda). Gentamycin ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to maintain hydration. After incising the skin overlaying the skull, the periosteum was cleared with 15% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. A manipulator (Sutter MP-285) was zeroed at bregma and midline and the target location for OB implantation was marked with respect to bregma (Exp1: AP +4.28 mm, ML +0.4 mm, Exp2: AP +4.28 mm, ML +0.5 mm).</p><p>A craniotomy performed at this site (Marathon III drill) exposed dura mater which was removed prior to implantation. Another craniotomy was performed more caudally for implantation of one ground screw (Plastics1 00–96 × 1/16). The (op)tetrode was positioned above the craniotomy over the OB while the ground wire was wrapped around the ground screw with the connection coated in silver paint (SPI Flash-Dry silver conductive paint). After securing the ground screw to the skull, the (op)tetrodes were lowered into position at the rate of 1 mm/minute (Exp1: AP +4.28 mm, ML +0.4 mm, DV 0.53 mm, Exp2: AP +4.28 mm, ML +0.5 mm, DV 1.0 mm). After reaching the target depth, the optetrode was adhered to the skull with C and B Metabond, followed by Teets ‘Cold Cure’ dental cement. After curing (10 min), the (op)tetrode was detached from the manipulator, the animal was removed from the stereotax and received subcutaneous injections of carprofen (10 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) and recovered on a heating pad kept at 37°C.

During reinforced odorant delivery (lasting 2.5 s) they must lick a water delivery spout at least once during each of four 0.5 second-long response areas in order to register the decision as a Hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Licks were detected as electrical connectivity between the water spout and the ground plate on which they stand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Slotnick and Restrepo, 2005</xref>). If the mice licked during a rewarded odorant trial, they received ~10 μl water reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The mice learn to refrain from licking for the unrewarded odorant due to the unrewarded effort of sustained licking. For correct rejections mice leave the spout shortly after the last lick that takes place 0.5–1.8 s after odorant onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Performance was evaluated in blocks of 20 trials, with 10 S+ and 10 S- trials presented at random. Animals performed as many as 10 blocks per session. Sessions were terminated when animals demonstrated satiety/disengagement from the task or when they performed at or above 80% correct discrimination in three or more blocks in a session. For EAPAexp1, IAAPexp2 and EAPAexp2 once criterion was reached, the next session had reversed valence, meaning that the previous S+ became S- (and the previous S- became S+). This reversal disambiguates the identity of the odor from its valence. Data were analyzed for all odorant pair sessions, including isoamyl acetate vs. mineral oil. Data were analyzed within two performance windows: when the animal was performing below 65% (naïve) or above 80% (proficient). The data were also analyzed in the 65–80% performing window, and the results fell between the naïve and proficient windows (data not shown).</p><p>Odor stimulus delivery time was measured with a photoionization detector (miniPID, Aurora Scientific). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the time course for odorant concentration measured at the odor spout.

Hilbert transform established the theta phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Div</xref>) and, separately, the envelope for beta or high gamma (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dv</xref>). A plot of the distribution of beta/high gamma amplitude in 51 bins of the phase of theta (PAC) was plotted to gauge the strength of PAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To quantify the strength of PAC we calculated the MI estimating the KL distance to quantify the difference between the observed beta/high gamma amplitude distribution along the phase of theta from a uniform distribution. If PAC is non-existent, MI = 0, meaning the mean amplitude is distributed uniformly over theta phases, and if PAC is a delta function MI = 1.

This was repeated for all trials and was performed separately for peak and trough PRP, and for analysis where the identity of the odorants was shuffled. LDA and dimensionality analysis were performed either on a per-mouse basis where the input was the PRP recorded from 16 electrodes, or on pooled mouse data where the input was the PRP recorded from 16 x N electrodes where N is the number of mice. For pooled mouse analysis a pooled response vector was therefore created by concatenating across animals and the number of trials <italic>n</italic>, was determined by the session with the lowest number of trials for a single odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Dimensionality</title><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Litwin-Kumar et al.

This paper presents new evidence to provide support for this hypothesis. The authors report that the theta phase-modulated amplitude of beta and gamma oscillations in the olfactory bulb can be used to discriminate between odorants after learning but not before. This study implies that certain aspects of oscillations that have been reported in memory systems of the brain (e.g., chunking of information within different phases of the theta oscillation in the hippocampus) also apply in the olfactory bulb, an early sensory structure and has implications for the universality of these principles throughout various systems of the brain. Scientists interested in learning and memory, the functions of oscillations, and neuronal ensemble coding of sensory stimuli will benefit from reading this work. An interesting future direction will be to assess the putative interaction between the effects reported here and sniffing patterns, considering that previous studies have shown that sniffing induces oscillations in the olfactory bulb and that there is an interaction between sniffing patterns and behavioral performance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Learning improves decoding of odor identity with phase-referenced oscillations in the olfactory bulb&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

These results have implications for how sensory-guided decision making may be orchestrated in the olfactory system. The hypothesis that the phase relationship between high frequency oscillations nested into lower frequency waves, or cross-frequency coupling, would carry coding information is very interesting and has been understudied in the olfactory system. Beyond applicability within the olfactory field itself, these studies hint that certain aspects of oscillations in more &quot;central&quot; established systems (like the chunking of information within different phases of the theta oscillation) also apply in the olfactory bulb, an early sensory structure, which has implications for the universality of these principles.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a lack of clarity in the presentation. Overall, the organization of the manuscript and the presentation of findings make it difficult for a broad readership to follow the logic of experiments and the analyses. The description of the results and figure panels jump around rather than flow through the figure. Further, many of the analyses lack sufficient motivation and interpretation within in the Results section. Thus, it is often difficult to understand why the analysis was done and what the outcome means. Revision of the manuscript should keep these general points in mind. Specific comments related to this general point are listed below:</p><p>a) Results section: There needs to be more description about the similarities and differences of Exp1 and Exp2 than just electrodes and recording depth. There is not enough information to determine if the results of both studies should be similarly interpreted. The findings in Exp2 appear to be stronger than Exp1, but this is not discussed further. The difference between Exp1 and Exp2 may arise because group 1 is composed of mice carrying Cre recombinase that is likely to change neurons physiology even in the absence of any recombination. This possibility should be mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><p>b) There are many times throughout the figures where findings are significant, but this is not indicated in the figure (i.e. with a symbol) and only stated in the figure caption or main text. It would be helpful if significant findings were presented uniformly throughout.</p><p>c) A more basic explanation of &quot;dimensionality&quot; and how this concept applies to the olfactory system would likely benefit readers who are unfamiliar with this concept. We suggest that some discussion of this in the Introduction as well as the Results section would be helpful.</p><p>d) From the start of the Results section, please mention the time window relative to poke from which data were analyzed.</p><p>e) Figure 1D: The data are presented like the x-axes are all the same and all data presented correspond to the expansion shown from Di to Dii. However, there are 16 cycles in Dii and Dv that don't line up and only 8 or 9 cycles in Diii and Div (these also don't appear to align). Did the timescale of the axis change?</p><p>f) Figure 2H: This figure is too small and difficult to work through. The main finding appears to be related to MI for S+&gt;S- in trained animals across data sets. There is no consistent change in MI for S+ or S- with learning. There is a consistent increase in phase variance for S- with learning. These findings should be summarized somehow in a straightforward and easier to understand way.</p><p>g) Related to the above point, in Figure 2H, it seems that MI and peak variance evolution during learning are different for the test IAMO for both Exp1 and Exp2. This pair has the singularity of being between an odorant and the vehicle and not between 2 odorants. Could the difference be due to the fact that in this case the mouse has to detect the odorant but does not need to identify/discriminate it? Is the PAC different when the S+ is mineral oil compared to isoamyl acetate?</p><p>h) Figure 5, especially 5D, and its/their results are difficult to follow meaningfully. Please elaborate more upon what is being shown. Perhaps better defining &quot;decision time&quot; would serve well since it appears this is in reference to the LDA vs the animal's actual decision.</p><p>i) Subsection “Peak angle variance decreases for S+ and/or increases for S- when the animals learn to differentiate odorants in the go-no go task”: Make it clear that this is PAC for theta-gamma in this section. Overall, the treatment of theta-gamma versus theta-beta PAC is not consistent. The focus seems to be mainly on theta-gamma but occasionally beta is added in for comparison. Currently, this is more distracting than meaningful. PAC changes over learning seems different between theta/beta and theta/high gamma. Contrarily to the effect observed for high gamma (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1), it is interesting to see that mean MI for theta/beta (Figure 2Hi) increases with learning for both S+ and S-. How does one interpret this difference between the MI for theta/beta and theta/ high gamma relationship? Considering the two different sources (OB vs. feedback) of these oscillations, their potential phase differences with theta, and the capacity for population activity that supports them to be differentially processing information, it would strengthen the study to compare and discuss theta-gamma versus theta-beta PAC more concretely and clearly.</p><p>j) Subsection “Dimensionality of PRP LFP space decreases when the animal learns to discriminate the odorants” &quot;evidence for a learned tightening of dimensionality for the odor representation manifold&quot; Please clarify what is meant by odor representation manifold. This is interesting but not very clear.</p><p>k) In several other instances, the text/significance indicators on figures and the graphs themselves are quite small and difficult to see (e.g. Figure 3D-F).</p><p>2 Some parts of the methodology are not described in sufficient detail. Specific examples are as follows:a) The behavioral methodology is unclear with respect to the data that is analyzed. Is it that the animals are trained on the go-no go task with odor versus blank, then transitioned to S+/S-? Does learning correspond to the task part or just the new odor sets once the task is learned? The methods section is vague on these details.</p><p>b) All statistical comparisons are made using a GLM. This is not standard and requires more explanation and justification than provided. It would be helpful to state what significance and degrees of freedom mean in this respect.</p><p>3) It is frequently stated that decoding odor &quot;identity&quot; is enhanced with learning. It is not apparent from the data that this true. There is evidence that the contingency of an odor (rewarded S+ versus unrewarded S-) is decoded. The change in PRP upon odor presentation resembles a binary change in state (high for S+ and low for S-). However, it is not clear that this is truly odor &quot;identity&quot; specific. Specific points related to this concern are listed below:a) Would a decoder trained from data for one odor pair be proficient in decoding data from another odor pair in the same mouse? If so, the information carried is the correlation of the odor with reward (or not) rather than the specific odor itself. This would also be interesting but phrased differently.</p><p>b) It is unclear whether the PRP in proficient mice reflects the identity of the odorant rather than the fact that when smelling the odorant the animal is engaged in a focused activity if licking for a reward independently of the odorant identity, for the following reasons:i) According to the examples of S+ stimulations shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3, before the odorant onset, there is no strong oscillatory activity. The activity that start when mice are asked to give their answer (licking) seems to be long lasting. This activity lasts for seconds after the animal already gave his response to the stimulus (more than 2 seconds after odorant offset).</p><p>ii) The analysis encompasses a long time period (2.5 sec) during which animals display very different behavior between S+ and S- stimuli. Indeed, in the case of S+ stimulus, animals are actively engaged in the action of licking in order to receive the reward. This is very clear from the Figure 5A, B and D in proficient animals: the fact they start to actively lick as early as at 0.5 sec after the odorant onset show that they have already performed the discrimination. Whereas for S- stimulus, once they have identified the odorant, they can behave in many different ways, and I assume they are able to explore the room. How long did mice stay in the odorant port for no-go trials?</p><p>iii) The breathing during the focus action of licking in order to get the reward is very different from breathing during exploration. Can the licking-associated breathing by itself change the parameters measured in the study. In particular I am thinking of theta amplitude (Figure 2D) and frequency that could match the licking frequency. If the respiratory rhythm varies between S+ and S- trials, then it is likely to also change properties of high gamma rhythm and thus the PRP particularly for high gamma. Did you control for the breathing changes?</p><p>iv) The perfect correlation between peak PRP and decision making could also mean that PRP results from the action of licking vs. not licking in proficient mice and the fact that in proficient mice almost all the trials are correctly answered, limiting the variability.</p><p>4) It would strengthen the decoding and decision-making arguments if the linear decoding accuracy and behavioral performance per trial were correlated. Likewise, for LDA and lick timing on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>5) The authors clearly state the fact that the data were acquired from two separate experiments/groups of mice, each with different probe designs and different implantation coordinates. It's great that the authors are forthcoming with the fact that these experiments yielded different results on some occasions (i.e. higher PAC strength for theta/beta and theta/high gamma in the second experiment, as pointed out in Figure 2). What would be nice would be further consideration/discussion on possible reasons why these differences may have arisen. Similarly, some discussion of why different results were seen for different odor pairs is warranted.</p><p>6) It appears that theta-gamma PAC does not consistently change in for S+, although PRP does increase modestly. In contrast, it is potentially more interesting that PAC for S- may actually decrease over the course of learning (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) consistent with the increase in phase variance. This may be more closely related to the large decreases in PRP as well. Why wasn't this explored more? The emphasis seems to focus &quot;increased&quot; PAC and PRP for rewarded S+ (i.e. Discussion section).</p><p>7) The dimensionality reduction findings are not convincing and do not appear to add much to the study. Reduction is only significant when pooled across animals and Exp1 and Exp2. It is not clear how this should be interpreted.</p><p>8) Are beta and high gamma oscillations occurring at the same time during the course of the trial or is there an alternation of the 2 rhythms?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52583.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a lack of clarity in the presentation. Overall, the organization of the manuscript and the presentation of findings make it difficult for a broad readership to follow the logic of experiments and the analyses. The description of the results and figure panels jump around rather than flow through the figure. Further, many of the analyses lack sufficient motivation and interpretation within in the Results section. Thus, it is often difficult to understand why the analysis was done and what the outcome means. Revision of the manuscript should keep these general points in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Results section to provide better motivation and interpretation of the analyses. In addition, we have modified the text and figures to provide more continuous flow through the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments related to this general point are listed below:</p><p>a) Results section: There needs to be more description about the similarities and differences of Exp1 and Exp2 than just electrodes and recording depth. There is not enough information to determine if the results of both studies should be similarly interpreted. The findings in Exp 2 appear to be stronger than Exp1, but this is not discussed further. The difference between Exp1 and Exp2 may arise because group 1 is composed of mice carrying Cre recombinase that is likely to change neurons physiology even in the absence of any recombination. This possibility should be mentioned in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. The sentence in the Results section caused the reader to think that we thought that differences between experiments were due to electrode location. It was not our intent to do this. Indeed, genotype can influence physiological and behavioral results, but ground truth is neither C57BL/6, nor Cre mice. Importantly, the findings are statistically significant for both Exp1 and Exp2. Although the differences do tend to be larger for Exp2 it is our opinion that discussing whether this is due to the number of animals used, the location of the electrodes, the odorant pairs used or the genotypes is not granted because it would be too speculative. Instead, we state in the discussion that obtaining statistically significant results for both experiments, in the face of numerous experimental differences, is a strength of the study.</p><p>We have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>We have updated Supplementary file 1 to include the genotype per experiment and we have replaced the sentence with: “As shown in Table S1 the two experiments differed in electrode locations, mouse genotype, device implantation (tetrode vs. optetrode), and odorant pairs used (see also Methods).”</p><p>We have added a sentence to the Discussion section: “Importantly, our findings were replicated in two different experiments (Exp1 and Exp2) differing in genotype, electrode location, device implanted (tetrode or electrode) and odorant pairs used (see Table S1). […] Regardless of the reason for differences between experiments it is important for this study that the findings on PRP are found for both experiments under substantially different experimental conditions.”</p><p>We have added the following sentence to the legend for Supplementary file 1: “Note: Cre expression can affect physiological parameters and therefore, the differences found between experiments in this publication can be due to Cre expression (Harno et al., 2013). However, it is not evident to us which of the methodological differences between experiments contributes to statistical differences in measured parameters.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) There are many times throughout the figures where findings are significant, but this is not indicated in the figure (i.e. with a symbol) and only stated in the figure caption or main text. It would be helpful if significant findings were presented uniformly throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We added asterisks to all bar graphs when we found significance in post hoc tests. We have not added significance asterisks to the cumulative probability histograms or time courses because this is awkward when you have several histograms in a plot. The significance p values for the cumulative probability histograms are in both the legend and the text in the results. In the literature we do not find asterisks for cumulative probability histograms.

We have thoroughly edited the subsection “Decision-making takes place at the same time for peak PRP LDA and lic”. This section now starts with a definition of what we mean with this decision-making time, and how it is calculated for licks and PRP LDA. In addition, we simplified Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p> <italic>i) Subsection “</italic>Peak angle variance decreases for S+ and/or increases for S- when the animals learn to differentiate odorants in the go-no go task”<italic>: Make it clear that this is PAC for theta-gamma in this section.

We found that, in contrast to theta-gamma, theta-beta PRP does not differ between peak and trough. BETA LFP has been postulated to convey centrifugal modulation from downstream brain areas to the OB. Our findings suggest that centrifugal modulation does not differ through phases of the theta oscillation and would therefore excerpt modulation on high frequency circuit activity occurring at different theta phases.

It is not apparent from the data that this true. There is evidence that the contingency of an odor (rewarded S+ versus unrewarded S-) is decoded. The change in PRP upon odor presentation resembles a binary change in state (high for S+ and low for S-). However, it is not clear that this is truly odor &quot;identity&quot; specific. Specific points related to this concern are listed below:</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, we did not mean to imply that the term identity was chemical identity of the odorant, but rather contextual identity (is the odor rewarded?). We have added these sentences at the beginning of the Results section to make this point clear:</p><p>“Importantly, reversal experiments from previous studies where we switched the rewarded and unrewarded odorants have shown that the power of the LFP in the OB and mitral/tufted cell spiking encodes for the <italic>contextual</italic> identity of the odorant (is the odorant rewarded?)(Doucette et al., 2011; Doucette and Restrepo, 2008; Li et al., 2015; Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018). Therefore, when we refer to identity in this publication, we do not mean the chemical identity of the odorant, we mean whether the odorant is rewarded or unrewarded.”</p><p>In addition, we now use the term “contextual identity” throughout, including the Abstract. Finally, we include a new Figure 4 described in subsection “Peak phase referenced power increases for S+ and decreases for S- over learning” showing that when odorant valence is reversed PRP switches indicating that PRP encodes for contextual identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Would a decoder trained from data for one odor pair be proficient in decoding data from another odor pair in the same mouse? If so, the information carried is the correlation of the odor with reward (or not) rather than the specific odor itself. This would also be interesting but phrased differently.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the new Figure 4 peak PRP switches when the rewarded odorant is reversed. Thus, peak PRP encodes for contextual identity (is this the rewarded odorant?). As explained in point 3 above, at the beginning of the results we make it clear that when we refer to identity we do not refer to the chemical identity of the odorant, we refer to contextual identity (is this the rewarded odorant?).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is unclear whether the PRP in proficient mice reflects the identity of the odorant rather than the fact that when smelling the odorant the animal is engaged in a focused activity if licking for a reward independently of the odorant identity, for the following reasons:</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in point 3 above, we did not imply that PRP reflects the chemical identity. We have added two sentences to the Results section making this clear at the onset of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) According to the examples of S+ stimulations shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3, before the odorant onset, there is no strong oscillatory activity. The activity that start when mice are asked to give their answer (licking) seems to be long lasting. This activity lasts for seconds after the animal already gave his response to the stimulus (more than 2 seconds after odorant offset).</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, the activity lasts for a few seconds, and this raises the question whether this is an odorant response compared to reflecting centrifugal input to the OB. As stated above, our data indicate that PRP encodes for the contextual identity of the odorant.</p><p>However, we would like to remark that the long lasting time course of oscillatory activity does not necessarily imply that the response is not an odorant response because: (1) Our olfactometer is designed for fast odorant onset (with a time constant of 100 msec), but the decrease in odorant concentration takes place in a few seconds (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1). (2) The odorant concentration is relatively high, several orders of magnitude above the threshold for detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The analysis encompasses a long time period (2.5 sec) during which animals display very different behavior between S+ and S- stimuli. Indeed, in the case of S+ stimulus, animals are actively engaged in the action of licking in order to receive the reward. This is very clear from the Figure 5A, B and D in proficient animals: the fact they start to actively lick as early as at 0.5 sec after the odorant onset show that they have already performed the discrimination. Whereas for S- stimulus, once they have identified the odorant, they can behave in many different ways, and I assume they are able to explore the room. How long did mice stay in the odorant port for no-go trials?</p></disp-quote><p>For the S- mice left the spout shortly after the last lick. As shown in Figure 5B the last lick takes place at 0.5-1.8 sec after odorant onset. This is now sated in the Materials and methods section. We agree with the reviewer: in this go-no go task the animal is not motivated to leave the port immediately after detection of the S- odorant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The breathing during the focus action of licking in order to get the reward is very different from breathing during exploration. Can the licking-associated breathing by itself change the parameters measured in the study. In particular I am thinking of theta amplitude (Figure 2D) and frequency that could match the licking frequency. If the respiratory rhythm varies between S+ and S- trials, then it is likely to also change properties of high gamma rhythm and thus the PRP particularly for high gamma. Did you control for the breathing changes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Active sniffing impacts odor responses through top-down and bottom-up mechanisms as shown, for example by Jordan and co-workers in a recent study (Jordan et al., 2018) and licks and sniffs are likely coordinated in the proficient animal given the fact that there is coordination of oromotor actions through brainstem circuits (Moore et al., 2014).</p><p>We did not measure breathing in this study. However, in past studies we have noticed close alignment of sniffs with theta LFP in the proficient animal in this go-no go task (Figure 5 of (Li et al., 2015)). With respect to the relationship of PRP power and licks, this is again an interesting question. Given the fact that there is coordination of oromotor actions through brainstem circuits (Moore et al., 2014) there is likely an alignment of licks, sniffs, whisker movement and theta LFP power when the animal becomes proficient. Indeed, studies in medial prefrontal cortex have shown that the LFP in the theta (6-12Hz) bandwidth is phase-locked to licks, even when the animal performs dry licks in the go-no go task (Amarante et al., 2017). Furthermore, in our past publication using Exp1 data, we performed a thorough analysis of event-related LFP power locked to the onset of the licks and we show that this measure changes as the animal learns and when we modulate noradrenergic input to the bulb through optogenetics (see Figure 7 in (Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018)). This published analysis of lick-related LFP power is directly relevant to the reviewer’s question on the relationship of licks and oscillations. In our opinion a more thorough study of the relationship of licks and oscillations is granted, but is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) The perfect correlation between peak PRP and decision making could also mean that PRP results from the action of licking vs. not licking in proficient mice and the fact that in proficient mice almost all the trials are correctly answered, limiting the variability.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that this can be the case (point iii above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would strengthen the decoding and decision making arguments if the linear decoding accuracy and behavioral performance per trial were correlated. Likewise, for LDA and lick timing on a trial-by-trial basis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a trial-by-trial analysis of decoding performance and we have sorted the data according to the different behavioral outcomes. Figure 5E shows the time course for decoding performance analyzed on a trial-by-trial basis sorted by behavioral outcome (Hit, Miss, CR and FA, as well as shuffled). These results are presented in subsection “Linear discriminant analysis classifies stimuli using PRP”. Interestingly, shortly after addition of the odorant decoding performance decreases below 50% for FAs. This is further evidence that PRP does not encode chemical identity of the odorant.</p><p>We did not perform the lick/LDA analysis because we do not understand what the reviewers mean by a trial-by-trial “LDA and lick timing analysis”. In addition, we have published a study of lick-related LFP power using the data in Exp2 (Figure 7 of (Ramirez-Gordillo et al., 2018), see response to point 3.b.iii above). Furthermore, we would like to ask the reviewers to consider our opinion that, while interesting, a full study of the relation of licks to oscillations is beyond the scope of this manuscript (see response to point 3.b.iii above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors clearly state the fact that the data were acquired from two separate experiments/groups of mice, each with different probe designs and different implantation coordinates. It's great that the authors are forthcoming with the fact that these experiments yielded different results on some occasions (i.e. higher PAC strength for theta/beta and theta/high gamma in the second experiment, as pointed out in Figure 2). What would be nice would be further consideration/discussion on possible reasons why these differences may have arisen. Similarly, some discussion of why different results were seen for different odor pairs is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the answer to point 1a above. There are many differences between experiments: electrode locations, mouse genotype, device implantation (tetrode vs. optetrode), and odorant pairs used. Thus, while, for example, electrode location may explain the differences in measured variables, we think it is too speculative to suggest that the differences are due to one parameter. More importantly, the key findings are statistically significant for both experiments, and this is a strength of this study.</p><p>In the Discussion section we state: “Importantly, our findings were replicated in two different experiments (Exp1 and Exp2) differing in genotype, electrode location, device implanted (tetrode or electrode) and odorant pairs used (see Supplementary file 1). We did find differences in measured parameters between experiments, and these are likely due to methodological differences between Exp1 and Exp2 such as electrode location and genotype. Regardless of the reason for differences between experiments it is important for this study that the findings on PRP are found for both experiments under substantially different experimental conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It appears that theta-gamma PAC does not consistently change in for S+, although PRP does increase modestly. In contrast, it is potentially more interesting that PAC for S- may actually decrease over the course of learning (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) consistent with the increase in phase variance. This may be more closely related to the large decreases in PRP as well. Why wasn't this explored more? The emphasis seems to focus &quot;increased&quot; PAC and PRP for rewarded S+ (i.e. Discussion section).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not mean to focus on an increase in PRP for S+. Indeed, the sentence in the Discussion section also mentioned the decrease in PRP for S-. We have edited the sentence and performed a search/edit of the word “increase” in the manuscript. The sentence has been modified to: “We speculate that the concurrent increase in PRP for S+ and decrease in PRP for S- reflects adaptational mechanisms in the OB to enhance contrast between similar stimuli with different associated values.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The dimensionality reduction findings are not convincing and do not appear to add much to the study. Reduction is only significant when pooled across animals and Exp1 and Exp2. It is not clear how this should be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the manuscript we did not present the results on dimensionality clearly, and there was a mistake on the statistical significance of the per experiment data. We have re-analyzed the data for both per mouse and pooled mouse data and we have generated new figures. As described in the revised Results section the increased decrease in dimensionality in proficient mice is significant for both per mouse and pooled animal data for both Exp1 and Exp2. This makes an important contribution to understand a sensory system that deals with high dimensional input because it indicates that learning focuses neural information processing on contextually relevant inputs. We have revised the Introduction and Discussion section to provide a clear presentation of the relevance of the analysis on dimensionality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Are beta and high gamma oscillations occurring at the same time during the course of the trial or is there an alternation of the 2 rhythms?</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with reports in the literature from, for example (Buonviso et al., 2003; Frederick et al., 2016), we did notice a slight delay of the increase in beta power compared to gamma. However, this delay was not as marked as reported in the literature and we did not focus on beta/gamma timing in this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
