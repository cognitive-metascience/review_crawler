pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36258.001</object-id><p>The transcription factor ASCIZ (ATMIN, ZNF822) has an unusually high number of recognition motifs for the product of its main target gene, the hub protein LC8 (DYNLL1). Using a combination of biophysical methods, structural analysis by NMR and electron microscopy, and cellular transcription assays, we developed a model that proposes a concerted role of intrinsic disorder and multiple LC8 binding events in regulating LC8 transcription. We demonstrate that the long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of ASCIZ binds LC8 to form a dynamic ensemble of complexes with a gradient of transcriptional activity that is inversely proportional to LC8 occupancy. The preference for low occupancy complexes at saturating LC8 concentrations with both human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ indicates that negative cooperativity is an important feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions. The prevalence of intrinsic disorder and multivalency among transcription factors suggests that formation of heterogeneous, dynamic complexes is a widespread mechanism for tuning transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36258.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins help to regulate almost every process in the body, and come in various forms, sizes and purposes. Cells contain thousands of different proteins, but not every protein is needed at all times. To create new proteins, the information on a gene first needs to be transcribed into RNA (template molecules of the DNA) in a process known as transcription. A complex machinery inside the cell then uses the copy as a template to assemble the protein.</p><p>So-called transcription factors (also proteins) can switch the copying process on or off by binding to the start point of a gene. They can act alone or in complex with other proteins. The transcription factor called ASCIZ, for example, helps to regulate the production of a protein called LC8. LC8 attaches to more than 100 different proteins and plays an important role in many cell processes. Therefore, fine-tuning its production is essential.</p><p>The shape of a protein is critical to its purpose. Like most proteins, transcription factors are made up of chains of amino acids that fold into a specific three-dimensional (3D) structurewith a region that recognizes and binds to a specific DNA sequence. But many transcription factors also contain flexible, ‘disordered’ regions that do not fold into a rigid 3D shape. These may help to control the activity of genes, but their exact role is unclear.</p><p>ASCIZ contains an exceptionally long, disordered region that has multiple positions for binding LC8 along its chain. Previous research has shown that ASCIZ binds to the LC8 gene and increases transcription to produce more LC8 proteins. Once the protein levels are high enough, LC8 is thought to bind to the disordered region of ASCIZ and switch off transcription. Human ASCIZ proteins have 11 binding sites for LC8 molecules, while fruit flies have seven. Until now it was not clear why so many different binding sites exist.</p><p>To address this question, Clark et al. combined biophysical, structural and molecular biology techniques to analyze proteins from humans and fruit flies and to test their role in human cells. This revealed that LC8 and ASCIZ form a dynamic mixture of complexes, instead of a single fully-occupied complex. As the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ increased, the rate of transcription dropped. However, all of the binding sites were rarely fully occupied. Instead, three to four attached LC8 molecules seemed to be sufficient to ensure that LC8 levels remain balanced. When the number of LC8 molecules exceeded this value, the attachment rate for additional LC8 slowed down. So, even when there was an excess of LC8, most of the human ASCIZ binding sites were only partially filled. This way, the production of LC8 proteins was slowed, rather than fully shut down. As a result, the cells were able to fine-tune the transcription rate of LC8 and maintain a stable and balanced pool of these proteins.</p><p>This work suggests that disordered regions on transcription factors could help to keep cellular systems steady in the face of changing conditions. In the future, the combination of methods used here could reveal new information about other proteins with disordered regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>Intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>multivalency</kwd><kwd>dynamic complexes</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1026125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heierhorst</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1022469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heierhorst</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Victorian State Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Infrastructure Support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heierhorst</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM124779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reichow</surname><given-names>Steve L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-084276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbar</surname><given-names>Elisar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>College of Science at Oregon State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Impact Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbar</surname><given-names>Elisar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of multiple LC8 copies to the intrinsically disordered region of the transcription factor ASCIZ exemplifies a new and potentially widespread molecular mechanism for negative feedback regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of transcriptional activity is essential for every biological process. Common mechanisms for regulation include post-translational modifications and/or cooperativity among multiple activators and repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee and Zhang, 2003</xref>). Some transcription factors contain multiple regulatory sites for either post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meek and Anderson, 2009</xref>) or binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</xref>), and their activity is thus tuned by the combined action of these components. Recent studies have revealed a high degree of intrinsic disorder in transcription factors, indicating that the inherent dynamical behavior harbored by these structures is critical for these regulatory events to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minezaki et al., 2006</xref>). Our developing understanding suggests that the intrinsically disordered domains in transcription factors may provide a multivalent platform for the recruitment of regulatory binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Currie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shammas, 2017</xref>). While the functional consequence of multivalent binding to an intrinsically disordered region has been described for a few transcription systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dyson and Wright, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uversky et al., 2009</xref>), it remains unclear for the vast majority of cases.</p><p>Human ASCIZ (ATMIN-Substrate Chk-Interacting Zn<sup>2+</sup> finger) is an 88 kDa protein that has recently been identified as a transcription factor for the hub protein, LC8 (dynein light chain 8)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>). Mice with mutations in ASCIZ that prevent LC8 transcription die in late embryogenesis and exhibit serious developmental defects in kidneys and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goggolidou et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goggolidou et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jurado et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ knockouts die in early embryogenesis and localized knockdowns using RNAi show mitotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaytseva et al., 2014</xref>). Mutant phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, developing mouse B lymphocytes, and cultured cells are rescued by ectopic overexpression of LC8, demonstrating that the observed defects of ASCIZ knockouts are due to ASCIZ regulation of LC8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goggolidou et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jurado et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaytseva et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it has recently been shown that a conditional knockout of LC8 almost perfectly copies the corresponding phenotypes of ASCIZ knockouts in mouse B cell development and B cell lymphomagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">King et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>LC8 is a highly conserved 20.6 kDa protein homodimer (10.3 kDa monomer) that facilitates self-association of its primarily disordered partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbar and Nyarko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). LC8 binding is associated with a range of cellular processes, from cell division to apoptosis, underscoring LC8’s essential role as a regulatory hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puthalakath et al., 1999</xref>). LC8 preferentially binds to a 10-amino acid motif in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing highly conserved TQT residues at positions 7–9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rapali et al., 2011b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In complex with LC8, the otherwise intrinsically disordered motif adopts a ß-strand conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Analysis of the 11 crystal structures of LC8 bound to short peptides containing the motif explains why the TQT residues are essential for binding: the Q is involved in interactions with both LC8 subunits in the dimer, while both T’s are fully buried and thus evolutionarily constrained. In these interactions, TQT acts as the motif anchor while the other seven highly variable motif residues modulate affinity, as described in the <italic>anchored flexibility model</italic> of LC8 motif recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2016</xref>). LC8 binds one motif in each of its two symmetrical binding grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), creating an IDP duplex that serves as a bivalent scaffold. This scaffold aids in higher order complex assembly by promoting binding of other proteins, including additional LC8 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), and enhancing self-association and oligomerization processes that often involve coiled-coil formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kidane et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, the number of experimentally characterized LC8 partners has risen to more than 40, and prediction methods indicate that dozens more may specifically bind LC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rapali et al., 2011b</xref>). Gaining insight into how LC8 interacts with partner proteins, and how LC8 levels in the cell are balanced, is therefore paramount to understanding the regulation of many cellular processes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36258.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LC8 dimerizes its protein partners</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ribbon diagram of dimeric LC8, where each monomer is colored a different shade of blue and bound to a representative peptide in yellow (PDB 5E0L).

Although some LC8 partners have multiple recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fejtova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stelter et al., 2007</xref>) (Nucleoporin Nup159 has 5, Chica and Bassoon each has 3), human ASCIZ contains 11 functional LC8 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapali et al., 2011a</xref>), the most by far of any partner protein identified to date. This enrichment in LC8-binding sites is conserved throughout the animal kingdom, underscoring the importance of multiple motifs in ASCIZ function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Cell culture transcription assays demonstrate that ASCIZ regulates LC8 transcription via a system of negative autoregulation, for which the mechanism is not well understood. Disruption of the ASCIZ/LC8 interaction via mutation of the TQT sites results in an increased level of LC8 transcription, while overexpression of LC8 decreases transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>). This observation led to the hypothesis that ASCIZ acts as a sensor for cellular LC8 and regulates LC8 transcription levels according to cellular needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>). As LC8 expression levels vary among tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>) and LC8 overexpression enhances the survival and proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vadlamudi et al., 2004</xref>), regulation of LC8 levels is critical for cellular health and homeostasis. However, while high levels of LC8 inhibit ASCIZ transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>), it is not known how this activity is controlled at the molecular level nor the requirement for multiple binding sites.</p><p>In this work, we use a combination of biophysical, structural, and molecular biology tools to explore the relationship between ASCIZ multivalency and LC8 transcription. We show that human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ bind to multiple LC8 dimers simultaneously in both a positively and negatively cooperative fashion, enabling the formation of a dynamic equilibrium of complexes, of which low occupancy intermediates are highly populated. We propose that this dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for transcriptional regulation and validate the main aspects of our hypothesis via transcriptional assays with human ASCIZ. These observations support a novel model of autoregulation, whereby ASCIZ engages in a dynamic equilibrium of multivalent interactions that tune the level of ASCIZ transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unbound ASCIZ is a primarily disordered monomer</title><p>The 45 kDa <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ protein, dASCIZ, is predicted to contain four Zn-finger motifs at the N-terminus followed by a 243-amino acid long region of intrinsic disorder.

When unbound, dLBD and LC8 each migrate as a single band. When LC8 is added to dLBD at a 1:1 molar ratio, the band for free LC8 disappears, and the complexes formed migrate above LC8, as a diffuse band likely corresponding to two dLBD chains bound to two or more LC8 dimers (since some free dLBD persists). As the molar ratio is increased, the diffuse upper band becomes a dark smear, free LC8 accumulates in a pronounced dark band, and the free dLBD band disappears. We think the most likely explanation is that the decreasing mobility of the upper edge of the smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed. Unbound LC8 is clearly visible at ratios ≥ 1:4, indicating that a pool of free LC8 accumulates even at conditions well below LC8 saturation of dLBD.</p><p>We similarly assessed the gel mobility of complexes formed by LC8 and the LC8-binding domain of human ASCIZ (hLBD), which contains 11 TQT motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rapali et al., 2011a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Very similar behavior is observed for hLBD, although the gel mobility of hLBD bands is much lower than the mobility of dLBD bands due to molecular sieving of the much larger hLBD (53 kDa) compared to dLBD (17 kDa). Molecular sieving is the dominate effect on hLBD mobility as both hLBD and dLBD are disordered and highly extended and have a pI of ~4. As LC8 is added to hLBD, the free hLBD band disappears and a lower mobility smear becomes increasingly evident. Decreasing mobility of the upper smear indicates increasing sizes of the complexes formed, while the appearance of a bands migrating the same as free LC8 at ratios ≥ 1:4 indicates the presence of a pool of free LC8 well below LC8 saturation of hLBD. Together the gel titration data for dLBD and hLBD suggest that hLBD:LC8 complexes form a dynamic ensemble with varying levels of LC8 occupancy in which lower occupancy forms are favored.</p><p>Titration of the hLBD with LC8 by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) supports our interpretation of the native gel experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>. Here, the amount of hLBD is held constant, and increases in peak intensity are due to effects on hLBD complexes from increasing LC8. Both LMW and HMW complexes form at the first titration point and increase in population as more LC8 is added. A low occupancy intermediate, labeled LMW, is clearly evident at the lowest molar ratio of 1:3, and persists at the same elution volume even at the highest molar ratios. Higher occupancy species, HMW, are also apparent at a ratio of 1:3 and become increasingly distinct as LC8 is increased. The peak corresponding to excess LC8 is discernable at a ratio of 1:7, and steadily increases as LC8 is added. Taken together, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are consistent with the explanation that a low occupancy form of the hLBD:LC8 complex is favored even with a large excess of LC8. A minor population of high occupancy complexes, present even at the lowest molar ratio, increases with increasing LC8 and is in equilibrium with the LMW species and with free LC8, and therefore with each other. Both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human LBD exhibit this dynamic behavior, suggesting it is a conserved feature of the ASCIZ:LC8 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure and distribution of LBD:LC8 complexes visualized by single particle EM</title><p>In order to visualize the various oligomeric states of ASCIZ-LC8, we analyzed electron microscopy data of dLBD and hLBD under saturating concentrations of LC8.

The scarcity of higher order complexes, coupled with the intrinsic conformational heterogeneity, precluded our ability to obtain 2D class averages of the high-occupancy complexes. To overcome this limitation, statistical analysis describing the distribution of oligomeric states was obtained by hand-selection and classification from single-molecule images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both dLBD:LC8 and hLBD:LC8 complexes form an ensemble of structures, displaying an exponential distribution with low-occupancy states (<italic>i.e.</italic> 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers) being most abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>).

For the hLBD:LC8 dataset, complexes containing as many as 7–9 LC8 dimers could be distinguished from the single particle image data, while higher-order complexes containing 10–11 LC8 dimers were either not distinguishable or were simply absent under the limiting concentrations required for negative stain EM specimen preparation. Nevertheless, the remarkable similarity in distribution of oligomeric species formed by dLBD and hLBD, obtained under similar binding conditions, is consistent with the nearly equivalent overall LC8 affinity determined by ITC, and suggests that a conserved mechanism of negative cooperativity is used by ASCIZ to regulate the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NMR titration of dLBD with LC8 identifies sites with modest preferential binding</title><p>If dLBD and LC8 form stable intermediate complexes with excess LC8, which of the seven recognition sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ are preferentially bound? Notably, the linear assembly pattern of LC8 dimers observed by negative stain EM suggests an ordered (or quasi-ordered) sequence of assembly, apparently favoring neighboring TQT sites. However, the location of LC8 binding sites could not be resolved in these experiments. Therefore, to examine interactions between individual motifs and LC8 in the context of the full dLBD, we turned to NMR. As unlabeled LC8 is titrated into solutions of <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C- labeled dLBD, changes in NH peak intensities can be measured in 3D HNCO spectra recorded for dLBD:LC8 molar ratios of 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:8. As LC8 concentration increases, a corresponding decrease in dLBD peak intensity is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). At a molar ratio of 1:5, less than 10% of the original peak intensity remains at all seven LC8 binding sites. At a ratio of 1:8, all dLBD peaks completely disappear except for peaks corresponding to eight N-terminal residues (241-248), indicating that all TQT sites have been occupied to some degree. The absence of peaks for bound dLBD is attributed to line broadening associated with intermediate exchange processes and/or faster transverse relaxation as a result of increased complex size.

To confirm this observation and to obtain titration information for the missing residues in this region, we performed similar experiments on the smaller QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs. QT2-4 was chosen to further validate LC8 binding to the QT3 motif that as an individual peptide showed weak binding by ITC, and QT4-6 was chosen because it has the highest LC8 binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Further, the two constructs share the QT4 motif, allowing us to assess its affinity in two sequence contexts. Due to the smaller number of peaks for shorter constructs, HSQC spectra have a sufficiently high resolution to render an HNCO-based titration unnecessary. Unlabeled LC8 was titrated into <sup>15</sup>N-labeled QT2-4 or QT4-6 and changes in peak intensity were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). As with dLBD, there is a gradual decrease in peak intensity as more LC8 is added to QT2-4 or to QT4-6 at molar ratios: 1:0.25, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4. Significantly, peak intensities in QT4-6 decrease at lower LC8 ratio than in QT2-4, confirming the trend we observe in full-length dLBD. In QT4-6, nearly all peaks in the motif region disappear at a ratio of 1:2, while ~30% of peak intensity remains in QT2-4.</p><p>Furthermore, NMR titration of QT2-4 with LC8 confirms that QT3 is an LC8 binding motif. The peaks corresponding to QT3 decrease in intensity at the same rate as peaks corresponding to the QT2 and QT4 motifs. The peaks in the linker region (residues 305–320) decrease more slowly, indicating that they are not interacting with LC8, but merely experiencing the effects of a larger correlation time.</p><p>Plots of the average peak intensity (I/I<sub>0</sub>) for each 10-amino acid motif in dLBD, and in each of QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs clearly show the dichotomy in the pattern of peak attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–g</xref>). In dLBD, the first three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) show a different titration pattern and weaker binding than the last four motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). This dichotomy is replicated in separate plots of the 3 QT motifs in each of the constructs QT2-4 and QT4-6; the average I/I<sub>0</sub> of motifs in QT2-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) drops to 0.2 at LC8 molar ratio 1:2, twice that observed for motifs in QT4-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>) which reach the same I/I<sub>0</sub> at molar ratio 1:1. The apparently higher LC8 affinity of motifs 4–6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,g</xref>), relative to motifs 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,f</xref>) is consistent with our ITC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The QT4 motif, common to both constructs, has a different rate of peak disappearance in each construct, suggesting that motif environment, not local sequence, determines its affinity.

Preferential binding of the C-terminal motifs is additionally supported by ITC results, which show that LC8 binds to the QT4-6 construct with slightly higher affinity than the full-length dLBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).

Most significantly, transcriptional activity of the AAA mutants can be ranked to form an activity gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) notable for a clear inverse relationship between their transcriptional activity and their affinity for LC8. While the differences between each construct are very small, the overall trend supports the hypothesis that affinity and transcriptional activity are correlated. The construct with the highest affinity for LC8 by ITC, AAA8-11, exhibits equal or slightly lower transcriptional activity than WT ASCIZ, while the construct with the lowest affinity for LC8, AAA1-4, 8–11, has 2.5x the activity of WT ASCIZ.

Here we integrate multiple approaches to elucidate the structure, dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydrodynamics of the large disordered ASCIZ-LC8 complexes, that together reveal a new model by which ASCIZ can maintain stable pools of the hub protein LC8. We tested the main features of this model in cells using transcription activity assays which show a trend wherein mutant ASCIZ constructs with lower LC8 occupancy display higher transcriptional activity, while constructs with higher LC8 occupancy have lower activity. We propose that a dynamic ensemble of complexes is important for fine-tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity, where stable, low occupancy complexes function to maintain a basal buffering transcription rate for LC8. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. As LC8 is an essential regulator of dozens of cellular processes, an ability to maintain an LC8 ‘buffer’ is likely important for cellular homeostasis. Although many other transcription factors are regulated by multisite phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmberg et al., 2002</xref>) or multiple binding events to different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor and Orkin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reményi et al., 2004</xref>), we find no examples of activity tuned by multivalent binding to the gene product in a negative autoregulatory role, which underscores the novelty and potential impact of this study.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ASCIZ is a new type of multivalent transcription factor</title><p>ASCIZ has three structural and functional features that together set it apart from other multivalent transcription factors.</p><p>(1) ASCIZ has an exceptionally long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain compared to other intrinsically disordered transcription factors. Human ASCIZ contains an intrinsically disordered domain that is 600 amino acids long, or 73% of its overall sequence. The well-studied transcription factor p53, by contrast, is 40% disordered and the disordered regions are dispersed through three different regions of the protein rather than being concentrated on one terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laptenko et al., 2016</xref>). Intrinsically disordered regions longer than 50 amino acids are considered to be of significant size for eukaryotic transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). As intrinsic disorder is proposed to play an important role in regulating function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shammas, 2017</xref>), it is possible that the length of the disordered domain enables a larger diversity of functions. Indeed, recent work has shown that the length of the intrinsically disordered domain can control transcriptional activity through ‘energetic frustration’, wherein opposing energetic couplings mediate the overall activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>(2) ASCIZ interactions with LC8 display <italic>both</italic> positive and negative cooperativity that together create a dynamic equilibrium of stable, low occupancy ASCIZ-LC8 complexes. ASCIZ binding to LC8 forms an IDP duplex scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2015</xref>) onto which other copies of LC8 or other dimeric partners can bind with higher affinity. The first two to four recognition motifs bind to LC8 with positive cooperativity, as evidenced by ITC experiments that show an enhancement in binding affinity from the presence of neighboring motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Negative cooperativity regulates the formation and distribution of higher-order LC8 assemblies, as shown by the dominance of low occupancy complexes at saturating concentrations of LC8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Negative cooperativity observed between low occupancy complexes and the fully occupied complex suggests that when the concentration of LC8 exceeds the buffering capacity of the low occupancy intermediates, the fully occupied complex is formed to switch off transcription.</p><p>A distribution of low occupancy dynamic complexes is a conserved feature of the ASCIZ:LC8 interaction. Evidence for a dynamic ASCIZ:LC8 ensemble comes from a combination of AUC, gel filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and negative stain electron microscopy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human LBD constructs, addition of excess LC8 results in formation of stable low molecular weight (LMW) complexes and a minor population of high molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Negative stain electron microscopy experiments show an exponential distribution of complexes, with assemblies containing 2–4 stacked copies of LC8 clearly visualized in 2D projection averages and suggesting a high degree of flexibility within the duplex IDP linkers persists upon complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Multivalency and intrinsic disorder in ASCIZ’s LC8 binding domain enable this dynamic ensemble of low occupancy complexes. Many proteins utilize multiple binding sites within intrinsically disordered regions for regulation, complex formation, and a multitude of other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortese et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uversky, 2015</xref>). In some examples, multiple binding sites serve as a scaffold to bring proteins together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortese et al., 2008</xref>), while in others, they modulate phase transitions that lead to the formation of bimolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banani et al., 2016</xref>). The diversity of these examples highlights the importance of multivalency and intrinsically disordered regions in protein function and regulation. It is of note that although ASCIZ’s multiple binding sites are similar to those that lead to phase transitions in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2012</xref>), we did not detect this behavior in vitro. However, ASCIZ puncta formation has been observed in cell culture in response to treatment with MMS, a DNA methylation agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jurado et al., 2010</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNees et al., 2005</xref>). These puncta do not form in the absence of LC8, indicating that LC8 binding to multiple recognition motifs is necessary for foci formation.</p><p>Comparison of ASCIZ with another LC8 multivalent binding partner, Nup159, underscores the uniqueness of the ASCIZ-LC8 assembly. While three other multivalent LC8 binding partners with more than two recognition motifs are known to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fejtova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stelter et al., 2007</xref>), the role of multiple sites has only been characterized for ASCIZ (this work) and Nup159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nyarko et al., 2013</xref>). Nup159 cooperatively binds five LC8 dimers and forms a relatively stable complex readily visible by electron microscopy and 2D classification analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stelter et al., 2007</xref>). As Nup159 has a slightly lower affinity for LC8 than ASCIZ (2.9 μM vs. 0.9 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nyarko et al., 2013</xref>), the difference between the Nup159 grids with uniformly stacked structures and the ASCIZ grids with sparse and heterogeneous structures of 2–4 stacked LC8 dimers is intriguing. This difference in structural heterogeneity can be attributed to the higher flexibility or short life time of ASCIZ:LC8 complexes relative to Nup159:LC8 complexes, while the scarcity of high-occupancy states is consistent with a unique mode of negative cooperativity. Given the different function of Nup159 (in nuclear pore assembly) versus ASCIZ:LC8 complexes (transcription regulation), the data suggest that the dynamic properties and unique mechanism of assembly that is conserved in LC8-ASCIZ complexes may reflect an important feature required for autoregulation of LC8 transcription.</p><p>(3) ASCIZ regulates its transcriptional activity by binding multiple copies of its gene product, LC8. Cell culture based transcription assays demonstrate that ASCIZ affinity for LC8 is negatively correlated with transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although the differences between each construct are very small, we see an obvious trend where fewer occupied LC8 binding motifs lead to increased ASCIZ transcriptional activity, and vice versa. The results of this assay suggest that LC8 concentration could fine-tune ASCIZ activity in a cellular environment by shifting the population of complexes towards higher or lower occupancy states.</p><p>A great example of multisite regulation is the E26 transformation-specific transcription factor (Ets-1), which tunes its transcriptional activity through multisite phosphorylation of its serine-rich domain. Phosphorylation of the serine rich region occludes the DNA-binding interface and stabilizes its helical inhibitory module, inhibiting Ets-1 DNA binding ~20 fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desjardins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pufall et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, the function of p53 is modulated by over 50 posttranslational modifications that are proposed to be interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meek and Anderson, 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of specific p53 residues prevents binding to the inhibitory protein HDM2, while increasing binding to the activating proteins CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreon et al., 2009</xref>). p53 affinity for CBP/p300 depends on the extent of p53 phosphorylation; successive phosphorylation events increase p53 affinity for the TAZ1, TAZ2, and KIX domains of CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teufel et al., 2009</xref>). p53 also binds to a multitude of other proteins that regulate its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beckerman and Prives, 2010</xref>). While many other transcription factors tune their activity through multisite regulation, we could find no other examples besides ASCIZ where binding to multiple copies of their gene product modulates activity; yet, the prevalence of IDP domains in transcription factors indicates that such mechanisms are likely to be widespread and studies such as these are becoming more tractable with the integrated approaches used here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Model of ASCIZ transcriptional regulation</title><p>Based on our experimental data, we have developed a model of ASCIZ transcriptional regulation that illustrates the relationship between transcriptional activity (red arrow) and LC8 concentration (blue arrow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As the cellular level of LC8 (blue dimers) increases, the number of LC8 molecules bound to ASCIZ also increases. The ASCIZ-LC8 complex primarily exists as a dynamic equilibrium of different complex stoichiometries and degrees of disorder (center brackets). We propose that this low occupancy conformational ensemble is important for maintaining a basal level of LC8 transcription. It acts as a buffer for changes in the concentration of LC8 and fine-tunes transcription levels according to cellular needs. A change in LC8 cellular concentration would shift this dynamic equilibrium to a higher or lower occupancy state without dramatically altering the level of transcription. All 11 (or 7) binding sites are therefore occupied in the heterogeneous mixture of complexes, as is demonstrated by NMR titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and participate in maintaining a homeostatic concentration of LC8. Thus, it is ensured that a high concentration of LC8 does not drastically decrease LC8 production, but rather shifts it to a lower level. As LC8 is a hub protein that interacts with &gt;40 protein partners, and is predicted to bind to 100 additional proteins from a diverse selection of cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rapali et al., 2011b</xref>), maintaining a constant level of its transcription is essential.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36258.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of ASCIZ regulation of LC8 transcription.</title><p>A proposed model of LC8 transcriptional regulation is shown for dASCIZ, which also applies to the human protein.

Single particle images were extracted with a box size of 160 × 160 pixels and CTF-corrected (phase-flipped) in EMAN2. Reference-free 2D class averages were generated in EMAN2 and RELION 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheres, 2012</xref>) using CTF-corrected and high-pass filtered image datasets. Statistical analysis of oligomeric composition was performed by counting the number of subunits identified from single particle images and classifying them manually as 2 – 7mers (dLBD:LC8 complexes) or 2 – 11mers (hLBD:LC8 complexes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Particles that could not be confidently assigned were discarded, leaving 2334 oligomers assigned for the dLBD:LC8 and 967 for hLBD:LC8 datasets. Complexes containing only a single LC8 dimer could not be distinguished from unbound LC8 particles, and were not included in our analysis.</p><p>As a positive control, Nucleoporin159 (Nup159) in complex with LC8 was also prepared for negative stain EM under similar conditions to the dLBD/hLBD samples, and as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stelter et al., 2007</xref>) (not shown). As a negative control, we prepared EM grids with LC8 alone and dLBD/hLBD alone. No oligomeric structures (<italic>i.e.</italic> beads on a string) were observed in these images (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transcription reporter assays</title><p>To measure transcriptional activity of ASCIZ mutants, six ASCIZ constructs were cloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech): WT ASCIZ (1-823), ΔZnF (230-823), ASCIZ AAA1-4, ASCIZ AAA8-11, ASCIZ AAA5-11, and ASCIZ AAA1-4, 8–11. Approximately 2 kbp of the Dynll1 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jurado et al., 2012a</xref>). Using FuGENE 6 (Promega), immortalized ASCIZ knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jurado et al., 2010</xref>) were co-transfected with ASCIZ constructs, the Dynll1 promoter, and a pRL-CMV vector containing <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase for normalization of firefly/luciferase ratios. The authenticity of the ASCIZ knockout MEF cell line was verified by PCR genotyping of the ASCIZ locus. The cell line tested to be free from mycoplasma contamination using a MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza, Switzerland). 24 hr after transfection, cells were transferred to 96-well plates and incubated overnight before determining reporter gene activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and a Polarstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany) instrument. For assessment of protein expression levels, human U2OS cells were transfected with ASCIZ constructs using FuGENE six and were probed with ASCIZ antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNees et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>BMRB accession code</title><p>The chemical shifts for dLBD ASCIZ have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank under accession code 27412.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are indebted to Professor Clare Woodward for the many helpful discussions.

The authors come up with a mechanism whereby the disordered domain of the transcription factor ASCIZ is able to bind multiple copies of LC8, in effect, sensing its concentration and controlling levels of transcription of the LC8 gene through a competition with activator binding. Overall this is an exciting development, but I do believe that the work could be clarified by consideration of a number of points below.</p><p>1) The authors show by NMR that as a function of titration signal is lost due to exchange and increase in molecular weight. The major insight by NMR is that there are two different classes of binding regions that bind either 3 or 4 LC8 dimers with different affinities. Yet little mechanism into binding order to sites within these classes is obtained and as the authors mention the affinities are very different from ITC. Can the authors look at say smaller constructs that contain only 3 or only the 4 dimer sites in an effort to circumvent the issue with disappearing peaks? Indeed even smaller constructs would allow to address whether at low stoichiometries there is preferential binding to one of the sites, whether there is exchange between sites and what both the kinetics and thermodynamics might be.</p><p>2) Related to 1, I find it interesting and surprising that upon saturating binding there is a 1:3 complex that appears to be dominant (can the authors give the relative amounts of 1:3 vs. 1:7). I don't understand why the 1:3 can’t be saturated (pushed to fully bound) – simply thermodynamics would dictate this unless there is some sort of structural change. What is the mechanism involved here? And what are the implications for transcription, since even at very high concentrations of LC8 it appears that there will be some activation, which seems wasteful.

Others have reported that ASCIZ regulates the expression of LC8 in certain cell types, and in some cancer cell lines, and that disruption of this regulatory circuit is associated with mitotic defects seen previously with loss of LC8. In addition, others have reported that the CTR of ASCIZ contains multiple short linear motifs (SLIMs) with the sequence TQT known to bind to LC8. Here, the authors characterized seven LC8 binding SLIMs within the CTR of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ASCIZ using ITC, AUC, and NMR. As LC8 was titrated into the ASCIZ CTR, a mixture of sub-stoichiometric and 1:7 complexes were formed, presumably with two CTRs stitched together by multiple LC8 dimers (as proposed by the authors). Mutagenesis of several different combinations of multiple SLIMs confirmed their LC8 binding properties and allowed the rank order of their μM affinities to be determined. The authors noted that the affinity of the CTR, with multiple binding sites, for LC8 was higher than that of isolated binding site, but this point was not rigorously addressed in the manuscript. The authors extended their studies to the CTR of human ASCIZ, which they showed contains 11 LC8 binding SLIMs using ITC and mutagenesis. Finally, the authors performed a Luc-reporter transcription assay using wt and mutant ASCIZ expressed in ASCIZ null MEFs, which showed that mutation of LC8 binding SLIMs was associated with a slight increase in expression of the luc reporter. This latter finding suggests that LC8 exerts negative feedback on its expression by binding to the SLIMs within the CTR of ASCIZ, possibly altering DNA binding and/or interactions with other transcription factors. While the authors' hypothesis regarding this negative feedback mechanism is novel and interesting, the data in the manuscript fall well short of proving the hypothesis. Much more extensive in vitro and in cell data would be needed to establish the LC8 concentration dependence of the negative feedback circuit and further data required to elucidate the associated mechanism of feedback. In addition, the new knowledge gained regarding the identification of LC8 binding SLIMs within fly and human ASCIZ seems incremental with respect to the 2011 BBRC report from Rapali, et al. Therefore, the manuscript does not provide the level of rigor, novelty and impact associated with <italic>eLife</italic> but rather would be more suitable for a more technical journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the characterization of the disordered C-terminal region (LBD) of the transcription factor ASCIZ and its interaction via multiple short linear motifs to LC8. The binding regulates ASCIZ activity and provides a feedback loop for controlling transcription of LC8. Different biophysical tools are used to study the dynamic complex between the ASCIZ LBD and LC8, including ITC, analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR on primarily dASCIZ constructs but also including some human. Results clearly support a model with a dynamic (based on NMR) mixture of complexes with different LC8 occupancies (based on centrifugation) and with ASCIZ engaging LC8 at multiple different motifs. Arguments are made for the cooperativity of multivalent binding (based on ITC) and for the ability of this dynamic mixture of states enabling tunable transcription levels (based on transcription assays).</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>Overall the manuscript describes extensive work on a fascinating system that offers insights into a mechanism for tunable regulation of transcription factor activity. The technical work appears to have been performed at a high level. The results are important for demonstrating a powerful example of the regulatory effects of multivalent binding of motifs within intrinsically disordered protein regions, one that could be more general. However, the authors do not place this example within the context of other literature on dynamic complexes involving multiple motifs of disordered proteins or other mechanistic approaches for generating tunable activity in transcription factors.</p><p>1) The authors should acknowledge this as an example of a dynamic or fuzzy complex and cite reviews (M Fuxreiter or others). The novelty of this being a unique case of multisite recognition is somewhat overstated. The manuscript should cite examples of other proteins that interact with multiple motifs and compare mechanistic effects of multi-site recognition with this mechanism. For two sites, this could include the p53 transactivation subdomains that bind the CBP TAZ2 (P Wright) and for larger numbers similar to that studied here it could include 14-3-3 targets such as Raf-1 protein kinase and yeast Cdc25 (multiple authors), CFTR regulatory domain (J Forman-Kay), Sic1 (M Tyers) and even phase separation via multiple motifs and multiple modular binding domains (M Rosen). Examining the approaches used to quantify local interactions or the caveats described in these cases from the literature may also be valuable for interpretation of the LC8-LBD interactions.</p><p>2) It is equally important to cite examples of transcription factors that are regulated in a tunable manner such as Ets<sup>-1</sup> (L McIntosh), as not all are binary on/off and probably many are tunable with mechanisms yet to be described but likely involving intrinsically disordered regions. The novelty of this being the only transcription factor to not be regulated in a binary manner is thus overstated.</p><p>3) &quot;we consider a decrease in peak intensity as a measure for an increase in complex formation&quot; and &quot;It should be noted that these Kd values measured by NMR titration differ from those measured by ITC because the loss in peak intensity detectable by NMR is influenced by a number of factors in addition to direct LC8 interaction. These include exchange with neighboring sites, change in correlation time due to dimerization of the dLBD upon binding dimeric LC8, and increased correlation time as LC8 sites are saturated. These Kd values, therefore, identify different behavior of each set of motifs, but do not accurately determine specific motif binding constants.&quot;</p><p>Generally, different Kd values are expected for global (ITC) and local affinities so the local measures should not match the global, even if the local affinities are accurate. The authors should try to calculate a global Kd based on linked local affinities. Importantly, however, the local affinities are not likely to be accurate. In addition to the caveats mentioned by the authors, there is a strong possibility of intramolecular interactions leading to a lower intensity in the free LBD with binding to LC8 disrupting these intramolecular interactions and leading to increase of intensity for some LBD regions. This should be acknowledged and is especially important given the suggestion of &quot;slightly more ordered structure in its C-terminal half&quot; of the LBD. (Note that &quot;ordered&quot; would be better described as &quot;transient&quot;, given the overall disordered nature of the LBD.) The differing apparent correlation times for LBD residues depending on distances from direct LC8 binding site(s) on the LBD and from the termini should also be acknowledged (P Wright and J Dyson). The complexity of interpretation of intensities needs to be laid out even if trying to make a simple interpretation. Ultimately, this reviewer is not convinced of the validity of the &quot;two sub-domains&quot; identified based on these different Kd and cooperativity values, due to the lack of ability to quantify local affinities from the NMR intensities.</p><p>4) Some background information on the nature of LC8 structure and its dimerization interface would be valuable. In particular, how does LC8 dimerization affect the cooperativity of binding? Can numerical models be generated to estimate the effect of dimerization in the context of linked multivalent interactions?</p><p>5) It would be valuable in the Discussion to at least briefly address the numbers of LC8-binding motifs found in known binding partners and how these proteins may exploit multiple motifs similarly (or not) to ASCIZ (based on: &quot;Although some LC8 partners have multiple recognition motifs (Gupta, Diener, Sivadas, Rosenbaum, and Yang, 2012; Jie, Lohr, and Barbar, 2015; Moutin et al., 2014; Nyarko, Song, Novacek, Zidek, and Barbar, 2013; Slevin, Romes, Dandulakis, and Slep, 2014), human ASCIZ contains 11 functional LC8 binding sites (Rapali, Garcia-Mayoral, et al., 2011), the most of any partner protein.&quot;)</p><p>6) What are the estimated cellular concentrations of LC8 at various stages and how would these affect the mixture of complexes between ASCIZ and LC8? What might be the dominant complex of LC8-human ASCIZ in cells based on the binding parameters determined in this manuscript? What would be the minimum number of LC8 to inhibit transcription? How is the affinity or kinetics comparable to the transcriptional activator?</p><p>7) Given the high level of multivalency in the system with 11 binding motifs and a dimeric binding domain (see work of M Rosen), it seems possible that puncta or large-scale associated states may be observed in vitro or in cells. Is there any evidence for this?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised manuscript &quot;Multivalency regulates activity in an intrinsically disordered transcription factor&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration. Your article was reviewed by the same reviewers as for the previous submission.</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed with the amount of new biophysical data added to the paper that considerably improved the characterization of this complex system. It was also felt that the literature was reviewed much more thoroughly this time and the current work framed in a better context. The consensus was that the biophysical characterization of a difficult system was strong, while the in-vitro and cellular experiments to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression were weaker. At issue is that while the overall trend regarding binding and activity is consistent with your claims, the effect is small (Figure 7D) and the errors are large, and in some cases it appears that the differences in the points corresponding to different Kd's are not statistically significant. It was the consensus of the reviewers that a revision should focus more on the biophysics, while suggesting biological relevance through the presentation of the transcription data. If possible, additional transcriptional experiments that attempt to decrease errors to strengthen this section would be recommended but are not required. Please provide a detailed point-by-point response to each of the issues raised below to assist the reviewers in an evaluation of your revised manuscript.</p><p>1) As mentioned above the authors present an interesting and extensive biophysical study that characterizes the negative regulation of a transcription factor through binding of a main target protein. The reviewers feel that this (the biophysics) should be emphasized more strongly in a revised manuscript. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the errors associated with the transcription data of Figure 7 could be reduced, but this will be left at the discretion of the authors.</p><p>2) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” the authors state that high order oligomers are rare with fully formed complexes almost never observed. Yet in their model of Figure 8 they propose that under high concentrations of LC8 a fully formed complex is formed. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Further it is hard for this reviewer to understand the role of negative cooperativity. If in fact the complete binding range is not used (i.e., one does not get fully bound transcription factor) then it seems like the full dynamic range over which changes in LC8 concentration occur is not optimally sampled by ASCIZ. What is the biological significance of the negative cooperativity, such that the full number of binding sites are not utilized? This seems not to be a very sensitive way of monitoring LC8 concentration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36258.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Multivalency in Transcriptional Regulation of the Hub Protein LC8&quot; describes a biophysical study that focuses on the mechanism of transcriptional control of the dynein light chain (LC8) through binding interactions with the disordered region of the transcription factor ASCIZ.

Yet there was some reservation about publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form and reviewers suggested several ways to strengthen the work. In this revision we address all the reviewers concerns and add substantial amount of data that considerably strengthen our model. Briefly, the new data include negative stain electron microscopy that give a structural view and quantitative distribution of the multiple disordered complexes in dynamic equilibrium (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Negative stain electron microscopy is particularly challenging for disordered systems and therefore the work here pushes the limit of this technique. New data for characterizing the dynamic intermediate were also obtained using small angle X-ray scattering and gel filtration (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have collected significantly more NMR data (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and changed the Introduction (Figure 1) and interpretation of the model (Figure 8). As a result, this manuscript is much more focused and we hope is now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Below we briefly address the reviewers’ major concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors show by NMR that as a function of titration signal is lost due to exchange and increase in molecular weight.

NMR titration of the smaller constructs substantiates our data from the full-length construct, which demonstrate that the C-terminal sites bind first. Excerpts from the manuscript are below.</p><p>“Plots of the average peak intensity (I/I<sub>0</sub>) for each 10-amino acid motif in dLBD, and in each of QT2-4 and QT4-6 constructs clearly show the dichotomy in the pattern of peak attenuation (Figure 6D-G). […] NMR dynamics experiments also demonstrate that residues in the C-terminal motifs are slightly more ordered in comparison to the N-terminal motifs (Figure 2F-G, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), which may explain the tighter LC8 binding to this region.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to 1, I find it interesting and surprising that upon saturating binding there is a 1:3 complex that appears to be dominant (can the authors give the relative amounts of 1:3 vs. 1:7).

Because of this we have performed every experiment conceivable to verify and rationalize this apparent discrepancy between ITC and AUC. While high occupancy complexes are evident in AUC profiles, consistent with the ITC results, these complexes are in equilibrium with many smaller sub-saturated species, the most highly populated of which is a mixture of 1:2-1:4 complexes of dLBD:LC8. The low occupancy complexes are favored, relative to higher occupancy complexes, even in samples having a large excess of LC8. The presence of stable, low occupancy complexes is supported by new small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, negative stain electron microscopy, and gel filtration. Importantly, also new to this submission, we show a similar behavior for human ASCIZ, and discuss that negative cooperativity in the transition from low occupancy to high occupancy complexes is a conserved feature of ASCIZ-LC8 interactions and explains the higher population of the low occupancy complexes. The completely revised discussion speculates on the biological ramifications of the ability of ASCIZ to undergo both positive and negative cooperativity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to 2 can the authors rationalize some of their transcription results where removing a number of ASCIZ sites seems not to matter?</p></disp-quote><p>In the AAA 8-11 construct, removal of 4 sites decreases transcriptional activity, rather than increasing it as one would expect. We now state in the text that this is likely due to the higher affinity of the AAA 8-11 construct for LC8 relative to WT. All of the other AAA mutants show a decrease in binding affinity that is correlated with an increase in transcriptional activity. Therefore, despite the unexpected result where removing LC8 sites decreases activity, it in fact fits the trend perfectly (see Figure 7D, a new figure in this submission).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the proposed model there is a duplex of dLBD that is formed that aids in LC8 binding.

The negative stain electron microscopy data are new to the revised manuscript and provide a clear image for duplex formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More discussion should be given to other transcription systems.

The original hypothesis has been altered and now states “ASCIZ and LC8 engage in a dynamic equilibrium of multivalent interactions that tune the level of ASCIZ transcriptional activity.” Additional data is included in this manuscript to support our hypothesis. Using a combination of methods that include SAXS, AUC, gel filtration, native gel, and negative stain electron microscopy, we demonstrate that both the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins form a dynamic complex with LC8. Our cell culture transcription assays show a gradient of ASCIZ activity that depends on the number of LC8 dimers bound. We speculate that this dynamic complex is important for fine tuning ASCIZ transcriptional activity.</p><p>This work will be of particular relevance to the NMR, intrinsically disordered proteins and transcription regulation communities as it is transformative on several fronts: 1) it presents an attractive model that begins to explain how the concentration of an essential hub protein is maintained in the cell, 2) it gives a unique demonstration of how protein disorder and multivalency, conserved among species, regulate transcription, 3) it presents an example of a multivalent protein that undergoes both positive and negative cooperativity where binding of short peptides and longer constructs is quite different from binding of full length domains, demonstrating the importance of biological context, 4) it combines structural analysis with cell-based mutational and transcription activity analysis of the human ASCIZLC8 interaction that supports the model inferred from structural studies, and finally, 5) it pushes the envelope in the complexity and disorder of systems studied by both NMR and negative stain electron microscopy, and presents a model methodology for similarly complex systems.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers were impressed with the amount of new biophysical data added to the paper that considerably improved the characterization of this complex system. It was also felt that the literature was reviewed much more thoroughly this time and the current work framed in a better context. The consensus was that the biophysical characterization of a difficult system was strong, while the in-vitro and cellular experiments to prove the hypothesis regarding the feedback mechanism regulating expression were weaker. At issue is that while the overall trend regarding binding and activity is consistent with your claims, the effect is small (Figure 7D) and the errors are large, and in some cases it appears that the differences in the points corresponding to different Kd's are not statistically significant. It was the consensus of the reviewers that a revision should focus more on the biophysics, while suggesting biological relevance through the presentation of the transcription data. If possible, additional transcriptional experiments that attempt to decrease errors to strengthen this section would be recommended but are not required. Please provide a detailed point-by-point response to each of the issues raised below to assist the reviewers in an evaluation of your revised manuscript.</p><p>1) As mentioned above the authors present an interesting and extensive biophysical study that characterizes the negative regulation of a transcription factor through binding of a main target protein. The reviewers feel that this (the biophysics) should be emphasized more strongly in a revised manuscript. It would strengthen the paper considerably if the errors associated with the transcription data of Figure 7 could be reduced, but this will be left at the discretion of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>While we definitely recognize the value in reducing the error bars associated with our transcription activity assays, we do not think that repeating the assays would produce significantly better results because of the small changes observed between each sample. We have performed this assay many times and while the overall trend seen in Figure 7D is always consistent, the size of the error bars are as well.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have placed a greater emphasis on the biophysical characterization of the ASCIZ-LC8 interaction and the transcription data is presented to give weight and biological relevance to our hypothesis. Changes to the text can be seen in the last paragraph of the Introduction as well as the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” the authors state that high order oligomers are rare with fully formed complexes almost never observed. Yet in their model of Figure 8 they propose that under high concentrations of LC8 a fully formed complex is formed. There seems to be a discrepancy here.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that high order (7+) oligomers are rare in comparison to low occupancy complexes. However, high order complexes of dLBD and hLBD bound to LC8 are formed in solution, as demonstrated by AUC (Figure 4), native gel (Figure 4), and negative stain electron microscopy (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The language in the third paragraph of the subsection “Structure and Distribution of LBD:LC8 Complexes Visualized by Single Particle EM” has therefore been modified to state that these higher order oligomers are rare in comparison to the low occupancy complexes. While these high occupancy complexes are scarce, they are observed in every experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further it is hard for this reviewer to understand the role of negative cooperativity. If in fact the complete binding range is not used (i.e., one does not get fully bound transcription factor) then it seems like the full dynamic range over which changes in LC8 concentration occur is not optimally sampled by ASCIZ. What is the biological significance of the negative cooperativity, such that the full number of binding sites are not utilized? This seems not to be a very sensitive way of monitoring LC8 concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that highlights the unique aspects of the ASCIZ-LC8 interaction. The combination of positive and negative cooperativity that we observe leads to the formation of a dynamic mixture of low occupancy ASCIZ-LC8 complexes. The first few sites bind with positive cooperativity and binding thereafter becomes negatively cooperative, forcing the complex into a low occupancy state. These low occupancy complexes are a mixture of different stoichiometries that range from 2-4 for both dASCIZ and human ASCIZ.</p><p>While all 11 LC8 binding sites do not interact with LC8 in a linear fashion (i.e. occupancy does not increase linearly as LC8 concentration increases), the full number of binding sites are utilized. All sites interact with LC8, as demonstrated by NMR titration of dLBD with LC8 (Figure 6), but due to negative cooperativity, this interaction results in a heterogenous mixture of low occupancy complexes.</p><p>We propose that a population of low occupancy complexes is important to maintain a stable pool of cellular LC8. Instead of progressively binding more LC8 as it becomes available, our model suggests that ASCIZ’s multiple sites function as a “buffer” for LC8 concentration and aid in maintaining a homeostatic concentration. For example, an increase in LC8 cellular concentration would cause a small shift in the complex equilibrium towards a higher occupancy state and a corresponding decrease in the level of transcription, instead of causing a large change in both. Our transcription assays corroborate this idea, demonstrating a small change in transcriptional activity when the number of available binding sites changes (Figure 7). As LC8 is a ubiquitous protein that binds to hundreds of partners, the need to maintain a stable level of LC8 is likely necessary.</p></body></sub-article></article>
