TFs have high affinities to nucleosome-embedded sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement. To understand this process mechanistically, we investigated two <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show that these factors bind to their sites within nucleosomes with similar binding affinities as to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to those for naked DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes in order to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to those of human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting that the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reb1</kwd><kwd>nucleosomes</kwd><kwd>pioneer factors</kwd><kwd>binding and dissociation kinetics</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name><name><surname>Poirier</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirier</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM086252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Benjamin T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1516979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poirier</surname><given-names>Michael G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The budding yeast transcription factors Reb1 and Cbf1 function as pioneer factors by slowly dissociating from nucleosomes, allowing them to target and unwrap nucleosomes efficiently to regulate transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome,~147 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Extensive contacts between nucleosomal DNA and the histone octamer suppress access to DNA-binding proteins, including many transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wolffe, 1992</xref>). To overcome this steric occlusion, TFs take advantage of dynamic nucleosome structural fluctuations, which transiently expose DNA-binding sites for TF binding. However, this site exposure mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Widom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>) results in reduced occupancy relative to thatÂ onÂ naked DNA, since the TF can bind only when the site is partially unwrapped. In addition, it was recently shown that nucleosomes increase TF dissociation rates by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2014b</xref>). In combination, the decreased binding and increased dissociation rates can result in aÂ reduction in the apparent dissociation constant for nucleosome substratesÂ ofÂ over aÂ 1000-fold. For example, Gal4 binds to its DNA target site at picomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 1996</xref>) whereas it requires nanomolar concentrations to bind nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2014b</xref>). In contrast to TFs suchÂ as Gal4, pioneer transcription factors (PFs) access their binding sites within nucleosomes as efficiently as theyÂ accessÂ fully exposed DNA without the aid of additional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). This property is thought to allow PFs to target closed chromatin and toÂ prime transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, chromatin is mainly opened by a few highly expressed TFs that can access their nucleosome-embedded binding sites in the genome and establish local nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). How these TFs gain access to their DNA target sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement is not well understood. Two non-exclusive mechanisms may be used during this process. With a ââpassiveââ mechanism, TFs can occupy naked DNA when the nucleosome structure is temporarily disrupted by another cellular event (e.g. DNA replication). Note that this mechanism does not require TFs to interact with nucleosomes. Alternatively, TFs may directly bind and invade into nucleosomes. The key to differentiating between these two models is to determine whetherÂ certain TFs, suchÂ as PFs, can stably engage a nucleosomal template containing their recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hughes and Rando, 2014</xref>).</p><p>One well-studied nucleosome-depleting TF is Reb1, a factor essential for yeast viability. Consistent with its ability to displace nucleosomes, most of the Reb1-binding sites in the genome reside in NDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). However,Â ~20% (154/903) of Reb1-binding sites exist within well-positioned nucleosomes and almost half (71/154) of these sites are occupied by Reb1. Reb1 tends to bind the nucleosome near the entry-exit site and hasÂ been shown to increase the accessibility of DNA locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koerber et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest that Reb1 may gain access to nucleosomes near the entry-exit site through the site exposure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koerber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>), but the stability and the kinetics of this interaction are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we used a combination of in vitro techniques, including gel electromobility shift assays (EMSA), ensemble fluorescence, and single-molecule fluorescence, to determine whether and how Reb1 invades nucleosomes. We foundÂ that Reb1 accesses its site in both DNA and nucleosomes with similar affinities and targets entry-exit sites by trapping the nucleosome in a partially unwrapped state without evicting histones. AsÂ forÂ other TFs, nucleosome site exposure lowers the Reb1 association rate when binding to nucleosome-embedded sites. However, once bound, Reb1 compensates for the reduced association rate with an equally reduced dissociation rate. These properties may be generalÂ among nucleosome-displacing factors:Â we show that another <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> TF, Cbf1, binds nucleosome with similar dynamics. Finally, in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicate thatÂ Reb1 undergoes exchange within the nucleus that is markedly slower than that of other chromatin-interacting proteins. These properties were previously reported for the human PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirillo and Zaret, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiya et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore propose that Reb1 and Cbf1 can function as PFs byÂ using a dissociation rate compensation mechanism to target nucleosomesÂ efficiently, toÂ partially unwrap nucleosomes, and toÂ facilitate the recruitment of transcription regulatory complexes to define NDRs and toÂ activate transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reb1 binds DNA and nucleosomes with similar affinities</title><p>A defining property of PFs is that nucleosomes do not impede their binding. To determine whether Reb1 exhibits this characteristic, we quantified Reb1 affinities to both nucleosome and DNA substrates. For DNA binding experiments, we tested binding to 25-bp oligos containing the Reb1-binding motif. With reconstituted, sucrose gradient purified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we tested binding to entry-exit sites because this is where Reb1 preferentially binds in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koerber et al., 2009</xref>). We tested binding at four separate sites positioned in increments of 5 bp throughout the entry-exit region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We refer to these templates as âP<italic>x</italic>,â where â<italic>x</italic>â defines the beginning of the Reb1-binding site in the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) (i.e. P3Â =Â binding site starts 3 bp into the nucleosome). Binding to both DNA and nucleosomes was detected via EMSA, inÂ which we titrate Reb1 and observe formation of a slow-mobility Reb1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâC</xref>). For Reb1 binding to nucleosomes, we imaged EMSAs with Cy5-H2A(K119C) and Cy3-DNA fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), confirming thatÂ Reb1 is in complex with nucleosomes. Affinity was measured for each binding reaction by determining the S<sub>1/2</sub>, the concentration at which 50% of the DNA or nucleosomes are bound by Reb1. For DNA, we measured S<sub>1/2 Reb1âDNA +Â site EMSAÂ </sub>=Â 2.3Â Â±Â 0.2 nM, whereas for the four nucleosome constructs, we measured S<sub>1/2 Reb1âNuc P3 EMSAÂ </sub>= 4.6 Â± 0.1 nM, S<sub>1/2 Reb1âNuc P8 EMSAÂ </sub>= 1.5 Â± 0.1 nM, S<sub>1/2 Reb1âNuc P13 EMSA</sub> = 8.5 Â± 0.2 nM, and S<sub>1/2 Reb1âNuc P18 EMSA</sub> = 11.2 Â± 0.3 nM. InÂ addition, we performed EMSAs with DNA and nucleosomes lacking the specific binding site and measuredÂ ~10-fold lower affinity for these sequences [S<sub>1/2 Reb1âDNA -site EMSA</sub> = 21.7 Â± 2.3 nM and S<sub>1/2 Reb1âNuc PâEMSA</sub> =Â 32.7 Â± 0.8 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table S1). Reb1's targetingÂ of DNA and nucleosome with similar affinities mimics the behavior of PFs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>).

Instead, this secondary rate is probably due to a structural changeÂ inÂ the Reb1âDNA complex that results in a transition from a low to aÂ high PIFE state. The interpretation of these two types of low to high PIFE transitions is similar to thoseÂ inÂ previous studies of intrinsically disordered proteins, where one ON rate is concentration-dependent and interpreted as binding, while the second ON rate is concentration-independent and interpreted as a structural transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dogan et al., 2012</xref>).

The ratio of the primary dissociation rate is higher than the ensemble S<sub>1/2</sub>, whereas the ratio with the secondary dissociation is lower. Because of restricted diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nag and Dinner, 2006</xref>), the apparent K<sub>D</sub> of a surface tethered molecule is always larger than the ensemble S<sub>1/2</sub>.

Furthermore, as we concluded earlierÂ that the secondary low to high PIFE transition rate represents a Reb1âDNA structural transition, and should have an associated high to low transition, we nowÂ conclude that the secondary high to low PIFE transitions are the result of Reb1âDNA structural transitions. Finally, our interpretation of the PIFE transitions is further confirmed by our observation that both primary rates were associated with 75% of the fluctuations and thatÂ both secondary rates were associated with 25% of the fluctuations.

The majority of bound events (&gt;60%) belonged to the slower population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that the slower rate is the primary mode for Reb1 dissociation. Interestingly, the rateÂ ofÂ Reb1 dissociation from nucleosomes isÂ ~130-fold lower than that of its dissociation from DNA, which is similar to theÂ ~50-fold reduction in Reb1 binding to nucleosomes relative to DNA. This reduction in dissociation rate compensates for the reduction in binding rate and results in a similar Reb1 binding affinities for its sites within nucleosomes and DNA. This result suggests thatÂ Reb1 interacts with partially unwrapped nucleosomes differently than other TFs, suchÂ as Gal4 and LexA, which exhibitÂ ~1000-fold acceleration in dissociation rates fromÂ nucleosomesÂ compared to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>The ratio of the dissociation rate to the binding rate is the apparent dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, which can be compared to the ensemble S<sub>1/2</sub> measurements.

This will largely remove the impact of the restricted diffusionÂ because the on rates will be impacted similarly for tethered nucleosomes and DNA. When using dominant rates, we found that the relative changes in binding affinity between nucleosomes and DNA are in close agreement for single-molecule and ensemble experiments. This strongly suggests thatÂ k<sub>off Reb1âNuc primary</sub> is the dominant determinate of the dissociation rate in the Reb1ânucleosome interaction in solution and that surface tethering does not impact the measured dissociation rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cbf1 also binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than fromÂ DNA</title><p>Recent work established that six TFs, including Reb1, are mainly responsible for NDR generation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2018</xref>).

This result provides additional evidence toÂ showÂ that Reb1 functions in vivo similarly to mammalian PFs,Â i.e.Â it exchanges moreÂ slowlyÂ than other transcription-regulatory complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We combined ensemble, single-molecule and live-cell fluorescence studies to investigate mechanistically how the budding yeast TFs Reb1 and Cbf1 interact with nucleosomal templates. We find that, like PFs, Reb1 and Cbf1 occupy sites within the nucleosome with affinities similar to those with which they occupy to naked DNA. These factors invade the nucleosome and trap it in a partially unwrapped state using the site exposure model, which results in a significant reduction in the binding rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tims et al., 2011</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) The dissociation rate compensation mechanism. (Left) For traditional TFs, nucleosomes decrease TF binding rates and increase TF dissociation rates, which can reduce the overall TF affinity by orders of magnitude. (Right) Like TFs, nucleosomes haveÂ lower PF binding rates than do naked DNA, but the PF dissociation rate from nucleosomes is lower than that from DNA. This compensates for the reduced PF binding rate so thatÂ the overall PF affinity is similar for nucleosomes and DNA, and allows PFs to trap nucleosomes in partially unwrapped statesÂ efficiently.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43008-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although yeast and human PFs bind nucleosomes and DNA with similar affinities, their impacts on nucleosome structure and dynamics may be distinct. For example, Reb1 and Cbf1 can trap nucleosomes in an unwrapped state, but human PFs do not appear to influence nucleosomal DNA unwrapping. FoxA traps mobile nucleosomes in distinct positions along the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirillo and Zaret, 1999</xref>) and competes with linker histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>), whereas Oct4 and Sox2 do not appear to disrupt nucleosomes upon bindingÂ to the DNA entry-exit region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>). The dissociation rate compensation mechanism, which allows PFs to target their DNA sites within nucleosomesÂ efficiently, appears to be conserved from yeast to humans, whereasÂ the impact of these factors on the structure and binding of nucleosomesÂ is much more diverse.</p><p>The specificity of Reb1 for its site near the edge of the nucleosome is 22-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), where specificity is defined as the fold-enhancement in binding affinity when a binding site is included the nucleosome. This is less than thatÂ ofÂ traditional TFs, such as the bacterial TF LacI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Riggs, 1975</xref>) and the eukaryotic TF Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 1996</xref>). However, the most extensively characterized pioneer factor, FoxA, has only a 2-fold differenceÂ inÂ specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiya et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that the Reb1 specificity is not out of line with thatÂ ofÂ other pioneer factors. TheÂ mechanisms of how TFs find their target sites in vivoÂ are not yet resolved, butÂ a potential model for Reb1 is that it is kinetically regulated;Â the bound-state residence time instead of the bound-state probability is key for Reb1 function. The residence time of Reb1 on its specific sites, especially the sites within the edge of the nucleosomes, is likely to be much longer than that on nonspecific sites. The long residence time may be required for Reb1 to recruit co-activators, such as chromatin remodelers and histone modifying complexes. In addition, Reb1âs target sites in vivo tend to be located in promoters, where many other regulatory factors bind. The cooperative binding of Reb1 and these factors may further enhance Reb1âs binding specificity.</p><p>Our results on Reb1 and Cbf1 dissociation rates are strikingly different to previous results on TFs such as Gal4 and LexA,Â whose dissociation rates from nucleosomes are much higher than those from DNA. This acceleration has been proposed to be theÂ resultÂ of both competitionÂ betweenÂ nucleosome rewrapping and the maintenance of TF partially bound states and disfavorable TFânucleosome interactions such as steric clash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Bundschuh, 2014</xref>). The reason why Reb1 and Cbf1 dwell much longer on their nucleosomal sites is still not clear. The human PF FoxA stabilizes its binding to nucleosomes by contacting H3 via its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cirillo et al., 2002</xref>), soÂ we suspect that aÂ similar mechanism may also stabilize Reb1 and Cbf1 binding. Interestingly, we find that the long acidic N-terminal tail of Reb1 does not contribute to the dissociation rate kinetic compensation mechanism. This indicates that the DNA-binding domain of Reb1 preferentially interacts with its site within the DNA entry-exit region of the nucleosome. Furthermore, because the acidic N-terminal domain of Reb1 does not influence binding to nucleosomes, it appears to have a different function such as recruiting transcription activators such as chromatin remodelers and histone-modifying complexes.</p><p>Interestingly, Reb1 binds to position P3 with 3.3-fold less affinity than toÂ P8, in spite of the fact that the P3 position is five base pairs closer to the edge of the nucleosome and therefore more accessible. There are two potential non-exclusive reasons for this difference. First, the DNA will not unwrap as much for Reb1 binding to P3, so less histone octamer surface should be exposed. If Reb1 achieves a higher binding affinity to nucleosomes by interacting with the exposed histone surface, this reduction in exposed histone octamer surface would reduce the affinity of Reb1 at the P3 position. Second, the P3 position is shifted by 5 bp, which will result in an 180 degree rotation of the binding site relative to the histone octamer. This could orient the bindingÂ region of Reb1 away from the histone octamer, soÂ that it is unable to interact with the exposed histone octamer surface,Â thereby reducing the overall affinity of this site at P3 relative to P8.</p><p>Our observation that Reb1 binding to P18 nucleosomes does not trap the nucleosome in an unwrapped state indicates that the mode of Reb1 binding to this site, which is further into the nucleosome, is distinct from binding very near the edge of the nucleosome at P3 and P8. AlthoughÂ Reb1 affinity at position P18 is 7.5-fold lower than thatÂ atÂ position P8, Reb1's affinityÂ forÂ P18 is stillÂ 2.9-fold greaterÂ than its affinity for nucleosomes without the Reb1 site. This indicates that the Reb1 binding remains site-specific in a manner similar to that of the human pioneer factor FoxA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekiya et al., 2009</xref>). Although it remains unclear how shifting the site by 10 bp changes the Reb1-binding mode, previous studies provide insight. At position P18, the Reb1-binding site extends 27 bp into the nucleosomes. Given theÂ ~90 kDa size of Reb1, the amount of DNA thatÂ isÂ required to unwrap soÂ that Reb1 can fully recognize the P18 binding site could extend significantly further into the nucleosomes than 27 base pairs. There are strong DNAâhistone contacts that are located 25 to 35 base pairs into the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall et al., 2009</xref>) and theseÂ cost 5 K<sub>B</sub>T of free energy to unwrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forties et al., 2011</xref>). This implies thatÂ the unwrapping probability is reduced by at least 150-fold. This significant increase in nucleosome unwrapping free energy could meanÂ thatÂ Reb1 preferentially binds part of the P18 target site within a fully wrapped nucleosome, as has been proposed for other pioneer factors such as Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soufi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The findings describedÂ above have significant implications forÂ explaining how certain TFs generate NDRs in vivo. A previous study proposed that TFs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can invade into nucleosomes passively by trapping transiently exposed naked DNA during replication or other histone-turnover events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). However, this does not exclude the possibility that some TFs can directly bind and invade into nucleosomes. Our observation that Reb1 and Cbf1 stably engage nucleosome provides support for the latterÂ mechanism. Given that these two factors do not evict histones in vitro (nor do other PFs), we do not think it is likely that these factors cause spontaneous nucleosome disassembly in vivo. Instead, the long dwell time of these factors on nucleosomes may allow time to recruit other factors, such as histone chaperones or nucleosome remodelers, to establish NDRs. Future in vivo and in vitro measurements are needed to investigate this further.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Dwell-time and unbound-time cumulative sum distributions were generated from these traces and each distribution was analyzed using MEMLET to determine the best fit for the data and ultimately toÂ obtain rate constants for the transitions between bound and unbound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woody et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>FRAP assay</title><p>TheÂ yeast strains used for the FRAP experiment are diploids constructed by mating the haploid strains in BY4741 (MAT<underline>a</underline>) and BY4742 (MATÎ±) backgrounds. GFP tags were introduced into BY4741 and BY4742 by integrating the <italic>GFPâHIS3MX</italic> cassette into the C-terminus of the target genes in the native genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). See 'Key resources table' for strain information and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> table S6 for theÂ primer list. Yeast cells containing GFP-labeled factors were cultured to log phase in synthetic medium, and then transferred onto an agar pad and mounted by a coverslip. Cells were imaged using the 60X lens of aÂ FV1000 confocal microscope (Zeiss) at room temperature. AÂ 488 nm laser was used to excite and bleach green fluorescence. Depending on the GFP intensity, 3â10% laser power was used to take theÂ images; 100% power was used to bleach the samples. The photobleaching time was set to 0.2â0.5 s, and the intervals between consecutive frames were 0.25â5 s. Two frames were acquired before photobleaching, followed by 28â48 frames afterwards. The bleached region coveredÂ ~10â25% of the nuclear region. Images were analyzed using Fiji-ImageJ. The average fluorescence intensities ofÂ the bleached and unbleached regions were recorded, and the ratio between them was used in the recovery curve.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Poirier and Bai Labs for helpful discussions.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissociation rate compensation mechanism for budding yeast pioneer transcription factors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tim Formosa as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maria Spies (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Donovan et al. present a rigorous dissection of the properties of two pioneer DNA-binding factors from yeast, Reb1 and Cbf1, comparing their ability to bind their target sites when they are in free DNA to when they are in nucleosomes. The key findings are that (1) the affinity of the factors for sites in naked DNA and sites close to the entry-exit point of nucleosomes is comparable, even though the latter are less accessible; (2) these factors use mechanisms distinct from what has been described previously as binding is coupled to unpeeling of nucleosomal DNA without loss of histones or repositioning of the octamers; and (3) dissociation from the nucleosomal context is slowed, compensating for the decreased binding rate that results from limited accessibility and thereby maintaining the same affinity. The experiments are a well-designed and carefully executed mixture of ensemble and single-molecule approaches whose quantitative depth substantially surpasses previous studies of pioneer factors.</p><p>The reviewers all found the &quot;off-rate compensation&quot; model in the absence of changes to nucleosome structure or positioning to be well-supported and an important conceptual advance. The primary weakness noted was that a testable model for how the compensation works mechanistically was suggested but not examined further. As either outcome from this test would be informative, including it would enhance the impact of the manuscript significantly, bringing it into the range expected for publication in this journal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>New experiments:</p><p>1) The results presented suggest a model for which domain of Reb1 is responsible for adjusting the off-rate in different contexts, but the manuscript does not take the opportunity to test this model. Specifically, the authors imply that the negatively charged N-terminal domain of Reb1 may contact the exposed positively charged histone residues (subsection âCbf1 also binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than DNAâ and Discussion section). This plausible and testable model could be addressed by measuring the binding and dissociation rate constants after deleting the N-terminal domain or mutating it to a neutral form. Any outcome is informative as it could either provide a mechanism for the altered dissociation rate and the stabilization of octamer composition and positioning or demonstrate that these are properties of the DNA-binding domain itself.</p><p>Changes to the manuscript:</p><p>2) The data on the second panel of Figure 3 (labeled D, should be E?) are fit to a double exponential, but only one phase is used to calculate the rate. While it is easy to envision why a double exponential fit was used for the ON time distribution (i.e. two distinct complexes with two stabilities), it is much harder to explain the second exponential for the OFF dwell times. The authors state that this phase is [Reb1]-independent and does not represent binding, but should speculate about the nature of this phase.</p><p>3) The affinity for a nucleosome without the recognition sequence only decreased about 10-fold. This non-specific, but quite significant, interaction with nucleosomes independent of the presence of the target DNA binding site needs to be discussed and incorporated into the overall model.</p><p>4) The relative changes in rate constants are the primary basis for the arguments presented, but because in most cases more and less prominent classes of events were observed, it can be confusing for the reader to understand which constants are being compared. For example, in subsection âReb1 binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than DNAâ the authors state that &quot;â¦the Reb1 dissociation rate from nucleosomes is also about 50-fold lower than from DNA.&quot; The two rates being compared seem to be 0.58 and 0.0044, which is a 132-fold reduction. The authors may be saying that 132-fold and 50-fold are similar, which is fine, but trying to determine whether this is the comparison they were making made the argument harder to follow. They could simply say that the rate decreased ~130-fold in this case, which is similar to the 53-fold change in the on-rate (as is done for Cbf1 in subsection âCbf1 also binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than DNAâ). The actual comparisons could be added as a column to the table in Figure 7A; the general idea is to give the actual ratio explicitly then let the reader decide how similar the results are instead of making the reader wonder precisely what is being compared. The same argument should be applied to the dissociation constants calculated from the rate constants (subsection âReb1 binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than DNAâ) and comparisons with EMSA (subsection âCbf1 also binds and dissociates from nucleosomes significantly slower than DNAâ).</p><p>5) The Materials and methods section does not describe how the yeast strains used were constructed. This is particularly important for understanding the FRAP results in which a large GFP construct was added to small histone and Nhp6A proteins. The details of this procedure (plasmid or integrated? N or C terminal fusions?) influence the interpretation and so should be given here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43008.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>New experiments</p><p>1) The results presented suggest a model for which domain of Reb1 is responsible for adjusting the off-rate in different contexts, but the manuscript does not take the opportunity to test this model.

This directly tests the model that this highly acidic N-terminal domain is responsible for the pioneering property of Reb1 and for the 130-fold decrease in Reb dissociation rate from the nucleosome relative to DNA. First, using both EMSAs and ensemble fluorescence, we find that Reb1-ÎN binds its site within naked DNA with a 1.5-fold higher affinity than binding its target site within P8 nucleosomes. For comparison, wild type (WT) Reb1 binds its site within DNA with a 2.1-fold lower affinity than to P8 nucleosomes. This implies that even without the acidic N-terminal domain Reb1 continues to bind DNA and nucleosomes with similar affinities. This is in stark contrast to traditional transcription factors (TFs), which bind nucleosomes at the P8 position with orders of magnitude lower affinity. Therefore, we conclude that the acidic N-terminal domain of Reb1 is not required for the pioneering property of Reb1.</p><p>To then further investigate this acidic N-terminal domain, we determined with single molecule fluorescence measurements the kinetics of Reb1-ÎN binding to and dissociating from nucleosomes. We find that the Reb1-ÎN binding to nucleosomes is similar to WT Reb1 with a 2-fold slower rate, while Reb1-ÎN dissociates from nucleosomes with a nearly identical rate as full length Reb1. These single molecule rate measurements imply a 2-fold difference in the effective K<sub>D</sub>, while our ensemble FRET measurements observe a 5-fold difference in the S<sub>1/2</sub>. This 2.5-fold difference between the ensemble and single molecule measurements of Reb1-ÎN and WT Reb1 affinities to nucleosomes is within the typical range when we compare ensemble and single molecule data. More importantly, they conclusively show that the Reb1 acidic N-terminal domain is not responsible for the 130-fold decrease in dissociation rate from nucleosomes and confirms the ensemble studies that find Reb1-ÎN retains its pioneering property.</p><p>These experiments significantly enhance the manuscript by ruling out the possibility that the N-terminal tail is responsible for the pioneering mechanism of Reb1, which we suggested in the original submission. We are grateful to the reviewers for recommending this experiment. To incorporate these new results into the manuscript, we have added a new main figure (Figure 6), two new supplemental figures (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 2), a new Results section and a paragraph to the Discussion section. We also removed the text in the Discussion section that suggests that the Reb1 N-terminal domain could be responsible for the 50-fold decrease in the dissociation rate from nucleosomes relative to DNA. Instead, we use the observation that the N-terminal domain is highly acidic to motivatie the N-terminal deletion experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Changes to the manuscript:</p><p>2) The data on the second panel of Figure 3 (labeled D, should be E?) are fit to a double exponential, but only one phase is used to calculate the rate. While it is easy to envision why a double exponential fit was used for the ON time distribution (i.e. two distinct complexes with two stabilities), it is much harder to explain the second exponential for the OFF dwell times. The authors state that this phase is [Reb1]-independent and does not represent binding, but should speculate about the nature of this phase.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the smPIFE measurements of Reb1-DNA interactions determined that the primary low to high PIFE transition rate is concentration dependent, which we attribute to Reb1 binding to DNA of 0.0032 s-1nM<sup>-1</sup>. The additional minor low to high PIFE transition rate is independent of the Reb1 concentrations, which rules out the possibility that this transition is due to Reb1-DNA binding. Instead, it is likely a structural transition of the Reb1-DNA complex that results in a transition from a low to high PIFE state. PIFE involves interactions on the nm length scale (Hwang, et al., 2011), so structural changes on this length scale would be sufficient to cause a change in PIFE. This also implies that one of the transitions from the high to low PIFE states is not due to Reb1-DNA dissociation, but a structural transition as well. Since the major high to low PIFE transition (0.58 s<sup>-1</sup>) is consistent with the dissociation constant measured by ensemble PIFE measurements, we conclude that the minor high to low PIFE transition rate (0.036 s<sup>-1</sup>) is due to Reb1-DNA structural transitions. This interpretation is similar to previous studies of intrinsically disordered proteins, where one ON rate is concentration dependent and is interpreted as binding, while a second ON rate is concentration independent and interpreted as a structural transition (Dogan et al., 2012).</p><p>To include these data interpretations in the manuscript, we added more detailed description of the smPIFE transition rates in the Results section that reports the Reb1 smPIFE measurements. We also altered the description of the smPIFE data so that we are careful about how we refer to the PIFE transition rates. Only after comparing the smPIFE data to the ensemble PIFE data do we refer to the concentration dependent low to high transition rate as a binding rate. We also corrected the panel labeling in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The affinity for a nucleosome without the recognition sequence only decreased about 10-fold. This non-specific, but quite significant, interaction with nucleosomes independent of the presence of the target DNA binding site needs to be discussed and incorporated into the overall model.</p></disp-quote><p>The 10-fold difference between Reb1 specific and non-specific equilibrium binding is less than traditional transcription factors such as bacterial TF LacI (Lin and Riggs, 1975) and the eukaryotic TF Gal4 (Liang, et al., 1996), which bind their consensus sequence with orders of magnitude higher specificity than a non-target DNA site. In contrast, the most extensively characterized pioneer factor, FoxA, has only a 2-fold difference (Sekiay, et al., 2009). Therefore, the specificity of Reb1 is not out of line with other pioneer factors.</p><p>In addition, comparing TF binding to a nucleosome with and without its target sequence is complicated by the fact that there are potentially many non-specific binding sites. We do not have direct experimental data on the nature of the non-specific interactions of Reb1 with nucleosomes. However, non-specific binding to DNA occurs at a concentration of ~30 nM (Figure 1B and Figure 3C), which is similar to Reb1 non-specifically binding to nucleosomes. This suggests that Reb1âs non-specific interactions with nucleosomes is largely through interactions with the nucleosomal DNA that is facing away from the histone octamer surface. If the non-specific Reb1-nucleosome interactions is indeed with nucleosomal DNA, the dissociation rate is likely faster than from its binding site within DNA, which is already 130-fold faster than from its binding site within P8 nucleosomes. Therefore, the Reb1 dissociation rate when non-specifically bound to nucleosomes is expected to be more than 130-fold greater than when specifically bound to P8 nucleosomes.</p><p>The detailed mechanism of how Reb1 functions in vivo with a relatively low specificity is beyond the scope of the current paper. However, we have considered 2 mechanisms that fit with the dissociation rate compensation mechanism. The first mechanism is that Reb1 is kinetically regulated, where the residence time of the bound state instead of the probability Reb1 is bound is key for Reb1 function. Here, the idea is that the long residence time of Reb1 at its site within the edge of the nucleosomes is required for Reb1 to recruit transcription co-activators such as chromatin remodelers and histone modifying complexes to function, while the over 130-fold shorter residence time of Reb1 nonspecifically bound to nucleosome is too short of Reb1 to recruit and maintain the co-activators occupancy to perform its function. The second mechanism is that Reb1âs specificity could be enhanced by the binding of the complexes Reb1 recruits when Reb1 is bound to its site near the edge of the nucleosome. For example, this could happen for complexes that interact with the histone H3 N-terminal, which is located at where the DNA exits the nucleosome.</p><p>We have incorporated this discussion of Reb1 specificity to the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The relative changes in rate constants are the primary basis for the arguments presented, but because in most cases more and less prominent classes of events were observed, it can be confusing for the reader to understand which constants are being compared.
