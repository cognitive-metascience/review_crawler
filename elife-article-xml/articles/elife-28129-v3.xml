However, approaches for synthetic genetic analysis with null-alleles in metazoans have not been feasible. Here, we present a CRISPR/Cas9-based Synthetic Genetic Interaction (CRISPR-SGI) approach enabling systematic double-mutant generation. Applying this technique in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we comprehensively screened interactions within a set of 14 conserved RNA binding protein genes, generating all possible single and double mutants. Many double mutants displayed fitness defects, revealing synthetic interactions. For one interaction between the MBNL1/2 ortholog <italic>mbl-1</italic> and the ELAVL ortholog <italic>exc-7</italic>, double mutants displayed a severely shortened lifespan. Both genes are required for regulating hundreds of transcripts and isoforms, and both may play a critical role in lifespan extension through insulin signaling. Thus, CRISPR-SGI reveals a rich genetic interaction landscape between RNA binding proteins in maintaining organismal health, and will serve as a paradigm applicable to other biological questions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28129.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28129.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>synthetic genetic interactions</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>lifespan and fitness</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Early Independence Award DP5OD009153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calarco</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007229</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bauer Fellows Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calarco</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calarco</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles King postdoctoral fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norris</surname><given-names>Adam D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant RGPIN-2017-06573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calarco</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Synthetic genetic analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identifies pairs of RNA binding protein genes that play a critical role in organism health and development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA binding proteins are critical regulators of all aspects of RNA metabolism, and have been implicated in human health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerstberger et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lukong et al., 2008</xref>). A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of specific combinations of RNA binding proteins for tissue-specific regulation of RNA processing and abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Manley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elkon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>). However, despite their importance in regulating many facets of gene expression, hundreds of metazoan RNA binding proteins have no described molecular or cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerstberger et al., 2014b</xref>). Part of the challenge in characterizing these factors may be due to redundancy in their regulation of shared RNA targets. For practical reasons, genetic analyses in multicellular animals have been limited to ablating RNA binding protein genes in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barberan-Soler et al., 2011</xref>) or studying a single genetic interaction by targeting two members of the same family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gehman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ule et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, deletion of multiple RNA binding protein genes with overlapping functions should reveal stronger âsyntheticâ phenotypes relative to the loss of individual factors, and shed light on the role of these genes in animal development and physiology. To systematically test this hypothesis, we sought to generate loss-of-function mutations in a defined set of RNA binding proteins in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and then create a previously unprecedented number of double mutants, covering all possible pairwise combinations within that set.</p><p>In budding yeast and bacteria, the development of such systematic pairwise gene deletion schemes, including the synthetic genetic array (SGA) approach, have revealed widespread synthetic interactions between genes, in which double mutant phenotypes differ from what would be expected given observed single mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>). However, analogous genetic strategies in multicellular organisms have not been feasible. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, RNA interference (RNAi) triggered by feeding animals double-stranded RNA has been used as a tool for analyzing genetic interactions, either by subjecting loss of function mutants to RNAi by feeding, or by targeting two genes simultaneously by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baugh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byrne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehner et al., 2006</xref>). However, despite its throughput, the use of RNAi in genetic interaction studies can be limited since gene activity is knocked down rather than knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamath and Ahringer, 2003</xref>), complicating the interpretation of synthetic phenotypes. Additionally, neurons are generally refractory to RNAi by feeding, unless specific hypersensitive genetic backgrounds are used which often have negative effects on animal physiology(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asikainen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calixto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Firnhaber and Hammarlund, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sieburth et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have devised a strategy that overcomes these technical limitations by enabling the generation of null mutations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that can be easily crossed together to create double mutants. We used this approach to study genetic interactions between neuronally-expressed RNA binding protein genes and found widespread interactions negatively impacting organismal fitness. One such genetic interaction between <italic>exc-7</italic> and <italic>mbl-1</italic>, two highly conserved RNA binding protein genes, led to a striking decrease in lifespan. Further analysis revealed that these genes potentially function downstream of the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin receptor gene, a critical determinant of lifespan. Our results indicate that combinations of neuronal RNA binding proteins play a previously-unappreciated role in maintaining organismal fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double mutant generation in a multicellular animal</title><p>To systematically study genetic interactions using null alleles in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we developed a strategy we will refer to as CRISPR/Cas9-based Synthetic Genetic Interaction (CRISPR-SGI) profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This strategy employs the CRISPR-associated enzyme Cas9 to generate double-strand DNA breaks in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson and Goldstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris et al., 2015</xref>). Following cleavage of chromosomal DNA by Cas9 and a single guide RNA (sgRNA), animals are created carrying marked deletion alleles through homology-directed gene replacement of a target gene with a heterologous GFP transgene. Thus, reporter fluorescence can be followed as a proxy for the gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To make an array of double mutants, a collection of genes are independently replaced with two compatible non-overlapping tissue-specific GFP reporters, and then crossed to generate double heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These animals are allowed to self-fertilize and generate F<sub>2</sub> animals, and homozygous double mutants are isolated by microscopy. This strategy for creating double mutants provides a substantial increase in throughput as it eliminates the need for laborious large-scale PCR and/or sequencing to ascertain the genotype of the animal at each generation.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28129.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disruption of RNA binding proteins via targeted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of template-directed homologous recombination to disrupt a gene of interest and replace with a positive-selection cassette (NeoR = Neomycin resistance) and one of two tissue specific fluorescent marker genes labeling the pharynx or body wall musculature.

The strategy takes advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, homologous recombination, and antibiotic selection to rapidly create transgenic animals. Heterologous fluorescent proteins are used to mark a gene deletion, thus allowing multiple deletion alleles with distinct heterologous fluorescent markers to be crossed together. Our approach has two immediate advantages over existing traditional methods of creating and screening double mutant animals. First, it enables the efficient generation of double mutants without the need for laborious PCR or sequencing validations. This offers a significant advance in throughput for generating double knockout mutants in genetically tractable multicellular animals. Second, because the approach creates marked fluorescent mutant animals, these mutants can be competed with non-fluorescent wild type animals to screen for relative fitness under identical environmental conditions in a high throughput manner.</p><p>Although relative growth or fitness measurements appear superficial in nature, in budding yeast they have provided countless insights into functional connections between genetic pathways in the eukaryotic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuldiner et al., 2005</xref>).

This type of analysis is particularly amenable to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, due to its short generation time and hermaphroditic reproduction. Such analysis in longer-lived, non-hermaphroditic species should be useful, but would require considerably more effort.

It remains to be determined what the causal cellular or molecular mechanisms are linking the RNA binding proteins to organismal lifespan, but transcriptional profiling experiments indicate that the two factors combinatorially control hundreds of genes and isoforms, many of which are involved in mediating lifespan. We have found that EXC-7 and MBL-1 co-regulate gene expression in a âsyntheticâ manner wherein expression is normal in either single mutant but aberrant in the double mutant. It is possible that such effects on steady state RNA levels could be the result of these factors regulating transcription or RNA stability, either through direct interactions with mRNA targets, or indirectly through the modulation of factors that control these processes. Indeed, it has been previously reported that both of these RNA binding proteins can influence other layers of RNA metabolism, including localization and RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simone and Keene, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2015</xref>). On the other hand, a large number of the splicing changes we observe are additive or cumulative in nature, wherein the double mutant splicing phenotype is reflective of each of the single mutant splicing phenotypes. It therefore may be that the double mutant synthetic effect on viability is caused by synthetic effects on RNA abundance. Alternatively, and not mutually exclusive, the synthetic phenotype may be caused by splicing events regulated additively and/or cumulatively by both factors, but only upon reaching a certain threshold of mis-splicing is a phenotype revealed. It will be of interest to identify the key targets of EXC-7 and MBL-1 that play crucial roles in maintaining long and healthy lifespan.</p><p>Collectively, we have developed a strategy for performing systematic genetic interaction analyses in metazoans using null alleles for the first time. Combining this approach with competitive fitness assays as a phenotypic readout led us to discover a hidden layer of novel genetic interactions. Our results thus highlight the importance of studying the effects of deleting combinations of RNA binding proteins in addition to studying single gene perturbations, and establish a novel paradigm in which these factors govern post-developmental health and longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain generation</title><p><italic>C.Â elegans</italic> wild type N2 strain (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)">WB-STRAINWB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)</ext-link>) was utilized for all CRISPR editing experiments. Mutants were created as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, plasmids encoding Cas9, sgRNA, co-injection markers pCFJ90 and pCFJ104 (obtained from the Jorgensen lab through Addgene) and the selection cassette flanked by homology arms (500+ bp) were injected into wild-type worms. Insertions were identified by resistance to G418, loss of co-injection markers and uniform, dim fluorescence of the inserted GFP. Insertions were then validated by PCR amplicons flanking both upstream and downstream insertion sites, followed by Sanger sequencing to verify insertions. In most cases, mutants with complementary GFP markers were required, but in a few cases where single mutants had an obvious visual phenotype, it was possible for the sake of convenience to cross two mutations together marked by the same GFP marker. First the GFP marker for one gene deletion was homozygosed, and then the second gene with an obvious visual phenotype was homozygosed to create the double mutant. For co-expression analysis of <italic>mbl-1</italic> and <italic>exc-7</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we generated an extrachromosomal array strain containing three co-injected constructs: an EXC-7::GFP fosmid, an MBL-1::SL2::mCherry fosmid (a gift from Kang Shen, Stanford University), and a Punc-17::BFP expression plasmid for labeling cholinergic neurons.

Plates were incubated for five days at 25Â°C. For each biological replicate â¥150 total worms were counted. Fitness values and synthetic effect calculations were adapted from the yeast SGA literature which uses a multiplicative null model for discovering synthetic genetic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baryshnikova et al., 2010</xref>). We define the Relative Fitness (F) for a mutant strain as the ratio of the observed percentage of animals on the plate divided by the percentage expected (50%) if the mutant had wild-type fitness levels: F<sub>1</sub> = (100 x (# mutant<sub>1</sub>/ # total worms))/50%. For example, if 40% of worms on the competition plate are observed to be mutant, then the relative fitness value of the mutant relative to wild type is 40%/50%, or 0.8. Expected fitness for double mutants (Fexp) was the product of the two single mutant fitness values: Fexp<sub>1,2</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> x F<sub>2</sub>. Synthetic fitness effects (É) were the difference between observed (Fobs) and expected: É = Fobs<sub>1,2</sub> - Fexp<sub>1,2</sub>. Conservative thresholds for significance were set at |É| â¥ 0.20. For strains passing the |É| â¥ 0.20 threshold, additional biological replicates were then performed. Finally, Fisher's exact test was applied between the aggregate observed values and the null-expectation values with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of &lt;0.01 used as significance threshold. Only genetic interactions passing all three significance criteria were reported as significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Animals carrying extrachromosomal arrays with broad expression were mounted on 2% agarose pads with 1x M9 and sodium azide, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope.

Gene-specific counts were tabulated for each sample using HT-Seq and statistically-significant differentially expressed transcripts were identified with DESeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Douglas Black, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hidehito Kuroyanagi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper from Calarco and colleagues presents a method for genetic interaction screening in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors create CRISPR-targeted knockout alleles. Each knockout is created as two alleles that yield expression of GFP in either pharynx or body wall muscle. Crossing lines carrying the pharynx-GFP mutation of one gene and the body-GFP of another gene, double mutants are rapidly identified by GFP expression in both locations. Single knockout mutants for 14 RNA binding proteins expressed in the nervous system were analyzed for fitness by competitive growth against wildtype worms. Only one mutation yielded a severe defect. The other 13 were all crossed with each other to characterize all possible double mutations. This uncovered 11 synthetic interactions showing a larger effect on fitness than the product of the two single mutants. One of these was lethal, with the others showing a range of severity. RNA binding proteins are an interesting test case for this method as they are known to act in particular combinations but generalized methods for testing for their cooperativity are lacking. The screen identified multiple interesting interactions for follow up, and the authors focused on one pair, <italic>mbl-1</italic> and <italic>exc-7</italic>, that exhibit a particularly large synthetic effect. These proteins have different patterns of cell specific expression but overlap in certain cholinergic neurons. The authors show that <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> double mutant worms mature to adulthood in equal numbers to wildtype but then quickly exhibit reduced viability. RNA profiling of worms with the single and double mutant genotypes identified a large set of expression and splicing changes in the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> double mutants that are not seen in the singles. Given the observed shorter lifespan, the authors then examine the interaction of the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> mutant with various lifespan mutants. They find that the <italic>eat-2</italic> mutation affecting the caloric restriction pathway can extend the lifespan of the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> mutant in a similar manner to its effect on wildtype. In contrast, the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation, which affects insulin signaling and which extends lifespan of otherwise wildtype worms, does not extend the lifespan of the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> mutant. From this they conclude that the effect of <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> is downstream of <italic>daf-2</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers agreed on the value of this study. A method to identify synthetic interactions between genes in metazoans is much needed. The authors make clever use of the worm system to develop a screen for such interactions. The method seems facile and adaptable to many other questions. The authors' examination of RNA binding protein combinations is also interesting. These proteins are understudied in the worm and this new method should allow questions to be examined that are hard to approach in other metazoan systems. The paper is well written and the data are clear. Several analyses need more detail, and a number of editorial changes are needed before it is ready for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors relate the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> mutant to the lifespan mutations <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>eat-2</italic>, which increase lifespan. Mutations that increase lifespan would seem to be quite different from the many possible mutations that decrease lifespan. While formally epistatic, the loss of the <italic>daf-2</italic> effect in the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> mutant is not convincing evidence that the two are closely connected. Couldn't the <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic> worms just be dying before the <italic>daf-2</italic> has an effect? To really make this connection, shouldn't overexpression of <italic>mbl-1</italic> or <italic>exc-7</italic> increase lifespan? Or a mutation in one of the many targets that are upregulated in <italic>mbl-1/exc-7</italic>? This should be discussed and the claims and the title modified. Alternatively, they could show additional data supporting the claim that <italic>exc-1</italic> and <italic>mbl-1</italic> are involved in <italic>daf-2</italic> signaling. For example, does the <italic>exc-1/mbl-1</italic> double mutant suppress dauer formation phenotype of <italic>daf-2</italic>, in a similar manner to <italic>daf-16</italic>?</p><p>The authors demonstrated that overall expression of 100 genes and the splicing pattern in 296 genes are altered in the <italic>exc-7; mbl-1</italic> double mutant. More analysis should be presented of the kinds of genes affected. They should also discuss whether these transcripts are related in how they affect function of the nervous system, and especially cholinergic neurons and/or longevity. Specifically, if they examine the splicing or expression targets for gene ontology clustering (GO analysis), is there a clustering around insulin signaling or anything else? What is different between the single and double mutant target transcripts in their ontology enrichments? How might this relate to the synthetic lethality?</p><p>Similarly, they should report more detailed analyses of the exons affected by the <italic>exc-7</italic> and/or <italic>mbl-1</italic> mutations.

Due to the complex and multi-faceted nature of lifespan extending versus shortening phenotypes, it may be difficult to draw strong conclusions from our epistasis analysis. We have included text in the manuscript that discusses some of the possibilities surrounding our observed phenotype. Additionally, we have altered the title of the manuscript to remove the word longevity and softened some of our statements throughout the text in relevant sections.</p><p>Anecdotally, we have not observed suppression of the dauer formation phenotype in <italic>daf-2; exc7; mbl-1</italic> triple mutants. These results would be consistent with the phenotype we observe that appears to manifest after animals reach adulthood, whereas the decision for animals to become dauers occurs earlier during larval development.</p><p><italic>The authors demonstrated that overall expression of 100 genes and the splicing pattern in 296 genes are altered in the exc-7; mbl-1 double mutant.

We have now performed GO analysis on both the genes with steady-state transcript level differences and genes with alternative junction usage differences. We did not find any molecular pathways or cellular processes that stood out as being enriched among the genes with steady-state level differences in double mutants. However, among the genes with differentially regulated alternative junctions, we identified a number of enriched GO terms associated with diverse aspects of development, reproduction, behaviour, and synaptic transmission and signaling. We have included this data in a new supplementary table, and we have also included text describing these results in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Similarly, they should report more detailed analyses of the exons affected by the exc-7 and/or mbl-1 mutations. Do they contain common regulatory elements for example? How do the splicing changes seen in the double mutant compare to the single mutants in terms of splicing pattern type (e.g. A5'SS, A3'SS, CE, MXE and IR)? Are there differences in these patterns that might explain the synthetic phenotype, or from the targets whose splicing pattern changes are seen only in the double mutant mbl-1/exc-7 combination? (see Venn diagram â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We have now classified the alternative junction usage events from our transcriptome analysis in double mutants, and present the relative frequencies of occurrence of each type of event and how these relative frequencies change relative to total documented frequencies of these events in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We also performed an analysis of 50 cassette type alternative splicing events differentially regulated between wild type and double mutants (top 25 with increased inclusion, and top 25 with increased exon skipping in double mutants). Interestingly, we observe significant enrichment of both muscleblind-like and EXC-7 consensus motifs in the upstream and downstream introns flanking these alternative exons. We have included this analysis in a new figure supplement.</p><p><italic>Can the authors comment of why the overall gene expression profile is elevated by loss of RNA binding proteins and provide some plausible explanations?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the bias towards increasing gene expression in the double mutants was a curious result. We speculate that these RNA binding proteins may be acting to regulate RNA stability in addition to their role in alternative splicing. Alternatively, these effects could be indirect via the regulation of one or more transcription factors or factors involved in controlling RNA stability.</p><p>We have included some additional discussion of these possibilities.</p><p><italic>In the supplementary data showing RT-PCR assays, it appears that, at least for the selected target exons shown, that there are few synthetic effects on splicing patterns.

Do they expect that the synthetic effect on viability would arise from a splicing target that also shows a synthetic effect or from combinations of targets that are changed by one of the two mutations?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewersâ assessment that a large number of splicing events altered in the double mutants are explained by changes observed in each of the single mutants. It is difficult to speculate whether the double mutant phenotype results from one or more aberrantly regulated targets that are synthetically controlled by the two RNA binding proteins, or the result of cumulative effects from independently de-regulated targets from each of the single mutants. We have included discussion suggesting that both of these scenarios are possible.</p></body></sub-article></article>
