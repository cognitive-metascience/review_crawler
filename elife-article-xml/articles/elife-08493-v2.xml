protein. Despite extensive research, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying SBMA remain elusive. In this study, we present evidence that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) promotes disease pathogenesis across multiple SBMA model systems. Most remarkably, loss of one copy of <italic>Nlk</italic> rescues SBMA phenotypes in mice, including extending lifespan. We also investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NLK exerts its effects in SBMA. Specifically, we have found that NLK can phosphorylate the mutant polyglutamine-expanded AR, enhance its aggregation, and promote AR-dependent gene transcription by regulating AR-cofactor interactions. Furthermore, NLK modulates the toxicity of a mutant AR fragment via a mechanism that is independent of AR-mediated gene transcription. Our findings uncover a crucial role for NLK in controlling SBMA toxicity and reveal a novel avenue for therapy development in SBMA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08493.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08493.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08493.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited disease that eventually leads to degeneration in motor neurons and weakness in muscles. It is caused by a specific genetic mutation in the gene that encodes the androgen receptor protein, which leads to the production of a mutant protein that is larger than normal. Similar mutations in other genes can lead to the development of other so-called ‘polyglutamine’ diseases such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. However, the precise details of how these mutations lead to disease symptoms are not known, and there are currently no effective ways of treating these conditions.</p><p>Previous research has shown that an enzyme called Nemo-like kinase (or NLK for short) regulates the normal androgen receptor in cancer cells. NLK has kinase activity, that is, it adds phosphate molecules to other proteins to regulate their activity. Todd et al. used human cells, fruit flies, and mice as model systems to investigate whether NLK is involved in the development of SBMA.</p><p>The experiments show that NLK promotes the development of features associated with SBMA in all three models. The kinase activity of NLK is required for these features to develop. Todd et al. also found that NLK can bind to and add phosphate molecules to the mutant version of the androgen receptor protein. This causes the mutant androgen receptor proteins to accumulate and increases the ability of the mutant proteins to activate particular genes.</p><p>Todd et al.'s findings suggest that NLK promotes the development of SBMA by interacting with the mutant androgen receptor. Previous studies have shown that NLK is able to modulate the development of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, which suggests that NLK may also play an important role in other polyglutamine diseases. The next challenge will be to fully understand the role of NLK in these diseases, which may aid future efforts to develop new treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08493.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08493.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular disease</kwd><kwd>polyglutamine disease</kwd><kwd>nemo-like kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS081811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Tiffany W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Janghoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Patients present in midlife with weakness of the limb and facial muscles, the latter of which often progress to dysarthria and dysphagia, occasionally leading to fatality. SBMA patients also commonly suffer from mild androgen insensitivity, presenting with gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and decreased fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuno et al., 2012</xref>). SBMA was originally defined as a neurodegenerative disease affecting the proximal spinal and bulbar motoneurons, and muscle atrophy was considered secondary to motoneuron degeneration. Current opinion in the field of SBMA research, however, now favors a model in which SBMA also directly affects the skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan and Lieberman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oki et al., 2015</xref>), and, in fact, recent studies have shown that removing or decreasing the expression of the mutant protein within skeletal muscle is sufficient to rescue SBMA phenotypes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieberman et al., 2014</xref>). This model of disease is supported by the finding that, in conjunction with neuronal loss, patients also show elevated creatine kinase levels and evidence of myopathic changes on biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorarù et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chahin and Sorenson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>SBMA is caused by the expansion of a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat located in the first exon of the <italic>Androgen Receptor</italic> (<italic>AR</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Spada et al., 1991</xref>). In wild-type AR, this repeat region encodes a stretch of 6–36 glutamines (Q). In SBMA patients, in contrast, the region is expanded to 37 to 70Q, resulting in pathogenesis via a gain-of-function and partial loss-of-function mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuno et al., 2012</xref>). SBMA is therefore one of nine identified polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases, along with Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17. PolyQ expansion renders the host protein toxic, resulting in the formation of mutant protein aggregates and cell death; and the commonalities in the nature of the mutation and the presentation of the different polyQ disorders suggest the presence of a common pathogenic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orr, 2001</xref>). Nonetheless, this mechanism has remained elusive and to date there are no cures or even effective therapies for most of these diseases.</p><p>AR is a well-studied steroid hormone receptor that also plays a crucial role in additional diseases including androgen insensitivity syndrome and prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>). Studies focusing on wild-type AR function and its role in other disease contexts can therefore shed light on SBMA pathogenesis. For instance, the main function of AR is to bind androgenic hormones, either testosterone or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in the cytoplasm, and then translocate into the nucleus to act as a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates androgen-dependent target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>). SBMA pathogenesis is dependent upon the presence of circulating androgens and is therefore only observed in males, with homozygous female carriers showing only mild symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuno et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of androgens to the disease has also been clearly shown in mouse models of SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katsuno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier-Larsen et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of AR is also crucial for pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Montie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been suggested that an AR interdomain interaction known as the amino (N)-terminal–carboxy (C)-terminal (N/C) interaction is important for SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr et al., 2010</xref>), as are the DNA-binding ability of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>) and its post-translational modification including acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montie et al., 2011</xref>), methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scaramuzzino et al., 2015</xref>), and other modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuno et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, several cofactors and regulators of AR can influence SBMA disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCampbell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palazzolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montie et al., 2011</xref>). Despite extensive studies, however, a precise molecular explanation for SBMA pathology has remained elusive.</p><p>Given the importance of androgens to SBMA pathogenesis, many approaches to SBMA therapeutics have focused upon depleting androgen levels in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katsuno et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández-Rhodes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, these strategies have not yielded significant results in clinical trials; hence, new approaches are necessary. It has been shown that within prostate cancer cells, wild-type AR physically interacts with Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and that NLK is able to regulate the activity and transcription of AR in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emami et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, studies show that NLK interacts either directly or indirectly with a number of neurodegenerative disease-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that it may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. Indeed, we have found that loss of one copy of <italic>Nlk</italic> (resulting in a 50% reduction in protein expression) is beneficial in mouse models of the polyQ disease SCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>). NLK is an evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase -like serine/threonine kinase primarily studied in lower model organisms, where it has been linked to a number of signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishitani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohkawara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishitani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishitani and Ishitani, 2013</xref>). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NLK may play a role in SBMA pathogenesis. We present evidence that NLK influences the aggregation and toxicity of polyQ-expanded AR across multiple model systems, using cell culture, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse. Loss of one copy of <italic>Nlk</italic> was able to partially rescue disease phenotypes in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models of SBMA. Furthermore, this 50% reduction in NLK protein expression dramatically extended the lifespan of SBMA mice. Finally, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which NLK mediates these effects on SBMA and suggest a model in which NLK interacts with and phosphorylates AR, inhibiting its intramolecular N/C interaction and thereby promoting gene transcription via the AR activation function 2 (AF-2) domain. This effect on AR activity could then modulate SBMA-related aberrant AR-dependent gene transcription. In addition, reduced NLK expression can rescue the toxic effects of an N-terminal fragment of AR, suggesting that NLK can regulate the mutant AR protein—even in the absence of DNA binding and AR-responsive gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NLK interacts with the wild-type and mutant AR</title><p>It was previously reported that NLK could interact with the wild-type AR in prostate cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emami et al., 2009</xref>). However, since SBMA is caused by polyQ-expanded AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Spada et al., 1991</xref>), and polyQ expansion can alter the ability of AR to interact with its binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsiao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irvine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sopher et al., 2004</xref>), we tested if NLK could bind mutant AR. We co-transfected a FLAG-tagged wild-type NLK construct (FLAG-NLK-WT) with either wild-type or mutant HA-tagged human AR (HA-AR25Q and HA-AR120Q, respectively) into NSC-34 motor neuron-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cashman et al., 1992</xref>) and performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. We found that NLK was able to co-IP both wild-type and mutant AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, polyQ expansion led AR to be co-immunoprecipitated to a greater extent given its lower expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although future in vitro and in vivo experiments would be needed to verify this result, it was consistent in our hands. In addition, NLK was able to co-IP an N-terminal fragment of AR spanning the first 130 amino acids and containing the polyQ repeat, suggesting that NLK binds within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is worth mentioning that this fragment expresses as a doublet, and NLK seems to interact with only one of the forms of this fragment. We suspect that the upper band represents a post-translational modification of the fragment but further experiments would be required to confirm and expand this hypothesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08493.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nemo-like kinase (NLK) interacts with the mutant AR and enhances its aggregation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NLK interacts with the AR protein in NSC-34 cells treated with 10 nM DHT.

PolyQ expansion results in the aggregation of the host protein, and inclusion formation is a pathological hallmark of polyQ and other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Todd and Lim, 2013</xref>). We therefore asked if NLK could influence the ability of the polyQ-expanded AR to aggregate. Mutant AR forms large polyQ- and DHT-dependent aggregates that can be readily visualized in our cell model via immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 1–3</xref>). Co-expression of wild-type NLK (NLK-WT) significantly increased the number of cells containing visible aggregates in DHT-treated, mutant AR (AR120Q)-expressing NSC-34 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>), but did not cause a significant increase in aggregation in the absence of the AR ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This increase was polyQ-dependent, as NLK co-expression resulted in only minimal aggregation in cells expressing a non-pathogenic AR25Q protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 2, 3</xref>). Furthermore, this increase in aggregation was not detected when we used NLK-KN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), which harbors a lysine to methionine substitution at residue 155 and is defective for kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishitani et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of NLK does not alter the subcellular localization of non-aggregated AR or inhibit its nuclear translocation, although cells with robust aggregation often showed a slight reduction in nuclear staining, suggesting that much of the mutant protein was sequestered into aggregates in these cells. In addition, we did not recognize any obvious changes in subcellular localization between NLK-WT and NLK-KN, which could both be detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We also noticed that aggregated mutant AR protein could be detected biochemically in the stacking gel when we ran DHT-treated NSC-34 cell extracts on SDS-PAGE gels. Co-expression of NLK-WT increases this aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that NLK is able to affect polyQ-AR-specific defects within this cell culture system in a kinase activity-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NLK increases mutant AR aggregation in primary spinal cord motor neurons</title><p>To test whether NLK can also increase mutant AR aggregation in an in vivo motor neuron setting, we cultured mouse primary motor neurons from spinal cord and transfected with GFP-tagged polyQ-expanded mutant AR and either a control plasmid or FLAG-tagged NLK-WT in the presence or absence of DHT.

Mice heterozygous for either of two gene trap alleles (both simply referred to as <italic>Nlk</italic><sup><italic>gt/+</italic></sup> here) show a 50% reduction in NLK expression, while mice homozygous for the gene trap alleles show an approximately 90% reduction in protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, this decrease can be detected in both the spinal cord and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the two tissues primarily affected in SBMA. We also obtained mice that express a BAC transgene containing a 121Q <italic>AR</italic> and its endogenous regulatory elements (<italic>BAC fxAR121</italic>).

We analyzed L4–L5 anterior horn motor neurons and found that a reduction in NLK expression resulted in significantly larger motor neuron cell bodies than those seen in SBMA littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting an improvement in pathology. We next focused on muscle pathology, since muscle cramping and atrophy are prominent symptoms in SBMA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katsuno et al., 2012</xref>), and this SBMA mouse model shows an obvious muscle atrophy phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lieberman et al., 2014</xref>).

Since NLK binds AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) and is a kinase, we first tested whether NLK could phosphorylate AR. We noted that co-expression of AR with NLK-WT induced an electrophoretic mobility shift in the AR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 2, blue arrow) that was not seen with co-expression of NLK-KN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 3). This mobility shift was reversed when cell extracts were incubated with lambda phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lane 5, red arrow), suggesting that this shift represents an NLK-induced AR phosphorylation. NLK targets proline-directed serines and threonines. There are thus seven potential NLK target sites within the full-length AR protein. We were able to obtain phospho-specific antibodies for two of these sites, serine (S)81 and S308. NLK significantly increased AR phosphorylation at both of these sites in a kinase activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>). Evidence suggests that NLK can target AR in both the presence and absence of hormone (data not shown), but as the effect of NLK on the non-ligand-bound AR is unlikely to be disease relevant, we have focused on its ligand-dependent activity.

Expression of a polyQ-expanded 130 amino acid N-terminal fragment of AR (trAR<sup>112Q</sup>) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye results in a robust retinal degeneration and depigmentation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2002</xref>). This fragment is able to interact with NLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and contains only two putative NLK targets sites, S81 and S94. We found that mutating S94 to alanine did not affect the NLK-mediated increase in full-length mutant AR aggregation in NSC-34 cells (data not shown). We therefore predicted that if loss of one <italic>Nlk</italic> allele could rescue the toxicity of this polyQ-expanded AR N-terminal fragment, the mechanism would likely depend upon the interaction of NLK with AR and phosphorylation at S81. We first confirmed that NLK could still induce phosphorylation at S81 in this fragment by co-expressing the proteins in NSC-34 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We next crossed trAR<sup>112Q</sup> flies with <italic>nmo</italic> mutant flies and assessed the eye phenotypes of the resulting progeny. We found that loss of one copy of <italic>nmo</italic> reversed the depigmentation phenotype induced by the trAR<sup>112Q</sup> fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>). This result supports the idea that NLK may regulate the aggregation and toxicity of polyQ-expanded AR via N-terminal binding and AR-S81 phosphorylation in SBMA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>NLK promotes AR transactivation activity</title><p>SBMA is caused by polyQ expansion in the full-length AR protein, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are unclear. On one hand, it has been reported that mutant AR can be processed by proteases and the polyQ-containing AR fragments are toxic and aggregation-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellerby et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2002</xref>). Mutant AR inclusions in patient tissue can only be detected by N-terminal AR antibodies and not by antibodies to the AR C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 1998</xref>). It has therefore been speculated that aggregates are comprised of mostly N-terminal AR fragments, and there is some evidence from mouse models to support this theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2007</xref>). These fragments lack the AR DNA-binding domain, suggesting that the polyQ-dependent toxicity seen, for example, in the trAR<sup>112Q</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> model must occur in the absence of specific DNA binding and AR-mediated gene transcription. Our data show that NLK can modulate mutant AR toxicity in this fragment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>), suggesting that it can play a role in transcription-independent pathological pathways in SBMA, such as protein misfolding and aggregation. Of course, these fragment models show ligand-independent toxicity and therefore cannot recapitulate the specific features of SBMA. Furthermore, the ability of AR to bind DNA is known to be important for toxicity in a full-length mutant AR <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of SBMA, suggesting that SBMA may also arise via a mechanism that involves aberrant gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this idea, changes in gene expression have been detected in SBMA mouse models and this is believed to contribute to pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sopher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ranganathan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katsuno et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamiyama et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore wondered whether NLK was also able to affect the function of the full-length AR protein, as this may contribute to the molecular mechanism by which NLK affects SBMA in vivo. We started by testing if NLK could affect the ability of the mutant AR to activate gene transcription by making use of an AR-responsive luciferase reporter. Both wild-type and mutant AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>) are able to activate the expression of this reporter when expressed in DHT-treated NSC-34 cells, although, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mhatre et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomas et al., 2006</xref>), AR120Q showed less activity than AR25Q. When NLK was co-expressed with AR, it led to a robust increase in AR-mediated gene transcription in a hormone- and kinase activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While most nuclear hormone receptors regulate gene transcription primarily via the interaction of their ligand binding-induced AF-2 domain with cofactors that contain a LxxLL motif, AR is unique in that it contains an LxxLL-like site in its N-terminus (<sup>23</sup>FQNLF<sup>27</sup>) that interacts with its own AF-2 domain with a greater affinity than other motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2001</xref>). This intramolecular interaction is known as the N/C interaction and it causes AR to regulate gene transcription primarily through its AF-1 domain in lieu of the AF-2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2004</xref>). Loss of this interaction leads to a decrease in AR-mediated gene transcription at some, but not all AR-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callewaert et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, it has been previously reported that the N/C interaction is upstream of mutant AR aggregation and toxicity, as well as its phosphorylation at both S81 and S308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that NLK might be acting to promote this intramolecular interaction and thereby increase AR-mediated gene transcription, AR phosphorylation, and SBMA phenotypes. We tested this idea by performing a mammalian two-hybrid assay in which a VP16 activation domain-fused AR N-terminus (VP16-AR120Q-N) is co-transfected with a Gal4 DNA binding domain-fused AR C-terminus (Gal4-AR-C). When these AR N- and C-terminal fragments interact, they bring together the Gal4-DBD and the VP16 activation domain, leading to an increase in the expression of a co-transfected Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). When we carried out this assay in the presence of NLK, we found that, surprisingly, NLK inhibits the N/C interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This inhibition was NLK dose dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The N/C interaction was also inhibited by NLK-KN, but to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Once again, these effects were seen with both wild-type and mutant AR, although NLK inhibited the N/C interaction more robustly in the presence of the polyQ expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">Figure 11—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that NLK is able to prevent the N/C interaction via a mechanism that is only partially dependent on its kinase activity.</p><p>In order to confirm that NLK was still able to induce its effects on the mutant AR in the absence of this AR N/C interaction, we introduced a mutation in the N-terminal <sup>23</sup>FQNLF<sup>27</sup> motif of AR that prevents it from binding the AF-2 domain in the C-terminus of the protein (HA-AR120Q-L26A/F27A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2001</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callewaert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr et al., 2010</xref>), this construct tended to be compromised in its ability to aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>) and was significantly impaired in its ability to induce AR-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). It also showed a reduction in phosphorylation at AR-S81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3D</xref>), as was reported in a separate SBMA cell model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, co-expression of NLK-WT still increased the aggregation rate of this mutant AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). NLK increased AR-mediated gene transcription when co-expressed with the AR N/C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). NLK was also able to increase the phosphorylation of this construct at S81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3D</xref>), as well as at S308, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that NLK can influence the activity and toxicity of the mutant AR via a mechanism that is independent, but perhaps parallel to, the AR N/C interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>NLK promotes AR transactivation via the AR AF-2 domain</title><p>One important remaining question is how NLK can increase AR-meditated gene transcription while inhibiting its N/C interaction. AR regulates target gene transcription by interacting with several cofactors at both its AF-1 and AF-2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>), and these interactions can be altered by polyQ expansion. For example, the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) binds the polyQ-expanded AR more robustly than its wild-type counterpart in a mouse model of SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sopher et al., 2004</xref>) and can be sequestered into mutant AR aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCampbell et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that the interaction of this protein with mutant AR may be important for disease pathogenesis in vivo. In addition, AR is acetylated by CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2000</xref>), and this acetylation is also important for SBMA pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montie et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether NLK regulates AR transcriptional activity by altering cofactor interactions, and chose to look specifically at p300. As expected, we found that co-expression of p300 with NLK showed a higher level of AR-dependent transcriptional activity than with either cofactor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). This suggests that NLK may enhance coactivator recruitment to the polyQ-expanded AR and thereby increase AR-mediated gene transcription.</p><p>Based on our mammalian two-hybrid data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), we speculated that the binding of NLK to the N-terminus of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) sterically blocks the ability of the AR N-terminus to bind the C-terminal AF-2 domain. As the N/C interaction can inhibit cofactor binding at the AR AF-2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2001</xref>), we reasoned that NLK may be acting to relieve this inhibition and thereby promote gene transcription via the AR AF-2 domain. To test this, we introduced two different point mutations into the AR AF-2 domain to differentially inhibit cofactor binding. The AR AF-2 domain is flanked by two charged clamp residues that mediate its interaction with cofactors containing LxxLL or FxxLF motifs. K720A is a partial AF-2 mutation that neutralizes the charge of one of the clamps, preventing LxxLL motif binding and reducing FxxLF motif binding by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubbink et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>). E897K is a complete AF-2 mutation that reverses the charge at the other clamp, abolishing both LxxLL and FxxLF motif binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubbink et al., 2004</xref>). We carried out the AR-responsive luciferase assay with both mutants and found that the E897K mutation alone tended to slightly decrease AR-mediated gene transcription compared to that seen with a wild-type AR, while the K720A mutation did not affect AR activity in NSC-34 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). This is consistent with what was reported in COS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>). When we co-expressed a wild-type NLK with these AR mutants, we were still able to detect an increase in AR-mediated gene transcription with the K720A mutation. In contrast, NLK-mediated enhancement in AR activity was dramatically compromised by the E897K mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). These data suggest that the NLK-induced increase in AR transcriptional activity is dependent on a functional AR AF-2 domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>SBMA is a devastating neuromuscular disease without any cure or effective therapy to date. In this study, we explored whether and how NLK could modulate the pathogenesis of SBMA. By utilizing a variety of model systems, we clearly show that NLK is a key regulatory factor capable of modulating AR activity and SBMA pathology. Using a combination of cell culture, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse models, we show that reduced expression of NLK suppresses, while increased expression exacerbates, mutant AR-associated SBMA pathology, including protein aggregation, cellular toxicity and degeneration, and animal lethality phenotypes. It is particularly intriguing that the effects of NLK on the mutant polyQ-expanded AR and SBMA are consistent across different model systems, as this suggests that the role of NLK in SBMA pathogenesis is fundamental. Furthermore, all of these effects are clearly dependent on the kinase activity of NLK. Our work therefore strongly suggests that a reduction in NLK expression or enzymatic activity could be beneficial for SBMA patients.</p><p>Of particular importance is our finding that a 50% reduction in NLK expression partially rescues the phenotypes of an SBMA mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 6–8</xref>). This improvement in pathology was seen at 20 weeks of age in these mice and was more robust at the later time point of 30 weeks. By very late time points (i.e., 40 weeks), however, a reduction in NLK expression resulted in an improvement of only some of SBMA phenotypes assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6, 8E</xref>), and did not show a robust effect in other assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7, 8G</xref>). This suggests that a reduction in NLK expression may act to delay disease progression in this model, but is not sufficient to completely prevent the onset of the full SBMA phenotype. It should be noted that the majority of <italic>BAC fxAR121</italic> mice die before reaching this final time point, however, and so we cannot rule out the possibility that the small cohort of mice analyzed at 40 weeks represent an ‘escaper’ subset of SBMA mice that are slightly healthier than the average <italic>BAC fxAR121</italic> mouse. The reasons for the variation in the SBMA phenotype in these mice are not known, but may be interesting to investigate in the future. It is also worth mentioning that we analyzed the mice on a C57/129 F1 hybrid genetic background. Although they can be considered to be on a pure background for the purpose of this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of mouse background effects. Future studies on a different pure genetic background and/or using NLK inhibitors would be useful in corroborating our findings.</p><p>In this study, we uncovered some molecular mechanisms that we predict underlie the role of NLK in SBMA at the cellular level. First, NLK interacts with mutant AR at the N-terminal region of the protein, and, interestingly, polyQ expansion results in a more robust interaction between NLK and mutant AR in comparison to wild-type AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Second, consistent with our data that NLK modulates SBMA features in a kinase activity-dependent manner, NLK promotes the phosphorylation of AR, either directly or indirectly, at multiple sites, including S81 and S308 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). NLK-induced changes in AR-S81 phosphorylation can be detected in vivo in mice, and AR-S81 phosphorylation likely contributes to the effect of NLK on SBMA pathology in cell culture and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Interestingly, however, the S81A mutation decreased, but did not completely abolish, the NLK-mediated effects on mutant AR aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). This indicates that, while AR-S81 is likely an important NLK phosphorylation site in the N-terminal region of AR, there may be other NLK target sites outside of this region that also contribute to NLK-dependent AR toxicity in SBMA. Finally, NLK can affect the transcriptional activity of the mutant AR protein, and, once again, this is dependent on its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Unlike aggregation, which is dependent on the presence of a polyQ expansion, this effect is seen with both wild-type and mutant AR. This suggests that NLK normally acts as an AR cofactor or regulator. PolyQ expansion, while resulting in the aggregation of the protein, also affects the activity of the AR monomer, whose altered function in target gene transcription may exert pathology in SBMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>). The ability of NLK to promote the activity of the mutant AR could therefore exacerbate this polyQ-induced protein dysfunction. We suspect that both the modulation of mutant AR aggregation and the misregulation of its native functions ultimately contribute to SBMA pathology, and our data suggest that NLK influences both of these pathomechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08493.025</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>A potential model for the role of NLK in SBMA pathogenesis.</title><p>NLK can induce the phosphorylation of the polyQ-expanded AR, which influences its aggregation and contributes to its toxicity in SBMA models. NLK can also regulate the ability of the mutant AR to act as a transcription factor, which would enhance any aberrant AR-mediated gene transcription that contributes to SBMA pathology. A combination of these toxic mechanisms and others could ultimately result in the degeneration and pathology characteristic of SBMA. These events occur downstream of AR ligand binding and nuclear translocation. In addition, NLK may inhibit the AR N/C interaction to promote AR AF-2 cofactor binding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08493.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08493.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08493-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The binding of NLK to AR, and likely its subsequent phosphorylation, strongly inhibit the AR N/C interaction, and yet paradoxically increase AR-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–C</xref>). This led us to investigate whether NLK could regulate AR activity via the AF-2 domain, and indeed, we found that complete inhibition of cofactor binding at the AR AF-2 domain strongly compromised the ability of NLK to increase AR transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). The NLK effect on AR activity was not completely abolished by this mutation, however, suggesting that NLK may promote AF-1-dependent transcription, as well. Furthermore, the E897K mutation compromised the effect of NLK on AR activity more so than the K720A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). As these mutations both completely abolish LxxLL motif binding, this suggests that NLK may preferentially allow for FxxLF motif-containing cofactor binding at the AR AF-2 domain, and this possibility warrants further investigation. Once again, as the effect of NLK on AR transactivation and on the AR N/C interaction are seen with both wild-type and mutant AR, this role for NLK in the regulation of AR AF-2 cofactor interactions is likely a normal function of NLK in AR signaling. Given that NLK promotes SBMA pathology, this may suggest that the AR AF-2 domain is important for SBMA pathogenesis. Interestingly, a separate study found that the retinal degeneration phenotypes in a full-length mutant AR <italic>Drosophila</italic> model were also dependent upon the AF-2 domain of AR. This study also found that the E897K mutation at the AF-2 domain led to a more robust rescue of mutant AR phenotypes than K720A, again demonstrating that the ability of the AR AF-2 domain to bind FxxLF-containing cofactors may be important for SBMA pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nedelsky et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also find it intriguing that the effect of NLK on AR molecular functions is very similar to that of the primate-specific Melanoma Antigen Gene Protein 11 (MAGE-11). MAGE-11 has been reported to bind AR specifically at the <sup>23</sup>FQNLF<sup>27</sup> motif in the N-terminal region of the AR protein to prevent the N/C interaction and allow for cofactor binding at the AF-2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2005</xref>). MAGE-11 is also known to directly bridge interactions between AR and various cofactors, including TIF2 and p300, resulting in a synergistic activation of AR-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askew et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2010</xref>). Together with our data, this suggests that inhibition of the N/C interaction by specific AR cofactors represents a unique and intriguing approach to regulating AF-domain dominance in AR target gene transcription. It will be interesting to investigate whether there is any cross-talk between NLK and MAGE-11 in AR-mediated gene activation and, perhaps, even in SBMA disease pathogenesis.</p><p>We suspect that the NLK-mediated increase in AR transactivation results from an increase in cofactor binding at the AR AF-2 domain, thereby supporting a model in which AF-2-mediated interactions are important for SBMA pathogenesis. And yet, it is also clear that inhibiting the N/C interaction via point mutations in the AR <sup>23</sup>FQNLF<sup>27</sup> motif reduces mutant AR aggregation and toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orr et al., 2010</xref>), features that NLK clearly promotes. One explanation for this seemingly conflicting data is that the binding of NLK to AR and the subsequent phosphorylation of the AR protein, perhaps at S81, elicit an effect on the AR protein that is similar to the effect of the N/C interaction. In this model, NLK binding and the N/C interaction are parallel means of triggering a similar downstream pathogenic response. It should be stressed, however, that binding and phosphorylation by NLK does not preclude the need for AR ligand binding, as aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the formation of the AR AF-2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wärnmark et al., 2003</xref>) all depend upon the presence of androgens, and NLK has no effect on these features without ligand. Furthermore, the exact details of this downstream pathway are still not completely clear. For instance, toxicity could arise from aberrant AR-mediated gene transcription (via a combination of AF-1 and AF-2 dependent mechanisms), the sequestration of various cofactors into aggregates, the inability of certain cells to handle the accumulation of toxic AR conformers, or via some other as-yet-unknown pathogenic factors. Or, perhaps more likely, SBMA may arise from a combination of the above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>Given that NLK interacts with and phosphorylates the mutant AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9">Figures 1, 9</xref>), we suspect that it is acting cell autonomously to regulate AR activity based on the mechanism we propose. As our mouse studies were carried out using a constitutive knockdown of NLK, however, we cannot at this time determine where NLK exerts its effects on SBMA pathology. In other words, it could be regulating mutant AR activity in the spinal motor neurons, the skeletal muscle, or both. Future investigations using targeted NLK inhibitors or tissue-specific knockdown using both this and other SBMA mouse models could address these questions. It is also interesting to note that, although our data show that NLK can influence the aggregation of the mutant AR across multiple models, and that NLK has a robust effect on AR transactivation activity in cells, we saw only a partial rescue of SBMA muscle and motor neuron pathology with a reduction in NLK expression in mice. Why we did not see a more robust improvement of these phenotypes is an intriguing question. A simple explanation may be that the remaining 50% of NLK expression, AR phosphorylation, and mutant protein aggregation is enough to allow for the toxic effects of the mutant AR that directly result in decreased muscle fiber and motor neuron size. A more complete knockout of NLK would thus be needed to prevent degeneration. Mice heterozygous for the <italic>Nlk</italic> gene trap allele are largely normal, suggesting either that this lower expression of NLK is enough to adequately carry out wild-type functions of NLK in the adult mouse, or that some other factor or pathway compensates for the decrease in active NLK. It is possible that such a compensatory factor or pathway may also contribute to mutant AR-induced pathology when NLK expression is reduced.</p><p>Data presented here and in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that NLK is able to regulate the pathogenesis of two separate polyQ diseases: SBMA and SCA1. In both cases, evidence suggests that NLK binds to and phosphorylates the mutant protein and thereby regulates its aggregation and activity. Yet, why NLK interacts with multiple polyQ proteins is an open question that warrants future investigation. We also noted that co-expression of NLK seemed to increase AR protein levels in NSC-34 cells and in the AR61Q <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, as well as separately influence its propensity to aggregate<italic>.</italic> This suggests that NLK may play a role in the stabilization of AR, specifically at the protein level, as both of these systems express AR under the control of exogenous promoters. In the <italic>BAC fxAR121</italic> mice, however, the AR121Q protein levels between mice with full NLK expression and those with a 50% reduction in NLK are not significantly different across the population assayed (data not shown). As all the mice assayed did show a rescue in the degenerative phenotype, however, we concluded that another mechanism must be playing a role in these mice and therefore investigated the possibility of a direct interaction between NLK and AR. That direct mechanism is the focus of the current study. Nonetheless, we noted that a subset of about 30–40% of the mice did show a reduction in mutant AR protein levels with a reduction in NLK expression. We therefore speculate that NLK may also play a role in protein clearance pathways, and that this, in turn, may contribute to the ability of NLK to regulate mutant protein aggregation and toxicity in varying disease cases. We ultimately suspect that both direct and indirect regulation of mutant protein expression/aggregation and activity underlies the role of NLK in disease.</p><p>Lastly, although there is still much to be understood about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SBMA and the role of NLK therein, our data clearly show that NLK normally promotes the disease condition and that reduction of NLK expression or activity is sufficient to partially rescue SBMA pathogenicity. We are confident in this conclusion because we utilized a multi-system approach to address the question. NLK is therefore a novel and interesting putative therapeutic target. We should note that complete loss of NLK function may cause severe problems, however, since NLK plays a role in multiple signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishitani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohkawara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishitani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishitani and Ishitani, 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, <italic>Nlk</italic><sup><italic>gt/+</italic></sup> heterozygous mice are generally healthy and our study provides convincing evidence that a 50% reduction in NLK protects against SBMA pathogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 6–8</xref>). Thus, this study suggests that putative treatments that target NLK may not need to completely inactivate the protein to generate a therapeutic effect. It will be very interesting to determine if pharmacologically inhibiting NLK can also rescue SBMA features at the mammalian level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>The following mutant and transgenic flies were used in this study: <italic>GMR-Gal4</italic> (Bloomington Stock Center), <italic>UAS-EGFP</italic> (Bloomington Stock Center), <italic>UAS-AR14Q</italic> (current study), <italic>UAS-AR61Q</italic> (current study), <italic>UAS-trAR</italic><sup><italic>112Q</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>UAS-NLK-WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>UAS-NLK-KN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>nmo</italic><sup><italic>adk1</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verheyen et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>nmo</italic><sup><italic>adk2</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Verheyen et al., 2001</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Louis Ptáček (Reviewing editor and peer reviewer) and Hank Paulson (peer reviewer).</p><p>Todd and colleagues explore the role of Nemo like kinase (NLK) as a regulator of disease processes in the neurodegenerative disorder, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). SBMA is a polyglutamine expansion disease that specifically affects motor neurons. Todd and colleagues use a wide range of models and assays to address the potential role of NLK in disease pathogenesis. Particular strengths of the study include genetic crosses between SBMA mice and mice haploinsufficient for NLK that strongly suggest it is indeed a modulator of disease processes and studies establishing that NLK can phosphorylate the disease protein in SBMA, the androgen receptor (AR), at specific sites. Taken together, results in the mouse crosses, fly models of disease and in cell-based assays of transcription, phosphorylation and protein-protein interaction, support the view that NLK directly phosphorylates the androgen receptor and directly binds the protein. While much of the data support the view that AR phosphorylation mediated by NLK is a principal driver of AR protein accumulation, aggregation and toxicity, additional evidence suggests that a direct interaction between AR and NLK independent of kinase activity inhibits AR intramolecular (N/C) interactions and alters AR association with transcription factors, separately adding to the toxicity of expanded AR. Overall the results are thorough and build a solid case for the role of NLK in this polyglutamine disease. While there are some inconsistencies in the data – for example, the variable extent of modulation in two separate fly models deficient in the NLK ortholog and an intriguing discrepancy between established factors contributing to toxicity and the effect of NLK on intramolecular interactions of mutant AR – these are not a significant issue and do not lessen the import of the study. Indeed, the authors do a good job of explaining their, sometimes conflicting, data and avoiding over-interpretation of key findings.</p><p>Studies by the same group previously showed that NLK could modulate SCA1 disease pathogenesis, SCA1 being another polyglutamine disorder. While this convergence on NLK in two related diseases arguably increases the impact of the current findings, it is striking that two separate disease proteins with little functional connection show similar relationships to NLK. One wonders whether there are indirect neuroprotective effects of this kinase on cellular pathways, not yet been explored, that may explain aspects of disease regulation by this signaling protein. The studies are a significant advance in the field and provide insight into the broader area of pathogenic factors underlying polyglutamine disorders.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig10">Figure 1-5, and 10</xref> ANOVA should be used instead of <italic>t</italic>-test in these multivariable instances.</p><p>2) A larger question that needs to be addressed is why a major change seen in the molecular data regarding aggregation and phosphorylation and a relatively minor change is seen phenotypically in the mouse (lifespan, muscle fiber, etc.).</p><p>3) The first paragraph of the Discussion belongs in the Introduction.</p><p>4) Third paragraph of Discussion: why is the 40-week old data not shown but discussed in the manuscript?</p><p>5) In the Discussion section, a hypothesis is floated out to the reader, conformational change, multiple times.

To summarize, we currently suspect, based on the data presented, that NLK normally interacts with and phosphorylates AR and regulates its interactions with its cofactors. This in turn influences the transactivation activity of AR. However, others and we have postulated that its activity and its interactions with its cofactors are likely altered, resulting in protein dysfunction and pathology. As NLK is still able to bind this mutant AR, we predict that its normal role in regulating AR activity now acts to enhance the dysfunction and toxicity of the receptor. At the same time, our data suggest that phosphorylation of the mutant (not wild-type) AR by NLK promotes its aggregation, enhancing the toxic effects of this aggregation process, as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
