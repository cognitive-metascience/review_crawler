population genetics and evolution, from haplotype structure and long-distance genetic linkage to the generation of new allelic variants of genes. To this end, we resequenced the four products of 13 meiotic tetrads along with 10 doubled haploids derived from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> hybrids. GC detection through short reads has previously been confounded by genomic rearrangements. Rigid filtering for misaligned reads allowed GC identification at high accuracy and revealed an ∼80-kb transposition, which undergoes copy-number changes mediated by meiotic recombination. Non-crossover associated GCs were extremely rare most likely due to their short average length of ∼25–50 bp, which is significantly shorter than the length of CO-associated GCs. Overall, recombination preferentially targeted non-methylated nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters, which showed significant enrichment of two sequence motifs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01426.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01426.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01426.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most living organisms package their DNA into bundles called chromosomes. These chromosomes generally form pairs, with each chromosome in the pair containing the same number of genes. The genes also come in the same order, but the exact sequence of DNA bases within the genes can be different.</p><p>When sex cells—such as egg, sperm or pollen cells—are made, each pair of chromosomes is separated so that the each sex cell contains only half the normal number of chromosomes. However, before they are separated, the pairs swap lengths of DNA via recombination events. These can involve exchanging large chunks of the chromosomes: this is called a ‘crossover’. Alternatively, short stretches of one chromosome can be replaced by the corresponding region from the other in the pair. When these ‘non-crossovers’ cause a change in the DNA sequence they are known as gene conversions.</p><p>Long-standing questions in the field of plant biology include: how common are gene conversions? How much DNA is typically exchanged? And where in the chromosomes do these events happen most? Now, Wijnker et al. have addressed these questions by focusing on the accurate detection of recombination events, with a special emphasis on gene conversions, in the plant biologist’s favourite species: Arabidopsis.</p><p>Searching for recombination events is a challenge because, when piecing together an entire genome from lots of shorter stretches of DNA—typically called ‘reads’, it is easy to misplace some of the pieces. However, meticulous examination of these short DNA reads allowed Wijnker et al. to reliably identify gene conversions on a genome-wide scale. In Arabidopsis, gene conversion appears to be unexpectedly rare—with approximately one gene conversion detected per 140–240 non-crossovers. Recombination tends to occur in regions of the chromosomes where the DNA is only loosely packaged, is not heavily modified by the process of ‘DNA methylation’, and also near the start of genes. Furthermore, two specific sequences of DNA bases were identified that marked ‘hot spots’ in the chromosomes, where recombination happens more frequently.</p><p>Wijnker et al. suggest that the low number of gene conversions detected indicates that non-crossovers tend to exchange very short stretches of DNA. However, future research may point to additional mechanisms that explain the low incidence of gene conversion in Arabidopsis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01426.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01426.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>meiotic recombination</kwd><kwd>gene conversion</kwd><kwd>next generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>double strand break repair</kwd><kwd>meiotic tetrad</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowan</surname><given-names>Beth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Velikkakam James</surname><given-names>Geo</given-names></name><name><surname>Klasen</surname><given-names>Jonas R</given-names></name><name><surname>Rawat</surname><given-names>Vimal</given-names></name><name><surname>Schneeberger</surname><given-names>Korbinian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBO long-term fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wijnker</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive and genome-wide description of the genomic make-up and frequency of meiotic recombination in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> reveals regional preferences, including nucleosome-free regions, and two associated recombination motifs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexually reproducing organisms are thought to have an advantage over asexual species, as novel allele combinations can emerge after meiosis in each generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Visser and Elena, 2007</xref>). Besides randomly passing on one of the homologous chromosomes to the next generation, meiosis introduces intra-chromosomal recombination. In addition to potentially generating superior allele combinations, this shuffling of alleles avoids Muller’s ratchet, in which asexual individuals accumulate deleterious mutations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muller, 1932</xref>). The impact of meiotic recombination on the allele distribution among offspring, and consequently on the haplotype structure of whole populations, depends on the rate and positioning of recombination events, which are initiated by the induction of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs).</p><p>Meiotic DSBs are repaired through homologous recombination (HR), in which homologous sequences are used as repair templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>). The broken strand invades a homologous chromosome and is repaired through HR repair intermediates like the D-loop and double Holliday junction. These intermediates are resolved either as crossovers (COs), leading to the reciprocal exchange of complete chromosome arms, or non-crossovers (NCOs). In both cases, heteroduplexes may arise from sequence divergence at the site of the strand invasion. When these are resolved, they can give rise to gene conversions (GCs), the non-reciprocal exchange of alleles between homologous non-sister chromatids. Such events typically lead to a 3:1 segregation of alleles among the four gametes of a single meiosis. GCs can be associated with COs (CO–GCs) or with NCOs (NCO–GCs) where they can introduce new alleles into an otherwise unchanged genetic background, depending on how the HR intermediate was resolved.</p><p>The number of GCs depends on the number of DSBs, polymorphism density, and on the tract lengths of HR repair intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kauppi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dooner and Martínez-Férez, 1997</xref>). Though some general characteristics of meiotic recombination may be shared among sexually reproducing organisms, such as the 150–250 DSBs that are formed at the onset of meiosis in yeast (<italic>Saccaromyces cerevisiae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiner and Kleckner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buhler et al., 2007</xref>), mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moens et al., 1997</xref>) and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vignard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>), the outcomes of meiosis with around 90, 27 and 10 COs per meiosis are profoundly different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giraut et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salome et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are three recent reports assessing GC rates in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al.

They identified three CO–GCs and two NCO–GCs per meiosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al.

Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al. (2012)</xref> made use of fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Francis et al., 2007</xref>) in a <italic>qrt</italic> mutant background to assess GC rates at transgenic loci, which when extrapolated to the whole-genome suggest a similar GC rate as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al. (2012)</xref>.</p><p>We have sequenced the four products of each of 13 meiotic tetrads and 10 homozygous doubled haploid (DH) offspring obtained from heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> hybrids. We show that short read alignment-based artifacts, which result from structural differences between parental genomes, can greatly inflate the apparent incidence of GCs. In total, we identified over 200 recombination events to the nucleotide level. These data suggest that recombination does not seem to be affected by sequence divergence, but revealed their preference for open chromatin and a significant association to two sequence motifs. Aided by simulations we provide estimates on gene conversion rates and associated tract lengths. CO-associated GCs are at ∼300–400 bp between 6–16 times longer than GCs resulting from NCOs (25–50 bp). The recovery of a ∼80 kb transposition that through crossover recombination leads to duplications and deletions in the offspring underlines the potential of meiosis to not only create new allele combinations but also to cause copy-number alterations of transposed sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequencing and genotyping of meiotic tetrads</title><p>We constructed F<sub>1</sub> hybrids of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions Columbia (Col) and Landsberg <italic>erecta</italic> (L<italic>er</italic>) in the <italic>quartet1 (qrt1</italic>) −/− background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preuss et al., 1994</xref>) and crossed individual pollen tetrads to a male sterile EMS mutant of the Cape Verde Island (Cvi) accession as a female receptor.

NCO–GCs can be detected by searching for L<italic>er</italic> alleles in regions inherited from Col, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. We distinguished between two different types of NCO–GCs. The first type can be detected at markers where the expected allele is isogenic to the recipient parent (Cvi). Here, NCO–GCs alter a homozygous into a heterozygous genotype (type-1 NCO–GCs). The second type is detected when the expected allele is different from the Cvi allele, and NCO–GCs change a heterozygous genotype into a homozygous genotype (type-2 NCO–GCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the footprint for type-2 NCO–GCs is the absence of one of the parental alleles, high sequencing depth is required to be confident in assigning a null-allele. In a previous study, this was addressed by removing all type-2 NCO–GCs from the analysis, effectively removing around 50% of the markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Precise identification of NCO–GCs relies on accurate detection of homozygous and heterozygous states at polymorphic markers, which in turn depends on two criteria: a reliable short read alignment-based allele frequency threshold for distinguishing between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, and a sufficient number of aligned sequence reads. In order to define the first, we summarized short read alignment-derived frequencies of the parental allele at all type-1 and type-2 marker positions. Fitting beta distributions to the observed allele frequency distributions allowed for the identification of a global, coverage-dependent cutoff that distinguishes between heterozygous and homozygous genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>To establish a minimum coverage threshold, we reasoned that insufficient coverage will lead to increased detection of (false-positive) NCO–GCs, but once a critical coverage is met, higher coverage requirements will not further impact the frequency of NCO–GCs candidate predictions. We calculated the frequency of NCO–GCs (defined as the ratio of converted markers divided by all markers) for a wide range of minimal coverage thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). At coverage levels of at least 50x, the frequency of NCO–GCs remained stable, and this sequence depth was subsequently used as the minimal threshold.</p><p>Combining both the allele frequency and the coverage thresholds, we were able to confidently assign genotypes to 2,477,241 markers within the five deeply sequenced complete tetrads.

Because Col and L<italic>er</italic> alleles segregate in an equal (2:2) ratio among the four tetrad offspring, both types of NCO–GCs are expected to occur at similar numbers. However, we identified a striking overrepresentation of type-1 NCO–GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). As mentioned, type-1 NCO–GCs introduce heterozygous genotype calls at markers where homozygous genotype calls would be expected. Such patterns of putative heterozygous alleles can also be introduced by erroneously aligned reads. By manually screening short read alignments, we found a large fraction of putative NCO–GCs residing in regions in which the parental lines had been assigned heterozygous genotypes. Since all three parental lines are highly inbred, and hence homozygous throughout their genomes, the presence of heterozygous marker calls can only be explained by misaligned reads that result from unknown rearrangements or repeats. This is especially critical for L<italic>er</italic> and Cvi, where genome information is more limited than for the reference accession Col. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows an example where three haplotypes appear to be present at a single locus when the short read data of L<italic>er</italic> are aligned against the Col reference genome.

Most remarkable was an ∼80 kb region on chromosome three, in three out of five independent tetrads, which harbored multiple closely linked putative type-2 NCO–GCs, but not a single type-1 NCO–GC. Thus, all these putative NCO–GCs were homozygous genotypes, which suggested another source of error. Intriguingly, for each of these tetrads, one other offspring was found with a similar pattern in the same region, but in contrast these offspring featured only putative type-1 NCO–GCs (heterozygous genotypes). Manual inspection of short read alignments and de novo assemblies of L<italic>er</italic> revealed a so-far undescribed large-scale rearrangement between Col and L<italic>er</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This rearrangement encompasses two closely linked transpositions, which together relocated ∼40 kb (including six genes) from ∼22.53–22.57 Mb of the reference genome to 17.36 Mb on chromosome 3 in the genome of L<italic>er</italic>. Additionally, the region adjacent to the transposed sequences (between 22.51 Mb and 22.59 Mb on chromosome 3) appeared to be mostly absent in L<italic>er</italic>. The segregation of this complex region in combination with a CO in between the two insertion sites of the transpositions resulted in either a duplication or a deletion of the transposed sequence within individual offspring genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As a consequence, this unexpected copy number variation introduced false NCO–GC calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Among all 13 tetrads (including the eight shallow sequenced tetrads), there are seven that show a recombination event between the transposed regions, suggesting that an ∼80 kb duplication/deletion is present in about half of all Col-L<italic>er</italic> gametes.</p><p>An earlier report highlighted the region at ∼22.5 Mb as hotspot for double recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, each of the genomes with a putative double recombination event at this position within the graphical genotypes also featured a CO between the insertion sites, which leads to the above-mentioned copy number variations and misleading genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To remove these and similar patterns we utilized the presence of the Cvi alleles. We assigned individual read pairs to one of the three parental genotypes whenever closely linked polymorphisms allowed distinguishing all three parental alleles.

From this, we estimated a spontaneous mutation rate of 1.1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> ± 1.0 ×10<sup>−8</sup> per site per generation, which is slightly higher than the estimated mutation rate of 7.0 × 10<sup>−9</sup> for sexually reproducing plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ossowski et al., 2010</xref>). Like for the spontaneous mutation rates, we observed an enrichment of transitions (n = 6) over transversions (n = 2). An increased mutation rate in haploids could result from the absence of a homologous repair template in haploid (G1) cells that might lead to increased repair through the presumably more error-prone pathway of non-homologous end-joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorbunova and Levy, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, the process of uni-parental genome elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanei et al., 2011</xref>) could potentially cause mutagenic stress. Even if spontaneous mutation rates are increased in the DH lines, there are on average no more than two mutations per DH genome, which is by far not large enough to interfere with the accurate identification of GCs, which act on existing variation only.</p><p>To assess a minimal coverage threshold to identify putative NCO–GCs for the DH lines, we used the same allele frequency cutoffs as for the analysis of the tetrad samples and calculated the conversion frequency for a series of minimal coverage thresholds.

Since homologous recombination requires homology for strand invasion, we speculated that overall COCTs should prefer regions with higher similarity. The distribution of sequence identity at COCTs was not found to be significantly different from randomly sampled regions from the chromosome arms with similar lengths. However, around 3.9% of these regions featured less than 5% confidently aligned positions, when aligning short reads of L<italic>er</italic> against the reference sequence. Such regions, which nearly completely miss any homology, were not targeted by any recombination according our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Nevertheless, reliable identification of a true lower border for the tolerance for sequence divergence at CO sites will be difficult to establish. This would require many more CO events, but also more precise information on the positioning of DSBs and strand invasion, since it is possible that recombination events are initiated adjacent to their resulting conversion tracts.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01426.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sequence similarity at recombination sites, length differences between COCTs and NCOCTs and crossover interference.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percentage of confidently aligned positions within the resequencing of L<italic>er</italic> was used as proxy for local sequence similarity.

These additional GCs did not pass our final filters, but have all been confirmed by PCR. In total, we identified 18 converted polymorphisms, which could be assigned to 14 distinct NCO conversion tracts (NCOCTs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). Ten of these NCOCTs consisted of a single polymorphism and the remaining four of two converted polymorphisms. Such short NCOCTs cannot be used to distinguish between NCOCTs resulting from co-conversion and more complex tracts of alternating 3:1 and 2:2 segregating markers, as the detection of complex conversions requires NCOCTs with at least three consecutive markers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>COs have longer gene conversion tracts than NCOs</title><p>The length distributions of observed CO and NCO conversion tracts are significantly different (p value 0.03 [<italic>t</italic> test], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Estimating the actual GC tract lengths from the observed GC tract lengths is difficult if the observed tracts are short and the marker density is relatively low. In particular for NCOCTs, where a majority of observed tracts had a length of 1 bp, tract length estimations are tenuous. We therefore performed simulations to determine the expected total number of converted markers within the five deeply sequenced tetrads and the average number of markers within a single conversion given different lengths of simulated conversion tracts.</p><p>For COCTs, we simulated 10,000 sets of 71 randomly placed COCTs of increasing conversion tract lengths from 100 bp to 1 kb and calculated the resulting total number of converted markers among all 71 COCTs and the average number of converted markers per tract. We found that a simulated length of ∼400 bp corresponds to an average number of 69.9 converted markers, which is very close to the 72 converted markers observed in the tetrad samples. An average of 2.2 converted markers per tract corresponds to a simulated COCT length of ∼300 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Differences between these two estimates might result from the fact that we simulated a fixed COCT length, while actual COCTs might feature variability in their lengths. From this we estimated that COCTs are on average ∼300–400 bp in length.</p><p>We repeated this simulation for NCOCTs. In contrast to simulations for COCTs, simulating NCOCT placement is hampered by the lack of knowledge of how many NCOs were present. It is likely that not all NCOs lead to GC, either due to restoration of the original allele as was assumed for half of the NCOs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mancera et al., 2008</xref>), or because they occur in regions without polymorphisms. We therefore simulated different NCO rates within the range of reported DSBs per meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vignard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>). We further assumed that half of them are restored to the original alleles and thus only 50% of them have the potential to lead to conversions (green to yellow colored lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These simulations suggested that 100 DSBs per meiosis with a tract length of 50 bp would lead to the detection of 6.7 converted markers on average, which is close to the observed number of 7. Likewise, simulating 200 DSBs per meiosis with a tract length of 25 bp would lead to a similar number of converted markers (average number of conversions was 6.5) (left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that a substantial fraction of meiotic DSBs is repaired through the (identical) sister chromatid and thus does not lead to GC. In order to test this, we simulated a range of very small numbers of meiotic DSBs with a tract length of 400 bp (our estimate of COCT length) and found that no more than 10 DSBs per meiosis repaired through the homologous chromatid would be sufficient to convert as many markers as we had observed in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, simulated tracts of ∼400 bp co-converted significantly more markers per CT as we observed in the real conversions (right side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, short NCOCTs lengths (averaging at 25–50 bp) would be in agreement with the low recovery rate of NCOs in studies on plant meiosis, and would concur with reported estimates of meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vignard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>).

Likewise five of the 60 CO events in the DH lines overlapped with genes, resulting in the generation of putative new allelic variants of genes. This is most likely a severe underestimate, as we only used available markers and might have missed some of the remaining polymorphisms, which could give rise to new variants of genes.

Potential causes for differences may lie in local GC formation differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), experimental variation (e.g., plant growth conditions) or the higher probability of meiotic DSBs to occur in transgenes.</p><p>In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the ∼1–3 NCO–GCs and ∼10 COs per meiosis we observed do not amount to the 120 to 250 DSBs that were observed during meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vignard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chelysheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>).

In the case of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which has a selfing rate of at least 85% (and much higher in most populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bomblies et al., 2010</xref>]), this impact will be relatively small in comparison to other organisms.</p><p>As shown in our analyses, meiotic recombination is an effective mechanism to generate new copy number variants, as was previously suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al.

The identification of an 80 kb transposition that is present on the same chromosome, but distant enough to allow for intermittent CO events, generated haploid genotypes that either lost or duplicated the transposed sequence. While we can currently only speculate on the resulting fitness (dis-)advantages for their offspring, the genomic effect of combining crossover recombination with genomic structural variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneeberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2011</xref>) provides significant potential for further selection and shaping of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> pan-genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of meiotic tetrads and doubled haploids lines</title><p>For the generation of meiotic tetrads, a Col–L<italic>er</italic> hybrid in a <italic>quartet</italic>1 background was made by crossing <italic>qrt1 −/−</italic> Col (N660403) to <italic>qrt1 −/−</italic> L<italic>er</italic> (N8050), which were obtained from the Nottingham <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Stock Center.

The male sterility mutant was selected from an EMS treated Cvi population and backcrossed twice to Cvi. These plants were grown under standard long day conditions in a growth chamber. Over 700 unique pollinations were made. All resulting siliques were individually harvested, and when four seeds were recovered from one silique, the resulting plants were grown under short day conditions to maximize rosette size before harvesting. Plants were genotyped using a previously described SNP marker set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wijnker et al., 2012</xref>) to verify that all markers segregate in the expected tetrad 2:2 ratio.

One-half to one gram of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle and transferred to a 15-ml polyethylene centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of ice-cold nuclei extraction buffer, consisting of 10 mM TRIS-HCl pH 9.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 500 mM sucrose, 4 mM spermidine, 1 mM spermine and 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol.

At both sequencing facilities, quality checks were performed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100, Agilent, Böblingen, Germany). Libraries for the doubled haploids, parents and the five deeply sequenced tetrads were generated using the Illumina Genomic DNA TruSeq sample kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries for the eight shallowly sequenced tetrads were prepared by fragmenting the DNA using dsDNA Shearase (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) to obtain 100- to 1000-bp fragments, A-tailing using Klenow exonuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, USA), ligating to indexed adapters using the QuickLigation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, USA), size selection to 300 to 500 bp using AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman-Coulter, Pasadena, CA), and PCR enrichment using the Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA, USA). The complete methodological details for the latter library preparation protocol will appear in a separate manuscript that is currently in preparation for publication. The samples were sequenced on Illumina Genome Analyzer GAIIx and Illumina HiSeq2000 in 100 bp paired-end runs.

In addition we removed all markers that resided in putative duplications, transposable elements, in regions that showed enriched coverage or that were closer than 150 bp to a position that showed evidence of two different alleles in the resequencing of one of the parental genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).</p><p>For the reconstruction of the individual tetrad genomes, we assigned either a Col or L<italic>er</italic> allele to each marker if there was a resequencing quality score greater than 15. This initial genotyping was used to identify COs by merging consecutive markers of the same genotype into blocks of markers. Blocks with at least 25 consecutive markers were used as seeds. COs positions were identified by extending the seeds until the nearest block of the other genotype with more markers than the preceding block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Identification and rate estimation of NCO–GCs in tetrad genomes</title><p>NCO–GC identification was attempted in the deeply sequenced tetrad genomes only. An NCO–GC was reported if the genotype at a marker was different from the background that was assigned in the initial genotyping. In order to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes reliably, we required a minimum coverage threshold and a coverage-dependent allele frequency cutoff. We established a coverage-dependent frequency cutoff that allows identifying homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at identical error rates. To this end, we fitted beta distributions to the observed distribution of allele frequencies as measured by the short read alignments at type-1 and type-2 markers respectively (an example for a minimal coverage of 50 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The unique point at which both distributions share the same quartile has been defined as the allele frequency threshold. This was repeated at multiple minimal coverage thresholds. Assigning homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at the same error rate allows for the calculation of the frequency of NCO–GCs by dividing markers with assigned NCO–GC by all markers with an assigned genotype. For the identification of a minimal coverage threshold, NCO–GC frequencies were calculated at multiple minimal coverage values. Calculations with lower coverage thresholds revealed higher NCO–GC rates compared to calculations with more stringent coverage thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>NCO–GC identification was initially performed on the set of markers used for CO identification. Though this marker set was defined in order to include high quality markers only, further filtering was necessary. Several filtering steps were applied, each reducing the number of markers. First, we extended the regions which encompass putative duplications and which were not allowed to feature markers. Each transposable element and putative duplicated region (as defined by the resequencing analysis performed with SHORE) was extended by 2 kb. Regions around heterozygous positions were defined as 1 kb up- and down-stream. The second filtering excluded all those markers in which we found evidence of read pair alignments from three different parents, which is a reliable indicator of wrong alignments. As a third filtering step, we removed markers where local sequence divergence hampered the alignment of L<italic>er</italic> short reads to the reference sequence.</p><p>Finally we removed all markers that were shown to segregate in a 2:2 manner within the Sanger sequencing data. As the absolute number of false positive NCO–GCs was relatively low compared to the absolute number of markers, we conclude that this is also true for the non-NCO–GCs. Errors result from technical artifacts and thus affect NCO–GCs and non-NCO–GCs equally, and thus the absolute number of false negatives is negligible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identification and validation of the 80 kb of transposed sequences</title><p>Initial identification of the 80 kb transposition was based on the recombinant tetrad genomes showing copy number variation at the transposition sites, which led to false GC calls.

(2008)</xref>. For each permutation test we generated 10,000 iterations. Instead of randomizing recombination locations we randomized the labels of the tetrads of each CO, and thereby preserved the inhomogeneity of CO placement across the genome. Chromatid interference, the non-random association of the chromatids involved in two adjacent CO, would violate the validity of this background distribution of our permutation tests.

We used the coverage-dependent frequency cutoffs identified in the analysis of the tetrad samples in order to identify to what level of ambiguous reads can be accepted at homozygous positions. This allowed the identification (and removal) of markers that are most likely featuring alignments from different loci in the genome. Calculating the probability of NCO–GCs per marker at a series of minimum coverage thresholds revealed that beyond a minimal coverage of 10, the frequency of NCO–GC remained stable. This threshold was used in the subsequent identification of GCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Identification of spontaneous mutations in the DH lines</title><p>For the sequencing of the doubled haploid samples, we pooled the DNA of at least four sibling double haploid plants for each sample. Spontaneous mutations, which occurred in the pollen or egg cell of the haploid progenitor plant, as well as recent somatic mutations of individual doubled haploid plants will not be fixed in these pools. By comparing the resequencing data of all 10 samples, we identified mutations, which are specific for one of the DH samples. These encompass mutations that happened in the haploid life cycle before meiotic cell divisions. Only homozygous positions with a SHORE score of greater than or equal to 32 were probed for spontaneous mutations. Like the identification of NCO–GCs, the identification of spontaneous mutations required a minimal coverage of 10, an allele frequency higher than the cutoff to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous positions (as defined for the tetrad analysis), and equivalent evidence for the non-mutant allele in the other samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Meiotic DSB-associated motif identification</title><p>We searched for consensus motifs at 67 conversion tracts identified in tetrads and DH lines.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The distribution of non-crossover association gene conversion (NCO-GC) events in large genomes (such as those of plants and mammals) is of interest to those studying both recombination processes and also the evolutionary impacts of recombination. Several previous papers have studied rates and patterns of NCO-GC in Arabidopsis. This paper adds to the literature by sequencing both meiotic tetrads (13 total, 5 in great detail) and doubled haploids (DH; 10 total). The authors take great care to reduce the false positive rate for gene-conversion events, which results in a fairly limited number of events (7 validated NCO-GC events meeting all filters from the tetrads, 9 from the DH lines). They analyse the rate of GC (both CO and NCO), tract lengths, interference, relationship to genomic feature and possible motifs. Although the findings largely replicate those seen in other organisms, the demonstration in Arabidopsis is important and the experimental is carried out and analysed at a very high level.</p><p>In revision, we would like you to address the following points.</p><p>1) It would be interesting to see a blow-up of any CO events associated with NCOs with patterns of Col and Ler markers between the 4 sister genomes shown. In particular, to show the spatial relationships between the observed COs and gene conversion tracts.</p><p>2) When trying to fit models of tract length and GC rate, it is important to include not just the observed number of conversion events, but also the distribution of the number of SNPs co-converted. This will help resolve the relationship between rate and length.</p><p>3) During sequencing of the DH lines the authors observe a two-fold higher rate of mutation compared to published rates, which is attributed to their haploid life cycle. Do the authors mean that this occurs due to the absence of a sister template to repair from? Interestingly, they estimate a higher conversion frequency at COs – do the authors have enough information to know whether specific types of mutations (e.g., transitions/transversions) are occurring?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01426.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It would be interesting to see a blow-up of any CO events associated with NCOs with patterns of Col and Ler markers between the 4 sister genomes shown. In particular, to show the spatial relationships between the observed COs and gene conversion tracts</italic>.</p><p>We have added visualizations of the genomic regions of 71 CO sites, for which sufficient sequencing information was available for the reconstruction of putative conversions tract. The visualizations include the parental genomes and all four genomes of the respective tetrads (see Supplementary file 3).</p><p><italic>2) When trying to fit models of tract length and GC rate, it is important to include not just the observed number of conversion events, but also the distribution of the number of SNPs co-converted. This will help resolve the relationship between rate and length</italic>.</p><p>We agree this indeed advances our simulations. We have now included a comparison of the average number of co-converted markers per conversion tract. In addition, we do not only show average values, but added standard deviations. This additional analysis corroborates that the tract lengths of COs and NCOs are drastically different.</p><p><italic>3) During sequencing of the DH lines the authors observe a two-fold higher rate of mutation compared to published rates, which is attributed to their haploid life cycle. Do the authors mean that this occurs due to the absence of a sister template to repair from</italic>?</p><p>The higher mutation rate in Arabidopsis haploids may have diverse causes. The absence of a homologous repair template in haploid cells in G1 might lead to more (presumably error-prone) repair through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). However, it is also conceivable that the process of uni-parental genome elimination causes mutagenic stress (i.e., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanei et al., 2011</xref>, PNAS). We have now added a sentence that clarifies this. In the original version of the manuscript we included 1-bp deletions in the calculation of the mutation rates. Excluding those (as it was done in the estimation of the wild-type mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ossowski et al, 2010</xref>, Science)) decreased our estimation slightly, but it is still more than 1.5 times higher as compared to published rates. Like for the original calculations this observation does not reveal a statistically significant difference.</p><p>Independent of any mechanistic reason for a putative enrichment in spontaneous mutations we had to check whether the mutation frequency is elevated to such drastic degrees that it would interfere with the identification with NCO-GCs. This was not the case.</p><p><italic>Interestingly, they estimate a higher conversion frequency at COs – do the authors have enough information to know whether specific types of mutations (e.g., transitions/transversions) are occurring</italic>?</p><p>Indeed, our analysis (of the tetrad samples) suggests higher conversion frequencies at COs as compared to NCOs, however this difference is not significant. The overall limited number of spontaneous point mutations makes it hard to characterize the spectrum of mutations. However among these eight mutations were 6 transitions and 2 transversions. This fits to the enrichment of transitions among spontaneous mutations, which was reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ossowski et al, 2010</xref>, Science). We mention this in the updated version of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
