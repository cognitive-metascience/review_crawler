innate-like lymphocytes that survey the subcapsular sinus (SCS) and associated macrophages for pathogen entry. The factors promoting this surveillance behavior have not been defined. Here, we report that IL7R<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes in mouse LNs rapidly produce IL17 upon bacterial and fungal challenge. We show that these innate-like lymphocytes are mostly LN resident. Ccr6 is required for their accumulation near the SCS and for efficient IL17 induction. Migration into the SCS intrinsically requires S1pr1, whereas movement from the sinus into the parenchyma involves the integrin LFA1 and its ligand ICAM1. CD169, a sialic acid-binding lectin, helps retain the cells within the sinus, preventing their loss in lymph flow. These findings establish a role for Ccr6 in augmenting innate-like lymphocyte responses to lymph-borne pathogens, and they define requirements for cell movement between parenchyma and SCS in what we speculate is a program of immune surveillance that helps achieve LN barrier immunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18156.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18156.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18156.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and a vital part of our immune system. Amongst other things, the lymphatic system carries microbes that have entered the body – for example via to a cut or mosquito bite – to small, oval-shaped organs called lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are packed with immune cells that can be activated to help fight off infections, however certain microbes actually replicate inside the lymph nodes themselves.</p><p>Lymph nodes protect themselves from these infections by having some pre-armed immune cells that are ready to respond rapidly as soon as an invading microbe is detected. These cells, referred to as innate-like lymphocytes, position themselves at the exposed surfaces of the lymph node – the locations where microbes are most likely to enter the organ. However, it was not known which cues caused these immune cells to assemble and remain at these locations.</p><p>Zhang et al. now reveal that a signaling molecule called CCL20 attracts the innate-like lymphocytes to the lymph node’s exposed surfaces, while a protein known as CD169 helps to securely attach the innate-like lymphocytes in place. Further experiments then confirmed that positioning the innate-like lymphocytes at this location made mice more able to fight off the disease-causing bacterium <italic>Staphyloccus aureus.</italic></p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhang et al. also found that innate-like lymphocytes can move from the surfaces of lymph node through to the underlying tissue. This unusual migratory behavior might allow the lymphocytes to search a larger area for the infectious microbes, though further studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Future studies are also likely to focus on elucidating how the innate-like lymphocytes recognize different types of invaders, and how their activity keeps the lymph nodes healthy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18156.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18156.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>innate like lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>lymph node</kwd><kwd>CD169</kwd><kwd>SCS Macrophage</kwd><kwd>IL17</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Theodore L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Elizabeth E</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hsin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodda</surname><given-names>Lauren B</given-names></name><name><surname>Cyster</surname><given-names>Jason G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCSF BMS Graduate Program, T32GM008568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Theodore L</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Elizabeth E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodda</surname><given-names>Lauren B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH AI074847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cyster</surname><given-names>Jason G</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Elizabeth E</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Hsin</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodda</surname><given-names>Lauren B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5-OD12178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villeda</surname><given-names>Saul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>103744/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crocker</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A group of innate-like lymphocytes surveys the lymph node subcapsular sinus for bacterial and fungal invaders using a novel combination of chemoattractant and adhesion molecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our ability to mount adaptive immune responses against skin-invading pathogens depends on the delivery of antigens to lymph nodes (LNs) for encounter by naive lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cyster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). However, activation, clonal expansion and effector lymphocyte differentiation takes several days, whereas pathogens can undergo marked replication in a matter of hours. The skin contains immune effector cells that help keep pathogen replication in check, in a process referred to as ‘barrier immunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belkaid and Segre, 2014</xref>). Despite this, in many cases, intact pathogens travel within minutes via lymph fluid to draining LNs. Indeed some pathogens, such as <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, appear to have evolved to undergo marked expansion only after arrival in the LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">St John et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, there has been evidence indicating the existence of barrier immunity within LNs. The first LN cells exposed to lymph-borne antigens include the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages that extend between the subcapsular sinus (SCS) or medullary sinuses and the underlying parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barral et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iannacone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phan et al., 2009</xref>). Crosstalk between sinus-associated macrophages and IFNγ precommitted CD8 T cells and NK cells is important for mounting rapid Th1-like and NK cell responses against acute infection by <italic>Pseudomonas aeroguinosa, Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coombes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kastenmüller et al., 2012</xref>). IL17 is a cytokine with roles in anti-bacterial and anti-fungal defense that is made abundantly by effector T cells at epithelial surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Littman and Rudensky, 2010</xref>). Whether IL17 is produced rapidly during responses to subcapsular sinus-invaders in LNs is unclear.</p><p>In recent work, our group and others identified populations of innate-like (pre-formed effector) lymphocytes that are enriched near the SCS in peripheral LNs and are pre-committed to produce IL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Do et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doisne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roark et al., 2013</xref>). These cells express high amounts of the chemokine receptors Ccr6 and Cxcr6 as well as the cytokine receptor IL7R, and they include a majority of αβ T cells but also considerable numbers of γδ T cells as well as non-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). Within the IL17-committed γδ T cell population a major subset expresses a Vγ4-containing TCR (according to the nomenclature of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heilig and Tonegawa, 1986</xref>]), and undergoes expansion in response to challenge with imiquimod or complete Freund’s adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roark et al., 2013</xref>). In previous work, we found that innate-like lymphocytes isolated from peripheral LNs were heavily coated with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage-derived membrane fragments (‘blebs’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). This observation suggested there may be strong adhesive interactions between these cells and the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. CD169 is the founding member of the Siglec family of sialic acid-binding lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crocker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macauley et al., 2014</xref>). Although CD169 is a defining feature of LN SCS macrophages and targeting antigens to CD169 can promote antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macauley et al., 2014</xref>), the function of CD169 on these cells is not fully understood.</p><p>Pre-enrichment of innate-like lymphocytes near LN sinuses is thought to be important for allowing very rapid responses against lymph-borne invaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kastenmüller et al., 2012</xref>). Despite this, it is not known whether IL17-committed innate-like lymphocytes in LNs respond rapidly upon pathogen challenge, and little is understood about how these cells localize to or move in the subcapsular region. In this study, we found IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes were mostly LN resident and they produced IL17 within hours of bacterial or fungal challenge. Their proximity to the SCS was mediated by Ccr6 and was important for the rapid induction of IL17 following bacterial challenge. Real time intravital two photon microscopy and in vivo labeling procedures revealed that innate-like lymphocytes exchanged between the LN parenchyma and the SCS. Movement into the SCS was S1pr1 dependent, whereas return to the parenchyma involved LFA1 and ICAM1. Within the SCS, CD169-mediated adhesive interactions that helped retain the cells, presumably against the shear stresses exerted by lymph flow. This requirement was most prominent for the Vγ4<sup>+</sup>γδ T cell subset of innate-like lymphocytes. These observations provide a model for understanding the mechanism by which innate-like lymphocytes survey the pathogen-exposed surface of the LN to protect the organ from infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes near the SCS respond rapidly to pathogens</title><p>IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes within peripheral LNs express high amounts of Cxcr6 and they include ~70% αβ T cells, ~20% γδ T cells and 5–10% non-T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>gd T cell subset produced IL17 rapidly upon treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin or with the cytokines IL1β and IL23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower graph) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). These treatments also triggered rapid IL17 production from the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>αβ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We therefore tested whether both the αβ and γδ subsets of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> T cells produce IL17 in skin draining LNs following bacterial or fungal challenge. IL17 is known to play a role in host defense against cutaneous <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Staphyloccus aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conti and Gaffen, 2015</xref>) and to be induced in rats by <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comer et al., 2010</xref>). Three hours after heat-killed <italic>C. albicans, S. aureus</italic> bioparticle, or attenuated <italic>Y. pestis</italic> footpad challenge, IL17 production in draining popliteal LNs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were the dominant IL17 producers at this early time point after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The induction of IL17 expression in IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells upon bacterial challenge was dependent on CD169<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages as the response was greatly blunted in CD169-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyake et al., 2007</xref>) pretreated with DT to ablate these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We targeted Thy1 since this marker is expressed by all the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells while not being present on SCS macrophages (not shown). PE-conjugated antibody was used as the large size of PE (250 kD) reduces the rate at which the antibody accesses the lymphoid tissue parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pereira et al., 2009</xref>). Thy1-PE antibody (0.2 μg) was injected into the footpad, the draining popliteal LN was isolated 5 min later and the frequency of labeled cells determined by flow cytometry. Approximately 10% of the total IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were brightly labeled with Thy1-PE antibody compared with about 0.3% of naive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Among the innate-like lymphocytes, γδ T cells (predominantly Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells) were preferentially labeled, with around 15–20% of these cells being antibody exposed. By immunofluorescence microscopy, Thy1-PE-labeled CD3ε<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in the SCS and in nearby lymphatic sinuses, and few labeled cells were detected within the LN parenchyma, confirming that footpad injection of PE-conjugated antibody led to preferential labeling of lymph-exposed LN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The broader labeling of the sinus by Thy-1 than by CD3 reflects the expression of Thy1 by lymphatic endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jurisic et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also obtained information about lymphocyte-SCS macrophage proximity by following up on our finding that isolated innate-like lymphocytes are heavily coated with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage-derived membrane fragments (‘blebs’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). This coating is thought to occur at the time of LN cell dissociation, possibly because the SCS macrophages are tightly bound to the extracellular matrix and become fragmented during mechanical preparation of the tissue. Importantly, the blebs only become bound to cells that are associated with the macrophages at the time of isolation since co-preparation of LN cells from congenically distinct animals did not lead to cross acquisition of macrophage-derived blebs by innate-like lymphocytes from the different LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). In accord with previous findings, 30–40% of the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes isolated from control mice were CD169 macrophage-derived membrane bleb positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). A higher frequency (40–55%) of the Vγ4<sup>+</sup>γδ T cells were CD169 bleb positive, suggesting these cells may be preferentially associated with SCS macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Combining this analysis with Thy1-PE labeling showed that lymph-exposed innate-like lymphocytes, but not total αβ T cells, were enriched for CD169-bleb-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The Thy1-PE<sup>+</sup> CD169<sup>–</sup> cells amongst total αβ T cells most likely correspond to recirculating cells that are exiting the LN via cortical and medullary sinuses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ccr6 promotes innate-like lymphocyte positioning near the SCS</title><p>Given the high Ccr6 expression on the innate-like lymphocyte population, we asked whether this CCL20 receptor had a role in guiding innate-like lymphocytes to the subcapsular region.

S1pr1 is also required for marginal zone (MZ) B cell shuttling between the S1P high MZ and the S1P low lymphoid follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnon et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore tested whether S1pr1 played a role in guiding innate-like lymphocytes into the SCS. The innate-like lymphocytes had detectable surface S1pr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and they responded to S1P by in vitro migration in a Transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Pretreatment of mice for 6 hr with FTY720, a functional antagonist of S1pr1, greatly diminished in vivo Thy1-PE labeling on IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similarly, in vivo Scart2 antibody labeling of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>γδ T cells was decreased after FTY720 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). FTY720 also decreased the CD169 membrane bleb positive fraction to 20–25% in both the total IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population and the γδ T cell subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The reductions in Thy1-PE-labeled cells (from ~10 to ~1%) and in CD169-bleb<sup>+</sup> cells (from ~35 to~25%) were similar, representing ~10% of the total IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> population in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the reduced frequency of CD169-bleb<sup>+</sup> cells was due to the loss of cells accessing the sinus. Comparable findings were made after treatment with the more selective S1pr1 functional antagonist, AUY954 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These data provided evidence that S1pr1 was required for the cells to have normal access to the SCS.

These observations are consistent with the conclusion that the S1P-S1pr1 axis plays a role in guiding innate-like lymphocytes into the SCS.</p><p>In accord with S1pr1 having an intrinsic role in promoting SCS access of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells, staining for S1pr1 and CD169 showed the macrophage-derived bleb coating was restricted to the S1pr1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This analysis required use of an unconjugated rat antibody to detect S1pr1. Since the Thy1-PE is a rat antibody, it was not possible to combine the S1pr1 stain with the in vivo Thy1-PE labeling procedure. To further test whether S1pr1 in innate-like lymphocytes was required for SCS access, S1pr1<sup>f/f</sup> CreERt2<sup>+</sup> mice were bred. Tamoxifen treatment of adult mice for 5 days caused a loss of S1pr1 in innate-like lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Analysis in separate mice showed that the loss of S1pr1 was associated with reduced in vivo Thy1-PE labeling and reduced CD169 on IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). However, this approach could not exclude a role for S1pr1 in other cell types. Attempts to test the intrinsic role of S1pr1 using BM chimeras were unsuccessful due to difficulties in achieving efficient reconstitution of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells and our finding that many of the cells developing in the chimeric mice appeared activated based on CD69 expression (not shown). In another approach, mice were treated with tamoxifen for a short time to cause a ~50% reduction in the fraction of cells that were S1pr1<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). We reasoned that if S1pr1 were acting cell intrinsically in IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells then under conditions of partial ablation the S1pr1-deleted cells should lose their CD169 association whereas this would not occur if the receptor were acting in another cell type. Consistent with an intrinsic role, there was little CD169 staining of S1pr1-negative cells in the tamoxifen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). These data support the conclusion that S1pr1 acts intrinsically in innate-like lymphocytes to promote close associations with SCS macrophages.</p><p>We also examined the effect of S1pr1 antagonism on innate-like lymphocyte migration dynamics using intravital two photon microscopy. Visual inspection of the imaging data for FTY720-treated versus control LNs suggested that there were fewer Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes in the SCS after FTY720 treatment and less examples of cells migrating into the sinus (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Quantification of the number of tracks present in the SCS and the parenchyma in four imaging experiments confirmed that there were fewer cells in the sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>), and there was a significant reduction in the number of tracks that crossed from the parenchyma into the sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). We also plotted the frequency of cells versus distance from the LN capsule for multiple experiments determined using a computational approach (see Materials and methods) and this confirmed that FTY720 caused a depletion of Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cells from the sinus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Visual inspection of the movies revealed many Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cells that appeared to be ‘stuck’ to the SCS floor with their cell bodies ‘fluttering’ in the sinus, possibly being moved by passing lymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>).

After 30 hr of treatment with CD169-blocking antibody, there was no change in total IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cell frequency, but there was a two-fold loss of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells in the LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We speculated that if this loss was occurring due to inhibited adherence of cells in the SCS then the lymph exposed cells might be lost rapidly following CD169-blockade. Indeed, in 6-hr blockade experiments, there was a significant reduction in the fraction of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells that were Thy1-PE labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). There was only a slight reduction in the total numbers of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells after this short period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) consistent with only a low fraction of the total population being in the sinus at a given time. These observations suggest that CD169 blockade caused a loss of cells in lymphatic sinuses and this in turn led to a loss of cells from the LN over time. A loss of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells was also observed following CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage ablation using CD169-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In considering explanations for why these effects were mostly selective to the Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> subpopulation, we found it notable that in ICAM1 adhesion assays, Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were less capable of binding ICAM1 compared with other innate-like lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taking this observation together with the finding that a higher fraction of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells were lymph-exposed in the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we speculated that the non-γδT innate-like lymphocytes – but not the Vγ4<sup>+</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells – in the SCS were able to travel back into the LN parenchyma even in the absence of CD169.</p><p>In an effort to reveal a role of CD169 in sinus retention of the total innate-like lymphocyte population, we blocked αL prior to blocking CD169. In the first 4 hr following αL treatment, we observed a gradual increase in the fraction of cells that were Thy1-PE<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), consistent with the accumulation of cells in the sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Within 2 hr of anti-CD169 treatment, this enhanced Thy1 labeling was lost, indicating loss of innate-like lymphocytes from the sinus, and there was a reduction in IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cell frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cell frequency declined further after 4 and 6 hr of double blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). When αL and CD169 were both blocked continually for 6 hr, there was a 50% loss of total innate-like lymphocytes in LNs, and this was accompanied by an increase of the cells in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In CD169 Het and KO mice, there were comparable starting frequencies of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but after αL blocking antibody treatment there was a loss of Thy1-PE labeling and in total IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells in the CD169 KO mice compared with the Het controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><p>The decrease in innate-like lymphocytes in LNs 6 hr after αL and CD169 double blockade was also evident in intact LNs visualized by real-time two photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Importantly, unlike αL blockade, which caused many innate-like lymphocytes to become non-migratory and apparently stuck to the SCS floor (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), applying anti-CD169 in addition to anti-αL led to innate-like lymphocyte detachment from CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages and loss in the lymph flow (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). In some regions, it was also possible to observe cells moving from the parenchyma into the sinus, but then failing to attach and being carried away in the lymph flow (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). By quantitative analysis of three imaging experiments, CD169-blockade or deficiency was found to have little effect on the density of Cxcr6<sup>GFP/+</sup> cells in the SCS, but combined αL and anti-CD169 treatment caused a decrease of cells from the sinus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). These data provide evidence that CD169 has a role in mediating lymphatic sinus retention of most innate-like lymphocytes.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18156-media6.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18156.024</object-id><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Decreased Cxcr6-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell frequency in SCS following αL and CD169 double blockade.</title><p>Decreased numbers of Cxcr6-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (green) are observed in the SCS and LN parenchyma following dual antibody blockade of αL and CD169.

Movement across the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage layer into the sinus is promoted by S1pr1 and lymphatic endothelial cell-derived S1P. Within the sinus CD169 on macrophages binds to sialylated ligands on the innate-like lymphocytes and helps prevent loss of the cells in lymph flow, with the Vγ4+ subset of innate-like lymphocytes being most dependent on this adhesive system. LFA1 binding to ICAM1 also contributes to retaining innate-like lymphocytes in the sinus. Finally, return of cells to the parenchyma involves LFA1 and ICAM1, presumably to support transmigration across the lymphatic endothelium. Although this local migratory behavior was not essential for mounting IL17 responses against the pathogens tested in this study (data not shown), we propose that this surveillance program allows innate like lymphocytes to interrogate the CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages and SCS for pathogen- or commensal-derived molecules for which they have appropriate receptors.</p><p>The cues required for homeostatic positioning of cells in LN T zone and follicles have been well studied, with CCL21/CCL19 and CXCL13 having dominant roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cyster, 2005</xref>). Our findings add CCL20 as an additional homeostatic organizer, acting to recruit Ccr6<sup>+</sup> IL17-committed cells to the LN SCS region. As well as expression by innate-like lymphocytes, Ccr6 is abundant on Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Littman and Rudensky, 2010</xref>) and we speculate that Th17 effector cells that remain in the LN following immunization or infection may position in proximity with the SCS. Although Cxcr6 is also abundantly expressed by innate-like lymphocytes, Cxcr6-deficiency did not appear to affect their distribution in the LN (unpubl. obs). The expression of CCL20 in a subcapsular region in primate LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pegu et al., 2007</xref>) makes it likely that our findings with Ccr6 in mice will extend to humans. Ccr6 antagonism was suggested to reduce the egress of Ccr6<sup>+</sup> effector CD4 T cells from LNs in a mouse EAE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liston et al., 2009</xref>). CCL20 can be strongly induced in inflamed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mabuchi et al., 2013</xref>), and we speculate that under the inflammatory condition associated with EAE, CCL20 travels to LNs from the inflamed site and attracts Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells into the sinus lumen as we observed following CCL20 injection. In the case of Ccr6<sup>+</sup> CD4 effector T cells, this might then favor their exit from the LN.</p><p>S1P and S1pr1 have a critical role in promoting egress of T and B cells from LNs, acting at the step of transmigration into cortical and medullary sinuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigorova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sinha et al., 2009</xref>). We describe here a further function for this ligand-receptor pair in promoting cell migration into the SCS. As for movement into cortical and medullary sinuses, this response involves S1P production by lymphatic endothelial cells. S1pr1 on naive lymphocytes is required during the egress commitment step and did not appear to have a role in promoting chemotaxis to the sinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grigorova et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with those findings, we did not observe an obvious effect of S1pr1 antagonism on innate-like lymphocyte density near the SCS, only a loss of cells from within the sinus. We therefore favor the model that the cells approach the sinus-lining lymphatic endothelial cells in a CCL20-dependent manner and S1pr1 commits some of the cells to cross the lymphatic endothelium (and associated CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophage layer) and enter the sinus. Within the sinus, we anticipate that the cells are exposed to high amounts of S1P that cause rapid, GRK2-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnon et al., 2011</xref>), internalization and desensitization of S1pr1, allowing the cells to respond to cues (possibly including CCL20) that can promote their return to the parenchyma. This type of shuttling behavior has been described in the spleen for another population of innate-like lymphocytes, the MZ B cells, with movement into the blood-rich MZ being S1pr1 dependent and return to the parenchyma being CXCL13 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnon et al., 2013</xref>). One function of MZ B cell shuttling is to deliver immune complexes from blood to B cell follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cinamon et al., 2008</xref>). It will be interesting to see if cell shuttling in LNs contributes to cargo delivery from lymph to the LN parenchyma.</p><p>CD169 is abundantly expressed on the lymph-exposed heads of SCS macrophages as well as on the tails that extend into the LN parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phan et al., 2007</xref>). We show that CD169 supports adhesion of innate-like lymphocytes in the sinus and helps restrain them against lymph flow. A number of in vitro studies have shown an ability of CD169 to support cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crocker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker and Gordon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van den Berg et al., 2001</xref>). Recent work has also revealed that CD169 on LN SCS macrophages can play a role in the capture of lymph-borne exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunderson et al., 2014</xref>) and retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). The present work builds upon those observations to provide in vivo evidence that this Siglec family member can support shear stress-resistant adhesion of cells. Although lymph flow rates in the mouse popliteal LN have not been directly measured, a modeling study estimated wall shear stresses of several dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> in the SCS close to afferent lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jafarnejad et al., 2015</xref>). These shear stresses are similar to those in blood vessels that support leukocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finger et al., 1996</xref>). A recent genomics study found that high endothelial venules in Peyer’s patches highly express St6gal1, an enzyme that can generate ligands for CD22 (Siglec-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). In transfer experiments, CD22-deficient B cells showed reduced homing to Peyer’s patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). CD22 also contributes to B cell homing to the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nitschke et al., 1999</xref>). These studies together with our work provide evidence that Siglecs are a second class of lectin, after the selectins, that functions in mediating shear-resistant adhesion of cells. A key feature that facilitates selectin function is the high density of glycosylated ligands on the target cell and the very rapid on- and off-rates of lectin-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosen, 2004</xref>). We suggest that similar features contribute to the function of CD169 as a shear-resistant adhesion receptor. The long ectodomain of CD169 (with 17 Ig-domains) also seems likely to contribute to an ability to ‘capture’ cells that have become dislodged by lymph flow and to allow their re-adhesion and subsequent transmigration. A similar activity may be involved in capturing CD169-ligand high cells arriving in the SCS from the afferent lymphatic.</p><p>Our study provides evidence that LFA1 and ICAM1 are required for retaining IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes in the SCS and supporting their return from the sinus to the parenchyma. These findings are in accord with the well-established roles of LFA1 and ICAM1 in supporting adhesion to and transmigration of lymphocytes across blood vessel endothelium into tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rot and von Andrian, 2004</xref>). However, they are in discord with a study showing that migration of BM-derived DCs from the SCS into the LN parenchyma was integrin independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>). The basis for this discrepancy is not yet clear but might reflect general differences in the properties of lymphocytes and BM-derived DCs. Moreover, integrins may contribute to DC trafficking into LNs under conditions of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teijeira et al., 2013</xref>). Our conclusion that LFA1 and ICAM1 function during innate-like lymphocyte movement from the SCS into the LN parenchyma is based on four sets of observations in mice treated with αL blocking antibody: (1) innate-like lymphocytes transiently accumulate in the SCS; (2) the accumulated cells exhibit an unusual elongated morphology (suggesting a less adhesive state); (3) tracking analysis shows reduced numbers of cells migrating from the SCS into the parenchyma; (4) the cells are more sensitive to dislodgement by CD169 blocking antibody. We feel that the most parsimonious explanation for these data is that LFA1 supports adhesive interactions between innate-like lymphocytes and ICAM1<sup>+</sup> sinus-associated cells (lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages) that are needed for movement into the parenchyma. However, given the heterogeneity of the innate-like lymphocyte population, we cannot exclude the possibility that LFA1 blockade also decreases retention of some cells within the LN parenchyma, thereby increasing their movement into the SCS. A study of naive lymphocyte egress from LNs showed that LFA1 and ICAM1 can contribute to promoting retention of cells in the LN and this was suggested to reflect a role for LFA1 in limiting the rate of cell movement across the endothelium into the sinus lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichardt et al., 2013</xref>). More studies will be needed to fully address all the functions of LFA1 and ICAM1 in innate-like lymphocyte migration dynamics.</p><p>The migration of innate-like lymphocytes in close association with SCS macrophages seems likely to ensure that factors made by the macrophages, such as IL1-family cytokines, can rapidly engage the lymphocytes. It presumably also ensures that signaling in the reverse direction, from the innate-like lymphocyte to the CD169<sup>+</sup> cells, can take place efficiently. Such signaling may serve to augment the antibacterial, antifungal or antiviral activities of the macrophages. The importance of cell movement into the lumen of the SCS is not yet clear but might allow prompt surveillance of pathogens and endogenous cells (e.g. cancer cells) arriving via the lymph, prior to their accessing the LN parenchyma. The greater CD169 coating of Vγ4<sup>+</sup>γδT cells and their stronger dependence on CD169 for retention in the SCS than the other innate-like lymphocytes suggests these cells interact more strongly or in a more selective way with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. This likely reflects requirements for recognizing and responding to unique ligands beyond IL1β and IL23.</p><p>Following <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection or after vaccinia virus injection, NK cell interaction with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coombes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>). These studies observed NK cell movement on collagen fibers and of NK cells slowing or stopping in contact with CD169<sup>+</sup> cells. Whether collagen fibers guide the movement of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells needs further study, although in contrast to NK cells, the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> cells had minimal expression of the collagen binding α2 integrin (not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>]). Another distinction between these cell types is that LN NK cells lack Ccr6 (unpubl. obs). A previous study showed that NK1.1<sup>+</sup> cells in the LN are concentrated in medullary regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kastenmüller et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with their homeostatic positioning being controlled by cues other than CCL20. NK cell movement to the SCS might occur in response to inflammation-induced chemoattractants such as CXCR3 ligands that can be upregulated in this region and function in recruiting activated CD4 T cells and CD8 central memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Groom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sung et al., 2012</xref>). NKT cell interaction with SCS macrophages was observed following immunization with α-galactosylceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barral et al., 2010</xref>). Since 15–20% of the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup> innate-like lymphocytes are NKT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that these cells are continually surveying the SCS macrophages in a manner similar to the bulk Cxcr6<sup>+</sup> population studied here. As well as macrophages, there are DCs in the SCS region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerner et al., 2015</xref>) and the migration behavior we describe may help ensure efficient surveillance of SCS-associated DCs. Following exposure to strong inflammatory signals, SCS macrophages move into the follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaya et al., 2015</xref>). It will be interesting to examine how this reorganization modifies the innate-like lymphocyte trafficking behavior.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>γδT cells in peripheral LNs and related cells in the dermis are precommitted to IL17 production, with stimulation by IL1β and IL23 being sufficient to strongly promote IL17 production by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Brien and Born, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2015</xref>). Our studies here show that the IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>Ccr6<sup>+</sup>αβT cell population also readily produces IL17 upon IL1β and IL23 stimulation. These cells are double negative for CD4 and CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). LN DN T cells highly express IL23R and respond to this cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riol-Blanco et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings in ASC-deficient mice provide in vivo evidence that IL1-family cytokines are involved in activating the cells. These observations are reminiscent of findings for innate-like CD8 T cells in LNs that rapidly make IFNγ upon cytokine (IL18 and IL12 or IL18 and IFNα) stimulation, and for various types of memory T cells that make IFNγ upon IL12 and IL18 exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jameson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kastenmüller et al., 2012</xref>). While our data suggest cytokines may be sufficient to activate the innate-like T cells under some conditions, this does not exclude a role for TCR stimulation in promoting activation or augmenting responses under other conditions.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that IL17-committed innate-like lymphocytes survey the pathogen-exposed surface of peripheral LNs and respond rapidly upon challenge with bacterial and fungal pathogens. Ccr6-guided proximity to the SCS is important for these cytokine-driven responses. S1pr1, CD169 and LFA1 function to promote migration between parenchyma and SCS in close association with CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages in a program that we suggest allows innate-like lymphocytes to survey for a range of pathogen- and commensal-derived antigens and mount appropriately tailored responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6NCr mice of 7–9 weeks of age were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).

The mouse was then draped and a ~1.5 cm incision was made in the abdominal skin to expose the left inguinal LN. A silver LED 415 (Prizmatix), set to maximum intensity, with a high numerical aperture polymer optical fiber (core diameter, 1.5 mm) light guide and fiber collimater, was used as a 415 nm violet light source. During the 15 min exposure period, the tissue was kept moist with saline. After photoconversion, the skin was closed with two autoclips (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ~0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine in saline was given i.p immediately before and after surgery, and every 4–12 hr as needed thereafter. The mice were closely monitored for signs of pain. Mice were analyzed immediately before and after photoconversion, and 24 hr and 48 hr post photoconversion. Flow cytometry was used to analyze left and right inguinal LN cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2013</xref>).

Mirror-image incisions at the left and right flanks were made through the skin and shorter incisions were made through the abdominal wall. The peritoneal openings of the adjacent parabionts were sutured together. Elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together and the skin of each mouse was stapled (9 mm Autoclip, Clay Adams) to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with Baytril antibiotic and Buprenex as directed for pain and monitored during recovery. For overall health and maintenance behavior, several recovery characteristics were analyzed at various times after surgery, including paired weights and grooming behavior. Mice were sacrificed for flow cytometric analysis two weeks post parabiotic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intravital two-photon laser-scanning microscopy of popliteal LNs</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 ml/kg saline containing xylazine (1 mg/ml) and ketamine (5 mg/ml). Maintenance doses of intramuscular injections of 4 ml/kg of xylazine (1 mg/ml) and ketamine (5 mg/ml) were given approximately every 30 min. To image the popliteal LN, the mouse’s hind leg was immobilized using thermal putty to a Biotherm stage warmer at 37°C (Biogenics) for the duration of the surgery and subsequent imaging. A small incision was made directly behind the knee, and a ~0.5 cm square region of underlying tissue was exposed. The fat pad surrounding the popliteal LN was carefully dissected away without damaging surrounding vasculature and the afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels. After visualization of the popliteal LN, a 3D-printed plastic tissue mount was attached to the surrounding tissue using Vetbond. The tissue mount was immobilized with additional thermal putty, and the area above the LN was submerged in PBS for imaging. Images were acquired with ZEN2009 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) using a 7 MP two-photon microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Chameleon laser (Coherent). For video acquisition, a series of planes of 3 μm <italic>z</italic>-spacing spanning a depth of 90 μm were collected every 30 s. Excitation wavelengths were 905 nm. Emission filters were 500–550 nm for GFP, 570–640 nm for PE, and 450–490 for second harmonic signal. Videos were made and analysed with Imaris 7.4.2 × 64 (Bitplane). Two hours prior to all imaging experiments, 2 μg CD11b-PE or 3 μg MOMA1-TxRed antibody was injected through footpad. Cell tracking was performed using Imaris Bitplane software. Tracks generated using the software were manually confirmed and tracks that were a minimum of 5 min in duration were grouped according to whether they were exclusively in the parenchyma, exclusively in the SCS or crossed between compartments. Each movie contained a total of between 100–300 tracks in the region of interest. Approximately 15% of the Imaris generated tracks could not be confirmed as representing the migration path of a single cell and these were excluded. To quantify the depth of cells from the LN capsule in the imaging data, we used a computational procedure. First, a surface object was created in Imaris over the LN capsule. The positions of both Cxcr6<sup>+</sup> cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophages were determined using spots objects in Imaris. The minimum distance between each spot and the capsule was determined using a custom MATLAB (MathWorks) script and the ImarisXT interface. These data were exported into the R programming environment for analysis and plotting (ggplot2 package). The depth of the subcapsular sinus in individual LNs varied, and for each experiment was computationally determined as the peak frequency on a plot of CD11b<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophage’s depth below the LN capsule, minus 2 µm, which agreed across experiments with visual estimates of the subcapsular sinus site. As the sinus size varied across experiments from 15 to 40 µm, for the graphs of cell frequency against depth below the capsule the size of the sinus was normalized across experiments to 20 µm. Only the region within the sinus was normalized. Axis ratio was calculated as the ratio of ellipticity (prolate)/ellipticity (oblate). These dimensions were obtained by first creating a surface object for each cell using Imaris Bitplane software. Final videos were annotated and exported in Premiere (Adobe).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Transwell migration assay</title><p>Lymphocytes from LN were allowed to transmigrate for 4 hr across 5 μm transwell filters (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) toward medium or SDF, CCL20, or S1P and enumerated by flow cytometry as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramirez-Valle et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>From paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue, 7 μm sections were prepared, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor.

The main findings are that CCR6-CCL20 attract ILL towards the SCS area, that the interaction of S1P1R1 with S1P1 mediates their egress into the SCS lumen, that the interaction of unidentified lectin-binding partners on ILL with CD169 on macrophages is important for their retention in the SCS and that the interaction of ILL LFA-1 with ICAM1 guides ILL out of the SCS and back to the LN parenchyma. Some of the major points emphasized by the authors are not novel (localization of ILL at the SCS for rapid pathogen encounter and pre-committed IL17 production by these ILL upon bacterial infection), having been established by the authors in previous studies or by other groups as cited and discussed. The main extension of previous findings involves the demonstration of a critical role for CCR6 in the localization of innate lymphocytes at the SCS and the provision of evidence that in the absence of CCR6 the innate T lymphocytes respond less well to bacterial challenge. These latter data provide some of the first direct evidence for a functional connection between micro-anatomical localization and functionality of lymphocytes regarding pathogen defense. While this relationship has been invoked as an interpretation of prior results, a direct demonstration of this relationship as provided here is important.</p><p>This said, the manuscript requires some changes / additions to improve the presentation and to validate some of the key conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The critical points regarding the role of CCR6 in ILL positioning and function require further support by plotting the frequency distribution vs. distance to the LN capsule for CCR6 GFP/+ vs CCR6 GFP/GFP mice (as done for CD169, FT720 and αL). As presented now, the impact of CCR6 is not completely clear – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figures 4—figure supplement 3A/B</xref> are not fully convincing – Figure 2—figure supplement 3/B should also show a bi-lobed iLN for optimal comparison as 3/A. The second approach (Thy1 labeling) does not show statistical significance between KO and Het mice (CCR6) regarding all innate-like T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), leaving doubt regarding the overall strength of the observed effects.</p><p>2) The exact roles of S1P as well as ICAM and CD169 are not quite clear and the functional impact of these molecules on the immune response (e.g. IL17 production) has not been tested. The supplementary data analyzing the positioning of innate-like T cells on tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 4) should be shown in the main figures (plotting of the frequency distribution vs. distance to LN capsule). This will also provide the reader with a better idea of the overall effects of the experimental perturbations.</p><p>3) The authors' suggestion that the interaction of LFA1 and ICAM1 allows ILL to egress from the SCS and home back to the LN parenchyma is not convincingly established in this manuscript. The authors observe a relative enrichment of innate lymphocytes between 10-20µm from the SCS, while fewer cells are directly at the SCS when blocking αL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 7—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 3, Figure 7—figure supplement 4). ICAM is highly expressed by SCS Mø and parenchymal cells. Therefore the conclusion that LFA1/ICAM1 controls the &quot;access&quot; to the parenchyma is not fully supported – the authors do not discriminate between retention signals at SCS vs. parenchyma. Parenchymal cells could also provide the critical retention signals – in this scenario αL blockade would also lead to accumulation of innate-like T cells closer to the SCS. Further, Sixt and colleagues have shown that translocation of DCs from the SCS into the LN parenchyma occurs independently of integrins. This difference involving established data on integrin-free DC migration vs. presumption of an integrin-counterligand interaction controlling ILL migration across the same endothelial barrier needs further elaboration, or at least comment. Furthermore, if the authors' assumption is right the number of Thy1-PE positive ILL should continuously increase over time in the SCS of aL-treated mice or should increase in absolute cell counts in the blood of these animals. The authors could easily address this issue experimentally.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18156.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Summary:</italic></p><p> <italic>In the present study Zhang et al. study the mechanisms that allow IL17-producing innate-like lymphocytes (ILL) to enter, stay within, and egress from the LN SCS.

We appreciate their recognizing the novelty of the findings regarding CCR6-CCL20. However, we believe that the reviewers have understated the novelty of several additional findings in the study. To our knowledge, this work is the first to show that this ILL population promptly produces IL17 in response to bacterial and fungal challenge; that ILLs move in and out of the SCS while remaining resident in the LN; and that this shuttling behavior requires S1PR1, CD169 and LFA1. Furthermore, we are not aware of any previous study showing that CD169 can function to support adhesion of cells under conditions of fluid flow and presumed exposure to shear stresses.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The critical points regarding the role of CCR6 in ILL positioning and function require further support by plotting the frequency distribution vs. distance to the LN capsule for CCR6 GFP/+ vs CCR6 GFP/GFP mice (as done for CD169, FT720 and αL). As presented now, the impact of CCR6 is not completely clear – Figures 4S3 A/B are not fully convincing – S3/B should also show a bi-lobed iLN for optimal comparison as S3/A. The second approach (Thy1 labeling) does not show statistical significance between KO and Het mice (CCR6) regarding all innate-like T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), leaving doubt regarding the overall strength of the observed effects.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have now quantitated the number of cells proximal to the capsule (within 100µm) versus more distant. This was done by counting cells in tissue sections rather than with intravital 2-photon microscopy because the high CCR6 expression in B cells necessitated costaining with a B cell marker to distinguish CCR6<sup>hi</sup> ILLs from B cells. We find that there is a ~3-fold reduction in the fraction of KO cells that are proximal to the capsule versus more distant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref> with a bi-lobed iLN as recommended. We also now include quantitation data for the Scart2 stained sections and this demonstrates a significant reduction in the fraction of these γδ T cells that are adjacent to the sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These data are in accord with the Thy1-PE labeling data showing that the frequency of IL7Rα<sup>hi</sup>CCR6+ cells and Vγ4+CCR6+ cells in the sinus is significantly reduced compared to WT mice.</p><p> <italic>2) The exact roles of S1P as well as ICAM and CD169 are not quite clear and the functional impact of these molecules on the immune response (e.g. IL17 production) has not been tested. The supplementary data analyzing the positioning of innate-like T cells on tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 4) should be shown in the main figures (plotting of the frequency distribution vs. distance to LN capsule). This will also provide the reader with a better idea of the overall effects of the experimental perturbations.</italic></p><p>We have performed experiments examining the IL17 response of FTY720 treated, and anti-CD169 and anti-LFA1 treated mice challenged with <italic>S. aureus</italic> bioparticles. In contrast to the findings with CCR6 deficiency, we do not detect a significant effect on the IL17 response of these perturbations and this is now stated in the text. We appreciate the suggestion to move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 4 into the main figures but due to the already crowded nature of these figures we felt it made for easier viewing to leave these panels in their (readily accessible) supplementary location. We do now include data for manually confirmed tracks in the main figures and these results are in close accord with the frequency distribution data (new Figure panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) The authors' suggestion that the interaction of LFA1 and ICAM1 allows ILL to egress from the SCS and home back to the LN parenchyma is not convincingly established in this manuscript. The authors observe a relative enrichment of innate lymphocytes between 10-20µm from the SCS, while fewer cells are directly at the SCS when blocking αL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, Figure 7—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 3, Figure 7—figure supplement 4). ICAM is highly expressed by SCS Mø and parenchymal cells. Therefore the conclusion that LFA1/ICAM1 controls the &quot;access&quot; to the parenchyma is not fully supported – the authors do not discriminate between retention signals at SCS vs. parenchyma. Parenchymal cells could also provide the critical retention signals – in this scenario αL blockade would also lead to accumulation of innate-like T cells closer to the SCS. Further, Sixt and colleagues have shown that translocation of DCs from the SCS into the LN parenchyma occurs independently of integrins. This difference involving established data on integrin-free DC migration vs. presumption of an integrin-counterligand interaction controlling ILL migration across the same endothelial barrier needs further elaboration, or at least comment. Furthermore, if the authors' assumption is right the number of Thy1-PE positive ILL should continuously increase over time in the SCS of aL-treated mice or should increase in absolute cell counts in the blood of these animals. The authors could easily address this issue experimentally.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ critical assessment of these data and we apologize for our lack of clarity about the αL blocking experiments. We have now performed additional analyses that we hope improve clarity. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> showed that αL blockade for 6 hr caused a marked accumulation of ILL in the Thy1-PE exposed sinus. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref> showed that cells could be observed within the sinus and they exhibited a non-migratory, elongated morphology. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> we show that there is an increase in the fraction of ILL that are Thy1-PE exposed after 2hr αL treatment and a further increase after 4 hr.</p><p>As a further approach to respond to this concern we have performed a manual confirmation of tracks in each of the treatment conditions and assigned tracks based on whether they remained in the parenchyma, remained in the SCS or moved between parenchyma and SCS. This analysis revealed that αL treatment increased the fraction of tracks that were within the SCS. The 3-6 hr αL treatment did not cause a significant change in the fraction of tracks that crossed from the parenchyma into the sinus but it strongly reduced the fraction of tracks that returned from the SCS to the parenchyma (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). These data provide support for the conclusion that LFA1 is required for efficient migration of ILL from the sinus into the parenchyma. However, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude LFA1 also having a role on the parenchymal side and have revised the discussion of these data and now comment on how this finding differs from the findings made regarding requirements for BM-derived DCs to move from the sinus into the parenchyma.</p><p>We have added data showing that long-term (3 day) aL blockade causes a reduction of ILL in the LNs and an increase in blood, similar to the findings in ICAM1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data are consistent with a role for LFA1 in mediating cell return from SCS to parenchyma, with gradual loss of the cells occurring over time due to lymph flow. However, these data are also consistent with a possible role for the integrin in cell retention within the parenchyma, a concept we acknowledge in the revised discussion.</p><p>We have added axis ratio measurements for cells in the SCS of control or αL blocked mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, right panel). The elongated morphology of many of the αL blocked cells is consistent with a reduced ability of these cells to take on a flattened, more adhesive state.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point that ICAM1 is expressed on many cell types and we have revised our remarks to indicate that we do not distinguish which cell type(s) are the necessary source of ICAM1. However, our imaging experiments provide evidence that some relevant cell type(s) must provide lumenally exposed ICAM1. In addition to LECs, this might involve CD169+ SCS macrophages.</p></body></sub-article></article>
