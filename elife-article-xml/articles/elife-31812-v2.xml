The extracellular components of RPTPs are diverse and grouped into eight subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson and Van Vactor, 2003</xref>). Type IIA RPTPs contain extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, fibronectin type III domains (FNIII), and two intracellular phosphatase domains. Three type IIA RPTPs in vertebrates, LAR, PTP-δ, and PTP-σ are known to be involved in nerve growth, guidance, regeneration, and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ensslen-Craig and Brady-Kalnay, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stoker, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Of six RPTPs found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two phosphatases, LAR and Ptp69D have a similar structure and are classified as Type IIA RPTPs. These Drosophila phosphatases have been extensively studied in the nervous system. It has been shown that several RPTPs, including LAR and Ptp69D, have some overlapping functions in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). For example, Ptp10D and Ptp69D exhibit overlapping function in CNS axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2000</xref>). Most ISNb motor axons have normal projections in Ptp69D or Ptp99A single mutants, but double mutants have severe axonal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Desai et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, both LAR and Ptp69D play an important role during axon guidance and target selection in the embryonic CNS and PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krueger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2000</xref>) and display considerable overlapping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system has a layered structure, as is commonly observed both in vertebrates and invertebrates. Each layer is specifically innervated by processes from specific sets of afferent neurons. Moreover, formation of a functional neuronal network requires not only precise target neuron recognition, but also stabilization of the axonal contacts within their appropriate synaptic layer during development. Owing to its simple and stereotyped structure with innervations from elaborate arrays of distinct photoreceptor axons, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system is a widely used model for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the wiring of layer-specific connections. In particular, the medulla, which is the second ganglion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe, has characteristic laminar structure and is divided into ten layers, M1 to M10. The axons from photoreceptors R7 and R8 terminate at the layer M6 and M3, respectively.</p><p>RPTPs have been shown to be important for layer-specific targeting. LAR and Ptp69D are required for R7 axons to create proper connections in medulla layer M6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newsome et al., 2000a</xref>). In <italic>LAR</italic> mutants, R7 axons initially target to the correct layer at early pupal stages, but they later retract to the R8 axon temporary layer, M3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clandinin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). The degree of functional redundancy between LAR and Ptp69D in selection of the final targeting layer (M6 versus M3) has also been assessed previously. Rescue experiments revealed that LAR can substitute for Ptp69D, but not vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, it has been suggested that LAR phosphatase activity is not required for R7 targeting depending on Ptp69D phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>). These findings indicate that LAR and Ptp69D have both highly similar and divergent functions, but their distinct versus overlapping effects on downstream signaling pathways governing layer specification of R7 axons remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we show that the R7 axons lacking both LAR and Ptp69D display a striking phenotype: termination in the lamina without innervation to the medulla. Thus, building on previous studies describing roles of LAR and Ptp69D in layer M3 versus M6 determination within the medulla, we show here that they have a crucial function for multi-layer specification in wider range from lamina to the medulla. Moreover, characterization of R7 axon extension over pupal development revealed that the double mutant R7 axons extend normally at the beginning of the pupal stage, but gradually retract from their correct temporary layer. Genetic manipulations leading to graded expression of LAR and Ptp69D indicated that R7 axons retract either to the lamina, surface of the medulla (referred to as M0 as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>]), M3, or M6 (as in wild type), according to the total expression level of each gene. Combining loss-of-function and genetic rescue experiments, we demonstrated that the depth of the final axon termination layer is controlled by (1) the cumulative amount of the cytoplasmic signaling activity of LAR and Ptp69D, and (2) distinct layer-specific expression patterns of ligands selective to the ectodomains of either LAR or Ptp69D. These data demonstrate how the convergence of common downstream signals generated by receptors with redundant downstream targets but different upstream ligands can shape layer-specific wiring in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LAR and Ptp69D have redundant functions in layer-specific targeting of R7 axons</title><p>To determine if LAR and Ptp69D have overlapping functions in layer-specific targeting and stabilization of R7 axons, we conceived a strategy to knock them out simultaneously in photoreceptors using the FLICK system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>) combined with null alleles of <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>Ptp69D</italic>. We first applied the FLICK system to generate <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>Ptp69D</italic> single knockout mutants (see Methods) and confirmed the phenotype of each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As reported previously, 90% of the R7 axons from the <italic>LAR</italic> single mutant and 20% of the R7 axons from the <italic>Ptp69D</italic> single mutant photoreceptors stabilized inappropriately at M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C and H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newsome et al., 2000a</xref>). The lower penetrance of the <italic>Ptp69D</italic> phenotype here is probably due to the low efficiency of the FLICK system. Next, we generated double-knockout FLICK mutants. Surprisingly, more than 80% of the R7 axons of <italic>LAR, Ptp69D</italic> double mutants failed to innervate the medulla and terminated inside the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>, See Materials and methods for quantification details). To exclude the possibility of R7 cell death, we checked agarose sections of double mutant retina for the existence of R7 cell bodies, and whether the axons were extending from those cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). These results indicate that LAR and Ptp69D share a common function in R7 axons to drive innervation to the medulla.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31812.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Defects of R7 axons in the <italic>Lar, Ptp69D</italic> double mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Horizontal image of the adult medulla; WT (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>LAR</italic> mutant (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>Ptp69D</italic> mutant (<bold>C</bold>) and <italic>LAR</italic>, <italic>Ptp69D</italic> double mutant (<bold>D</bold>).

As in the <italic>LAR</italic> mutants, most of the R7 axon terminals reached their proper layer up to 24 hr after puparium formation (24hrAPF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B’</xref>). Around 36hrAPF, the shape of the growth cones was thinner and several axons had started to retract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and C’</xref>). At 42hrAPF, we found most of the axon terminals were collapsed and detached from the R7 temporary layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and D’</xref>). At 48hrAPF hardly any axons remained inside the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and E’</xref>) and this persisted through adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G’</xref>). These observations suggest that LAR and Ptp69D have a common role to promote attachment and stabilization of axons in the R7 temporary layer during the development of the medulla.</p><p>We then assessed requirements for LAR and Ptp69D at specific time points in development. To test the temporally regulated roles of LAR and Ptp69D, we modulated the levels of LAR and Ptp69D expression at several pupal developmental stages using temperature sensitive Gal80 (Gal80<sup>ts</sup>). For this, we drove <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>Ptp69D</italic> RNAi simultaneously in photoreceptors by GMR-Gal4, which resulted in the termination of R7 axons at the surface of the medulla, M0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the LAR and Ptp69D expression level was recovered at 25%APF, R7 axons stabilized in the proper layer M6. However, when we restored LAR and Ptp69D expression levels at 50%APF and 75%APF, R7 axons, especially in posterior region, mostly terminated in the M0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the converse experiment, decreasing the expression level at 12%APF or 25%APF caused some R7 axons to retract, but this did not occur upon knockdown at 50%APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that LAR and Ptp69D are required between 25%APF and 50%APF to promote axonal attachment and stabilization, which coincides with the period that R7 axons start to retract in the double mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The expression level of LAR and Ptp69D determines the final layer of axon termination and stabilization</title><p>We found that some of the R7 axons in single <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>Ptp69D</italic> mutants stably terminated in M3, whereas the axons of double mutants retracted to the lamina. These results led us to postulate that the total level of LAR and Ptp69D phosphatase activity might determine the final depth of R7 axons. To examine this hypothesis, the expression level of each gene was manipulated simultaneously. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, to achieve the highest expression of each gene, we suppressed the expression of double RNAi by temperature sensitive Gal80<sup>ts</sup> at permissive temperature (23°C), which resulted in almost normal targeting phenotype. In contrast, to achieve the lowest expression, the heterozygous mutants of <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>Ptp69D</italic> that also expressed RNAi for each gene without Gal80<sup>ts</sup> at 25°C were used, which displayed as strong a phenotype as homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Intermediate RNAi expression levels were set by housing flies at a series of different temperatures (see Materials and methods for details). In this way, we were able to control the expression level of LAR and Ptp69D in a temperature controllable manner and thereby generated a series of mutants with graded expression levels of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the lowest expression level, most of the R7 axons retracted to the lamina, and the number of R7 axons stabilizing appropriately in the medulla gradually increased as the expression level of LAR and Ptp69D was increased through temperature control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Two key conclusions can be deduced from this experiment. First, the depth of the final axon termination layer is controlled by the cumulative expression level of LAR and Ptp69D. Second, the final layer of axon termination and stabilization determined by LAR and Ptp69D levels seems to shift in a step-wise manner, M6 to M3 to M0 to the lamina layer in decreasing order of expression, thus indicating that there are discontinuous adhesive properties across the layers of the medulla. These results suggest that LAR and Ptp69D play both redundant and additive roles in stabilizing R7 axons in the medulla and determining the final layer position.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31812.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Final stabilizing layer determinations by LAR and Ptp69D.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Genetic manipulation using a temperature sensitive Gal80<sup>ts</sup> system driving RNAi expression was employed to manipulate the cumulative expression level of LAR and Ptp69D.

All transgenes had higher intensity than 50 except for the ones lacking Ig domains (ΔIg1-3 and ΔIg1-3ΔFn1-6). Since LARFL which had a full rescue showed 50, such expression level was probably sufficient for the rescue. We speculate that the lack of detection against transgenes without Ig domains is because the LAR antibody was raised against the Ig domains. In fact, LARΔIg1-3ΔFn1-6 which also has HA tag was strongly detected by HA antibody (shown in blue).

Next, we examined the ability of mutated forms of LAR to rescue the phenotype. Deletion of the extracellular LAR FnIII7-9 domains could not rescue the double mutant phenotype, indicating that FnIII domains are essential to stabilize R7 axons inside the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and M</xref>). Not surprisingly, we also found that the existence of LAR FnIII7-9 was sufficient to rescue the double mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H and M</xref>); its presence was previously reported to be sufficient for rescuing LAR single mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>). We then tested a series of mutated cytoplasmic domain fragments, which in all cases retained the normal LAR ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>). Specifically, we assessed transgenes with the second or both phosphatase domains deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and M</xref>), and phosphatase-dead mutations affecting one or both phosphatase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E and M</xref>). R7 axons gradually shifted their final termination layer depending on the strength of the mutation in the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>): the stronger the mutation, the shallower the layer of termination. The double phosphatase-dead (2xCS) construct rescued 40% of the R7 axons projecting to the medulla. ΔD2 had less capability to rescue the phenotype than 2xCS, despite having a normal D1 phosphatase domain. Therefore, the ability of LAR to rescue the R7 stabilization phenotype is not necessarily dependent on phosphatase activity, and also relies on putative downstream interacting domain(s) residing in the proximity of D2.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>Ptp69D</italic> constructs lacking catalytic activity of the first phosphatase domain DA1 did rescue the double mutant to the same extent as intact <italic>Ptp69D</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, K and N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garrity et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). However, when both DA1 and DA2 catalytic activities were lost, Ptp69D did not rescue the R7 phenotype to any extent, as with the case for <italic>Ptp69D</italic> mutants lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, L and N</xref>). These results are consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garrity et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2001</xref>) that unlike LAR intracellular domains, phosphatase activity is essential for Ptp69D signaling. We have assessed the expression level of the rescuing transgenes using antibody staining against larval eye discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The transgene expression was monitored to show that they are all expressed above the endogenous level, in considerably equivalent and sufficient manner. This indicates that the rescuing ability is not correlated with the expression level of the transgenes, but rather with the protein domains and the mutations. Altogether, we have now successfully demonstrated that the degree of intracellular signaling plays a key role in layer termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Different specificities in the LAR versus Ptp69D ectodomains contribute to the choice between layer M3 versus M6 stabilization</title><p>Despite LAR and Ptp69D functions being highly redundant, we noticed some differences between their phenotypes in the rescue experiments. Interestingly, in LAR rescue, the R7 axons that remained inside the medulla mostly stabilized at layer M6 or M0, but very few at layer M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>), which stands in sharp contrast with the <italic>LAR</italic> mutant, where almost all R7 axon terminals stabilized in layer M3.

Moreover, R7 axons were not stabilized in layer M6 even at the highest levels of Ptp69D expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>: LARM+PtpFL). These results indicate that Ptp69D alone does not have the ability to stabilize R7 axons to their proper layer M6, but does prevent R7 axons from retracting back to the lamina through adhesion in layer M3. Given that common domain accounting for this preference seems to reside in the ectodomains of LAR and Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M and N</xref>), we asked whether the expression pattern of potential ligands differs between LAR and Ptp69D. To detect ligand expression profile for each protein, we incubated the sectioned mid-pupal brain with an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated ectodomain of LAR and Ptp69D, a technique which is often used in embryonic nervous systems to detect the anatomical profile of ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>). If the ectodomain binds to a potential ligand, ligand distribution among the medulla layers can be visualized through AP staining. Consistent with the genetic experiments, we observed a difference in ectodomain staining between LAR and Ptp69D: LAR ectodomain staining was mainly found in layers M0, M3, and M6 layers, while vague staining of the Ptp69D ectodomain was observed in layer M3 layer with no positive signal in layer M6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that LAR has a preference for directing R7 axons stabilization to layer M6, whereas Ptp69D selectively drives stabilization to M3.

We further found that LAR phosphatase activity was dispensable, whereas that of Ptp69D was essential for proper M3 targeting of R8 axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, F and G</xref>). Furthermore, the overexpression of LAR in the double mutants resulted in some R8 axons extending past layer M3, and instead stabilizing in M6. The ratio of R8 axons terminating in layer M6 correlated with LAR cytoplasmic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D and G</xref>). However, the mere overexpression of LAR did not cause overextension, likely due to M3 adhesive properties driven by Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that R8 axons follow similar rules as R7 axons in achieving their proper position.

In the control animal, 21.5 R7 axons per 100 µm stack innervated the medulla, whereas only 7.4 axons did so with the double mutant clones, suggesting the cell-autonomous function of the RPTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

However, as these studies focused only on the choice of R7 axons to stabilize at layer M3 versus M6, we sought to determine if these downstream components also function in preventing lamina retraction. To investigate what molecules act downstream of LAR and Ptp69D in R7 axons, we genetically tested the effects of Trio, Abl, and Ena upon the <italic>LAR, Ptp69D</italic> double mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

After RNAi knockdown, 35% of the R7 axons stopped at M0 and only 2% targeted deeper layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and G</xref>). In this background, we then modulated the dosage of Abl, Ena, and Trio. After reducing Abl expression by RNAi, the ratio of R7 axons extending past layer M0 increased to ~13%, suggesting that Abl antagonizes the function of LAR and Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and G</xref>).

Taken together, our results indicate that Abl and Trio interact with the LAR and Ptp69D intracellular domains, acting as key components of a common downstream pathway directing the stabilization of R7 axons. Thus, the unique properties of LAR versus Ptp69D are conveyed by properties of their extracellular domains.

By observing axon extension in the medulla at several developmental stages, we revealed that the double mutant R7 axons extended normally at the beginning of the pupal stage, but then gradually retracted from their correct temporary layer and terminated in the wrong layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data demonstrate that LAR and Ptp69D play a common role in the stabilization of R7 axons inside the medulla. The simultaneous manipulation of the expression levels of each gene revealed two principles explaining their shared and common functions in axon guidance and stabilization. First, determination of the final termination layer of R7 axons primarily relied on the cumulative expression level of both LAR and Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The amount of the cytoplasmic transduction was proportional to the depth of the final termination layer, regardless of the specific RPTP (LAR versus Ptp69D). Second, although LAR and Ptp69D share a common cytoplasmic pathway, thus explaining the high redundancy of the two molecules, unique properties in their ectodomains were responsible for the choice between layers M3 and M6 of the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together, these principles can explain the difference between the LAR versus Ptp69D single mutant phenotypes, and also explain why LAR can rescue Ptp69D function, but not vice versa.</p><p>However, an alternative explanation of the proportional relationship between cumulative LAR and Ptp69D expression levels and the depth of the stabilizing layer is that LAR and Ptp69D cytoplasmic activity is only required to stabilize the axon whenever the ligand of these receptors is bound. The LAR ectodomain exhibits preferential expression in layers M0 and M6, whereas the Ptp69D ectodomain attaches to layer M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), where their respective ligands are presumably expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This model is supported by the double mutant rescue experiment, in which ectopic expression of LAR variants with different cytoplasmic activity level in the double knockout background led to extensive axon termination at layers M6 or M0, but very rare termination in M3. On the other hand, double mutant R7 axons rescued by Ptp69D variants mostly terminated in layer M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Even a high-dosage overexpression of Ptp69D was insufficient to stabilize R7 axons in layer M6 in the absence of LAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), indicating that the Ptp69D ectodomain is able to stabilize R7 axons only at layer M3, rather than in layer M6. Consistent with the findings for R7 axons, about half of R8 axons displayed ectopic extension and stabilization to layer M6 layer instead of layer M3 when LAR was overexpressed in the absence of Ptp69D, whereas Ptp69D overexpression did not generate a prominent phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, even in this latter scenario, some degree of correlation between layer-depth and RPTP activity must exist, as R7 axons require less LAR cytoplasmic activity for stabilization in layer M0 than in layer M6.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two models of axonal stabilization regulated by RPTPs</title><p>How mechanistically can less LAR and Ptp69D activity be required to stabilize an axon when it retracts back and becomes shorter? Our data are consistent with the notion that LAR and Ptp69D likely bind and activate adhesion molecules to stabilize the growth cone to the target site in a contact mediated manner. One scenario might be that the ligands form a gradient that is higher along the proximal part of the photoreceptor axons. Thus, a lower amount of receptor protein can still generate a sufficient amount of stabilizing signal. This scenario is unlikely, however, because the ligand has to be expressed in higher doses where normally it is not functionally required. The second, and a more likely scenario is that the lower amounts of RPTP signaling are required when the axon is shorter and the growth cone is closer to the cell body. It is important to note that the RPTP stabilization signal seems to be required in mature axons but not young growing axons. In this scenario, layer-enriched expression of RPTP ligands would ensure that axons that had grown into the medulla would notice a stabilizing ligand at their maximum length. This mechanism would serve as a regulatory check on axons that failed to stabilize at a certain target layer by allowing them to stabilize at more proximal layers. This process offers both a universal and economical model by which striped expression of a limited number of ligands can shape a relay of neuronal connections comprised of constant length axons connected from the surface to the inner region of the brain. In addition, the system requires only a few guidance molecules to guide axons in a certain direction, rather than an array of specific molecules to each targeting layer and stabilizing specific class of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biphasic properties of axonal growth</title><p>Given the observation that double mutant photoreceptors extend their axons normally until 24hrAPF, and then suddenly started to retract them around 40hrAPF, there seems to be a biphasic pattern to axonal growth. First, R7 axons grow by default, and seem to neither require nor recognize stabilizing RPTP signaling. In the later stage of pupal development, R7 axons retract by default, and require RPTP signaling for stabilization. The difference between these two phases might be attributable to changes in molecular properties inside axons, in particular the dynamics of the actin polymerization and microtubule organization. One of the triggers that can cause axon maturation and terminal targeting can be the formation of synapses, and/or firing of action potentials. To test whether double mutant R7 retraction can be rescued by neuronal activity, we expressed TrpA1 channel and elevated the temperature to activate the firing of R7 neurons. However, they still retracted back to the lamina, suggesting that activity is not sufficient for suppressing axon retraction at least in RPTP mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Formation of complexes between LAR and Ptp69D</title><p>Previous studies from Jessica Treisman’s research group have provided ample evidence that LAR and Ptp69D form complexes with each other. Treisman and colleagues analyzed R7 axons in <italic>LAR</italic> mutants and found that LAR phosphatase activity is dispensable for stabilization in layer M6 because of the catalytic activity of Ptp69D, and determined that LAR phosphatase activity is required only in the absence of Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we labeled R7 axons specifically and aimed to dissect the function of the ectodomain and cytoplasmic domain of LAR and Ptp69D. We found that LAR lacking phosphatase activity still stabilized R7 axons inside the medulla to some extent, even without Ptp69D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and M</xref>). When LAR lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain (LARΔC), it could not rescue the double mutant at all and R7 axons retracted to the lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and M</xref>). On the contrary, when LARΔC is combined with full length Ptp69D, more than half of the R7 axons terminated at the proper layer M6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and G</xref>), although Ptp69D alone could only stabilize R7 axons in layer M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and N</xref>). A previous study showed similar results concluding that LAR has non-autonomous functions in R8 axons, serving as a ligand for an unknown receptor in R7 axons to promote targeting to layer M6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). Based on our results, this seems unlikely because LARΔC enhanced the <italic>Ptp69D</italic> null mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>) and had no function in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and M</xref>). Our data instead support the idea that LAR and Ptp69D create a complex, and that upon binding of LAR to its ligand in layer M6 signals for stabilization are transduced through the phosphatase domains of Ptp69D even in the absence of LAR cytoplasmic domains. In contrast, when the intracellular domain of Ptp69D is deleted (Ptp69DΔintra) and then expressed in the <italic>Ptp69D</italic> mutant, the Ptp69D ectodomain alone was sufficient to prevent LAR effects and most R7 axons retracted to the lamina. Similarly, Ptp69DΔintra also suppressed Ptp69D function in <italic>LAR</italic> mutants. Based on these rescue experiment data, Ptp69D probably creates a complex with LAR that binds to unknown LAR ligand in layer M6. When they are in the complex, the stabilizing signal in layer M6 is likely transduced through the Ptp69D intracellular domain.</p><p>Although Sdc and Dlp are thought to be ligands of LAR that promote synapse formation in the neuromuscular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), it is unlikely that they serve as ligands in the visual system. Some defects were observed in photoreceptor axon pathfinding in both <italic>sdc</italic> and <italic>dlp</italic> mutants, but R7 axons did not show any significant retraction at 40hrAPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rawson et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, Sdc and Dlp bind to the extracellular Ig domains of LAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), but the transgene lacking three Ig domains can rescue R7 targeting in the <italic>LAR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>) as well as in the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and M</xref>), and FnIII domains of LAR are essential to stabilize R7 axons inside the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, H and M</xref>).</p><p>Then what is the ligand of LAR? We consider N-Cadherin (CadN) to be one of the candidates. The phenotype of R7 axons lacking CadN resembles the <italic>LAR</italic> mutant with axon termination in layer M3. CadN is required to reach and remain in the R7 temporary layer at the early stage of pupal formation, whereas the retraction of R7 axons in <italic>LAR</italic> mutant starts at a later stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ting et al., 2005</xref>). Detailed analysis of photoreceptor filopodial dynamics by the live imaging revealed that CadN deficient R7 axons initially reached the correct target layer but failed to stabilize there. This observation suggests that CadN is not a guidance cue but a stabilization factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Özel et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to their similar functions in R7 axon stabilization, <italic>Drosophila</italic> CadN and LAR physically interact in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). It was also reported that the mammalian N-Cadherin is an in vivo substrate of the mammalian protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ), which is an orthologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> LAR. Dephosphorylation of N-Cadherin by PTPσ increase adhesiveness and inhibits axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Siu et al., 2007</xref>). It is thus highly conceivable that CadN in R7 axons and their target layers interact with the extracellular domain of the LAR-PTP69D complex and that phosphorylation status of CadN affects the adhesiveness between the R7 axon growth cone and the proper target layer, eventually resulting in axonal stabilization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

and 18°C) and temporal expression level shift (27°C and 18°C). To manipulate the expression level of two RPTPs simultaneously, <italic>LAR, ptp69D</italic> double RNAi was expressed by eye-specific GMR-Gal4 and RNAi expression was controlled using temperature sensitive Gal80<sup>ts</sup> at 23°C, 25°C, and 27°C. To achieve lower expression level, we also expressed <italic>LAR, ptp69D</italic> double RNAi in the back ground of LAR<sup>-</sup>/+, ptp69D<sup>-</sup>/+ and utilize the temperature dependency of Gal4 strength (25°C and 18°C). To perform temporal control of the expression level, <italic>LAR</italic> and <italic>ptp69D</italic> RNAi were expressed in photoreceptors by GMR-Gal4 controlled by temperature sensitive Gal80<sup>ts</sup> as above, and temperature was shifted from 27°C to 18°C or from 18°C to 27°C at indicated time point. The stages after puparium formation are determined according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashburner, 1989</xref>). For the FLICK technique, two FRT lines flanking a gene to be knocked out were recombined onto the same chromosome. These FRT lines were obtained from Exelixis collection: LAR; e04149, e00822, ptp69D; f03442, e00274 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>). A more detailed explanation about FLICK is provided in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). LAR and Ptp69D FLICK flies are referred to as &lt;LAR&lt; and &lt;Ptp69D&lt; respectively. To create the double mutant R7 single clone, Ptp69D mutation was introduced by creating the clone with MARCM system using GMR-FLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>), whereas LAR expression was down-regulated by combining LAR heterozygous mutation with LAR-RNAi expressed only in the clones by GMR-Gal4.

Larval eye-brain complexes were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. The staining was performed in PBS with 0.1% Saponin for LAR antibody and with 0.1% Triton for Ptp69D antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: mAb24B10 (1:50, DSHB), rat antibody to CadN (Ex#8, 1:50, DSHB), rat antibody to elav (7E8A10, 1:100 DSHB), mouse antibody to LAR (9D8, 1:20 DSHB), mouse antibody to Ptp69D (3F11, 1:20 DSBH), rabbit antibody to HA (Ab9110, 1:1000 Abcam) and rabbit antibody to GFP conjugated with Alexa488 (1:200, Life technologies). The secondary antibodies were Alexa488, Alexa568 or Alexa633-conjugated (1:400, Life technologies). Images were obtained with Nikon C2<sup>+</sup> confocal microscopes and processed with NIS-elements AR and Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Binding experiments</title><p>White pupae of w<sup>-</sup> flies were collected and kept at 25°C. The Eye-brain complexes were dissected at 40 hr APF in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min. After the fixation, the samples were washed in PBS for 30 min with several exchange of the buffer and embedded in the diluted agar (5% low melting point agar in pure water). The temperature of the agar was 40–45 degree. Wait until it gets solid for 30 min-1 h. Samples were sliced using LinearSlicer (Dousaka EM) with 90–100 μm thickness (FREQUENCY 85–87 Hz, AMPLITUDE 1–1.2 mm, speed 1 mm/min). The swimming slices were picked up with brush and incubated with 100 μl PTP69D or LAR-PLAP fusion protein (kindly provided by Dr. Kai Zinn) supernatant for 1.5 hr at room temperature. Then, the samples were postfixed with 5% PFA in PBS without prewashing for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing the fixative with PBS (three changes) for 15 min and with 0.05% PBT (PBS+0.05% Triton X-100, three changes) for 15 min, the slices were incubated with anti-PLAP (1:500, abcam) and 24B10 (1:50, DSHB) in 0.05% PBT overnight at 4°C. After washing with 0.05% PBT (three changes) for 15 min, the brains are incubated for 3 hr at room temperature in secondary antibodies (1:400, Life technologies). The brains were washed again with 0.05% PBT (three changes) and with PBS (three changes) for 15 min, then soaked in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) overnight at 4°C. The slices were mounted just before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessment of photoreceptor axonal phenotypes</title><p>R7 photoreceptor axons were visualized with Rh4-mCD8GFP in confocal-stack images of whole-mount brains. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) the number of axons terminating each layer was counted manually using NIS-elements AR and the ratio of the axons terminating each layer was calculated. Although the terminals of R7 axons were clearly visible in lamina (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), a precise quantification was hampered by the overlapping nature of R7 photoreceptor axons inside the lamina. Therefore, we compared the number of R7 photoreceptor axon innervating medulla between the wild-type and the mutant flies. In the wild type, there are 21.7 Rh4-mCD8GFP positive R7 photoreceptor axons per 10 μm stack (466 μm in total thickness). We then calculate the expected number of R7 axons which should innervate medulla according to total thickness of scanned images. If the number of R7 axons innervating medulla in mutant flies is less than 90% of the expected number from the calculation above, we considered that the deficit is caused by the axons terminated in the lamina. Then we subtracted the number of R7 axons innervating medulla from the expected number and regarded the difference as the number of R7 axons terminated in the lamina. For example, the total number of the R7 axons innervating medulla in <italic>LAR, ptp69D</italic> double mutant was 102 (376μm in total thickness). The expected number of axons was calculated to be 21.7 × 376/10 = 815.92. As 102 is less than 90% of expected axons number (815.92 × 0.9 = 734.328), we consider the difference (815.92–102 = 713.92) is the R7 axons in double mutant terminating in the lamina (87.5%). For R8 axons, the axons were visualized with Rh6- mCD8GFP and the ratio of the axons terminating each layer was calculated in the same manner as R7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the wild type, there are 18.6 Rh6-mCD8GFP positive R8 photoreceptor axons per 10 μm stack (318 μm in total thickness).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Two receptor tyrosine phosphatases dictate the depth of axonal stabilizing layer in the visual system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew Pecot (Reviewer #1) and Kai Zinn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers were in general positive about your study showing that the two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), LAR and Ptp69D act in an overlapping manner to control specific targeting of R7 and R8 photoreceptors in the medulla neuropil of the fly eye. Your findings that active RPTP signaling is required for R7 and R8 axons to stabilize in the correct layer, and that these axons retract back to the lamina when both LAR and 69D are absent constitute an advance. The reviewers were impressed by your ability to produce photoreceptor axons that lack both genes and by the thorough rescue experiments you performed.</p><p>However, two of the three reviewers - and in the post-review discussion all three - agreed that experiments addressing cell autonomy are lacking and that this effort would firm up the story. They point out that LAR and Ptp69D are expressed broadly and in the RNAi experiments they are disrupted broadly. They call for genetic mosaic methods and cell-specific enhancers for manipulating gene function selectively in R7 or R8 neurons (both are not required).</p><p>In addition, you claim that the levels of LAR and Ptp69D expression and the degree of intracellular signaling play a key role in layer termination, based on RNAi knockdown or the overexpression of cDNA constructs containing or lacking specific signaling domains in rescue experiments. However, there is no assessment of the degree to which RNAi affect protein levels or whether rescue constructs are expressed equivalently. This issue could be addressed by the use of tagged constructs, and/or through immunostaining with fluorescence probes.</p><p>Another suggestion is to test the LAR mutant generated by Treisman that retains only FNIII repeats 7-9, unless it is no longer available, to see if rescue can ensue.</p><p>If additional experiments are predicted to take longer than 2 months, <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy is to reject the paper in its present form. If your efforts to demonstrate cell autonomous defects are successful, the paper could be again considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Previous studies showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor neurons (R1-R8) require the activities of two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), LAR and Ptp69D, for proper axon targeting within the lamina and medulla neuropils. Here the authors attempt to address how these molecules work together to regulate the layer-specific targeting of R7 and R8 photoreceptors in the medulla neuropil. They propose that these proteins act in an overlapping manner to control layer specificity. They claim that final layer termination depends on the combination of differential ligand recognition and the cumulative levels of intracellular signaling through a common pathway.</p><p>In general I think the lack of experiments addressing cell autonomy and levels of expression make it difficult to interpret the results, and leads me to feel the conclusions are overstated. This is particularly problematic because experiments similar to a number of those described here have been published in previous studies (e.g. LAR, Ptp69D single and double mutants, structure function experiments), and without performing more precise cell-specific manipulations it's not clear what the advance is.</p><p>1) LAR and Ptp69D are expressed broadly in the eye and brain, and required in all photoreceptors for targeting. Thus, a major concern is that in all experiments LAR and Ptp69D are disrupted broadly, either in the whole eye (RNAi) or in large patches in the eye and brain (FLICK), and rescue constructs are likewise expressed broadly in the whole eye, yet conclusions are made about the function of these molecules in R7 or R8 specifically. Non-autonomous effects cannot be ruled out, and it is essentially impossible to assess cellular requirements in these experiments. Genetic mosaic methods and cell-specific enhancers for manipulating gene function selectively in R7 or R8 neurons are well established and could be applied here to address these issues, although these experiments may be complicated genetically and could require more than two months to complete.</p><p>2) In addition, it is claimed that the levels of LAR and Ptp69D expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the degree of intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) plays a key role in layer termination, based on RNAi knockdown or the overexpression of cDNA constructs containing or lacking specific signaling domains in rescue experiments. However, there was no assessment of the degree to which RNAi affected protein levels or whether rescue constructs were expressed equivalently. Thus, on top of the issue of cell autonomy, more controls are needed to make conclusions about the requirement for specific protein levels and signaling activities. LAR immunostaining could be assessed in RNAi experiments in the eye, and rescue constructs could potentially be tagged and visualized through immunostaining (quantify fluorescence). If tagged constructs do not exist then transgenic flies would have to be made making it unreasonable to complete such experiments in a two month window.</p><p>I feel strongly that the authors need to address the above issues before the paper would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Layer-specific targeting of photoreceptor axons in fly visual system is a central model for understanding molecular mechanisms that guide axons to their targets in the brain. Work from a number of labs identified a pair of receptor tyrosine phosphatases, LAR and PTP69D, as playing important roles in stabilizing R7 photoreceptor axons in their target layer in the medulla. However, the mechanisms that determine how these phosphatases act, and might guide R cell axons past alternative target layers have remained unclear. Here Hakeda-Suzuki et al. make a significant contribution to our understanding by producing photoreceptor axons that lack both genes, and then performing an exhaustive series of rescue experiments using both genes. These studies reveal that phosphatase activity is required for axons to stabilize in the medulla, with different levels of activity causing targeting to different layers, patterns that correlate with the expression patterns of phosphatase ligands. Overall, this paper makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the roles of receptor tyrosine phosphatases in layer-specific targeting, and I have no major concerns regarding the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper reporting a unique phenotype in which loss of both Lar and Ptp69D (69D) causes R7 axons to retract fully from the medulla. The paper does not define a mechanism that can account for the phenotypes, beyond what has been reported earlier by others. It was already known (or thought) that Lar and 69D form a complex in R7 axons, and that the signal from that complex can be transduced by either Ptp domain. Lar phosphatase activity is not required for normal R7 targeting because 69D phosphatase activity can substitute for Lar activity. Nevertheless, these are remarkable findings, given that they demonstrate that active RPTP signaling is required for R7 and R8 axons to stabilize in the correct layer, and that they retract back to the lamina when both Lar and 69D are absent.</p><p>1) In general, the authors fail to emphasize that most RPTP phenotypes are only observed in double or triple mutants. Thus, redundancy is the rule rather than the exception for these enzymes (summarized in Jeon et al. 2008). For example, embryonic longitudinal CNS axons project normally in 10D or 69D mutants, but cross the midline in 10D 69D double mutants (Sun et al. 2000). Tracheae develop normally in 10D or 4E mutants, but develop cysts and cannot inflate in 4E 10D double mutants (Jeon et al. 2009, 2012). ISNb motor axons project normally in 69D or 99A mutants, but are usually truncated in double mutants (Desai et al. 96). Finally, most relevant to the present study, some ISN motor axons usually reach their normal termination site in Lar mutants, but the bundle appears thinner. In Lar 69D double mutants, the ISN is truncated at its second branchpoint, and in Lar 69D 99A triple mutants it is truncated at the first branchpoint (Desai et al. 97). It thus gets shorter as RPTPs are removed, similarly to R axons (in light of these new studies, it would be interesting to go back and do live imaging in the embryo and see if the axons initially reach the normal termination site in mutants but then later retract). It doesn't make sense to say, as they do in the Discussion, that redundancy between Lar and 69D is a mechanism to ensure preservation of color vision. One might as well say that redundancy between 10D and 4E is a way to preserve respiration. The fly is insulated against some phenotypes by redundancy, but there are obviously many single mutant phenotypes that cause lethality.</p><p>2) They need to count R7s in the retina, not just show that some R7 axons remain in the double mutant. It is possible that many R7s die as a consequence of failing to synapse.</p><p>3) They should test the Lar mutant (generated by Treisman and colleagues) that retains only FNIII repeats 7-9, unless it is no longer available, to see if it rescues. Hofmeyer and Treisman showed that these repeats were sufficient to rescue the Lar single mutant phenotype.</p><p>4) The Lar and 69D-AP staining is not very informative. It probably represents the cumulative expression of multiple ligands. While there is staining in M6 for Lar-AP, it is not the most prominent staining, and 69D-AP weakly stains all layers. It is possible that the staining of M6 by 69D-AP is slightly lower than that of other layers, but this is not very convincing. Still, it seems acceptable to include these data in a supplement. At least they did the experiment.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: It appears that the DM phenotype can be substantially rescued by LAR 2XCS, implying that neither Lar or 69D phosphatase activity is absolutely necessary (if both mutants are nulls). However, binding of something to Lar D2 appears to be required, as has been observed earlier by other groups. Oddly, however, for 69D to rescue the DM phenotype phosphatase activity of one domain is required. However, this assumes that 69D D2 does have enzymatic activity and that the DA mutation is equivalent to a CS mutation; it is also possible that the DA1DA2 double mutant acts as a substrate trap and makes the phenotype worse via some kind of dominant negative (DN) effect. Expressing the DA1DA2 construct in wild-type embryonic neurons produces axonal phenotypes.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5: R8</xref> axons usually retract only to M1, not to lamina, in DM. This is interesting. LarΔC acts as a DN in DM, doubling the fraction that retract to lamina. Why? This figure also shows that the distinction between Lar stabilizing axons at M6 and 69D stabilizing them at M3 is not as clean as they wish to argue. LarFL overexpression in the DM causes 50% of R8s to go to M6, and LarD1CS causes about 20% to go to M6. For 69D, full-length 69D causes 20% to go to M6, indicating that it has the same effect as Lar D1CS.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It is odd that Ptp69D-deltaintra seems to be able to block most Lar activity (since it generates a phenotype almost as strong as the DM when expressed in a 69D mutant), and can completely block 69D activity (since it generates a DM phenotype when expressed in a Lar mutant), yet it generates no phenotype on its own when it is expressed in a wild-type background. Perhaps in this case there is residual Lar activity that can maintain most axons at M6. Still you would think that you would get a 69D-like phenotype.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Two receptor tyrosine phosphatases dictate the depth of axonal stabilizing layer in the visual system&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) On the issue of cell autonomy: In the experiment in which you use a combination of MARCM and RNAi, PTP69D and Lar in R7 were knocked out. MARCM was used to generate single R7 neurons (and R1 andR6 neurons) that are null for PTP69D in an otherwise heterozygous background. A Lar null mutation was included in the background and whole eye (GMR) Lar RNAi was used in addition to knockdown of Lar function.</p><p>a) Please clarify what the control genotype is.</p><p>b) Because R1 and R6 clones are also generated, and these neurons terminate axons in the lamina similar to the double knockout R7 neurons, it was not possible to directly identify R7 axons mis-targeting to the lamina. Instead, the quantification is based on the number of axons innervating the medulla in control versus double knockout and the difference between them is assumed to represent R7 axons terminating in the lamina. This may be correct, but it is also possible that there was differential Flping between the genotypes (i.e. different numbers of clones generated in wild type and mutant backgrounds). A simple way to resolve this without changing the genetics would be to address the number of clones in wt and DKO that innervate the medulla in early pupal development, before the mutant neurons retract to the lamina. At this stage the number of clones in the medulla should be similar, which would be consistent with your hypothesis.</p><p>2) Your experiments on cell-specific rescue experiments using the GAL4/UAS system and FL Lar constructs are compelling but references for the specificity of the drivers and evidence of cell-specific expression should be provided.</p><p>3) As you have not addressed the issue of directly assessing protein levels for their expressed constructs, this caveat should be acknowledged in your experiments.</p><p>4) Explain what the n's mean in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Are these number of stacks analyzed, and or the number of total axons? If there were only 4 or 5 clones total, that would not be sufficient. But those numbers could not explain the statistics, as you can't get 5% penetrance with 4 axons. If the n's refer to the number of stacks analyzed, and the micron values to the depth of those stacks, why are there no numbers associated with the DM animals in D-F and G-I? The only numbers are for the rescue, but the unrescued DMs appear to be different animals than those analyzed in A-C. They have to be different for G-I, as here one is viewing R8 rather than R7. This should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31812.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, two of the three reviewers - and in the post-review discussion all three - agreed that experiments addressing cell autonomy are lacking and that this effort would firm up the story.

According to this valuable suggestion, we have addressed this issue with additional analysis. We have added 2 ways to demonstrate the cell autonomy of the RPTPs overlapping function. One for R7-specific loss-of- function, and another for R7-specific rescue experiment.</p><p>The detailed genotype is:</p><p>Double mutant R7 single cell clone: GMR-FLP, UAS-mCD8::GFP/+; GMR-Gal4, LAR[2127]/ UAS-LARRNAi; Ptp69D[D1689] FRT80B / GMR-mCD8-KO-myc, tub-Gal80, FRT80B,</p><p>R7-specific rescue: yw, eyFLP2 (c-lacZ)/PM181-Gal4; LAR[2127] /&lt;LAR&lt;, Rh4mCD8::GFP; Ptp69D[D1689] /&lt;Ptp69D&lt; UAS-LARFL</p><p>R8-specific rescue: yw, eyFLP2 (c-lacZ)/2-80Gal4; LAR[2127] /&lt;LAR&lt;, Rh6- mCD8::GFP; Ptp69D[D1689] /&lt;Ptp69D&lt; UAS-LARFL</p><p>In the former experiment, 70% of double mutant R7 showed retraction to the lamina, whereas only 25% of them correctly targeted to the M6 layer. Less frequent ratio of retraction compared to the eyFLP clone is probably due to the perdurance of the RPTP protein where the clone was induced at the last step of differentiation, compared to the eyFLP (all photoreceptors) mutant FLICK clone. Nonetheless, significant defect that was observed in single R7 clone strongly suggests RPTPs’ cell-autonomous function.</p><p>In the latter experiment, we tried to rescue eyFLP double FLICK mutant by R7-specific LAR expression. There, we observed around 80% innervated the medulla and 50% to the M6 layer. This also showed lower success rate compared to the GMR rescue. We reasoned that PM181-Gal4 might be insufficient to rescue 100%, either too weak or too early to stop expressing UAS-LAR, therefore we concluded that overall 80% is a sufficient number to claim the cell-autonomous function in R7 axons. We also performed an R8-specific rescue, which resulted in 100% rescue, therefore concluded that RPTP function in R8 in cell autonomously. In R8, probably the expression of the 2-80-Gal4 was consistent to cover the critical period to rescue. We have summarized these data in a figure and newly named as the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, it is claimed that the levels of LAR and Ptp69D expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the degree of intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) plays a key role in layer termination, based on RNAi knockdown or the overexpression of cDNA constructs containing or lacking specific signaling domains in rescue experiments.

We have added 2 supplementary data using antibody staining to show that the RNAi knock down have successfully down-regulated the protein level in desired manner, and that transgene expression was monitored to show that they are all expressed in considerably equivalent and sufficient manner, and the rescuing ability is not correlated with the expression level, but rather with the protein domains and the mutations. Altogether, we have now successfully demonstrated that the levels of LAR and Ptp69D expression and the degree of intracellular signaling play a key role in layer termination.</p><p>These are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) In general, the authors fail to emphasize that most RPTP phenotypes are only observed in double or triple mutants.

It is possible that the staining of M6 by 69D-AP is slightly lower than that of other layers, but this is not very convincing. Still, it seems acceptable to include these data in a supplement. At least they did the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We keep including these data in the supplemental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: It appears that the DM phenotype can be substantially rescued by LAR 2XCS, implying that neither Lar or 69D phosphatase activity is absolutely necessary (if both mutants are nulls). However, binding of something to Lar D2 appears to be required, as has been observed earlier by other groups. Oddly, however, for 69D to rescue the DM phenotype phosphatase activity of one domain is required. However, this assumes that 69D D2 does have enzymatic activity and that the DA mutation is equivalent to a CS mutation; it is also possible that the DA1DA2 double mutant acts as a substrate trap and makes the phenotype worse via some kind of dominant negative (DN) effect. Expressing the DA1DA2 construct in wild-type embryonic neurons produces axonal phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested whether expressing the DA1DA2 construct in wild-type photoreceptor neurons produces axonal phenotypes, but the result was negative (normal), suggesting that DA1DA2 does not act as a dominant negative in the photoreceptors. But we fully agree with the reviewer that the observation we made here, and that of J. Treisman’s study (PNAS 2010), contains some mysteries that we still cannot explain very well. Differential requirement of phosphatase domain between LAR and Ptp69D in a context dependent manner is one of those that we should further clarify in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5: R8</xref> axons usually retract only to M1, not to lamina, in DM. This is interesting. LarΔC acts as a DN in DM, doubling the fraction that retract to lamina. Why? This figure also shows that the distinction between Lar stabilizing axons at M6 and 69D stabilizing them at M3 is not as clean as they wish to argue. LarFL overexpression in the DM causes 50% of R8s to go to M6, and LarD1CS causes about 20% to go to M6. For 69D, full-length 69D causes 20% to go to M6, indicating that it has the same effect as Lar D1CS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that those points made by the reviewer are fully justified, and we cannot make a strong argument, but can only speculate here.</p><p>LAR∆C acts DN in R8: It is possible that, only in R8, there is the third RPTP that can bind to LAR ectodomain, and is sharing the downstream signaling with LAR. However, this is just a pure speculation.</p><p>Ptp69D has also M6 targeting effect: We fully agree with the reviewer. Our hypothesis was to satisfy the largest number of observations we made, but we admit that we fail to do so for a small number of observations. Future studies and a theory hopefully explain everything.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It is odd that Ptp69D-deltaintra seems to be able to block most Lar activity (since it generates a phenotype almost as strong as the DM when expressed in a 69D mutant), and can completely block 69D activity (since it generates a DM phenotype when expressed in a Lar mutant), yet it generates no phenotype on its own when it is expressed in a wild-type background. Perhaps in this case there is residual Lar activity that can maintain most axons at M6. Still you would think that you would get a 69D-like phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that it seems quite odd. The explanation we came up is as follows: As a prerequisite, we set the following conditions.</p><p>1) LAR-69D complex contains more than three proteins, possibly tetramer (?).</p><p>2) In the wild type situation, when LAR ligand binds to LAR-69D complex, only the cytoplasmic domain of 69D gets activated.</p><p>3) If the complex contains both 69D(FL) and LAR(FL), 69D∆Intra cannot interfere with their signaling. Therefore, overexpression of 69D∆Intra in wild type background does not create any defects.</p><p>4) If there is only LAR (in 69D mutant), 69D<sub>∆</sub>Intra binds to LAR(FL) and activates only the cytoplasmic domain of 69D, which does not exist here in this situation. As a result, 69D∆Intra suppress the activity of LAR cytoplasmic domain and therefore act as a DN.</p><p>5) If there is only 69D (in LAR mutant), 69D<sub>∆</sub>Intra sequestrates the 69D ligand, and therefore act as a DN.</p><p>In these conditions, there can be a difference when ptp69D-∆intra was expressed in wild type background (both LAR and 69D are available) or in Ptp69D mutant (only LAR is available).Since this is a pure speculation, we did not describe this in the Results or in Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) On the issue of cell autonomy: In the experiment in which you use a combination of MARCM and RNAi, PTP69D and Lar in R7 were knocked out.

Instead, the quantification is based on the number of axons innervating the medulla in control versus double knockout and the difference between them is assumed to represent R7 axons terminating in the lamina. This may be correct, but it is also possible that there was differential Flping between the genotypes (i.e. different numbers of clones generated in wild type and mutant backgrounds). A simple way to resolve this without changing the genetics would be to address the number of clones in wt and DKO that innervate the medulla in early pupal development, before the mutant neurons retract to the lamina. At this stage the number of clones in the medulla should be similar, which would be consistent with your hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>When we considered about how to quantify the Flping efficiency of GMR-FLP in the mutant and the control, we realized that we could utilize our existing data. As we applied the cMARCM system (Tomasi et al., 2008), the WT axons were labeled with GMR-mCD8-Kusabira Orange (GMR-mCD8KO). The lack of KO signal indicates that the axon is a GFP positive clone. We thereby quantified the gaps in M6 terminating axons of GMR-mCD8KO (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>) and confirmed that the number of the double mutant R7 clones was comparable with the control (control: 22.3/100μm, DM: 27.4/100μm).</p><p>We have added a sentence in the Results section to explain this result as follows:</p><p>“As we applied the cMARCM system (Tomasi et al., 2008), the WT axons were labeled with GMR-mCD8-Kusabira Orange (GMR-mCD8KO).

R8-specific expression persists until mid-pupal stage.” PM181-Gal4 is already published in a number of papers (Lee et al., 2001, Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As you have not addressed the issue of directly assessing protein levels for their expressed constructs, this caveat should be acknowledged in your experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we have addressed this issue by antibody staining, and 2 additional supplementary figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) were added before the resubmission stage.

Are these number of stacks analyzed, and or the number of total axons? If there were only 4 or 5 clones total, that would not be sufficient. But those numbers could not explain the statistics, as you can't get 5% penetrance with 4 axons. If the n's refer to the number of stacks analyzed, and the micron values to the depth of those stacks, why are there no numbers associated with the DM animals in D-F and G-I? The only numbers are for the rescue, but the unrescued DMs appear to be different animals than those analyzed in A-C. They have to be different for G-I, as here one is viewing R8 rather than R7. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>“n” indicates the number of independent hemispheres of the brain analyzed and the depth of the total stacks are also indicated as μm.
