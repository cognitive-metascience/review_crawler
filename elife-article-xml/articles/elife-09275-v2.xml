neurons. Morphine inhibits GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to VTA-DA neuron excitation. However, it is not known whether morphine has an additional strengthening effect on excitatory input. Our results suggest that glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is inhibited by GABAergic interneurons via GABAB receptors and that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release by removing this inhibition. We also studied the contribution of the morphine-induced disinhibitory effect on the presynaptic glutamate release to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons and related behavior. Our results suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release might be the main mechanism for morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09275.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09275.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09275.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Morphine is one of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of severe pain. It is derived from opium, which is extracted from poppies, and binds to the same receptors in the brain as the body's own naturally produced painkillers. As well as providing pain relief, morphine can act directly on the brain's reward system to trigger a state of euphoria, and can therefore be highly addictive.</p><p>One of the key components of the brain's reward circuit that morphine affects is called the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The activity of the VTA is regulated by the combined efforts of two groups of cells: excitatory glutamatergic neurons that increase VTA activity and inhibitory interneuronsthat reduce the activity of the VTA.</p><p>Morphine inhibits the interneurons, thereby allowing the glutamatergic neurons to activate the VTA. But does morphine also strengthen this excitatory input directly? By examining the effects of morphine on individual VTA neurons, Chen et al. show that the drug does indeed enhance the activity of the glutamatergic neurons. However, it does so indirectly by inhibiting another group of interneurons that would otherwise silence the glutamatergic neurons. This effect of morphine is dependent on the drug acting on a specific receptor type on the interneurons.</p><p>Chen et al. show that injecting a drug that blocks these receptors straight into the VTA of rats prevents morphine from increasing the animals' activity levels. It also prevents the animals from developing a preference for being in locations where they have previously received morphine. This suggests that morphine could primarily exert its pleasurable effects by preventing the glutamatergic neurons from being inhibited, and thus allowing them to activate the VTA neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09275.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09275.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>GABA neuron</kwd><kwd>GABAB receptor</kwd><kwd>glutamate release</kwd><kwd>morphine</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB553500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Program of Yunnan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013GA003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB835100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009CB52201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31121061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91332204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81371466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31070932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31421091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments examining the actions of morphine on single neurons from one of the brain's reward centers, the VTA, reveal the mechanism by which the drug exerts its hedonic effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphine is a potent analgesic with high addictive potential. Morphine-induced addictive behaviors are strongly dependent on the activation of dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wise, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luscher and Malenka, 2011</xref>). The hedonic response produced by the activation of VTA-DA neurons by morphine is a primary factor behind drug dependence.</p><p>One previously reported mechanism for morphine activation of VTA-DA neurons is the VTA-DA neuron disinhibition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and North, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalivas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">White, 1996</xref>). Morphine first inhibits neighboring GABA inhibitory neurons, which shifts the balance between inhibitory and excitatory input to VTA-DA neurons in favor of excitation and then leads to the promotion of VTA-DA neuron excitation. It was also reported that the release of glutamate from least some of the glutamate terminals that synapsed on VTA-DA neurons was inhibited by opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manzoni and Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolis et al., 2005</xref>). This inhibitory effect of opioids on glutamate release is puzzling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chartoff and Connery, 2014</xref>) because one would expect morphine to produce rapid activation of VTA-DA neurons through both the inhibition of GABAergic input and the excitation of glutamatergic input. In addition, postsynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2006</xref>) or excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al., 2014</xref>) in response to Î¼ opioid receptor activation has also been reported in some VTA-DA neurons. However, the amplitude of the inhibitory outward currents produced by opioids in postsynaptic VTA-DA neurons in the study of Ford et al. was small (2.1 Â± 1.5 pA in VTA-DA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and 14 Â± 4 pA in those projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2006</xref>), while only a small population of VTA-DA neurons (19%) showed depolarization or an increase in firing rate in response to opioids in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al. (2014)</xref>. This low postsynaptic responsiveness to opioids was consistent with physiological and anatomical evidence that only a few VTA-DA neurons had Âµ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, we propose that morphine might have a strengthening, rather than an inhibitory, effect on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons because it was reported that blockade of excitatory glutamatergic signaling in the VTA suppressed morphine-induced VTA-DA neuron activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jalabert et al., 2011</xref>) and related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalivas and Alesdatter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Aston-Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the strengthening influence of morphine on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons is more relevant to its promoting effect on VTA-DA neuron excitation. In this article, we report our observations of the effect of morphine on glutamatergic input to VTA-DA neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp method, and the results of our study of its mechanism and functional consequences using electrophysiological, biochemical, optogenetic, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphine-induced increase in spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons is dependent on glutamatergic input</title><p>We observed the effect of morphine (10 ÂµM) on the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons in rats. We select 10 ÂµM of morphine because this concentration is commonly used in in vitro experiments as it elicits a significant effect useful for further analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akaishi et al., 2000</xref>), and the effect of morphine at this concentration can be essentially abolished by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Valentino and Dingledine, 1982</xref>). VTA-DA neurons were identified based on I<sub>h</sub> currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Details of the identification method are given in the âMaterials and methodsâ section. Using original recordings of spontaneous firing (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the time course of spontaneous firing (middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in VTA-DA neurons for comparison, we could see that morphine (10 Î¼M) increased the frequency of spontaneous firing in VTA-DA neurons. The average frequency of spontaneous firing increased from 1.0 Â± 0.3 Hz before to 1.4 Â± 0.4 Hz for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from five rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to determine the role of glutamatergic input in the morphine-induced increase in the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons, we observed the influence of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (50 Î¼M) and the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist 6, 7-Dinitroquinoxalie-2, 3-dione (DNQX) (10 Î¼M) on the effect of morphine. In the presence of APV and DNQX, morphine no longer increased spontaneous firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The average frequency of spontaneous firing was 0.7 Â± 0.1 Hz before and 0.8 Â± 0.1 Hz for 10â15 min after morphine application in the presence of APV and DNQX (n = 6 cells from five rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &gt; 0.05, compared to control with APV and DNQX before morphine, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that the morphine-induced increase in the spontaneous firing frequency of VTA-DA neurons requires AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic input, consistent with a recent report using the NMDA antagonist APV and the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) in in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jalabert et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09275.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of VTA-DA neurons in rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrophysiological properties of VTA-DA neurons.

First, we observed the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs when the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX) was added to a bath solution to remove spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). Consistent with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manzoni and Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolis et al., 2005</xref>), in the presence of extracellularly applied PTX (100 Î¼M), morphine (10 Î¼M) decreased the frequency of sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The average frequency of sEPSCs decreased from 4.2 Â± 0.7 Hz before to 3.5 Â± 0.7 Hz for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, bath application of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists can lead to a wide blocking effect on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors present on different types of neurons, including DA-neurons and GABA neurons, in VTA slices. To circumvent this wide influence and target the inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to VTA-DA neurons, we added the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist PTX (100 ÂµM) to the internal solution of microelectrodes as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al. (1985)</xref> when recording sEPSCs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by intracellularly applied PTX, we first examined the effect of intracellularly applied PTX (100 Î¼M) on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in VTA-DA neurons. The results showed that under this experimental paradigm, IPSCs disappeared (top of panel 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, n = 5 cells from two rats), demonstrating that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the recorded VTA-DA neurons were blocked by intracellularly applied PTX. In addition, to further confirm that the spontaneous events we measured in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX were in fact sEPSCs, we observed the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX on spontaneous events in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. The results showed that the spontaneous events were completely blocked by DNQX (10 Î¼M) (bottom of panel 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We repeated the experiment in three cells from different slices and obtained similar results. On this basis, we observed the effect of morphine on the sEPSCs in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. Raw current traces (panel 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and the time course of sEPSCs (panel 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) before and after morphine application in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX showed that morphine (10 Î¼M) increased the frequency of sEPSCs. The average frequency of sEPSCs increased from 4.8 Â± 0.6 Hz before to 5.5 Â± 0.6 Hz for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 8 cells from five rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, panel 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, morphine (10 Î¼M) had no significant effect on the amplitude of sEPSCs. The average amplitude of sEPSCs was 16.6 Â± 1.3 pA before and 15.3 Â± 1.3 pA for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 8 cells from five rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &gt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, panel 5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm that the increased spontaneous events we measured in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX after morphine were also in fact sEPSCs, we observed the effect of the AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX on spontaneous events after morphine application in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. The results showed that the spontaneous events after morphine application were completely blocked by adding DNQX (10 Î¼M) (panel 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We repeated the experiment in three cells from different slices and obtained similar results. We also used the first excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) of paired pulse facilitation (PPF) as an index of EPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maejima et al., 2001</xref>), and the PPF of paired EPSC as an indicator of presynaptic glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>) to confirm the effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, morphine (10 Î¼M) increased the amplitude of the first EPSC, which was accompanied by a clear change in the presynaptic parameter PPF. The average amplitude of the first EPSCs was 124.1 Â± 9.0 pA before and 161.9 Â± 10.8 pA for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The average PPF was decreased from 1.5 Â± 0.2 before to 1.2 Â± 0.1 for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results supported the suggestion that morphine increased presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX. More importantly, when we clamped the membrane potential of VTA-DA neurons at the reversal potential of Cl<sup>â</sup> channels to remove sIPSCs, as an alternative to the application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, either by the intracellular or bath approach, morphine still exerted a promoting effect on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The average frequency of sEPSCs in this condition increased from 4.4 Â± 0.3 Hz before to 5.5 Â± 0.4 Hz for 10â15 min after morphine application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before morphine, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09275.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of morphine on the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and paired pulse facilitation (PPF) of VTA-DA neurons in rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effects of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs in the presence of extracellularly applied picrotoxin (PTX) in VTA-DA neurons.

One suggestion is that morphine may directly act at glutamatergic terminals to promote glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of morphine on glutamate release from the VTA synaptosomes of rats, which are sealed particles containing vesicles, viable mitochondria, and all components necessary to store, release, and retain neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breukel et al., 1997</xref>), using on-line fluorometry. However, we did not find that morphine (10 Î¼M) had a direct effect at glutamatergic terminals to promote glutamate release. The average concentration of glutamate was 8.1 Â± 0.1 nmol/mg before and 8.5 Â± 0.7 nmol/mg after morphine application (n = 6 samples from eight rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &gt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also studied the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs from mechanically dissociated single VTA-DA neurons in rats, which retained functional synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike and Moorhouse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ye et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2009</xref>). The left top image of panel 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows mechanically dissociated neurons from the VTA. These VTA-DA neurons were identified by only using I<sub>h</sub> currents (the graph on the right of panel 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) without TH staining because in dissociated DA neurons, it was difficult to fix the cell after recording for TH staining. The results showed that morphine (10 ÂµM) had no significant effect on the frequency of sEPSCs (panels 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we first studied whether GABA could inhibit presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons by examining the effect of exogenous applied of GABA on the frequency of sEPSCs of VTA-DA neurons in rats. From raw current traces (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the time course of sEPSCs (middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we could see that GABA (10 Î¼M) apparently decreased the frequency of sEPSCs. The average frequency of sEPSCs decreased from 6.7 Â± 0.7 Hz before to 4.7 Â± 0.6 Hz for 10â15 min after GABA application (n = 6 cells from four rats, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before GABA, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Then, we observed whether the activation of intrinsic GABAergic neurons could inhibit presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons in mice. To do this, AAV virus expressing a double floxed-stopped channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry was stereotaxically injected into the VTA of mice expressing Cre recombinase in GABA neurons. 2 weeks after infection, expression of ChR2âmCherry was observed in the VTA (panel 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We then performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in GABA neurons of the VTA and observed the light-induced action potentials in GABA neurons in order to confirm that ChR2 was indeed expressed in the GABA neurons of the VTA in mice. The results showed that 470 nm light stimulation (20 Hz) elicited action potentials in GABA neurons (panel 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). On this basis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in VTA-DA neurons to observe the effect of 470 nm light stimulation on the frequency of sEPSCs in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX (100 ÂµM). Following 5â10 min of baseline recording of sEPSCs, twenty 470 nm light pulses of 5 ms at 20 Hz were delivered every 4 s for 15 min. Raw current traces (panel 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and the time course of sEPSCs (panel 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) before and after light stimulation showed that the light stimulation apparently decreased the frequency of sEPSCs.

AAV virus expressing a double floxed-stopped eNpHR3.0-EYFP was stereotaxically injected into the VTA of mice expressing Cre recombinase in GABA neurons. 2 weeks after infection, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording in GABA neurons of the VTA and observed light-induced inhibition of firing of action potentials in GABA neurons. The results showed that yellow light stimulation (590 nm) could reliably inhibit the current injection-induced firing of action potentials in GABA neurons (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). On this basis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in VTA-DA neurons to observe the influence of the light-induced disinhibition of glutamatergic input on the effect of morphine. First, we observed whether this inhibition by light stimulation of GABA neurons affected the frequency of sEPSCs in VTA-DA neurons. As expected, light stimulation increased the frequency of sEPSCs in VTA-DA neurons (middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The average frequency of sEPSCs was 3.9 Â± 0.4 Hz before and 4.5 Â± 0.4 Hz for 10â15 min after light stimulation (n = 6 cells from five mice, paired <italic>t</italic> test, p &lt; 0.05, compared to control before light stimulation, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

From raw current traces (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) and the time course of sEPSCs (middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), we could see that the effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs disappeared in the presence of the light stimulation.

In agreement, as shown by the results above, if a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist was applied using a similar bath approach, morphine inhibited the frequency of sEPSCs. However, if the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist was applied using an intracellular approach, morphine had a promoting rather than an inhibitory effect.</p><p>Why did morphine produce opposite effects on the frequency of sEPSCs under different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist application conditions? We believe that under the condition of bath application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, the antagonist can produce a wide inhibitory effect on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors present on various neuron subtypes, such as DA neurons and GABA neurons, in VTA slices. Maybe this wide effect shifts the effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons toward an inhibitory effect. However, the intracellular application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist only blocks GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the single VTA-DA neuron being recorded. In this case, a clear promoting effect on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons was observed. In addition, to confirm this promoting effect under intracellularly applied PTX, we used the PPF of EPSC as another indicator of presynaptic glutamate release in order to observe the effect of morphine; the result substantiated our conclusion that morphine promoted presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons. More importantly, when we clamped the membrane potential of VTA-DA neurons in the reversal potential of Cl<sup>â</sup> channels to remove sIPSCs, instead of using the intracellular or bath application of a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, morphine still promoted presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons. These results strongly suggest that morphine can promote presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons.</p><p>Postsynaptic inhibition in response to Âµ opioid receptor activation has been reported in some VTA-DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, we did not observe this effect. The amplitude of the outward currents produced by opioids in the study by Ford et al. was small (2.1 Â± 1.5 pA in VTA-DA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and 14 Â± 4 pA in those projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus) and thus might not be reflected by the change in action potential firing in our study. In addition, a recent report demonstrated postsynaptic excitation of some VTA-DA neurons by opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al., 2014</xref>), an event that we also did not observe. Only a small population of VTA-DA neurons (19%) showed depolarization or an increase in firing rate in response to opioids in this paper, which is consistent with physiological and anatomical evidence that Âµ receptors were present on a small population of VTA-DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, we believe that we did not observe this effect perhaps because the percentage of the cells responding by excitation was low. Similar to our study, Jalabert et al. did not observe an excitatory effect of firing of VTA-DA neurons by opioids in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jalabert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism underlying the promoting effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons may involve different processes. One suggestion is that morphine may directly act at glutamatergic terminals to promote glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we observed the effect of morphine on glutamate release in isolated nerve terminalsâsynaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breukel et al., 1997</xref>) from the VTA. We found that morphine had no significant effect on glutamate release. In addition, using mechanically dissociated single VTA-DA neurons, we still did not observe an effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs. These results suggest that morphine does not exert a direct promoting effect on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons.</p><p>Another possible mechanism may be through a local neuronal circuit that promotes glutamate release. It has been proposed that Âµ receptors located in GABAergic interneurons are the primary site of action of opiates in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with morphological and functional data showing that Âµ receptors are primarily located on non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garzon and Pickel, 2001</xref>) and that activation of Âµ receptors can inhibit GABAergic interneurons by hyperpolarizing the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and North, 1992</xref>). In addition, Chefer et al. studied the inter-relationship of Âµ receptors, GABA, glutamate, and DA in the VTA of freely moving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chefer et al., 2009</xref>). They found that there was a positive correlation between basal dopamine levels and the glutamate/GABA ratio in the VTA of wild-type animals. Moreover, in Âµ receptor knockout mice, the GABAergic inhibitory tone in the VTA was significantly increased, but the glutamatergic excitatory tone was decreased. These results suggest that activation of Âµ receptors may increase presynaptic glutamate release via inhibition of GABAergic interneurons in VTA-DA neurons. This is supported by our results indicating that the Âµ receptor antagonist CTOP can block the promoting effect of morphine on the frequency of sEPSCs (the average frequency of sEPSCs was 2.95 Â± 0.35 Hz before and 2.97 Â± 0.40 after morphine application (10 ÂµM) in the presence of CTOP (1 ÂµM); n = 6 cells from four rats, p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, we hypothesize that morphine may act at Î¼ receptors located in GABA neurons, inhibit the function of GABA neurons, and thus disinhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons, leading to increased glutamate release.</p><p>To test whether morphine has a disinhibitory effect on the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons, the presence of an inhibitory circuit from neighboring GABA neurons to the presynaptic glutamatergic terminals of VTA-DA neurons must first be demonstrated. Therefore, we designed a series of experiments to determine if this inhibitory circuit existed. Our results showed that (1) GABA could inhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons and this inhibition was mediated through GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, rather than GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors; (2) GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were present in synaptosomes from the VTA as shown by Western blotting, and in glutamatergic terminals of VTA-DA neurons as shown by the triple immunofluorescence staining method; and (3) selective stimulation of GABA neurons of the VTA with an optogenetic technique could inhibit the presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons and the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP54626 could remove this inhibitory effect. These results strongly support the presence of an inhibitory circuit from neighboring GABA neurons to the presynaptic glutamatergic terminals of VTA-DA neurons. Moreover, they suggest that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors mediate this inhibitory effect of GABA. On this basis, we checked whether morphine-promoted presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons through the disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release. To test this hypothesis, we used two strategies to remove inhibition by GABAergic input of presynaptic glutamate release and then observed their influence on the effect of morphine on glutamate release. The results showed that âclosingâ local GABAergic interneurons both with optogenetic methods and with the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP54626 could abolish the promoting effect of morphine on glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons. These results confirm our hypothesis that morphine promotes presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons through its disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release.</p><p>It was previously reported that Î¼-opioid agonists hyperpolarized the GABAergic interneurons of the VTA, reduced the frequency of sIPSCs, and thus produced a disinhibitory action on VTA-DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and North, 1992</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that morphine-disinhibited presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons by a second mechanism. These two kinds of disinhibitory actions may both contribute to the morphine-induced excitatory effect on VTA-DA neurons. However, there is no direct evidence supporting the suggestion that the disinhibitory action on VTA-DA neurons causes the morphine-induced increase in DA neuron firing. In the present study, we investigated the contribution of the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons by employing the selective presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216. Several studies have indicated that pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in central neurons may be pharmacologically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutar and Nicoll, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deisz et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">1997</xref>). CGP36216 is a useful lead compound to differentiate between pre- and postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Up to 1 mM of CGP36216 was ineffective in antagonizing baclofen-induced hyperpolarization mediated through postsynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, but the responses mediated through presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors were reversibly antagonized by CGP36216 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 43 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ong et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the contribution of the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons to the overall excitatory effect of morphine on VTA-DA neurons by examining the effect of CGP36216 on the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors. Our results showed that if GABAergic inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release in VTA-DA neurons was removed, the effect of morphine on the firing of VTA-DA neurons disappeared, indicating that the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron activity might mainly depend on its disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release. We also observe the effect of removing GABA inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release with the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216 on morphine-induced increase in locomotor activity, which is often assessed as increased VTA-DA neuron activity at the behavioral level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vezina, 2004</xref>). The results showed that intra-VTA injection of a presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist could abolish the increase in rat locomotor activity induced by both i.p. and intra-VTA-injected morphine. In addition, we observed the effect of removing GABA inhibitory control of presynaptic glutamate release with the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216 on morphine-induced CPP, which is initiated by morphine-induced activation of VTA-DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). The results showed that intra-VTA injection of CGP36216 could abolish morphine-induced CPP in rats. These data suggest that the disinhibitory action of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release may be the main mechanism in the morphine-induced increase in VTA-DA neuron firing and related behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>VTA slice preparation</title><p>Male SpragueâDawley rats (14â16 days old) or mice (4â5 weeks old) were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.).

Using a range of clever approaches, small but significant increases in spontaneous synaptic event frequency are seen with morphine that appears to depend on the presence of local inhibitory neurons in the VTA and GABA(B)R activity.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) sEPSCs are usually recorded when sIPSCs are blocked with picrotoxin (PTX) or bicuculline in the bath solution. This was not routinely used in the manuscript, as PTX in the bath causes morphine to inhibit rather than increase glutamate release.

Why are the effects of PTX and CGP alone suddenly investigated at this stage? It's helpful to know that PTX does not block the spontaneous events (see above), but this does not seem the right place to show it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is large, and the description of it in the text is lengthy, so it should be simplified as far as possible.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chefer et al., 2009</xref> report that glutamate release is decreased in Mu receptor KO mice, suggesting that Mu receptors ordinarily increase glutamate release.

The data suggest that the effect of morphine requires AMPARs and/or NMDARs (although the data do not show that the AMPARs and NMDARs required are necessarily on dopamine neurons), not that the effect of morphine depends on glutamatergic âtoneâ.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> the firing rate in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists looks faster than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Could the authors comment on this.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not necessary.</p><p>5) Introduction, first paragraph: âHowever, the mechanism behind activation of VTA-DA neurons by morphine remains to be studied.â This statement should be deleted or at least re-phrased as the mechanism of morphine-induced disinhibition of VTA DA neurons is very well studied, even if the authors have uncovered some new details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript entitled âMorphine disinhibits glutamatergic inputs onto VTA dopamine neurons and promotes dopamine neuron excitationâ examined the mechanism by which morphine affects the firing of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Previous studies have suggested that morphine inhibits GABAergic neurons in the VTA (or the rostromedial tegmental area [RMTg]) to disinhibit dopamine neurons. In the present study, the authors performed a series of experiments in slice and behavior to indicate that morphine increases the frequency of glutamate release onto dopamine neurons. The authors first showed that the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postosynaptic currents (sEPSCs) increased after morphine application in slice. To isolate sEPSCs, the authors blocked inhibitory currents in the recorded neuron by applying a GABA-A receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, from the internal solution of the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>). The authors showed increasing VTA GABAergic neuron firing decreased sEPSCs while blocking GABA-B receptors increased sEPSCs. Furthermore, the effect of morphine to increase locomotor activity was blocked by local injection of GABA-B receptor agonist in the VTA.</p><p>This study provides a novel idea regarding the action of morphine on dopamine neurons, which is potentially of great significance. However, there were a couple points that were not convincing. I would like to see the authors' response.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The authors recorded sEPSCs while VTA GABAergic neurons were activated by optogenetically. I would expect that VTA GABAergic neurons provide strong direct inhibitions onto dopamine neurons. Why did the authors not see this effect? Did the authors use intracellular picrotoxin in this experiment as well? It was not stated in the manuscript.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, the authors apply GABA-B antagonist, CGP36216, to counteract morphine's effects on locomotor activity. The authors show that applying CGP36216 reduced the effect of morphine. However, the authors' results suggest that both morphine, applied without GABA-A blocker, and CGP3616 increase dopamine neuron firing. It was unclear how the authors interpret these results mechanistically.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>It has been shown that the rewarding effects of opioids occur through activation of VTA DA neurons but the molecular mechanism underlying this activation are still debated, especially the effect of morphine on the glutamatergic transmission, which is the focus of the current paper. Using a multidisciplinary approach, combining electrophysiology, optogenetics, biochemistry and behavior, Zheng et al. investigated the effect of morphine on glutamatergic inputs onto VTA DA neurons. In addition to the accepted disinhibition model, Zheng et al. argue for an excitatory effect of morphine on presynaptic glutamate release.</p><p>I would have some comments in order to strengthen the paper.</p><p>1) A major issue with this paper is the use of mice for the optogenetic experiments and rats for the rest. Rats and mice are species showing significant differences in terms of behavior and neurobiology. In order to be able to make comparisons and generalizations I would use the same species for all of the study, or at least, the authors must repeat some of the key experiments side-by side in both spices.</p><p>2) The aims of the study are well defined and the background is solid however I would add the following references. Concerning the disinhibition model, in addition to the Johnson and North paper I would add these two papers:</p><p>Kalivas PW (1993) Neurotransmitter regulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Brain Res Rev 18:75-113.</p><p>White FJ (1996) Synaptic regulation of mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons. Annu Rev Neurosci 19:405-436.</p><p>In the same line, I suggest including the study of Bonci, A. and Malenka, R.C. (1999) Properties and plasticity of excitatory synapses on dopaminergic and GABAergic cells in the ventral tegmental area. J. Neurosci. 19, 3723-3730, when speaking about the inhibition of the glutamate terminals onto VTA DA neurons.</p><p>3) There is no description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the text. The identification of DA neurons by the presence of an I<sub>h</sub> current is not ideal and can be misleading. Did the authors consider using genetic methods for the identification?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the authors should explain the choice of the morphine dose. Does it rely on a previous study, is it a physiological dose?</p><p>5) Where is the figure showing that morphine has no significant effect on the amplitude of sEPSCs? Likewise the figure showing that the morphine has no effect on glutamate release from synaptosomes of the VTA is missing. Also missing is the figure showing that the CGP36216 could increase the firing rate of VTA-DA neurons.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, morphine had a strong excitatory effect on VTA DA neurons, which is no longer present on the dissociated DA neurons used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors must refer to the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> description and detail the hypothesis underlying such difference.</p><p>7) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should show all western blots (including the control) and not just a small part of it. Likewise, I would describe what chemical was used to label the GABA(B)R.</p><p>8) Morphine has been shown to induce CPP. In order to strengthen the behavioral part, the authors should perform a CPP test in order to observe the influence of CGP36216 on the effect of morphine reward. All four groups of the 2x2 factorial design must be reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09275.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved scientifically and would be acceptable after revision of the Abstract and indicating the species for all data in the Results section and in the legends.

However, there were a couple points that were not convincing. I would like to see the authors' response.</italic></p><p><italic>Major issues:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors recorded sEPSCs while VTA GABAergic neurons were activated by optogenetically. I would expect that VTA GABAergic neurons provide strong direct inhibitions onto dopamine neurons. Why did the authors not see this effect? Did the authors use intracellular picrotoxin in this experiment as well? It was not stated in the manuscript.</italic></p><p>Yes, we used intracellular picrotoxin in this experiment as well. The intracellular picrotoxin abolished the inhibitory effect of the light-induced activation of GABAergic neurons on dopamine neurons, but it did not affect the inhibitory effect of the light-induced activation of GABAergic neurons on presynaptic glutamate release of VTA-DA neurons. We added a statement about it in the present revised version as follows:</p><p>âOn this basis, whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed in VTA-DA neurons to observe the effect of 470 nm light stimulation on the frequency of sEPSCs in the presence of intracellularly applied PTX (100 ÂµM).â</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10"><italic>Figure 10</italic></xref><italic>, the authors apply GABA-B antagonist, CGP36216, to counteract morphine's effects on locomotor activity. The authors show that applying CGP36216 reduced the effect of morphine. However, the authors' results suggest that both morphine, applied without GABA-A blocker, and CGP3616 increase dopamine neuron firing. It was unclear how the authors interpret these results mechanistically.</italic></p><p>Our interpretation is as follows:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> showed that if using the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonist CGP36216 to remove the inhibition of GABAergic tone on presynaptic glutamate release before morphine, the effect of morphine on locomotor activity was counteracted. This result suggests that the effect of morphine depends on the disinhibitory action on presynaptic glutamate release.</p><p>The results that both morphine, applied without GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, and CGP36216 increased dopamine neuron firing were in consistent with the above behavioral experiments. Our results showed that morphine increased DA-neuron firing via removing GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release, whereas the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP36216 mimicked the increasing effect of morphine on firing via antagonizing presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and removing GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[â¦] I would have some comments in order to strengthen the paper.</italic></p><p><italic>1) A major issue with this paper is the use of mice for the optogenetic experiments and rats for the rest. Rats and mice are species showing significant differences in terms of behavior and neurobiology. In order to be able to make comparisons and generalizations I would use the same species for all of the study, or at least, the authors must repeat some of the key experiments side-by side in both spices.</italic></p><p>Based on the suggestion by the reviewer, we repeated some key experiments in mice as follows:</p><p>A) Morphine increases the frequency of sEPSCs in VTA-DA neurons of mice.</p><p>From raw sEPSC traces of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>âpanel 3) and time course of sEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we found that morphine (10 Î¼M) increased the frequency of sEPSCs.
