We now report that CaMKII has a remarkable property, which is that activation of the holoenzyme triggers the exchange of subunits between holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation of new subunits. We show, using a single-molecule TIRF microscopy technique, that the exchange process is triggered by the activation of CaMKII, and that exchange is modulated by phosphorylation of two residues in the calmodulin-binding segment, Thr 305 and Thr 306. Based on these results, and on the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that the phosphorylated regulatory segment of CaMKII interacts with the central hub of the holoenzyme and weakens its integrity, thereby promoting exchange. Our results have implications for an earlier idea that subunit exchange in CaMKII may have relevance for information storage resulting from brief coincident stimuli during neuronal signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01610.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01610.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01610.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How do fleeting signals passing through the neurons of our brains become memories that can last for years or even decades? An enzyme called CaMKII is known to have an important role in the formation of memories. CaMKII adds phosphate groups to proteins—a process that is called phosphorylation—and is itself activated when calcium levels increase inside the neurons where the enzyme is found.</p><p>Individual CaMKII proteins bind together in groups of 12 to form a ‘holoenzyme’. When one of the 12 subunits is activated by calcium, it can phosphorylate the other subunits in the same holoenzyme. Once this happens, the activation of CaMKII can continue after the initial rise in calcium has ceased, and this effect is thought to be involved in the formation of long-term memories.</p><p>30 years ago, Francis Crick—famous for his role in the discovery of the double helix—proposed that memory formation might involve ‘memory-storage molecules’ passing an activated state to unactivated molecules, and John Lisman later suggested that CaMKII could fulfil this role by swapping subunits of holoenzymes between activated and unactivated ones. Now, Stratton, Lee et al. have tested whether CaMKII can exchange subunits by using advanced microscopy to track single molecules of CaMKII labelled with fluorescent markers. This revealed that activation can cause CaMKII subunits repeatedly to mix between holoenzymes—and this only happens once a first holoenzyme has been activated.</p><p>Subunits of CaMKII join together via a central ‘hub’ region, but when a subunit is activated, the phosphorylated segment may interact with the hub. This weakens the connections between the subunits, thereby making it easier for subunits to exchange between holoenzymes. This process provides a mechanism by which a level of activated CaMKII can be maintained, even if some subunits become degraded and long after the disappearance of the initial activation signal.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01610.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01610.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CaMKII</kwd><kwd>subunit exchange</kwd><kwd>spread of activation state</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jane Coffin Childs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stratton</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhattacharyya</surname><given-names>Moitrayee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of CaMKII holoenzymes triggers the exchange of subunits with other holoenzymes, including unactivated ones, enabling the calcium-independent phosphorylation and activation of new subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a critical role in neurons, where it is a component of the molecular networks that lead to the strengthening of synaptic connections between co-active neurons, as exhibited in long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>).

The holoenzyme consists of a central hub formed by the association of the C-terminal domains of CaMKII, to which the catalytic modules, consisting of the kinase domain and a regulatory segment, are attached by a variable linker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> for a schematic representation of the domains of CaMKII). There are four CaMKII genes in humans, termed α, β, γ, and δ and these generate ∼40 isoforms through alternative splicing that results in variations in the linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tombes et al., 2003</xref>). The α and β isoforms are found predominantly in neurons, while the γ and δ isoforms are distributed more broadly. In this paper we focus on the human α isoform, CaMKIIα, the major isoform in neurons, which has a 30-residue linker connecting the catalytic module to the hub domain.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01610.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CaMKII architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The architecture of a dodecameric CaMKII holoenzyme.

An increase in calcium levels results in the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM) to the regulatory segment, thereby activating CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbran et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikura et al., 1992</xref>). Subsequent to activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, the phosphorylation of at least three critical threonine residues within the regulatory segment modulates kinase activity and the response to calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to most other kinases, CaMKII has no phosphorylation sites within the activation loop.</p><p>A critical phosphorylation site, Thr 286, is located in the R1 element of the regulatory segment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; the residue numbering we use corresponds to that of a human CaMKIIα construct in which the 30-residue linker between the catalytic module and the hub domain is deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2011</xref>]). The phosphorylation of Thr 286 requires one activated kinase domain to phosphorylate another kinase domain in the same holoenzyme, and trans-phosphorylation between different holoenzymes is not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). Phosphorylation of Thr 286 prevents the R1 element from rebinding to the kinase domain, thereby conferring partial calcium-independence to the catalytic module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lou et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>). This property, referred to as autonomy, prolongs the active state of CaMKII and is likely to be critical for the generation of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saitoh and Schwartz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lai et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schworer et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Koninck and Schulman, 1998</xref>).

The functional significance of these phosphorylation sites is less well understood but, as for Thr 286, studies using knock-in mice have emphasized their importance in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elgersma et al., 2002</xref>).

The possibility that memory storage in the brain might rely on the exchange of subunits between autonomous (calcium-independent) forms and unactivated forms of CaMKII had been proposed earlier by John Lisman, following an initial conjecture by Francis Crick about memory-storage molecules that have the ability to instruct newly synthesized unactivated molecules of earlier activation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crick, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman, 1994</xref>). Our results provide a mechanism for maintaining a pool of active CaMKII despite protein turnover, a process that could potentially be important for long-term information storage in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The experiments on CaMKII that we report here were prompted by a curious observation concerning the stoichiometry of subunits in CaMKII, which was that samples derived from the same CaMKII holoenzyme preparation showed both six-fold and seven-fold symmetry when visualized by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg et al., 2006</xref>). Crystal structures of isolated hub domain assemblies of CaMKII revealed both tetradecameric and dodecameric forms, and spectroscopic studies provided evidence for variability in the number of subunits in intact holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoelz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rellos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>). This variability in subunit stoichiometry raised the possibility that the CaMKII holoenzyme might dissociate and reassemble, allowing subunits to exchange in the process. To study this, we analyzed CaMKII subunit exchange by using a single-molecule technique to visualize fluorescently labeled holoenzymes directly. We find that although unactivated CaMKII holoenzymes do not display appreciable subunit exchange, activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM leads to significant subunit exchange.</p><p>All the experiments described here are carried out using the full-length human α isoform of CaMKII (CaMKIIα) and mutants thereof. Proteins are prepared using bacterial expression, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2010</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). Gel filtration results are consistent with the purified protein being a dodecameric form of CaMKII that has not been activated. Mass spectrometric analysis documented that the purified CaMKII is unphosphorylated prior to activation (data not shown).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single-molecule assay for monitoring subunit exchange in CaMKII</title><p>Our general experimental strategy is to label two samples of CaMKII separately with two different fluorophores, followed by mixing and analysis of whether holoenzymes containing both of the fluorophores are obtained. This type of analysis is complicated in bulk solution by the difficulty in distinguishing between aggregation of holoenzymes and true subunit exchange. Gel filtration analysis of a constitutively active mutant (CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>) shows no evidence for aggregation, and incubation of the wild-type holoenzyme with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP shows no changes in the UV-vis absorption spectrum (data not shown). We also used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the size distribution of activated CaMKII assemblies in solution (for both wild-type, activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and a constitutively active mutant in which Thr 286 is replaced by aspartate [CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>] in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). DLS measurements indicate that the addition of ATP to CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>, under the conditions used in our mixing experiments, results in a small population with sizes that are larger than that of a single holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The DLS data for both wild-type CaMKII and CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> demonstrate that there is no time-dependent change in the particle size distribution over the time scale of our experiments.</p><p>To rule out aggregation as a complicating factor definitively, we developed a single-molecule assay in which individual CaMKII holoenzymes are visualized directly. In this assay, two samples of CaMKII are labeled separately with the donor (Alexa 488, green fluorophore) and acceptor (Alexa 594, red fluorophore) using cysteine chemistry, and then mixed and incubated together in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP. CaMKII holoenzymes are then immobilized on a glass slide such that individual holoenzyme assemblies are separated spatially from each other, and visualized by TIRF microscopy (see schematic diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). An exchange event is detected by the colocalization of red and green fluorophores, and potential aggregation is monitored by analysis of the distribution of fluorophore intensities.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01610.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule assay for subunit exchange reveals activation-dependent subunit exchange.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative single-molecule TIRF image, with red and green channels overlaid (left).

The purified protein was biotinylated in vitro, and labeled separately with either the green or the red fluorophore. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the labeling occurs at Cys 280, in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. Labeling efficiencies ranged between 20 and 40% for the wild-type protein (see ‘Materials and methods’), and this is sufficient for our analysis because of the direct visualization of holoenzymes. After mixing the two labeled species, a small amount of the CaMKII solution was removed at each time point, diluted, and then immobilized on the PEG-treated glass slides that were coated with streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Multi-color TIRF imaging was performed and the extent of colocalization was determined using a custom particle-tracking program (see ‘Materials and methods’). We score exchange events by treating all particles that have both red and green fluorophores equally. That is, our analysis does not distinguish between holoenzymes in which a single subunit has been exchanged and those in which more than one subunit has been exchanged.</p><p>The positions of CaMKII holoenzymes were determined by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian function to particle intensities (see ‘Materials and methods’). Importantly, the software filters out particles of insignificant brightness (i.e., noise) and aggregates (i.e., unusually bright particles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). On average, 6–20% of particles were eliminated from the analysis. Since samples from different time points are from the same reaction, the distribution of fluorescence intensities of each sample should not change over time in the absence of aggregation. Histograms of the fluorescence intensities were created for each image, after processing in the particle-tracking program, and monitored to check for any population of extra-bright particles (most likely aggregates). The distribution of fluorescence intensities did not change significantly over the time course of the subunit exchange reaction, indicating that the colocalization we report is not due to aggregation, which would cause the distribution to shift towards values of greater intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This does not, however, rule out that aggregation or self-association of CaMKII holoenzymes may be necessary as an intermediate step for subunit exchange to occur, since such self-association might be reversed by dilution prior to the single-molecule analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP triggers subunit exchange in CaMKII</title><p>We compared the results of mixing experiments in which CaMKII had either not been activated or had been activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP. Protein samples were mixed and incubated together at 37°C for varying lengths of time in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP and analyzed using the single-molecule assay. The level of colocalization detected under these conditions is very low, even at long times (∼5% at 240 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A dramatically different result is obtained when the samples are activated by incubation for 240 min at 25°C with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP (∼40% colocalization in about 50 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The absolute levels of colocalization observed in our experiments are likely to be underestimates of the true degree of colocalization. Incomplete labeling, a population of fluorescent molecules in a dark state and errors in image processing would lower the total percentage of colocalization detected. The maximum extent of colocalization (62%) was observed using a sample of CaMKII that has been labeled with both dyes simultaneously. We report the degree of colocalization in any particular experiment as a fraction of this maximal value. The values for colocalization are variable between experiments done on different days, due to labeling efficiencies and instrumental variability (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). All direct comparisons made in this paper are done using data from experiments performed on the same day.</p><p>The extent of colocalization increases markedly with CaMKII concentration and with temperature, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>. For example, activated wild-type CaMKII reaches 40% of maximal colocalization within 6 min at 37°C, but at 25°C the time taken to achieve the same degree of colocalization is ∼250 min. If the concentration of CaMKII subunits is reduced from 8 μM to 1 μM, the extent of colocalization in 10 min at 37°C is reduced from ∼20% of maximal to ∼10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The concentration of CaMKII subunits in dendritic spines is estimated to be ∼100 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otmakhov and Lisman, 2012</xref>), suggesting that in this environment the timescale of subunit exchange may be substantially shorter than seen in our experiments. We have not studied subunit exchange in vitro at concentrations higher than 8 μM.</p><p>We asked whether the activation-triggered colocalization involves a dead-end conversion in which holoenzymes that have undergone one cycle of exchange are inert to further exchange. To test this, we added saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP to red-labeled and green-labeled forms of the holoenzyme and incubated these activated species separately for 15 min at 25°C. We then mixed the two samples and observed robust colocalization that is similar for samples that had not been incubated separately after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data indicate that once CaMKII is activated, its subunits are capable of multiple cycles of exchange.</p><p>The results of the single-molecule assay are corroborated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements in solution. The site of labeling in the wild-type protein, Cys 280, is located at the periphery of the holoenzyme, and does not give a good FRET signal. We therefore labeled the hub domain at a site near the central hole in the hub assembly (residue 335), where any two such sites in the same hexameric ring would be close enough to generate a FRET signal. We replaced surface-exposed cysteines (residues 280 and 289) in the kinase domain by serine and replaced Asp 335 in the hub domain by cysteine (D335C). Labeling at this site should bring donor–acceptor pairs within ∼33 Å for adjacent subunits and ∼58 Å for non-adjacent subunits within a holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The D335C mutant CaMKII was labeled with ∼80% efficiency.</p><p>The FRET signal obtained for experiments using the D335C mutant showed a marked contrast for mixed samples that were either activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP or not. There is a substantial increase in the FRET signal that occurs within minutes of mixing the two labeled species for the activated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B,C</xref>). In the unactivated sample (i.e., in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP), there is only a modest, slow increase in the FRET signal with time, indicating that any exchange that might occur in the unactivated sample does so at a very slow rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stabilizing the dodecameric assembly by fusing CaMKII to a hexameric protein suppresses exchange</title><p>We interpret the results of the single-molecule experiments to mean that activation results in the weakening of inter-subunit contacts, facilitating exchange.

To do this, we fused CaMKII to hemolysin-coregulated protein from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (Hcp1), a protein that forms hexameric rings with roughly the same diameter as the hub domain of CaMKII (CaMKII-Hcp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mougous et al., 2006</xref>) (PDB code 1Y12). The fusion protein was generated by linking the C-terminal end of the hub domain of CaMKII to the N-terminal end of Hcp1 by a 10-residue linker with a sequence that is designed to be flexible (see ‘Materials and methods’). The Avitag used to immobilize CaMKII to the glass slide was incorporated after the Hcp1 sequence. The kinase activity of the CaMKII-Hcp1 fusion was tested using a peptide substrate (syntide) and it displayed cooperative activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, with an activation profile similar to that of wild-type CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaertner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg et al., 2005</xref>, data not shown).</p><p>We carried out a mixing experiment using the CaMKII-Hcp1 fusion protein in which this construct was labeled separately with either red or green dye and the two samples were mixed and incubated at 37°C.

We found that the subunits of the isolated hub domain assembly do not exchange subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that some combination of the kinase domain, the regulatory segment or the linker connecting the regulatory segment to the hub domain must be required for the exchange process.

Activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM releases the R3 element from the kinase domain, but it remains hidden within calmodulin. Thr 286 is, however, outside the footprint of calmodulin, and it is phosphorylated upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the holoenzyme. The release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM from a subunit after Thr 286 is phosphorylated facilitates phosphorylation at Thr 305 and Thr 306, which prevents Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM rebinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanson and Schulman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbran, 1993</xref>). Displacement of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and phosphorylation of the R3 element on Thr 305 and/or Thr 306 may therefore facilitate subunit exchange. Using this reasoning, the kinase activity of CaMKII is expected to be crucial for the exchange process.</p><p>We carried out two mixing experiments using wild-type CaMKII and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In one experiment, as described previously, the fluorescently labeled samples were incubated separately with ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, then mixed together and monitored for CaMKII colocalization using the single-molecule assay. In the other experiment, the ATP concentration was lowered to 1 μM, which is below the value of the K<sub>M</sub> for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbran, 1993</xref>). In addition, the kinase inhibitor bosutinib was added during the incubation phase. Although bosutinib was developed as an inhibitor of Abl tyrosine kinase, it has off-target activity against CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Remsing Rix, 2009</xref>) and was used in the crystallization of autoinhibited CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2011</xref>).

For example, after 30 min of mixing, the wild-type enzyme exhibits 70% of the maximal degree of colocalization, whereas under conditions where phosphorylation is inhibited the level of colocalization is only ∼20% after 30 min. We confirmed the importance of kinase activity by using the FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We replaced these residues with alanine separately to generate two constructs (CaMKII<sup>T286D,T305A</sup> and CaMKII<sup>T286D,T306A</sup>). Attempts to purify a construct in which both residues were mutated to alanine were not successful because this variant did not express well.

We conclude that phosphorylation of both Thr 305 and Thr 306, in addition to Thr 286, is important for subunit exchange.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Activated CaMKII can exchange subunits with holoenzyme assemblies that have not been activated, leading to a spread of activation</title><p>An important question is whether subunits that are activated can exchange with holoenzymes that have not been activated, and further, whether such exchange could result in the phosphorylation of Thr 286 in the unactivated subunits. To study this, we used mixtures of wild-type CaMKII and the constitutively active CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> variant in mixing experiments. Because CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> lacks Thr 286, this allows us to detect the phosphorylation of Thr 286 in the unactivated holoenzymes by using an antibody that is specific for the phosphorylated form of Thr 286 (pT286, see ‘Materials and methods’).

To do this we devised a three-color single-molecule experiment, in which the Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 channels monitor the locations of the labeled CaMKII variants, and the Alexa 647 channel detects phosphorylated Thr 286 in wild-type CaMKII. To determine the extent of antibody labeling that can be detected in a fully activated sample of CaMKII, we first activated CaMKII by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and ATP for 10 min. This is expected to result in robust phosphorylation of each holoenzyme assembly because of the direct activation of each subunit by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. This resulted in ∼75% colocalization of fluorescent signals from CaMKII and the pT286 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We then studied the extent of Thr 286 phosphorylation that is detected when the constitutively active CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> is mixed with unactivated wild-type CaMKII. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, there is an increase in the degree of phosphorylation detected with time, demonstrating that CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> is able to phosphorylate subunits in unactivated wild-type CaMKII.</p><p>It has been shown previously that trans-phosphorylation of Thr 286 occurs principally within a holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). In order to check that the observed phosphorylation is due to the simultaneous presence of activated (CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>) and unactivated (wild type) subunits within the same holoenzyme, we carried out two analyses. First, we employed the Hcp1 fusion construct, for which subunit exchange was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mixing CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup>-Hcp1 with wild-type CaMKII resulted in decreased Thr 286 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that stabilizing the activated CaMKII holoenzyme reduces the observed phosphorylation. In the second analysis, we showed that antibody binding occurs principally in those species in which the red and green fluorophores are colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with subunit exchange being required for the trans-phosphorylation reaction.</p><p>We note that the signal from pT286 rises much more slowly than the rate of colocalization. Colocalization reaches a plateau value of ∼60% colocalization in ∼50 min, whereas the level of three-color colocalization at a comparable time point is only ∼5%. The replacement of Thr 286 by aspartate in CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> may not be a good mimic of the phosphorylated form of Thr 286 in terms of its ability to promote phosphorylation. We found that the activity of CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> towards a peptide substrate (syntide, see ‘Materials and methods’) is only ∼20% that of activated wild-type CaMKII (data not shown). Also, the ability of CaMKII<sup>T286D</sup> to transphosphorylate an adjacent subunit within an unactivated holoenzyme may be inherently slow without calmodulin bound to the subunit being phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). The activation of CaMKII is highly cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaertner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg et al., 2005</xref>), so low levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM that are insufficient for autophosphorylation of an unactivated holoenzyme may be sufficient for binding the target subunit and enhancing its autophosphorylation in holoenzymes that contain some activated subunits through exchange.</p><p>To get a better sense of the extent to which activated subunits can potentiate the activity of holoenzymes that have not been activated, we turned to a solution assay using two different samples of wild-type CaMKII, without fluorescent labeling. One sample, the activated sample, was prepared by incubation with ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM for 15 min, followed by removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (see ‘Materials and methods’). The second sample, the unactivated sample, was not exposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. We then measured the activity of these samples using a peptide substrate (syntide) and a continuous enzyme-coupled assay (ADP Quest, see ‘Materials and methods’). This assay relies on the conversion of ADP to a fluorescent product, resorufin, the accumulation of which is monitored over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charter et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A sample containing 1 μl of activated CaMKII at 6 μM concentration exhibits a peptide phosphorylation rate of 132 units, where the units are the change in the fluorescence of resorufin in unit time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A second sample containing 3 μl of unactivated CaMKII at the same concentration exhibits a rate of 49 units (this activity represents the futile ATP hydrolysis rate of CaMKII, also observed without peptide substrate, data not shown). A third sample consisting of 1 μl of activated CaMKII at 6 μM mixed with 3 μl of unactivated CaMKII at 6 μM exhibits a rate of 592 units. In the absence of any crosstalk between the unactivated and activated holoenzymes, the reaction rate exhibited by the mixture is expected to be the sum of the reaction rates of the first two samples, that is, 181 units. The actual observed rate, 592 units, is about three times as high. This suggests that activated CaMKII holoenzymes have increased the activity of the holoenzymes that had not been activated previously.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Speculation about mechanisms for subunit exchange</title><p>One difficulty in developing a conceptual model for the exchange process in CaMKII is that there appears to be little precedent in the biochemical literature, as far as we are aware, for oligomeric enzymes that spread their state of activation by exchanging subunits. We envisage two possible kinds of mechanisms for the exchange of subunits between CaMKII holoenzymes. The first mechanism is suggested by the unusual allosteric activation of porphobilinogen synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Selwood and Jaffe, 2012</xref>). This enzyme converts between an inactive hexamer and an active octamer, with the transition requiring dissociation of the assembly into dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Selwood et al., 2008</xref>). We have developed a speculative structural model for how activation might promote the release of subunits, most likely dimers, from a CaMKII holoenzyme, discussed below. An alternative mechanism involves the transient formation of higher order aggregates of two or more holoenzymes, with exchange occurring within the aggregate followed by separation of holoenzymes with mixed subunits. The data available to us at present provide no clues as to how such a process might occur, so we do not discuss this further although it remains an important alternative mechanism for future investigation.</p><p>Regardless of whether subunit exchange proceeds through the release of subunits or through transient aggregation, it seems likely that the regulatory segment is able to destabilize the hub assembly when this segment is released from the kinase domain. We developed a model for how the regulatory segment might weaken the hub assembly by analyzing molecular dynamics simulations of CaMKII (see ‘Appendix’), and by considering several characteristic features of the structure of the holoenzyme and the exchange process. These include (i) the ability of the hub assembly to interconvert between dodecameric and tetradecameric forms, (ii) the importance of phosphorylation of the regulatory segment, (iii) the presence within the hub domain of a deep cavity containing three conserved arginine residues and (iv) the known ability of the hub domain to serve as a docking site for peptide segments by virtue of its exposing an uncapped β sheet, with no steric hindrance to extending the sheet by an additional strand provided by the regulatory segment. For ease of discussion, the details of the molecular dynamics simulations and the reasoning that went into the development of this model are presented in an ‘Appendix’ that follows immediately after the main body of the text. The main features of the model are summarized schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Note that the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> emphasizes the release of dimers, but we are uncertain as to whether the actual process involves a transient aggregation step that we do not yet understand.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01610.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic of a potential mechanism for subunit exchange in CaMKII.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the unactivated state of CaMKII, the dodecameric hub domain undergoes fluctuations, which leads to transient lateral openings between vertical dimeric units. (<bold>B</bold>) Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, Thr 286 is trans-phosphorylated. For simplicity, just one kinase domain is depicted. When calcium levels drop, CaM falls off and Thr 305 and Thr 306 are subsequently phosphorylated. The now-released regulatory segment is free to bind the open β sheet of its own hub domain. This brings residues 305/306 in close proximity to the hub cavity (blue triangle), which houses the three conserved Arg residues. Binding of the regulatory segment induces a crack to open in the hub domain, which exposes the Arg residues to the phosphate groups. We reason that phosphorylation of the regulatory segment leads to an interaction between the R3 element and the hub domain that weakens the lateral association between hub domain dimers, leading to their release from one holoenzyme. (<bold>C</bold>) Fluctuations in the autoinhibited holoenzyme create a hub assembly that resembles a ‘C’ shaped structure. This fluctuation may allow the capture of a vertical dimer that has been released from an active holoenzyme. The drawing depicts the adoption of a tetradecameric structure upon docking of an incoming vertical dimer, which may be an intermediate in the exchange process. As discussed in the main text, we have no direct experimental evidence at present concerning the exchange process. We cannot, therefore, rule out alternative mechanisms, such as those involving a transient aggregation of holoenzymes prior to exchange.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01610.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01610.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01610-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The CaMKII holoenzyme can be thought of as being assembled from six ‘vertical dimers’. In a view that has the mid-plane of the dodecamer horizontal, these vertical dimers each contribute one hub domain to the upper ring and one to the lower ring of the hub assembly. We propose that the hub assembly within a holoenzyme, whether activated or not, normally undergoes fluctuations that convert it from the closed double-ring form seen in crystal structures to an open C-shaped form with a gap between two adjacent vertical dimers. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this gap can easily be large enough to capture a vertical dimer provided by another holoenzyme. This could, for example, convert a dodecameric assembly to a tetradecameric one. In the absence of activation, however, the transient openings in the hub assembly of the holoenzyme simply reanneal, due to the stability of the lateral interactions between vertical dimers.</p><p>The situation changes, however, when CaMKII is activated and Thr 305 and Thr 306 are phosphorylated. We propose that the phosphorylated regulatory segment, which is freed from interaction with the kinase domain and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, is now able to dock on the hub domain and form an additional strand of the β sheet that is the core scaffold of the hub domain. We speculate that when this happens, one or more of the phosphorylated sidechains in the regulatory segment reach into the interior of the hub and interact with the conserved arginine residues located in the hub cavity. This interaction might distort the structure of the hub domain, slightly weakening the lateral interactions in the hub assembly. A fluctuation in the hub assembly can now result in the release of an activated vertical dimer. A released vertical dimer can either be recaptured or, if it encounters an unactivated holoenzyme that is open transiently, it can be incorporated into that holoenzyme.</p><p>While we believe that this model provides a reasonable framework for thinking about the exchange process, the schematic shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is far from definitive. For example, close encounters between two holoenzymes may be necessary for an activated dimer to ‘hop’ directly from one holoenzyme to another, without being ever released completely. In such a situation, the interaction between the phosphorylated regulatory segment and the hub domain may occur in <italic>trans</italic>, between two holoenzymes, rather than within one holoenzyme. We anticipate that future studies will establish whether the model we are proposing is correct in essence, or whether the subunit exchange mechanism relies on features that we have failed to anticipate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons that occurs following brief repetitive stimuli that induce LTP is likely to be important for the formation and maintenance of cognitive memory. Much attention has been focused on the role of CaMKII in this process, particularly its ability to maintain an activated state, through intra-holoenzyme phosphorylation of Thr 286, after cessation of LTP-inducing stimuli. But can the active state be maintained beyond the lifetime of the kinase molecules present during the initial stimulus?</p><p>Lisman introduced the idea that information about previous activating events could be transmitted to newly synthesized CaMKII molecules if the subunits of the activated holoenzyme could exchange with unactivated ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman, 1994</xref>). We now demonstrate that the CaMKII holoenzyme has precisely this property when studied in vitro. Activated CaMKII holoenzymes can indeed instruct previously unactivated holoenzymes as to their phosphorylation state through subunit exchange, and this ability is switched on by activation and autophosphorylation. In the time since Lisman’s earlier speculation about subunit exchange, there has been no experimental precedent that has pointed to such a mechanism being operative for CaMKII. Translocation of CaMKII to the NMDA receptor requires active subunits and has been postulated to serve as a molecular memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemieux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neant-Fery et al., 2012</xref>). This population of CaMKII bound to the NMDA receptor may maintain its activity for longer times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Otmakhov et al., 2004</xref>). Subunit exchange could facilitate the recruitment of additional holoenzymes to the receptor by spreading activation to unactivated holoenzymes.</p><p>Recent experiments using a CaMKII construct engineered to be a FRET reporter of its activation state indicate that the bulk of CaMKII holoenzymes in dendrites maintain their activation state for not much longer than a minute after the stimulation is withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takao et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, another study demonstrated that localized stimulation of a neuron resulted in the translocation of CaMKII from the main body of the axon to synapses throughout the dendritic arbor for much longer times (15–40 min) after the local stimulation is stopped; the authors of this report commented that subunit exchange may play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rose et al., 2009</xref>). Given the high concentrations of CaMKII in synapses and the fact that calmodulin is limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu and Storm, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacNicol and Schulman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Persechini and Stemmer, 2002</xref>), subunit exchange provides a potential mechanism for increasing the spread of activation caused by an initial activating pulse.</p><p>Now that we have demonstrated unambiguously that activation triggers the exchange of subunits in CaMKII in vitro, future experiments will address several important questions. We have focused on human CaMKIIα in this study. Is subunit exchange common to the other isoforms of the human enzyme? Did the property of subunit exchange arise early in evolution, or did it evolve with the specialization of CaMKII to neuronal function? Finally, and most importantly, how has nature exploited subunit exchange in activated CaMKII to determine the actual outcomes of neuronal signaling as well as in heart and other systems? It will be challenging, but ultimately most informative, to devise experiments to address this last question.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Appendix: speculation concerning the activation-dependent weakening of the hub assembly of a CaMKII holoenzyme</title><p>The CaMKII dodecamer can be described in terms of the lateral association of six vertical dimeric units, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.

To do this, we made a copy of the trajectory. The subunits in the original are labeled C through K, and in the copy they are labeled C′ through K′. The two internal interfaces (E:F/G:H and G:H/I:J) are brought into alignment by superimposing subunit E from the original onto subunit G′ of the copy of the trajectory, for pairs of structures at the same point in the trajectory. The overlaid structures are shown at the bottom left. The close overlap shows that the two vertical interfaces in this instantaneous structure are similar. We then aligned subunit E of the instantaneous structure with subunit G of the crystal structure (bottom right).

There is a rapid relaxation of the curvature of the ring in both trajectories. The decameric structure opens up with respect to the starting structure in both trajectories within ∼10 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The principal outward displacement occurs in the plane of the ring so that the structures move closer to the tetradecameric form of the hub assembly (PDB code: 1HKX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The constraint of ring closure undoubtedly imposes an entropic strain on the ring, and removal of the constraint is expected to yield a more floppy and open structure. What is notable, however, is that in both molecular dynamics trajectories we observe relaxation to a specific interfacial arrangement that is different from the interfacial arrangement seen in the crystal structure of the dodecamer. There are two internal vertical interfaces in the decamer, between the G:H and E:F vertical dimers and between the G:H and I:J vertical dimers. The relative orientations of subunits across these two interfaces converge to a similar arrangement, with low rms displacements, both within one trajectory and between two independent trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, bottom left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and this arrangement is different from that seen in the crystal structure of the dodecamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, bottom right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>This relaxation towards a specific structure, as seen in two independent trajectories, suggests that there is an enthalpic contribution to the strain in the closed ring.

Although in many cases the only access to the interior of the hub cavity is through the main opening to the cavity, which is far from where the regulatory segment connects to the hub, some individual subunits in hub domain assemblies exhibit cracks in the surface at the interface between helix αA and the β sheet against which it is packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These cracks make Arg 403, located within the cavity, partially accessible from the side of the hub domain. If such cracks were to open up further then phosphorylated residues in the R3 element might gain access to the interior of the cavity from the side of the hub domain, in the vicinity of the lateral interfaces between vertical hub domain dimers in the holoenzyme.</p><p>We carried out a 1 μs molecular dynamics simulation of a vertical hub domain dimer that was extracted from the crystal structure of mouse CaMKIIα (PDB code: 1HKX, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

This open edge of the β sheet is in fact utilized for a docking interaction by an 8 residue portion of the R3 element in the structure of autoinhibited CaMKII holoenzyme, in which this portion of the R3 element extends the β sheet by one strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2011</xref>). In that structure, however, further interaction between the R3 element and the hub domain is prevented by the fact that the kinase domain sequesters the rest of the regulatory segment.</p><p>We modeled the regulatory segment, with Thr 305 phosphorylated, as an additional strand that extends the β sheet of the hub domain, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details of the molecular docking). This model was used to generate three independent molecular dynamics trajectories, each extending for 50 ns.

The peptide stays docked onto the β3 strand of the hub domain throughout the trajectories, which, in turn, prevents the crack between helix αA and the β sheet from closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Notably, the widening of the crack is coupled to changes in the disposition of the loops that make lateral contacts with the adjacent vertical dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). This disruption may be sufficient to allow the release of a vertical dimer from the hub assembly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for a schematic representation of such a process).</p><p>Experimental validation of this model will require an extensive set of studies that are beyond the scope of this paper. For example, we mutated the arginine residues in the hub cavity that we have implicated in the exchange process, but this resulted in a substantial loss of fluorophore labeling at residue 335, indicating that the structure of the hub domain might be compromised.

Analysis was carried out in two overall steps: (i) localization of particles in micrographs and quantification of integrated fluorescence emission intensity from each identified spot and (ii) colocalization of detected particles in different color channels. Initial guesses for the location of particles were generated by locating sites of divergence in the gradient vector field of the image. Fitting an elliptical Gaussian to the intensity profile of individual particles refined the initial guesses. A cut-off in the circularity (evaluated as the ratio of the major and minor axis of the ellipse) enabled aggregates and particles with overlapping intensity distributions to be excluded. Colocalization, or the (number of colocalizing particles)/(number of total particles in reference channel), was evaluated by counting particles in separate channels with center positions located within a threshold distance (1.0–2.5 pixels). The colocalization number was normalized subsequently by the experimentally determined maximum value obtained from a positive control of doubly labeled CaMKII proteins.

Phosphorylated CaMKII (activated sample) was prepared as above. Activated and unactivated samples were diluted to 1 μM. For the mixing experiments, these samples were mixed in a 3:1 ratio of unactivated:activated protein (15 μl unactivated + 5 μl activated). For controls, each sample was measured individually at these same concentrations, and brought to the same final volume by addition of buffer. The kinase assay was carried out in a 384-well plate format at 30°C in a 27.5 μl reaction volume. The reaction mixture contained the following components (listed at final concentration): 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 μM DTT, 0.3–0.5 mM peptide substrate syntide (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK), and Tris. For each reaction, 5 μl of the protein solution was mixed with 4 μl concentrated reaction mixture, and 1 μl of either water or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (200 μM/4 μM) was added. The protocol for the ADP quest assay was followed for the remaining steps and reactions were initiated by the addition of 250 μM ATP to the mix. The increase in fluorescence was monitored at 590 nm (excitation at 530 nm) in a fluorescent microplate spectrophotometer (Synergy H4, Biotek) with sampling every 5 min. Slopes (Δfluorescence<sub>590 nm</sub>/time) were calculated from the early data points where an initial linear rate is observed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Molecular dynamics</title><p>The molecular dynamics trajectories were generated using the Gromacs 4.6.2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berendsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pronk et al., 2013</xref>). For all the hub dimer molecular dynamics simulations, with the docked pThr containing peptide, Amber12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Case et al., 2012</xref>) was used for ease of handling of modified backbone residues. The ff99SB-ILDN force field was used for all the calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). All simulations were carried out in aqueous medium using the TIP3P water model and appropriate counterions (Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>) were added to neutralize the net charges. After initial energy minimization, the systems were subjected to 30–100 ps of constant number, volume and temperature (NVT) equilibration, during which the system was heated to 300K. This was followed by a short equilibration at constant number, pressure and temperature (NPT, 20–100 ps). The equilibration steps were performed with harmonic positional restraints on the protein atoms. Finally, the production simulations were performed under NPT conditions, with the Berendsen and v-rescale thermostats in Amber12 and Gromacs 4.6.2 respectively, in the absence of positional restraints. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed, and particle-mesh Ewald summations were used for long-range electrostatics and the van der Waals cut-off is set at 1 nm. A time step of 2 fs was employed and the structures were stored every 2 ps. SHAKE and LINCS constraint algorithms were used with Amber12 and Gromacs 4.6.2, respectively, to fix covalent bonds.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Modeling the docked peptide onto the hub assembly</title><p>We modeled a 16-residue stretch of the R3 element as an additional strand of the β sheet in the hub domain. We created the model by first docking a β strand taken from an arbitrary protein so that the last 9 residues of the strand were aligned roughly with the 8 residue strand formed by R3 element in the autoinhibited CaMKII holoenzyme (PDB code: 3SOA). This model does not have the strand aligned optimally with the rest of the β sheet, and to improve the model we searched the protein databank, using the PDBeFOLD server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</xref>), for structures that had β strands arranged in the same topology and with close spatial overlap to the three strands from the hub domain and the roughly modeled fourth β strand, yielding a match in the human core Snrnp domain (PDB code: 1D3B). We then created a new model in which the β sheet from the crystal structure of the hub domain was retained and the fourth strand was taken from Snrnp, with appropriate changes to the sequence.</p><p>Using this fourth strand as a template we modeled in the sequence of the CaMKII R3 element in more than one sequence register, and carried out a series of short molecular dynamics simulations (∼100 ns each). In one of these simulations a conformational change that is similar to the transient fluctuations noted in the Appendix happened to occur, opening up access to the hub cavity. The sidechain of Met 307 from the R3 element was seen to approach Arg 403 closely in this simulation. We then changed the sequence register of the peptide so that Thr 305 occupied the position of the methionine sidechain, and we added a phosphate group to the threonine sidechain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Kuriyan and Groves labs, especially Jon Winger, for helpful discussion.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Wes Sundquis , is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present experiments and simulations showing that activated subunits from dodecameric CaMKII kinase assemblies can exchange into unactivated holoenzymes and thereby “spread” activation in a calcium-independent fashion. The authors make beautiful use of two- and three-color single molecule experiments (and complementary solution FRET experiments) and a series of mixed CaMKII constructs to demonstrate that subunit exchange and spreading occurs, and requires: 1) subunit activation, 2) dissociation of activated subunits from the dodecamer, 3) activities within the R3 regulatory and adjacent regulatory regions, including phosphorylation of Thr86 and Thr305/6, and 4) exchange of activated subunits into the previously inactive holoenzymes. An elegant mechanistic model for subunit exchange is proposed based upon structural and experimental constraints, and supported by molecular dynamics simulations.</p><p>The experiments are clean and elegant, the results remarkable, and the implications for CaMKII regulation and establishment of LTP are potentially far-reaching. The detailed proposal for activation-induced subunit exchange is still rather speculative, but is well thought out and logical and its inclusion enriches the paper. Unfortunately, the authors were unable perform the one very obvious test of their mechanistic proposal, mutation of the Arg-rich hub cavity, owing to technical problems. Nevertheless, there is much solid, important work here and it seems appropriate for the authors to propose a detailed model for subunit exchange and wait for subsequent studies to test the model (and its biological implications) more rigorously.</p><p>The paper is appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> because the phenomenon reported is unprecedented, because it has physiological implications on long-term potentiation, and because the single molecule colocalization approaches are novel, especially the three color detection that includes a phosphorylation site. The work should therefore have a very broad appeal to the structural biology, biophysics, signaling, neurobiology, and single molecule imaging communities.</p><p>Experimental issues:</p><p>1) Some of the assays used to demonstrate subunit exchange use wt forms of CaMKII (not pseudophosphorylated at T286). The authors deal with the important issue of whether activation conditions lead to aggregation of CaMKII into large clusters, as previously observed by others. They claim “no evidence” for such aggregation, but test this only for the CaMKII T286D form. Because their mixing experiments use other forms, they need to provide evidence regarding aggregation of these forms.</p><p>2) The authors should explain why they did not use a kinase defective mutant to test the requirement of the kinase activity. Instead, they used the unusual approach of lowering ATP concentration to 1 μM (why not zero?) and adding a kinase inhibitor. Using a kinase dead mutant would seem to be more direct and convincing. Was this approach used because a kinase mutant is not available or because such a study was performed but subunit exchange was still observed?</p><p>3) It is unsatisfying that the authors did not attempt to quantify the apparent stoichiometry of protein complexes through photobleaching analysis. They will get a distribution, of course, but they should be able to determine how many of their fluorescent spots are due to potential dimers because if dimers are indeed ejected upon activation, there will be more spots with fewer photobleaching steps. It will also be good to perform an experiment with a single population of wild-type kinase all labeled with a single dye and measure the distribution of photobleaching step counts before and after activation. The current single molecule intensity distribution measurements are not precise enough to address these points.</p><p>Conceptual/discussion issues:</p><p>1) The authors consistently refer to subunit exchange from an active holoenzyme into an inactive one. As we understand the mixing experiments, the exchange could also be from inactive form into an active form. If this is correct, the wording should be changed. This issue is important because it relates to one of the physiological roles of CaMKII that is alluded to: the role of subunit exchange in memory maintenance. According to ideas cited, CaMKII bound to the NMDA channel may be a molecular memory at synapses. The work of Colbran (2011) shows the importance of autophosphorylated CaMKII for binding to the PSD. One can thus assume that the bound CaMKII is autophosphorylated and active. If such a holoenzyme were replaced during protein turnover by an unphosphorylated holoenzyme, information would be lost. On the other hand, if as postulated in previous models (Lisman), turnover occurred by subunit exchange, the key step in protein turnover would be insertion of unphosphorylated (new) subunits into a previously activated holoenzyme. The new subunit would become phosphorylated by well established intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation. In this way, any loss of phosphorylated subunits from this holoenzyme would be compensated. These ideas are not clearly presented in the Discussion. The Discussion is further muddled by allusion to a completely different phenomenon, the spread to CaMKII activation throughout the dendrite after local stimulation. This is a little studied phenomenon of questionable physiological significance. It is worthy of mention but needs to be described in a separate paragraph and not mixed in with the discussion of the potential importance of subunit exchange for memory maintenance.</p><p>2) The authors should make it explicit that 305/306 regulation of subunit exchange might be just modulatory. There is no evidence that it is necessary.</p><p>3) For much of the data presented, one could have argued that the complex stability decreases with activation, leading to disassembly and reassembly resulting in mixing. Therefore, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is important but the readers have to read through other details, for example whether certain linkers and artificial multimerization domain are important for the exchange. The authors should consider moving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> up as much as possible to establish this most important aspect of the work.</p><p>4) The authors should also consider that some of the readers will be interested in how far this activation can propagate, that is what is the amplification factor? Will a single activated complex induced activation of one more, 10 more, or 100 more, for example. Their data as a function of protein concentration showing a steep drop in colocalization at low concentrations seems suitable for this type of modeling.</p><p>The spread of activation could indeed be mediated by the insertion of an active subunit into an inactive one. However, measurements done under physiological conditions (Yasuda Lab) show that bulk CaMKII is rapidly dephosphorylated. Thus, under these conditions, insertion of an active subunit into an inactive holoenzyme would not lead to “gain”. Indeed, such gain would be undesirable because it would propagate the biochemical signal that triggers synaptic modification to inactive synapses. Yasuda's work on optical detection of activated CaMKII shows that it remains localized to the activated spine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01610.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Experimental issues:</p><p><italic>1) Some of the assays used to demonstrate subunit exchange use wt forms of CaMKII (not pseudophosphorylated at T286).

Regarding the observation by others of large scale aggregates in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, we note that our earlier analysis of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> holoenzyme by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) found no evidence for aggregation in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, with the only structural effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM being an increase in the radius of gyration of the holoenzyme (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosenberg et al., 2005</xref>). We suspect that the aggregation observed by others may be a consequence of differences in the solution conditions, particularly the pH, but we have not investigated this further.</p><p>We now present dynamic light scattering analysis for the wild-type human enzyme activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to augment the data for the T286D mutant that had been presented in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). These data demonstrate that there is no significant time dependent aggregation for either sample. It is interesting to note that the hydrodynamic radius derived from the light scattering data for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-activated sample (∼30 nm) is larger than that for the T286D mutant (∼11 nm). We interpret the apparent increase in the hydrodynamic radius in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to mean that the binding of CaM converts the holoenzyme to a more extended form than seen for the T286D mutant. Regardless of the origin of the increased apparent hydrodynamic radius of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM complex, there is no observable increase in the hydrodynamic radius with time for either sample. Note also that the T286D mutant exhibits a robust degree of subunit exchange in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, comparable to the exchange kinetics seen for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. Thus, the differences in the apparent hydrodynamic radii of the two species is not a contributing factor to the exchange process.</p><p>We also now present intensity analysis for the single-molecule experiments for the T286D mutant as well as for the wild-type enzyme with Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM (the original manuscript presented data only for the wild-type enzyme; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). These data make clear that there is no time-dependent increase in the intensities of the samples, consistent with the absence of aggregation in the samples analyzed by the single-molecule method.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should explain why they did not use a kinase defective mutant to test the requirement of the kinase activity. Instead, they used the unusual approach of lowering ATP concentration to 1 μM (why not zero?) and adding a kinase inhibitor. Using a kinase dead mutant would seem to be more direct and convincing. Was this approach used because a kinase mutant is not available or because such a study was performed but subunit exchange was still observed</italic>?</p><p>A kinase inhibitor was used in place of a kinase-dead mutant in order to compare exchange rates for the same protein preparation directly. We now present a FRET experiment to test exchange in the presence of bosutinib and no ATP, which was a good suggestion by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). The data show clearly that in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and a kinase inhibitor with no ATP added, the exchange is suppressed to the level of unactivated CaMKII.</p><p><italic>3) It is unsatisfying that the authors did not attempt to quantify the apparent stoichiometry of protein complexes through photobleaching analysis.

The current single molecule intensity distribution measurements are not precise enough to address these points</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct in saying that our current intensity measurements are insufficient to derive stoichiometric information regarding the exchange process. For the single molecule studies shown in the original manuscript, the labeling efficiency was well below 100%, which would affect any type of stoichiometric analysis. Additionally, if each subunit of a CaMKII dodecamer was labeled with one dye moiety, this would create more photobleaching steps than can accurately be measured. The numerous cysteine residues in the wild-type CaMKII sequence also introduce an uncertainty in the labeling distribution. We have performed photobleaching experiments using our current setup (see sample traces below [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>], which are provided here but will not be included in the final manuscript).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Author response image 1: Sample traces</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01610-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The information obtained from these traces does not yield significant information regarding stoichiometries of the unit of exchange. Absolute counting of photobleaching steps is not a straightforward way to obtain the true stoichiometry of multimeric protein samples and models correcting for submaximal labeling of proteins with chromophores, non-linear detection of signals with different brightness and photophysical effects must be employed and validated with careful control experiments. Follow-up experiments in the future will certainly be geared toward this important question.</p><p><italic>Conceptual/discussion issues</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors consistently refer to subunit exchange from an active holoenzyme into an inactive one. As we understand the mixing experiments, the exchange could also be from inactive form into an active form. If this is correct, the wording should be changed. This issue is important because it relates to one of the physiological roles of CaMKII that is alluded to: the role of subunit exchange in memory maintenance. According to ideas cited, CaMKII bound to the NMDA channel may be a molecular memory at synapses. The work of Colbran (2011) shows the importance of autophosphorylated CaMKII for binding to the PSD. One can thus assume that the bound CaMKII is autophosphorylated and active. If such a holoenzyme were replaced during protein turnover by an unphosphorylated holoenzyme, information would be lost. On the other hand, if as postulated in previous models (Lisman), turnover occurred by subunit exchange, the key step in protein turnover would be insertion of unphosphorylated (new) subunits into a previously activated holoenzyme. The new subunit would become phosphorylated by well established intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation. In this way, any loss of phosphorylated subunits from this holoenzyme would be compensated. These ideas are not clearly presented in the Discussion. The Discussion is further muddled by allusion to a completely different phenomenon, the spread to CaMKII activation throughout the dendrite after local stimulation. This is a little studied phenomenon of questionable physiological significance. It is worthy of mention but needs to be described in a separate paragraph and not mixed in with the discussion of the potential importance of subunit exchange for memory maintenance</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that our current understanding of the exchange process does not clearly delineate directionality of subunit exchange between dodecamers. We have reworded this where appropriate. Additionally, we have reorganized the Discussion to separate the idea of CaMKII spreading throughout the dendritic spine after activation from the Discussion of the effects of exchange on CaMKII bound to the NMDA receptor.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should make it explicit that 305/306 regulation of subunit exchange might be just modulatory. There is no evidence that it is necessary</italic>.</p><p>This wording has been corrected.</p><p><italic>3) For much of the data presented, one could have argued that the complex stability decreases with activation, leading to disassembly and reassembly resulting in mixing. Therefore, the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>is important but the readers have to read through other details, for example whether certain linkers and artificial multimerization domain are important for the exchange. The authors should consider moving</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>up as much as possible to establish this most important aspect of the work</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this comment and had attempted to reorganize the manuscript in this way. A large number of experiments are discussed in the paper, and we found that the rearrangement made it harder to keep the discussion coherent. We have, therefore, retained the original flow of the paper.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should also consider that some of the readers will be interested in how far this activation can propagate, that is what is the amplification factor? Will a single activated complex induced activation of one more, 10 more, or 100 more, for example. Their data as a function of protein concentration showing a steep drop in colocalization at low concentrations seems suitable for this type of modeling</italic>.</p><p><italic>The spread of activation could indeed be mediated by the insertion of an active subunit into an inactive one. However, measurements done under physiological conditions (Yasuda Lab) show that bulk CaMKII is rapidly dephosphorylated. Thus, under these conditions, insertion of an active subunit into an inactive holoenzyme would not lead to “gain”. Indeed, such gain would be undesirable because it would propagate the biochemical signal that triggers synaptic modification to inactive synapses. Yasuda's work on optical detection of activated CaMKII shows that it remains localized to the activated spine</italic>.</p><p>From our current set of data, we cannot accurately estimate the effect of activation spread in terms of total propagation. We are planning future experiments and extensive modeling to try to answer this difficult question. However, this will most likely require devising in vivo experimentation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
