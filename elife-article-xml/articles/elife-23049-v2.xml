optimal peptide selection by MHC class I molecules. Here, we asked whether any other co-factors associate with TAPBPR, which would explain its effect on peptide selection. We identify an interaction between TAPBPR and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1), a folding sensor in the calnexin/calreticulin quality control cycle that is known to regenerate the Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> moiety on glycoproteins. Our results suggest the formation of a multimeric complex, dependent on a conserved cysteine at position 94 in TAPBPR, in which TAPBPR promotes the association of UGT1 with peptide-receptive MHC class I molecules. We reveal that the interaction between TAPBPR and UGT1 facilities the reglucosylation of the glycan on MHC class I molecules, promoting their recognition by calreticulin. Our results suggest that in addition to being a peptide editor, TAPBPR improves peptide optimisation by promoting peptide-receptive MHC class I molecules to associate with the peptide-loading complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23049.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23049.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TAPBPR</kwd><kwd>TAPBPL</kwd><kwd>antigen processing &amp; presentation</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>HLA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship 104647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neerincx</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Boyle</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Fellowship,UF100371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Grant,C7056A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hateren</surname><given-names>Andy van</given-names></name><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 685</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trautwein</surname><given-names>Nico</given-names></name><name><surname>Stevanović</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship,089563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Clemens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Award 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antrobus</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>programme grant,WT094847MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Huan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The recently discovered peptide editor TAPBPR binds to UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 to provide quality control in the antigen presentation pathway by facilitating the reglucosylation of the glycan on MHC class I molecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The presentation of antigenic peptides to the immune system by MHC class I molecules is crucial in generating protective responses against infection and cancer. Central to this process is the loading and optimisation of peptides onto MHC class I molecules within the peptide-loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by tapasin, an MHC class I-dedicated chaperone that has been the focus of intense investigation for the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadasivan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ortmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). It is now well established that tapasin functions as a peptide exchange catalyst for MHC class I molecules, a process that is important in the selection of high-affinity peptides onto MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>). Recently, we revealed that TAPBPR, a second MHC class I-dedicated chaperone in the antigen presentation pathway, also functions as a peptide exchange catalyst for MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>), a finding that was subsequently verified by Margulies and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is now clear that there are at least two MHC class I-specific chaperones in the antigen presentation pathway that are intimately involved in selecting peptides for presentation on MHC class I molecules.</p><p>Although both tapasin and TAPBPR share the ability to optimise peptide selection in vitro, they cannot directly compensate for each other within a cellular environment and appear to influence peptide selection in separate yet complementary processes. In the absence of a functional tapasin molecule, inefficient peptide loading occurs, resulting in MHC class I molecules loaded with suboptimal peptide ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ortmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Purcell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). As a consequence, the absence of tapasin produces thermolabile MHC class I complexes that are inefficiently expressed on the cell surface, although different MHC class I allomorphs differ in their dependency on tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ortmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garbi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grandea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to our understanding of tapasin, the precise role of TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing in the antigen presentation pathway has yet to be fully characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). TAPBPR is not essential for the initial peptide-loading event onto MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, TAPBPR has a more subtle, fine-tuning effect on the peptides displayed, removing some peptides of lower affinity and thus improving peptide selection and increasing the stability of MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have speculated that the different effects of tapasin and TAPBPR on the peptide repertoire in cells is due, at least in part, to the environment in which the two chaperones operate. Tapasin functions within the PLC in an environment that is rich in suitable peptides for MHC class I binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadasivan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ortmann et al., 1997</xref>), which helps promote efficient peptide loading onto MHC class I molecules. In contrast TAPBPR is not a component of the PLC and therefore performs peptide editing outside this complex, potentially in a more peptide-deficient environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>), which may favour peptide dissociation from MHC class I molecules. Therefore, it seems plausible that tapasin and TAPBPR have evolved to function in distinct cellular environments. For tapasin, three regions have been identified that are essential for its localisation and function within the PLC: its transmembrane domain is responsible for its interaction with TAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2015</xref>); a free cysteine residue at position C95 is essential for its association with ERp57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peaper et al., 2005</xref>); and residues in the Ig domains interact with MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turnquist et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turnquist et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). For TAPBPR, the only functional sites to be identified so far are those that are responsible for its interaction with MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), and as yet, no association partners that function with TAPBPR have been characterised. Our aim here was to investigate whether any other co-factors interacted with TAPBPR in cells, which would explain the ability of TAPBPR to optimise peptide selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TAPBPR binds to UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1</title><p>To identify potential cellular binding partners for TAPBPR, we transiently transfected HeLaM cells with a construct in which the cDNA encoding amino acids 22–468 of human TAPBPR (i.e. the mature protein) was cloned downstream of a generic ER leader sequence, two protein A cassettes and a myc tag (ZZ-TAPBPR). This resulted in the expression of ZZ-TAPBPR at an approximately five-fold greater level than that observed for endogenous TAPBPR in IFN-γ-treated HeLaM. Affinity chromatography with IgG-sepharose beads was subsequently used to isolate ZZ-TAPBPR and any associated proteins. As expected, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis identified the MHC class I heavy chain and β2m in the ZZ-TAPBPR immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) was also isolated in the immunoprecipitates from ZZ-TAPBPR-expressing cells, but not in control HeLaM cells transfected with an empty vector (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that UGT1 could be a novel binding partner for TAPBPR. UGT1 was ranked as the third specific hit in the ZZ-TAPBPR pulldown after the MHC class I heavy chain and TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). UGT1 is an ER/cis-Golgi resident enzyme that monitors glycoprotein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tessier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Alessio et al., 2010</xref>). In 2011, Cresswell and colleagues showed that UGT1 plays an important role in the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Although no direct association was demonstrated between MHC class I and UGT1 within a cellular environment, they found that MHC class I maturation and assembly was delayed, surface expression of MHC class I was reduced, and there was an impairment of peptide selection in UGT1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, recombinant UGT1 was found to reglucosylate MHC class I molecules associated with suboptimal ligands and permitted their re-engagement with the PLC, thus providing direct evidence for the role of UGT1 in the antigen presentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>). To confirm that the interaction between TAPBPR and UGT1 was not an artefact of tagging or TAPBPR overexpression, immunoprecipitation of TAPBPR was performed in IFN-γ-induced HeLaM and KBM-7 cells, followed by western blotting for UGT1. An association between endogenous TAPBPR and UGT1 was observed in both IFN-γ-treated HeLaM and KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> respectively). The association was not observed in cells that were knocked out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of TAPBPR, demonstrating that the co-precipitation of UGT1 was a direct consequence of TAPBPR presence. Furthermore, the association between TAPBPR and UGT1 was observed in the absence of tapasin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that a functional PLC is not required for TAPBPR to associate with UGT1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, we observed that the association between TAPBPR and MHC class I was increased in the absence of tapasin, an observation that is consistent with our previously published findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the association observed between TAPBPR and UGT1, no association was observed between tapasin and UGT1 in IFN-γ-induced KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results confirm that UGT1 is a novel binding partner for TAPBPR. However, as human TAPBPR lacks an N-linked glycan and UGT1 monitors glycoprotein folding by recognising hydrophobic patches near a Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trombetta et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caramelo et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caramelo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>), it is highly unlikely that UGT1 functions directly in the quality control of TAPBPR.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23049.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TAPBPR associates with UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) TAPBPR or (<bold>C</bold>) tapasin were immunoprecipitated using PeTe4 or Pasta1, respectively, from (<bold>A</bold>) IFN-γ-treated HeLaM, TAPBPR KO, tapasin KO, and double tapasin KO/TAPBPR KO HeLaM cells or (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) IFN-γ-treated wild-type, TAPBPR-depleted (+ shTAPBPR), and tapasin KO KBM-7 cells. In (<bold>A</bold>), immunoprecipitation with an isotype control antibody was used as a control (labelled 'Ctrl'). Western blot analysis was performed for UGT1, TAPBPR (using R021), tapasin (Rgp48N), MHC class I HC (using 3B10.7), or calnexin as a loading control on immunoprecipitates or lysates as indicated. Note: the amounts of TAPBPR present in the lysates were below limits of detection and were detectable after concentration via immunoprecipitation. In (C), * denotes the tapasin protein from the previous blot, while the lower band is the MHC class I HC. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. In (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), an increased association between TAPBPR and MHC class I molecules in the absence of tapasin can be observed. While this is not immediately obvious in (<bold>A</bold>) with HeLaM cells, a significant loss of MHC class I expression is observed in the absence of tapasin in this cell line. Therefore, a relative increase in the association between MHC class I molecules and TAPBPR is observed in the absence of tapasin.

For tapasin, intramolecular disulphide bonds exist between C7 and C71 in the N-terminal domain and C295 and C363 in the membrane proximal Ig-like domain, while C95 is known not to be involved in an intramolecular disulphide bound, but instead forms an intermolecular disulphide bond with C57 of ERp57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2009</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Our Fold and Functional Assignment System (FFAS) model of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>) now supported by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>), predicts that C18 and C101 in the N-terminal domain and C300 and C361 in the IgC domain of TAPBPR form similar intramolecular disulphide bonds as those found in tapasin, and that C191 and C262 form an additional intramolecular disulphide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This analysis predicts that C94 in TAPBPR is very unlikely to be involved in an intramolecular disulphide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To verify this, all cysteine residues were individually changed to alanine, cloned into a lentiviral vector containing a bicistronic GFP, and then successfully transduced into HeLaM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of C300 or C361 in the IgC domain led to significantly reduced steady-state expression of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that these cysteines are essential for TAPBPR stability. Under non-reducing conditions, TAPBPR<sup>C18A</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>C101A</sup> exhibited lower electrophoretic mobility relative to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that a disulphide bond exists between C18 and C101 that is important for the structural integrity of the N-terminal domain. Mutation of C191 and C262 did not significantly affect steady-state TAPBPR expression; however, a very subtle change in electrophoretic mobility of these two mutants was observed under non-reducing conditions compared to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This may reflect disruption of a disulphide bond within a stable protein domain that does not lead to sufficient unfolding as to be detected by electrophoresis, as is the case for MHC class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman and Strominger, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">1983</xref>). Another possibility is that, under the conditions used, the sample was reoxidised prior to loading. In contrast, mutation of C94 in TAPBPR did not affect steady-state protein expression or electrophoretic mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As an additional check to determine whether TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> was stable and folded, this mutant was cloned into the pHLsec expression vector and transiently transfected into HEK293F cells. As observed with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>), TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> was efficiently expressed and purified using Ni affinity and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Using differential scanning fluorimetry, the melting temperature of purified TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> were the same, demonstrating that mutation of C94 to alanine did not affect protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23049.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>C94 in TAPBPR is not involved in an intramolecular disulphide bond</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequences of human TAPBPR (NP_060479.3) and tapasin (AAC20076.1) were aligned using ClustalW.

Under non-reducing conditions, there was no evidence of a disulphide-linked heterodimer between TAPBPR and UGT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Both UGT1 and TAPBPR isolated from TAPBPR immunoprecipitates from HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells resolved at the predicted size of the monomeric proteins (~175 kDa for UGT1 and &lt;52 kDa for TAPBPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, no difference in electrophoretic mobility was observed if the cells expressed TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> or TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition to suggesting that TAPBPR does not form a disulphide-linked dimer with UGT1, the results also indicate that TAPBPR does not form a covalent bond with any other as-yet unidentified binding partner of measurable size in these cells. There was also no evidence of a disulphide-linked dimer between endogenously expressed TAPBPR and UGT1 in IFN-γ-induced KBM-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Based on our FFAS model of TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), additional residues (I83, E87, L90, H91, and D93) predicted to form an α-helix on the surface of TAPBPR near C94 were also anticipated to contribute to the UGT1 interface. Mutation of these residues (UBS1: I83K, E87K, or UBS2: E87K, L90K, H91S, and D93R) decreased the association of UGT1 with TAPBPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Next, we sought to determine whether a tri-molecular complex between TAPBPR, UGT1, and MHC class I formed in cells by turning our attention to the contribution of MHC class I to the interactions. First, we asked whether an association between TAPBPR and MHC class I was required for UGT1 to efficiently associate with TAPBPR. In TAPBPR immunoprecipitates from HeLaM<sup>KO</sup> cells transduced with TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup>, which is unable to bind to MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>), the amount of UGT1 bound to TAPBPR was significantly reduced compared to cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, upon IFN-γ treatment, which boosts MHC class I expression, TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> was able to interact with MHC class I molecules, albeit weakly, and the amount of UGT1 bound to TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> similarly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the association between TAPBPR and MHC class I is important for the maximum association of UGT1 with TAPBPR, supporting the concept that a tri-molecular complex forms between TAPBPR, UGT1, and MHC class I.</p><p>We wondered whether TAPBPR was acting as a molecular platform or intermediate between UGT1 and MHC class I, which is likely to be peptide free or loaded with low-affinity peptides, given recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). To test this, we determined whether TAPBPR was required for UGT1 to associate with MHC class I. In HeLaM<sup>KO</sup> cells, we observed a weak association between MHC class I and UGT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells, this association was significantly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). No such enhancement was observed in cells expressing the mutant forms TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> or TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup>, even in the presence of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that the association between MHC class I molecules and UGT1 is promoted by TAPBPR. We also tested the requirement for TAPBPR in the association between MHC class I molecules and UGT1 when endogenous TAPBPR was induced in HeLaM cells by IFN-γ. UGT1 was found to associate weakly with both HC10- and W6/32-reactive MHC class I molecules in IFN-γ-treated HeLaM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, in IFN-γ-treated HeLaM<sup>KO</sup> cells, a significant reduction was observed between UGT1- and W6/32-reactive MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results are consistent with TAPBPR acting as a bridge between UGT1 and MHC class I heterodimers and suggest that UGT1 recognition of MHC class I molecules can occur in a TAPBPR-independent manner (i.e. for the majority of HC10-reactive MHC class I) or in a TAPBPR-dependent manner (i.e with W6/32-reactive MHC class).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> still functions as a peptide editor in vitro</title><p>Recently, we and others have shown that TAPBPR is a peptide exchange catalyst that is important for optimal peptide selection by MHC class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). Having identified an interaction between UGT1 and TAPBPR, we next asked how important this association was for peptide optimisation on MHC class I molecules in a cellular environment. First, we tested whether TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> was a functionally active MHC class I peptide editor in vitro. Using fluorescence polarisation, we observed a comparable ability of TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> to enhance peptide dissociation and association on HLA-A*02:01 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Furthermore, when we tested the ability of TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> to discriminate between high-affinity (the labelled peptide FLPSDC*FPSV) and lower-affinity (NLVPMVATV) peptides for binding to HLA-A*02:01 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for a comparison of the affinity of these two peptides for HLA-A2), in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>, NLVPMVATV became a poorer competitor, as observed with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>).

However, we observed slightly lower surface expression of HLA-A*68:02 in cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> compared to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) despite comparable levels of steady-state expression of TAPBPR in cell lines transduced with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, in order to determine the contribution that the UGT1 bound to TAPBPR has on peptide selection in a cellular environment, we compared the MHC class I peptide repertoire on HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> with HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> cells, both with the addition of IFN-γ to boost MHC class I, TAP, and tapasin expression. In this system, both cell types still contain functional UGT1 molecules and express TAPBPR molecules that remain capable of peptide exchange, as shown above. Therefore, it allows for the loss of the association between TAPBPR and UGT1 to be specifically examined. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules isolated from cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> by mass spectrometry revealed differences in the repertoire of peptides presented. A total of 690 peptides were shared between these two cell lines, while 500 were unique to HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells and 174 were unique to HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Comparison of the anchor residues found at the P2 and C-terminal (PΩ) positions of the peptides unique to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>cells (presumably peptides selected by the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex) with peptides unique to TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>cells (presumably peptides restricted by the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex) revealed a decrease in the canonical anchor residues in the peptides uniquely isolated from the TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>-expressing cells for HLA-A*68:02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). For HLA-B*15:03, no decrease in the prevalence of anchor residues was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that the ability of TAPBPR to improve peptide optimisation on MHC class I molecules within a cellular environment can be strongly influenced by its association with UGT1, as observed here for HLA-A*68:02.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23049.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 bound to TAPBPR influences peptide selection on MHC class I molecules</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cytofluorimetric analysis of W6/32-, HLA-A68-, and 4E-reactive MHC class I molecules on HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>cells (black line), HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>cells reconstituted with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> (blue line) or TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>cells (green line).

It is noteworthy that these particular experiments have been performed in independently produced cell lines in the unmodified HeLaM background (i.e. without TAPBPR<sup>KO</sup>, in the absence of IFN-γ induction, and with lower transgene expression) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> for the association of TAPBPR with MHC class I and UGT1 in these cell lines). On HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>WT </sup>cells, only a slight increase in HLA-A68 expression was observed upon incubation at 26°C with exogenous peptide compared to cells incubated at 37°C without peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). In contrast, on HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>C94A </sup>cells, a significant increase in HLA-A68 expression was observed on cells incubated at 26°C with exogenous peptide compared to 37°C without peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). To further confirm that the increased expression of peptide-receptive HLA-A68 at the cell surface was a direct consequence of the loss of the association between TAPBPR and UGT1, as opposed to any other consequential effect of mutation of the C94 residue of TAPBPR, we depleted UGT1 in HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells. In shUGT1-depleted cells, a significant, although not complete, reduction in the association between TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and UGT1 was observed, and the strong association between TAPBPR and MHC class I was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the surface phenotype of HLA-A68 molecules now resembled that of HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>C94A </sup>cells rather than that of HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells, with increased levels of peptide-receptive HLA-A68 that were stabilised upon incubation at 26°C with high-affinity peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). The expression of peptide-receptive HLA-A68 was higher on HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>WT/shUGT1 </sup>cells than HeLaM-TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> cells, perhaps due to additional TAPBPR-independent effects of UGT1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

In contrast, in IFN-γ-induced HeLaM<sup>KO</sup> cells, the amount of HLA-A68 recognised by calreticulin was reduced, and proportionally more HLA-B15 had the Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> moiety attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In HeLaM<sup>KO</sup> cells reconstituted with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, we observed an increase in the amount of MHC class I molecules bound to both tapasin and TAP as compared to HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>cells or cells reconstituted with TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In accordance with the results observed above with the calreticulin pulldowns, we specifically observed enhanced PLC association with the lower MHC class I heavy chain band (i.e. HLA-A*68:02) in HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The increased association of HLA-A68 with tapasin in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> compared to TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> was independently verified via quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which also confirmed that the amounts of MHC class I molecules bound to TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>C94A </sup>were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To ensure that the enhanced association of MHC class I with the PLC was specifically due to the association of TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> with UGT1, we also determined the association of MHC class I molecules with TAP and tapasin in cells depleted of UGT1 using shRNA. In HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> cells depleted of UGT1, the amount of HLA-A68 bound to tapasin and TAP was significantly reduced compared to its UGT1-competent counterpart HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup>, and was now comparable to HeLaM<sup>KO</sup>TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> without UGT1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that in addition to functioning as an MHC class I peptide editor in its own right, TAPBPR can also influence peptide selection on MHC class I molecules by promoting their association with the PLC, an effect that is dependent on its interaction with UGT1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently, we and others have shown that, like tapasin, TAPBPR can function as a peptide exchange catalyst on MHC class I molecules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>). However, within a cellular environment, the two related MHC class I chaperones do not appear to be functional equivalents in regard to their influence on peptide selection. While tapasin influences both the loading and optimisation of cargo on MHC class I molecules, TAPBPR appears to have a more subtle, fine-tuning effect on the final peptide repertoire displayed, at least in the limited number of cell lines tested to date. We wondered whether any other co-factors associate with TAPBPR, which would explain its refining effect on peptide selection in a cellular environment. Here, we identify a novel association between TAPBPR and UGT1, an ER/cis-Golgi-resident enzyme that recognises hydrophobic patches near Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> moieties in incompletely folded or unassembled glycoproteins and transfers a glucose residue from UDP-glucose in order to regenerate Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, restoring recognition by the calnexin/calreticulin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trombetta et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammond et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ware et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tessier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caramelo et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caramelo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ritter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Alessio et al., 2010</xref>). Human TAPBPR has no N-linked glycan and therefore cannot be reglucosylated by UGT1. Thus, it is highly unlikely that UGT1 functions directly on human TAPBPR. In some species, TAPBPR may contain an N-linked glycan due to the presence of an NxS or NxT motif. However, these are generally found in the IgV domain and therefore might not affect the association with or be effected by UGT1.</p><p>In 2011, Cresswell and colleagues first identified a role for UGT1 in the MHC class I pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). UGT1 was shown to reglucosylate MHC class I molecules associated with suboptimal peptide, thereby permitting re-engagement with the PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in UGT1-deficient mouse cells, maturation of MHC class I was delayed, surface expression of MHC class I molecules was reduced, and the peptide repertoire presented on MHC class I was impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). These studies demonstrate that UGT1 provides a unique level of quality control in the MHC class I presentation pathway, acting as a sensor for the quality of the MHC class I-associated peptide cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings here suggest that as well as UGT1 recognising a population of MHC class I molecules in a TAPBPR-independent manner, it can also recognise MHC class I molecules bound to TAPBPR. In this scenario, TAPBPR most likely acts as a platform or bridge between UGT1 and MHC class I. As the MHC class I molecules bound to TAPBPR are in a peptide-receptive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>), we propose that TAPBPR permits UGT1 to reglucosylate empty or suboptimally loaded MHC class I molecules, thus providing an important quality control checkpoint in the antigen presentation pathway. It is possible that UGT1 senses different conformational perturbations in MHC class I molecules when functioning in a TAPBPR-dependent versus a TAPBPR-independent manner.</p><p>Precisely how C94 in TAPBPR permits its binding to UGT1 remains unclear at present. Our evidence does not support a disulphide-mediated interaction between the two proteins. However, perhaps within the environment of the ER and cis-Golgi, a covalent association does indeed exist, but is susceptible in the conditions used to isolate this complex, as was initially observed for the disulphide-mediated bond between tapasin and ERp57, which was found to be extremely labile in the absence of pre-treatment with N-ethymaleimide (NEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Cresswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2002</xref>). Alternatively, the association between TAPBPR and UGT1 may be dependent on a post-translational modification of C94, such as S-nitrosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hess et al., 2005</xref>). We have attempted to determine whether C94 is post-translationally modified via mass spectrometry, but we were unable to identify peptides covering C94 when digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Interestingly, we found additional residues predicted to form an α-helix on the surface of TAPBPR also influenced its association with UGT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that C94 may be part of an extended interface. In this capacity, C94 may help stabilise the α-helix as a UGT1 binding site.</p><p>We found that the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex promotes the glucosylation of the glycan on MHC class I, regenerating the Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> moiety in order to restore recognition by calreticulin, which subsequently results in enhanced association of the MHC class I molecules with the PLC. Therefore, in addition to functioning as a peptide editor in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morozov et al., 2016</xref>), it is now apparent that TAPBPR can also influence peptide selection by promoting peptide-receptive MHC class I molecules to associate with the PLC. Our discoveries here shed light on our previously unexplained observations, namely that, in HeLa cells, fewer HLA-A68 molecules were associated with TAP in TAPBPR-depleted cells compared to their TAPBPR-competent counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>). In this previous work, we suggested that the HLA-A68 molecules dissociated faster from the PLC in the absence of TAPBPR, but it now appears that this phenotype is more likely to be explained by a lack of recycling of the HLA-A68 molecules back to the PLC in the absence of TAPBPR due to the lack of reglucosylation of the MHC class I glycan. Our findings here also help to further explain why TAPBPR expression slows down the ER export of MHC class I molecules and enhances their association with tapasin; findings that earlier led us to speculate that TAPBPR was a second quality control checkpoint in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although UGT1 is not required for TAPBPR to function as an MHC class I peptide editor, the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex is clearly important for MHC class I peptide optimisation. This is evidenced by the decrease observed in canonical anchor residue prevalence for peptides associated with HLA-A68 in cells expressing TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>, a mutant that retains peptide-editing function, but cannot bind UGT1. These results demonstrate that TAPBPR and UGT1 work together to provide a novel quality control checkpoint in the antigen presentation pathway that influences the final peptide repertoire displayed. We propose the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): in the PLC, MHC class I molecules are loaded with peptides of relatively optimal affinity via tapasin (step 1). However, some MHC class I molecules can also self-assemble with peptides in a tapasin-independent manner, resulting in complexes associated with cargoes of variable quality (step 2). Following glucosidase II-mediated removal of the terminal glucose on the glycan (step 3), some MHC class I molecules can be recognised and reglucosylated directly by UGT1 in a TAPBPR-independent manner (step 4). However, in order to proceed to the cell surface, MHC class I molecules need to pass through the TAPBPR-mediated quality control checkpoint (step 5). MHC class I molecules loaded with high-affinity peptides transit through quickly. However, MHC class I molecules associated with cargoes of low or medium affinity are captured by TAPBPR for a subsequent editing step that favours peptide dissociation. The resultant MHC class I molecule that is devoid of peptide is now reglucosylated by UGT1 associated with TAPBPR (step 6); a modification that sends the MHC class I molecule back into the calnexin/calreticulin pathway, and consequently back to the PLC (step 1) for another attempt at peptide loading. While the reason for TAPBPR preferentially mediating reglucosylation of HLA-A68 over HLA-B15 in HeLaM cells is currently unexplained, it is tempting to speculate that TAPBPR may favour binding to molecules that are initially associated with peptide in a tapasin-independent manner, as has been observed for many HLA-A allomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenwood et al., 1994</xref>), and may be due to the lower affinities of their cargoes.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23049.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model of the TAPBPR:UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 complex in the MHC class I presentation pathway.</title><p>In addition to (1) the loading and editing of peptides (shown in blue) via tapasin in the peptide-rich milieu of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), an environment that favours MHC class I molecules associating with a broad range of optimal peptides, (2) some MHC class I molecules can also self-assemble with peptides with a wide range of affinities (shown in red) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a tapasin-independent manner. (3) Regardless of the folding state or affinity/source of the cargo occupying the peptide binding groove (reflected here as a quartered circle to signify a broad range of peptide affinity from various sources of loading), GlsII will mediate removal of the terminal glucose on the glycan in the absence of protection by calnexin/calreticulin. (4) Some conformations of MHC class I molecules will be recognised and reglucosylated by UGT1 in a TAPBPR-independent manner. (5) In order to be exported to the cell surface, MHC class I molecules need to pass through the TAPBPR-mediated quality control checkpoint. If a high-affinity peptide is bound to the MHC class I molecule, TAPBPR either does not bind to the MHC class I molecule or associates transiently and is quickly released, permitting the MHC class I molecule to proceed through the secretory pathway. If the MHC class I molecule is associated with a cargo of low or medium affinity, TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing occurs. In contrast to tapasin-mediated peptide editing in the PLC, this second TAPBPR-mediated editing step favours peptide dissociation either as a consequence of occurring in more peptide-restrictive areas of the ER, cis-Golgi, and medial Golgi or due to a distinct functionality of TAPBPR. (6) MHC class I molecules devoid of peptide are now recognised and reglucosylated by UGT1 associated with TAPBPR. (7) This modification on the N-linked glycan sends the MHC class I molecule back into the calnexin/calreticulin pathway, and consequently back to the PLC (1) for another attempt at peptide loading. In this scenario, TAPBPR may exhibit preferential binding to MHC class I molecules that associate with peptides in a tapasin-independent manner, as has been observed for many HLA-A allomorphs.

For tapasin, the free cysteine residue at position C95 is essential for its association with ERp57 in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Tapasin<sup>C95A</sup> molecules exhibit an impaired ability to load and edit peptides, resulting in poorly loaded MHC class I molecules that escape to the cell surface, where they are unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dick et al., 2002</xref>). For TAPBPR, its free cysteine residue at position C94 is important for its association with UGT1. TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> molecules exhibit an impaired ability to reglucosylate MHC class I molecules and exhibit a reduction in the ability to optimise peptide selection due to a failure to recycle MHC class I molecules back to the PLC. Thus, the unpaired cysteine residues in both tapasin and TAPBPR in mammals have evolved to perform roles that prevent the release of MHC class I molecules loaded with unsuitable peptides. As a result of functioning as peptide exchange catalysts within distinct cellular environments and their unique association partners, it is becoming evident that tapasin and TAPBPR have evolved to uniquely shape the peptides bound to MHC class I molecules in distinct yet intertwined ways that ultimately determine the final peptide repertoire presented on the surface of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>The production of full-length TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> and TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> in the lentiviral vector pHRSIN-C56W-UbEM, which produces TAPBPR under the control of the spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) promoter and the GFP derivative emerald under the control of a ubiquitin promoter, has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermann et al., 2013</xref>).

Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and supernatants were pre-cleared on IgG-sepharose (GE Healthcare) and protein A sepharose (Generon, UK) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the indicated antibody and protein A sepharose or recombinant calreticulin with glutathione sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2–3 h at 4°C with rotation.

Samples for separation by gel electrophoresis were heated at 94°C for 10 min in sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromophenol blue). For reducing SDS-PAGE, sample buffer was supplemented with 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol. For samples to be analysed by western blotting, proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon transfer membrane (Merck Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% (w/v) dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation with the indicated primary antibody for 1–16 h.

Proteins were digested in gel and the tryptic peptides were eluted for analysis using an Orbitrap XL (Thermo) coupled to a NanoAcquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (Waters, UK). Peptides were eluted using a gradient rising from 8% to 25% acetonitrile (MeCN) for 27 min and 40% MeCN for 35 min. Mass spectra were acquired at 60,000 fwhm at between 300 and 2000 m/z, with MS/MS spectra acquired by top 6 collision-induced dissociations. Raw files were searched against a human Uniprot database (download 041113, 68,896 entries) using the Mascot search engine, with carbamidomethyl cysteine as a fixed modification and acetyl N-terminus and oxidised methionine as variable modifications. Scaffold (version Scaffold_4.3.2, Proteome Software, Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 90.0% probability. Peptide Probabilities from X! Tandem were assigned by the Scaffold Local false discovery rate algorithm. Peptide Probabilities from Mascot were assigned by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2002</xref>) with Scaffold δ-mass correction. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability.

To measure the peptide dissociation rate, peptide-receptive HLA-A*02:01 was obtained by exposing 500 nM monomeric HLA-A*02:01 complexes to 366-nm light for 20 min at 4°C (‘UV-exposed’ hereafter). UV-exposed HLA-A*02:01 molecules were allowed to bind 17.6 nM of the fluorescent peptide FLPSDC*FPSV overnight at room temperature. Dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was subsequently followed after the addition of 1000-fold molar excess non-labelled NLVPMVATV competitor peptide in the absence or presence of 0.125 µM TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> or TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>. Fluorescence polarisation measurements were taken using an I3x (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with a rhodamine detection cartridge or an Analyst AD (Molecular Devices). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (using the Analyst AD) or 25°C (using the I3x) and used PBS supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine γ-globulin (Sigma-Aldrich) in a volume of 60 µl. Binding of TAMRA-labelled peptides is reported in millipolarisation units (mP) and is obtained from the equation mP = 1000 × (S – G × P) / (S + G × P), where S and P are background subtracted fluorescence count rates (S = polarisation emission filter is parallel to the excitation filter; P = polarisation emission filter is perpendicular to the excitation filter) and G (grating) is an instrument- and assay-dependent factor. To measure the association rate of the peptides, 75 nM HLA-A02:01fos molecules were mixed with 1.5 µM human β2m and exposed to 366-nm UV light at 4°C for 20 min, and then 5.95 nM FLPSDC*FPSV was added in the absence or presence of 0.125 µM TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> or TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup> immediately before fluorescence polarisation measurements were taken. For peptide competition experiments, 75 nM HLA-A02:01fos molecules were mixed with 1.5 µM human β2m and exposed to 366-nm UV light at 4°C for 20 min, and then incubated with 5.95 nM high-affinity peptide FLPSDC*FPSV and various concentrations of the lower-affinity competing peptide NLVPMVATV (0–100 μM) in the presence or absence of 0.0625 µM TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> or TAPBPR<sup>C94A</sup>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Pamela Wearsch (Reviewer #2); Frank Homburg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper describes the association of tapasin binding protein, related (TAPBPR), a currently characterized peptide editor/chaperone, with UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glycosyltransferase (UGT1), an enzyme involved in quality control of partially folded molecules in the secretory pathway. The relevance to antigen presentation via the MHC-I pathway is high, and the current paper adds important information to the development of mechanistic models for the role of TAPBPR in the context of the classical tapasin-containing peptide loading complex (PLC). The role of an unpaired cysteine 94 in TAPBPR is established although the mechanism of its contribution remains unclear. This result forms the basis of an evolving model for the function of TAPBPR as it contributes to post-endoplasmic reticulum editing for high affinity peptides. The work identifies a novel molecular interaction, documents this extensively with biochemical and cell biological evidence, and uses this to develop a sensible mechanistic model. The observations are established by pull-down experiments in cells and evaluation of knock down and overexpressing cell lines, and uses recombinant proteins to further substantiate the observations.</p><p>Nevertheless, a number of shortcomings were noted, ranging from minor experimental details, to lack of adequate statistical analysis, to aspects that may require additional experimentation, to concerns about the basis and the validity of the final model.</p><p>Note that Reviewer #2 offers considerable criticism of the model, and appropriate rebuttal or modification of the model should be entertained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The work is done well, taking advantage of unique reagents, but my major concern is that a mechanistic explanation for the role of C94 is not clear, and is not sufficiently addressed in Discussion. In addition, a number of nagging details in the description of the reagents, in the referencing, and in experimental controls should be addressed. One issue not dealt with in the Discussion or the model is the quantitative relationships of tapasin/MHC interaction as compared with TAPBPR interaction and the relative levels of expression of tapasin and TAPBPR in different compartments and different tissues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports a novel interaction between TAPBPR and UGT1 and provides mechanistic explanations for previously unexplained phenomena regarding the function of TAPBPR in antigen processing. Overall, the experiments are well-designed and executed, and the manuscript is well-written. Although I generally agree with the interpretation of the data in the Results section, I have significant questions and concerns about the model (Figure 6) that is presented in the Discussion section. I acknowledge the challenge of incorporating decades of research into a model, but believe that we can generate one that is more simplistic and comprehensive of past and present data.</p><p>Issues regarding the model:</p><p>The difference in tapasin-dependence for HLA-A vs HLA-B alleles is a highly relevant issue, but largely ignored. HLA-A molecules are not tapasin-dependent (Greenwood 1994) and do not necessarily interact with the PLC prior to deglucosylation by GLSII (step 1). Self-loaded MHC molecules are therefore an alternate entry point into the &quot;TAPBPR cycle&quot;. This is supported by the finding that the TAPBPR-MHC interaction is increased in the absence of tapasin (Boyle 2013). Furthermore, self-loaded HLA-A molecules are more likely to be TAPBPR substrates than PLC-loaded HLA-A molecules.</p><p>The major flaw (and constraint) of this model is the authors' view that tapasin and TAPBPR are functionally equivalent in regards to peptide editing.</p><p>A) If true, what would determine whether TAPBPR association with HLA-A leads to step 4 (peptide exchange) vs. step 5 (peptide displacement and UGT1 association)? If true, why would a redundancy of tapasin/TAPBPR function be energetically favorable? In other words, why go through additional steps of UGT1 reglucosylation and PLC association (steps 5 and 6) if TAPBPR can do the same thing all by itself (step 4)?</p><p>B) Keeping in mind the number of studies on tapasin vs. TAPBPR, I think it's premature to conclude that their functional activities are identical. Although I would agree that TAPBPR stabilizes HLA-A molecules and promotes the displacement of peptides, the &quot;selectivity&quot; of TAPBPR activity has yet to be convincingly demonstrated (Hermann 2015, Morozov 2016, this study). More comprehensive studies are needed to directly compare tapasin and TAPBPR activities using a broader panel of low and high affinity peptides.</p><p>C) Another oversight of this model (and past studies of TAPBPR) is the peptide supply. Immunofluorescence and EndoH experiments (Boyle 2013) show that TABPBR is not exclusively localized to the ER. Even within the ER, the peptide supply may be significantly higher near TAP. Thus, the localization of TAPBPR vs. tapasin may have a profound effect on their potential to edit the peptide repertoire in vivo.</p><p>Revised model:</p><p>I propose an alternative model for discussion with the authors and reviewers.</p><p>1) Some HLA-A molecules assemble with peptides independently of the PLC. Of these, some bind high affinity peptides and some bind suboptimal peptides.</p><p>2) HLA-A molecules that have bypassed the PLC are more rapidly trimmed by GlsII because the glycan is not &quot;protected&quot; by calreticulin. Self-loading may have occurred before or after GlsII trimming. (I do not recall evidence that would support one option vs. the other).</p><p>3) HLA-A molecules loaded with high affinity peptides pass quality control and do not interact with TAPBPR.</p><p>4) HLA-A molecules loaded with suboptimal peptides associate with TAPBPR in the ER or cis-Golgi.</p><p>5) Due to differences in TAPBPR vs. tapasin activity and/or the peptide supply, TAPBPR promotes the dissociation of the suboptimal ligand, but does not load a high affinity peptide.</p><p>6) Instead, TAPBPR improves the efficiency of reglucosylation by recruiting UGT1. Another advantage of the TAPBPR interaction is that HLA-A molecules are stabilized before and during the association with UGT1.</p><p>7) An event triggers the dissociation of UGT1 and TAPBPR from reglucosylated HLA-A, allowing it to engage with the PLC and load high affinity peptides. (Insight into the dissociation step using TAPBPR-reconstituted cells is limited since TAPBPR overexpression shifts the equilibrium towards HLA-A/TAPBPR association and favors retention in the ER).</p><p>This model explains</p><p>A) Preferential binding of HLA-A allomorphs by TAPBPR since HLA-B alleles are less stable and less likely to self-load in the ER.</p><p>B) Related and synergistic, but non-identical functions of TAPBPR and tapasin in quality control.</p><p>C) – Effect of tapasin-deficiency vs. TAPBPR-deficiency on MHC class I surface expression and stability.</p><p>Although the revised model suggests a secondary role for TAPBPR in quality control, it does not undermine the novelty or significance of this manuscript! In fact, I think it would be very interesting to discuss how the same region of tapasin and TAPBPR (N-term loop with C95 or C94) has evolved to co-opt components of ER glycan chaperone system (i.e., ERp57/ calreticulin and UGT1) to improve the stability of MHC class I complexes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Boyle and colleagues present interesting and novel data that identify the glucosyltransferase UGT1 as interaction partner for the MHC-I chaperone TAPBPR which plays, in addition to tapasin, a role in the process of optimizing MHC-I peptide ligands, however, is not part of the TAP-associated peptide loading complex. It is convincingly shown that a conserved, presumably unpaired cysteine residue (C94) in TAPBPR is essential for the association of UGT1, while no evidence for the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds (at least with heterologous molecules of appreciable molecular weight) involving C94 is found. TAPBPR[C94A] seems to be as stable as WT TAPBPR. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the TAPBPR C94A mutation negatively influences the re-glucosylation and association with TAP1 and tapasin of HLA-A*6802 molecules, but apparently not of HLA-B*1503 molecules. Very interestingly, the peptide ligandomes of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-B*1503 molecules are shown to be specifically influenced by either TAPBPR WT of TAPBPR[C94A]. Only for HLA-A*6802 molecules, TAPBPR WT improved the loading with peptides containing classic anchors. On the other hand, the C94A mutation does not seem to reduce the capacity of TAPBPR to bind MHC-I.</p><p>The shown experiments are convincing and carefully controlled. Conclusions are valid and discussed concisely and with expertise, however, a number of important points need to be addressed satisfactorily.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>Figure 1B: In TAPBPR precipitates from KBM-7 cells, the MHC-I WB band seems to show a clearly increased intensity in the tapasin KO situation, while this not obvious (by visual inspection) in TAPBPR precipitates from HeLa/tapasin KO cells (Figure 1A). This result may suggest competition between tapasin and TAPBPR for MHC-I binding. Please comment whether this has been more often in independent experiments, and if yes, discuss the finding. Is co-IP of MHC-I by tapasin vice versa increased after TAPBPR knock-down? Include an MHC-I blot in Figure 1C.</p><p>Figure 2E: In the size exclusion chromatography experiment, His-tagged TAPBPR WT should be compared with TAPBPR[C94A] side by side. In the SDS-PAGE insert, elution fractions should be labelled and Mw markers indicated.</p><p>Figure 3A: Indicate molecular weight markers.</p><p>Figure 4C: TAPBPR WT must be included in this peptide competition experiment.</p><p>Figure 4D: Show levels of TAPBPR WT and C94A in transfected HeLa/TAPBPR KO cells by Western blot.</p><p>Figure 4F: Spell out the classic peptide anchors that were analysed in HLA-A*6802 and HLA-B*1503 ligands.</p><p>Figure 4E-F: Can anything be said about the distribution of auxiliary anchors and preferred residues in positions other than P2 and P-Omega in peptides unique to TAPBPR WT and C94A?</p><p>Figure 5: Show densitometric analyses of the 2 bands representing MHC-I allomorphs. It seems that TAPBPR WT also somewhat increases the pulldown of HLA-B*1503 by GST-CRTwt. Where are HLA-C and HLA-E allomorphs expected to run?</p><p>Discussion, third paragraph, correct: “[…]but now it transpires[…]”</p><p>It is striking that both TAPBPR WT and C94A expression result in a significant downregulation of surface-expressed HLA-A*6802 and B*15:03 allomorphs (Figure 4D) although only A*6802 seems to have augmented peptide editing upon UGT1-mediated re-glucosylation. This is counterintuitive since the presence of the peptide editor TAPBPR should improve the overall stability of MHC-I molecules and thereby increase cell surface steady-state levels (NB: tapasin KO but not overexpression has previously been associated with reduced MHC-I cell surface levels). First experiments must be performed that address the fate of A68 and B15 in the secretory route in the absence of TABPBR and in the presence of TAPBPR WT and C94A. Since TAPBPR has no ER retention signal it is possible that the pulldown with exogenous CRT reflects a mixture of ER and post-ER MHC-I molecules. Figure 5A should include a digestion with Endo H before WB for MHC-I. Measuring the turnover of a cohort of cell-surface biotinylated MHC-I molecules in the absence of TABPBR and in the presence of TAPBPR WT and C94A would be another informative approach to clarify the effects of TAPBR-mediated peptide editing and resulting changes in the stability of MHC-I.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23049.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The work is done well, taking advantage of unique reagents, but my major concern is that a mechanistic explanation for the role of C94 is not clear, and is not sufficiently addressed in Discussion.

However, this reviewer has raised a number of very important points that we were unaware of and which we did not take into consideration when generation our initial working model, particularly regarding the point that selfloaded MHC class I molecules will be deglucosulated by GLSII in a PLC-independent manner. We thank reviewer 3 for raising this highly relevant point.

Although both molecules can function as peptide editors in vivo, we feel that the distinct cellular environment these two chaperones function in, particularly in regard to peptide available, will strongly influence whether the final outcome of these chaperone on MHC class I is peptide loading or peptide dissociation. We have made a number of changes to the Introduction and the Discussion to reflect that tapasin and TAPBPR are not functionally equivalent.

However, there is one particular point made by this reviewer which we do not feel we have data to strongly support; that TAPBPR works only on HLA-A and not HLA-B. While it is true that TAPBPR does appear to bind more strongly to HLA-A, in a cellular environment TAPBPR also affects the peptide repertoire presented on HLA-B. Therefore, we do not feel comfortable to make such a strong distinction between HLA-A and HLA-B as has been suggested. However, we are very grateful for the comments received, particularly the inclusion of self-loaded MHC class I molecule, and agree with the suggestion that TAPBPR is likely to have a more profound effect on the tapasin-independent/self-loading MHC class I molecules and have incorporated this into our working model.</p><p><italic>Although the revised model suggests a secondary role for TAPBPR in quality control, it does not undermine the novelty or significance of this manuscript!

However, in the absence of TAPBPR, the interaction between MHC class I and tapasin did not significantly increase. Our finding here in both Figure 1B and 1A are consistent with these previously published findings. Although in Figure 1A the amount of MHC class I bound to TAPBPR in tapasin-deficient HeLa-M cells does not appear to increase compared to the tapasin-competent HeLa-M cells, western blot analysis on the lysates of these two cell lines reveals a significant loss of MHC class I molecules expression in the absence of tapasin. Therefore, there is a relative increase in the amount of MHC class I bound to TAPBPR in the absence of tapasin. We have included some additional text in the Results section and in the figure legend to this effect.</p><p>As requested we have also included a MHC class I blot in Figure 1C.</p><p><italic>Figure 2E: In the size exclusion chromatography experiment, His-tagged TAPBPR WT should be compared with TAPBPR[C94A] side by side.

However, as this analysis has been performed on film, it is not appropriate for accurate quantification due to the signals not necessarily being on a linear scale and/or saturated as can be seen with TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> samples. Therefore to further valid the increased reglucosylation of HLA-A68 on the presence of TAPBPR<sup>WT</sup> we have performed accurate quantitative analysis on tapasin immunoprecipitation in Figure 6C. In the pulldowns with GST-CRT we agree this is a slight increase in HLA-B15 associated suggesting the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex can reglucosylate HLA-B15, but the dominant change appears with HLA-A68. Furthermore, pulldown on endogenous tapasin suggests WT-TAPBPR strongly influences HLA-A68 over HLA-B15 and there is no obvious increase in HLA-B15 association with the PLC in this situation. Regarding HLA-E and –C, we have not specifically taken these into account mainly due to their lower expression relative to HLA-A and -B. Furthermore, our evidence to date suggests TAPBPR does not associate with HLA-E in HeLa cells.</p><p><italic>Discussion, third paragraph, correct: “[…] but now it transpires[…]”</italic> </p><p>Transpires has been changed to appears.</p><p><italic>It is striking that both TAPBPR WT and C94A expression result in a significant downregulation of surface-expressed HLA-A*6802 and B*15:03 allomorphs (Figure 4D) although only A*6802 seems to have augmented peptide editing upon UGT1-mediated re-glucosylation. This is counterintuitive since the presence of the peptide editor TAPBPR should improve the overall stability of MHC-I molecules and thereby increase cell surface steady-state levels (NB: tapasin KO but not overexpression has previously been associated with reduced MHC-I cell surface levels). First experiments must be performed that address the fate of A68 and B15 in the secretory route in the absence of TABPBR and in the presence of TAPBPR WT and C94A. Since TAPBPR has no ER retention signal it is possible that the pulldown with exogenous CRT reflects a mixture of ER and post-ER MHC-I molecules. Figure 5A should include a digestion with Endo H before WB for MHC-I. Measuring the turnover of a cohort of cell-surface biotinylated MHC-I molecules in the absence of TABPBR and in the presence of TAPBPR WT and C94A would be another informative approach to clarify the effects of TAPBR-mediated peptide editing and resulting changes in the stability of MHC-I.</italic> </p><p>As requested we have included and Endo-H digest on the exogenous CRT pulldowns. This has revealed that the MHC class I molecule which interact with the exogenous CRT are entirely Endo H sensitive and therefore, the effect of the TAPBPR:UGT1 complex on the reglucosylation of MHC class I is occurring before the medial-Golgi. This data can be found in Figure 6—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>To address the resulting changes in the stability of MHC class I, we have previously addressed the effect of TAPBPR mediated editing in the presence and absence of TAPBPR in our previous publication in <italic>eLife</italic> (Hermann et al. 2015). However we have provided some additional data to demonstrate the change in stability of HLA-A68 in cell expressing C94A compared to WT-TAPBPR. We have found in cells expressing C94A-TAPBPR HLA-A68 surface expression can be rescue by addition of exogenous peptide, suggesting there is a pool of peptide-receptive HLA-A68 released to the surface in these cells. Furthermore, we can recreate this phenotype on WT-TAPBPR expressing cells by depleting shUGT1 expression. We hope you find this attempt to address your query is satisfactory and informative. Unfortunately, we were unable to measure with turnover of cell surface biotinylated in the time-frame permitted for revisions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
