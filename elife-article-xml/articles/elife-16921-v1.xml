Detailed analyses indicate this effect is related to an elevated electric field (Δ<italic>ψ</italic>) component of the <italic>pmf</italic>, rather than lumen acidification, which <italic>in vivo</italic> increased PSII charge recombination rates, producing singlet oxygen and subsequent photodamage. The effects are seen even in wild type plants, especially under fluctuating illumination, suggesting that Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced photodamage represents a previously unrecognized limiting factor for plant productivity under dynamic environmental conditions seen in the field.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16921.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16921.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>proton motive force</kwd><kwd>photoinhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006151</institution-id><institution>Basic Energy Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-91ER20021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Geoffry A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanazawa</surname><given-names>Atsuko</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohzuma</surname><given-names>Kaori</given-names></name><name><surname>Froehlich</surname><given-names>John E</given-names></name><name><surname>Satoh-Cruz</surname><given-names>Mio</given-names></name><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K002627/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>A William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wolfson Research Merit Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>A William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Michigan State University Center for Advanced Algal and Plant Phenotyping</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Michigan State University AgBioResearch</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Storage of solar energy in the thylakoid electrical field by photosynthesis in vivo can substantially destabilize charge-separated states in photosystem II, leading to singlet oxygen production and photodamage, contributing to loss of productivity, especially under fluctuating light experienced in the field.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thylakoid proton motive force (<italic>pmf</italic>), the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons generated during the light reactions of photosynthesis, is a fundamental entity of bioenergetics, coupling light-driven electron transfer reactions to the phosphorylation of ADP via the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avenson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer and Evans, 2011</xref>). In oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy is captured by pigments in light-harvesting complexes and transferred to a subset of chlorophylls in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), where it drives the extraction of electrons from water and their transfer through redox cofactors to ultimately reduce NADP<sup>+</sup>. The vectorial transfer of electrons across the membrane is tightly coupled with the generation of the <italic>pmf</italic>, composed of both electric field (Δ<italic>ψ</italic>) and pH (ΔpH) gradients.</p><p>In addition to its role in energy conservation, the <italic>pmf</italic> is also critical for feedback regulation of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cruz et al., 2005</xref>). Acidification of the thylakoid lumen activates the photoprotective energy-dependent exciton quenching (q<sub>E</sub>) process, which dissipates excess absorbed light energy in the photosynthetic antenna complexes by the activation of violaxanthin deepoxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demmig-Adams and Adams, 1992</xref>) and protonation of PsbS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Lumen acidification also regulates the oxidation of plastoquinol by the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex, slowing electron transfer from PSII and preventing the accumulation of electrons on PSI, which can otherwise lead to photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nishio and Whitmarsh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hope et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> work has shown that excessive lumen acidification can inactivate PSII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krieger and Weis, 1993</xref>), decrease the stability of plastocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross et al., 1994</xref>) and severely restrict electron flow through the cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>6</sub><italic>f</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 1999</xref>). Taken together, the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence of the susceptibility of photosynthetic components to acidification has led to the proposal that the extent of <italic>pmf</italic> and its partitioning into Δ<italic>ψ</italic> and ΔpH components is regulated to maintain the lumen pH above about 5.8, where it can regulate photoprotection. However, under environmental stresses the regulation of photosynthesis may become overwhelmed, leading to PSII damage, or photoinhibition, from lumen over-acidification, although this has not been shown to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>PSII photoinhibition can be a major contributor to loss of photosynthetic productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raven, 2011</xref>), particularly under rapid fluctuations in environmental conditions experienced in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kulheim et al., 2002</xref>). However, the mechanisms and regulation of photoinhibition remain highly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keren and Krieger-Liszkay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tyystjärvi, 2013</xref>). Though several mechanisms have been proposed for the photodamage process, it is not known which of these operate <italic>in vivo</italic> under diverse environmental conditions. In addition, there are differing views on whether the extent of photoinhibition is governed by the rate of photodamage to PSII or by regulation of PSII repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). Answering these questions is essential to understanding how plants respond to rapidly changing conditions and thus of critical importance to improving plant productivity.</p><p>The extent of the <italic>pmf</italic> can be modulated by altering the light-driven influx of protons into the lumen, i.e. by changing the rates of linear electron flow (LEF) or cyclic electron flow, or the efflux of protons through the ATP synthase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kramer et al., 2004</xref>). This latter mode of regulation is important for co-regulation of the light reactions with downstream metabolic processes. For example, under CO<sub>2</sub> limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanazawa and Kramer, 2002</xref>) as well as during stromal P<sub>i</sub> limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takizawa et al., 2008</xref>) the chloroplast ATP synthase activity is strongly down-regulated, decreasing the proton conductivity (<italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup>) of the thylakoid, leading to buildup of <italic>pmf</italic> and activation of q<sub>E</sub>. Similar decreases in <italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> and increases in <italic>pmf</italic> are seen when ATP synthase protein content is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rott et al., 2011</xref>) or in mutants with an altered ATP synthase γ-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohzuma et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We took advantage of the effects of the ATP synthase on the photosynthetic proton circuit to probe how the <italic>pmf</italic> influences photoinhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>. We constructed a series of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutants, which we termed <italic>minira (mini</italic>mum <italic>r</italic>ecapitulation of <italic>A</italic>TPC2), in which we complemented a γ<sub>1</sub>-subunit (ATPC1) T-DNA knockout line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dal Bosco et al., 2004</xref>) with γ-coding sequences containing site-directed mutations to specifically incorporate amino acid changes around the redox regulatory cysteines present in ATPC2 into ATPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inohara et al., 1991</xref>). Each <italic>minira</italic> line is designated numerically based on amino acid position and independent transformation events; for example <italic>minira</italic> 4–1, <italic>minira</italic> 4–2, and <italic>minira</italic> 4–3 represent three independent transformation events of the same I201V mutation. The <italic>minira</italic> library was originally developed as part of an on-going 'domain swapping' approach to assess functional differences in the two ATPC paralogs in Arabidopsis, ATPC1 and ATPC2, but the <italic>minira</italic> mutants also shows a range of ATP synthase activities useful to the present work. As described below, we also confirmed key aspects of the work using previously characterized ATPC1 tobacco antisense lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rott et al., 2011</xref>). However, variations in ATP synthase suppression in the antisense lines between leaves and plant generations limited their experimental utility. The current mutagenesis approach was preferable as it allowed repeatable analyses of multiple photosynthetic parameters in stable, identical genetic backgrounds within each mutant line.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16921.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>γ-subunit mutations alter photosynthetic proton efflux.</title><p>Sequence alignment of Arabidopsis ATPC1 and ATPC2 regulatory region (<bold>A</bold>).

The increases in q<sub>E</sub> were especially pronounced at higher light intensities on days two and three. These effects can be explained by slowing of proton efflux through the ATP synthase in the mutants that results in increased <italic>pmf</italic> for a given LEF. This is reflected in the higher lumen pH-sensitive q<sub>E</sub> response for a given LEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is strikingly similar to that attributed to ATP synthase regulation in wild type plants during limitations in carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanazawa and Kramer, 2002</xref>) or decreases in ATP synthase content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rott et al., 2011</xref>). The q<sub>E</sub> sensitivities for the mutants remained similar throughout the experiments, i.e. the data for each mutant followed similar curves, implying that the ATP synthase activities were relatively constant within a particular line, consistent with a lack of light-dependent modulation of <italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> that has previously been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avenson et al., 2005</xref>). The extents of q<sub>E</sub> did not exceed about 3.5 units in any of the lines, suggesting that either the lumen pH was restricted to a moderate acidity or that the capacity of the q<sub>E</sub> response was saturated as light intensities increased.</p><p>We also observed a strong correlation between increased q<sub>E</sub> and q<sub>I</sub>, (for quantitative comparisons, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), implying that decreases in ATP synthase activity in the mutants led to not only higher photoprotection but also higher rates of PSII photoinhibition. This result appears counterintuitive, in that we would expect the photoprotective q<sub>E</sub> response to prevent photoinhibition. Particularly striking was the relative loss in q<sub>E</sub> near the peak light intensities on days two and three in the most strongly affected <italic>minira</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The upward spike represents the effect of rapidly increasing the light intensity. The downward spikes seen towards the ends of the traces reflect the transients that occur when the actinic light is switched to the lower light intensity at the end of the fluctuation. A rough estimate of the extent of the Δ<italic>ψ</italic> imposed by the spikes can be obtained by comparing the ECS signals with the calibration and results presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takizawa et al.

It is unlikely that such triplets could be generated in the bulk light harvesting pigments because high NPQ in the mutants will decrease the lifetime of antenna excited states, and chlorophyll triplets generated in light harvesting complexes are efficiently quenched by carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Telfer et al., 2008</xref>). We thus propose that elevated Δ<italic>ψ</italic> induces <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production by accelerating PSII recombination in low <italic>g</italic><sub>H</sub><sup>+</sup> mutants when <italic>pmf</italic> is large. Keren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keren et al., 1997</xref>) suggested that recombination-induced triplet formation could explain the photoinhibitory effects of very low light, when PSII charge recombination is preferred over the forward electron transfer reactions. Our work implies that this type of phenomenon is greatly accelerated by high Δ<italic>ψ</italic>, potentially making it relevant to photosynthesis under growth light conditions.</p><p>The effects of high Δ<italic>ψ</italic> would be expected to alter the rates of PSII recombination through P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> (where P<sup>+</sup> is the oxidized primary chlorophyll donor and Pheo the D1 subunit pheophytin) in an increasing dependence upon the fraction of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>, consistent with the observed correlation between q<sub>I</sub> and q<sub>L</sub> as the light intensity increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To test this relationship, we estimated the recombination rates from S<sub>2</sub>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> through the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> pathway, considering Q<sub>A</sub> redox state (estimated by 1-q<sub>L</sub>) and the expected impact of Δ<italic>ψ</italic> on the equilibrium constant for sharing electrons between Pheo and Q<sub>A</sub> (based on ECS<sub>ss</sub> and the position of Q<sub>A</sub> in the structure relative to the membrane dielectric). The basis of this estimate is described in more detail in Materials and methods. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, we see a positive correlation between q<sub>I</sub> and estimated recombination through P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> over both mutant variants and light intensities, indicating that the combined effects of Δ<italic>ψ</italic> and Q<sub>A</sub> redox state can explain a large fraction of the observed extents of photoinhibition. While it is likely that multiple mechanisms of photoinhibition exist, which may also explain some of the q<sub>I</sub> variation, overall the greatest impact upon photoinhibition under these conditions can be explained by Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-mediated changes in PSII electron recombination.</p><p>The obvious questions are: does Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced photoinhibition occur in wild type plants and if so under what conditions? Photosynthesis is known to be particularly sensitive to rapid fluctuations in light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kulheim et al., 2002</xref>), at least some of this sensitivity is associated with photoinhibition of PSI, especially in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allahverdiyeva et al., 2015</xref>). However, such fluctuations should also result in large transient changes in Δ<italic>ψ</italic>, as the thylakoid membrane has a low electrical capacitance and low permeability to counter-ions, while the lumen and stroma have high proton buffering capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz et al., 2001</xref>). The slow onset of q<sub>E</sub> and other down-regulatory processes in photosynthesis should exacerbate these effects and allow for large fluxes of electrons when light levels are rapidly increased, resulting in large, transient Δ<italic>ψ</italic> 'pulses'.</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced photodamage may contribute to the increased photodamage seen under fluctuating light. To test this possibility, we measured light-driven <italic>pmf</italic> (Δ<italic>ψ</italic> and ΔpH) and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation in wild type Arabidopsis under fluctuating light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, replicating the first 8 hr of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> day three). The initial dark-to-light transition resulted in an immediate, transient 'spike'in Δ<italic>ψ</italic>, even though the light intensity was low (39 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The spike was transient, and decreased to steady-state levels within tens of seconds, as shown in the blue trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. Spikes in Δ<italic>ψ</italic> of similar amplitudes were also seen upon each increase in light at the onset of each fluctuation, though the recovery kinetics tended to be more rapid than those seen at the first dark-light transient. An example of these transients, taken at the transition between 167 and 333 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> is shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). A more complete set of transient kinetics, over the entire course of the experiment is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. The amplitudes of these Δ<italic>ψ</italic> transients were similar to or larger than those seen in the <italic>minira</italic> 3–1 line under constant 300 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> light, which also induced <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation (see red horizontal bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These spikes reflect increases in Δ<italic>ψ</italic> above that already produced by steady-state photosynthesis, so the true extent of Δ<italic>ψ</italic> is likely considerably higher, and based on estimates of the calibration of the ECS signal likely range between 150–260 mV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, wild type plants under constant 300 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> produced much lower Δ<italic>ψ</italic> extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> green bars) and had no detectible <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that even low amplitude light fluctuations are capable of inducing Δ<italic>ψ</italic> large enough to produce <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and PSII photodamage. Supporting this interpretation, wild type leaves under these fluctuating light conditions produced substantial amounts of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> during the first hour of fluctuating conditions compared to higher intensity, but constant illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>The above results lead us to conclude that fluctuating light likely induces strong effects through Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced recombination reactions in PSII (see below for considerations of potential contributions to PSI). In addition to direct damage to the enzymes of photosynthesis, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> can also activate plant light stress-related gene expression and programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a possible physiological linkage between <italic>pmf</italic>-enhanced recombination and plant regulatory pathways that may result in long-term acclimation to fluctuating light.</p><p>At a mechanistic level, we propose that imposing a large Δ<italic>ψ</italic> across the PSII complex will decrease the standard free energy gap between the vectorial electron transfer steps and thus the back-reaction will be accelerated in competition with forward (energy-storing) reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Grooth and van Gorkom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vos et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is known that decreasing the energy gap between Pheo and Q<sub>A</sub> favors recombination from P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> via Pheo<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Grooth and van Gorkom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>) rather than directly from Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> to P<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krieger-Liszkay and Rutherford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>).

The red and blue arrows indicate the Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced changes in the equilibrium constant for the sharing of electrons (−) between Q<sub>A</sub> and Pheo, and electron holes (+) among P<sup>+</sup> and the oxygen evolving complex. Excitation of PSII by light leads to formation of excited chlorophyll states (P*), the excitation is shared over the 4 chlorophylls and the 2 pheophytins. Charge separation occurs between more than one pair of pigments, so at short times the situation is not well defined, but Chl<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Pheo <sub>D1</sub><sup>−</sup> appears to be the dominant radical pair. Secondary electron transfer events occur forming P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Pheo<sub>D1</sub><sup>−</sup>, the second radical pair, which is present in nearly all centers. This radical pair is stabilized by electron transfer from Pheo<sup>−</sup> to Q<sub>A</sub> forming P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. This radical pair is further stabilized by electron transfer from D1Tyr161 (TyrZ) forming a neutral tyrosyl radical, which oxidizes the Mn cluster of the oxygen evolving complex to form the state S<sub>n+1</sub>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. Finally, Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> reduces Q<sub>B</sub> to form S<sub>n+1</sub>Q<sub>B</sub><sup>-</sup>. Upon a second PSII turnover the double reduced and protonated Q<sub>B</sub> plastohydroquinone becomes protonated and is exchanged with an oxidized plastoquinone from the membrane pool (black arrows). The illustration was based on crystal structure 3WU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Umena et al., 2011</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) The charge separation states described above are unstable and recombination competes with the energy-storing reactions. When P<sub>D1</sub><sup>+</sup> is present, recombination reactions can occur by several pathways as indicated by the dashed lines: (1) direct electron transfer from Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> to P<sup>+</sup> (R1); (2) by the back reaction to form the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> state, which can then recombine directly (R2) or, (3) when the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> radical pair is present as a triplet state, <sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup>], the dominant state when formed by the back-reaction, <sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup>] charge recombination forms <sup>3</sup>P (R3), a long lived chlorophyll triplet that can easily interact with O<sub>2</sub> to form <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>; (4) complete reversal of electron transfer can also occur, repopulating P* (R4), which can return to the ground state by emitting fluorescence (luminescence) or heat. Route 3, the triplet generating pathway, is the dominant recombination route in fully functional PSII. For simplicity the <sup>3</sup>[P<sup>+</sup>Phe<sup>-</sup>] is not distinguised from the singlet form in this scheme. A Δ<italic>ψ</italic> across the membrane should destabilize P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> relative to the other states (see dotted blue lines), affecting the rates of reactions indicated in the green versus red. A Δ<italic>ψ</italic> across the membrane should also destabilize P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup>, but because of the smaller dielectric span across the membrane, to a lesser extent than P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. Thus, the buildup of Δ<italic>ψ</italic> should shift the equilibrium constant for sharing electrons between Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> and Pheo, favoring the formation of Pheo<sup>−</sup> and thus increasing the rate of recombination through R3 (as well as the R2 and R4), resulting in increased production of <sup>3</sup>P and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Destabilization of P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> will also increase the driving force for P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> recombination via R1, however this recombination is already driven by 1.4eV and it is thus likely to be in the Marcus inverted region. Thus increasing the driving force will slow recombination by this route.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16921.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16921.039</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16921-fig8-v1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This proposed mechanism of Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-mediated photoinhibition has broad implications for the energy limitations of photosynthesis. Although the two components of <italic>pmf</italic> are energetically equivalent for driving ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hangarter and Good, 1982</xref>), they have distinct effects on the regulation of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finazzi et al., 2015</xref>).

We demonstrate here another important constraint on this balance: the avoidance of photodamage caused by recombination reactions in PSII, and this may explain the need for complex ion balancing systems in chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kunz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The effect of Δ<italic>ψ</italic> on recombination and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production may, at least in part, explain the severe effects of fluctuating light on photosynthesis, and thus could constitute a significant limitation to photosynthetic productivity. In the absence of a large Δ<italic>ψ</italic>, the energy gap between the P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup> and P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> appears to be sufficient to keep detrimental recombination to a manageable level when the usual regulatory mechanisms are functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>). During photosynthesis, and especially under fluctuating light, though, the energy gaps between the photo-generated radical pairs vary dynamically under the influence of the <italic>pmf</italic>, so that high Δ<italic>ψ</italic> renders the charge-separated states in the photosystems considerably less stable. The Δ<italic>ψ</italic> is also expected to influence the trap depth (i.e. the energy level between P<sup>*</sup> and the first radical pair(s), the most relevant probably being P<sup>+</sup>Pheo<sup>−</sup>) and this could potentially affect the quantum yield of charge separation and the yield of radiative recombination (luminescence).</p><p>Transthylakoid electric fields also influence recombination reactions in PSI reaction centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Gorkom, 1996</xref>). It is thought that P<sub>700</sub> triplet formation is minimized in PSI by the presence of the higher potential quinone in PsaA, making this side of the reaction center the safe charge recombination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>). In light of the present findings, it is worth considering whether a transiently large Δ<italic>ψ</italic> could make this protective mechanism less efficient, though this question has yet to be addressed experimentally.</p><p>Over evolutionary time scales, the Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-effect may have constrained other bioenergetics features of photosynthesis. It has long been known that oxygenic photosynthesis is limited, in most organisms, to wavelength ranges shorter than about 700 nm (the 'red limit'), resulting in the loss of a large fraction of the light energy hitting the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankenship et al., 2011</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gust et al., 2008</xref>) proposed that the red limit may be the result of certain limitations imposed in part by key biochemical properties of life (e.g. the properties of energy storage molecules NAD(P)H and ATP, the use of certain biochemical pathways, etc.) that evolved before the advent of photosynthesis. Milo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milo, 2009</xref>) came to a different conclusion based on estimates of the theoretical wavelength dependence of energy conversion efficiency for plant photosynthesis, based on the Shockley and Queisser equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shockley and Queisser, 1961</xref>). The maximum efficiency was about 700 nm, similar to the red limit of oxygenic photosynthesis, suggesting that evolution has selected for photosynthetic energetics based on this fundamental limit, rather than any biological imperative. However, the predicted wavelength-dependence of the energy efficiency is very broad, with only about a 15% decrease from the peak at wavelengths out to 800 nm, far beyond the red limit, even in organisms with red-shifted reaction centers. Marosvolgyi and van Gorkom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marosvolgyi and van Gorkom, 2010</xref>) drew a similar conclusion but with additional restraints and suggested a narrower maximum more closely overlapping with the red absorption of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>.</p><p>Rutherford et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>) took a different view based on an analysis of the bioenergetics of reaction centers. They noted that PSII was in a uniquely difficult situation in energy terms: (1) it does multi-electron chemistry (at both sides of the reaction center) and so cannot prevent back reactions by kinetic control, (2) it has a very energy demanding reaction to do: water oxidation and quinone reduction with a ∆E ~920 meV in functional conditions, and requires a significant over-potential not just for attaining a high quantum yield of photochemistry but also for achieving water oxidation and quinol release, and (3) its chlorophyll cation chemistry is uniquely oxidizing and thus it cannot use carotenoids to protect itself from chlorophyll triplet formation at the heart of the reaction center. This situation means that unlike other type-II reaction centers, PSII is unable to prevent electrons from the bound semiquinones getting back to the Pheo and then recombining with P<sup>+</sup> and forming <sup>3</sup>P.</p><p>This lack of energy 'headroom' was seen not only as a major factor in PS II’s susceptibility to photodamage but also as a reason why oxygenic photosynthesis is pinned to chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> photochemistry at around 680 nm as the red limit. The existence of efficient oxygenic photosynthesis at longer wavelengths seemed to question that view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miyashita et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuhl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behrendt et al., 2015</xref>). However, it was pointed out that these species seem to exist in very stable environments that have very little variation in light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotton et al., 2015</xref>). Under such a narrow range of illumination conditions it is not unreasonable that less energy 'headroom' is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Clearly, these specific energy limitations of PSII will be exacerbated by spikes in the Δ<italic>ψ</italic> reported here. Indeed, it seems reasonable to suggest that the existing 'energy headroom' postulated in normal chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>-containing PSII, while too small to avoid photodamage altogether, exists quite specifically to mitigate the extra photodamage from back-reactions enhanced by spikes in Δ<italic>ψ</italic> due to variable light intensities. In this way, the extent of the variable light-induced Δ<italic>ψ</italic> may be considered to contribute to the position of the red limit of oxygenic photosynthesis.</p><p>The need to prevent Δ<italic>ψ</italic>-induced recombination may also have guided the evolution of other photosynthetic components. Recent mechanistic models of the ATP synthase suggest that the ratio of protons passed through the ATP synthase per ATP synthesized depends on the number of subunits in the <italic>c</italic>-ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silverstein, 2014</xref>).

The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AtpC1 gene was excised from binary vector pSex001 as a SmaI/XbaI fragment and cloned into SmaI/XbaI digested pBluescript plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pDA15. The mutations were introduced into ATPC1 using a combination of three approaches.</p><p>The first approach used an adaptor ligation strategy. Oligonucleotides were designed to introduce desired mutations. Adaptors representing the 5’ and 3’ strand of DNA targeting specific mutations were obtained independently from Sigma Aldrich. A total of 5 ml of each oligonucleotide pair (10 mM) were mixed and denatured at 95°C for 10 min in a boiling water bath. The oligonucleotides were allowed to reach room temperature over two hours in the water bath allowing for efficient annealing of complementary strands. The adaptors thus obtained were utilized for adaptor ligation.</p><p>The target region from ATPC1 cDNA was removed using BglII/HpaI restriction enzymes. The larger linearized backbone of pDA15 was used for ligation with the adaptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The resultant vector was double digested with SmaI and XbaI to excise the mutated ATPC1 gene, which was then ligated back into the SmaI/XbaI digested binary vector, pSex001.</p><p>A second set of mutations was introduced by first digesting pDA15 with BglII followed by a partial digestion with TatI. The resulting plasmid backbone was used for ligation with the adaptors having the desired mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). As in the first adaptor ligation-mediated mutagenesis approach, the resultant vector was double digested with SmaI and XbaI to excise the respective mutated atpC1 gene and ligated into SmaI/XbaI digested binary vector, pSex001.</p><p>A second mutagenesis strategy used splicing by overlap extension (SOE) PCR. For each desired mutation, two sets of primers were designed to produce two overlapping fragments during amplification of atpC1 from pDA15 such that the mutation was generated in the region of overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). The two fragments were mixed together and the resulting DNA solution was used as a template for a subsequent PCR using primers that amplify the complete AtpC1 gene (DMP 45 and DMP 46). This led to the amplification of the entire atpC1 gene with the desired mutation. The mutated atpC1 was digested with SmaI and XbaI and was sub-cloned into SmaI/XbaI digested pSex001.</p><p>The third mutagenesis approach involved swapping of target domains (delete swaps) using synthetic gene fragments synthesized at GenScript USA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The synthetic gene was used to replace the ATPC1 redox regulatory domain in the native gene. To swap the domains, pDA15 was digested with BsrGI and XbaI to remove the native domain and ligated with the synthetic fragment derived from the synthetic gene construct after digestion with BsrGI and XbaI. To introduce a synthetic gene with a single nucleotide mutation, the synthetic gene construct for <italic>minira</italic> 3 and pDA15 were double digested with BsrGI and XbaI and the synthetic BsrGI/XbaI fragment with the mutation was ligated into pDA15 where the original BsrGI/XbaI fragment had been removed The resultant intermediate plasmid was digested with SmaI/XbaI to obtain the gene with swapped C domain. This gene was then sub-cloned into SmaI/XbaI digested pSex001. All of the introduced mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of individual plasmids.</p><p>Following successful mutagenesis, <italic>minira</italic> constructs were mobilized into the binary vector pSEX001-VS under control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Robert Burnap (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Kris Niyogi as the Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript deals with mechanisms of photoinhibition of photosystem II in vivo, which are still unresolved despite decades of study. The authors use a series of <italic>Arabidopsis &quot;minira</italic>&quot; mutants affecting the chloroplast ATP synthase γ subunit to show an unexpected relationship between the electric field (<italic>Δψ</italic>) component of the <italic>pmf</italic> and q<sub>I</sub> (as a measure of photodamage to PSII). These results suggest a novel mechanism of PSII photoinhibition that involves an effect on PSII charge recombination, which in turn might result in increased singlet oxygen production. The data showing a correlation between <italic>Δψ</italic> and q<sub>I</sub> are compelling and convincing, but the presentation and discussion of the subsequent results could be improved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: The authors note that the present results go against the previous ideas that lumen acidification (not <italic>Δψ</italic>) was a significant cause of photoinhibition. However, we are not aware of experiments demonstrating that lumen acidification is a cause of photoinhibition in leaves, although the supposition can be found frequently in the literature. Were there experiments that showed acidification as a cause in vivo? If so, the reference needs to be more clearly cited. If not, then references to the proposition or the circumstantial evidence are more appropriate.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> needs a loading control to enable comparison of the expression levels of ATPC1 mutant proteins in different <italic>minira</italic> lines.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the &quot;decreased levels of D1 protein&quot; mentioned in the text are not obvious and convincing from the single immunoblot shown in the figure. In addition to showing a representative blot, these data for lincomycin-treated leaves (and the water-treated control) should be plotted in a format like the other data in this figure, and the number of biological replicates should be indicated in the legend. These data are important to demonstrate that the increase in q<sub>I</sub> is indeed related to D1 photodamage rather than a type of sustained non-photochemical quenching.</p><p>4) Concerning <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors state that this shows that there is no correlation between the extent of PSII damage (q<sub>I</sub>) and Q<sub>A</sub> redox state (q<sub>L</sub>) – they show three sub-figures, one for each light intensity used. If taken together (i.e., if the data had been plotted in one figure), would the relationship between q<sub>L</sub> and q<sub>I</sub> have much worse than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, which shows the relationship between <italic>Δψ</italic> and q<sub>I</sub>? This should be shown. The coexistence of two damage mechanisms would not be a surprise or a problem, nor would the entanglement of Q<sub>A</sub> redox state on the likelihood of voltage-driven backreaction-induced damage.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors switch from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to spinach thylakoids, although the text and legend indicate that the ECS signal is similar to that seen in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. For consistency, why was this experiment not performed with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> thylakoids? Also, what is the evidence that the <italic>pmf</italic> is &quot;stored almost exclusively as <italic>Δψ</italic>&quot;? (There is no gramicidin or valinomycin treatment shown in panel B.)</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that SOSG does not appear to be in chloroplasts, so this raises a question about the origin of the singlet oxygen that is being detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Given the very short lifetime of singlet oxygen, it seems unlikely that it could diffuse from a site of generation in the PSII reaction centers in thylakoids, through the stroma and across the double envelope membrane of the chloroplast to react with SOSG in the cytosol. Also, how quantitative are the measurements of singlet oxygen using SOSG? A very recent review of this topic (Koh and Fluhr 2016 Plant Signal Behav, in press subsequent to submission of this manuscript) indicates that one should be cautious about quantification using SOSG. Some discussion of the limitations of this probe seems warranted.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Limitations to photosynthesis by proton motive force-induced photosystem II photodamage&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin as the Senior editor and a Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) A loading control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is still needed. We apologize for not being clear about this essential revision in the previous decision letter. What is needed is not a dilution series of the wild type, which was already included in the figure, but additional panels showing that each lane of the blots was loaded with an equal amount of protein. This control is necessary to compare the expression level of ATPB in the different <italic>minira</italic> lines. This can be done by probing the blots with an antibody recognizing an unrelated protein whose level is the same in all lines, or at a minimum by showing the Coomassie-stained gels (as was done in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or Ponceau-stained blots to demonstrate equal protein loading of the lanes.</p><p>2) As requested, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> was changed to a graph based on biological replicates, however from the error bars it is not clear that the difference between <italic>minira</italic> 3-1 and the wild type is significant. Statistical analysis of these data is needed. Also, the authors might want to consider showing these data in a line graph instead of a bar graph, for consistency with the corresponding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p>3) The response to essential revision #6 in the previous decision letter was not completely clear. In their response, the authors state that &quot;The localization of SOSG under a confocal microscope can generate SOSG fluorescence due to the intense laser light used to excite the dye, and therefore would not be useful in our understanding of physiological <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation.&quot; If this is the case, then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> should be omitted from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16921.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Introduction, second paragraph: The authors note that the present results go against the previous ideas that lumen acidification (not Δψ) was a significant cause of photoinhibition.

Indeed, testing this hypothesis was one of the motivations for the current study. We have clarified this point in the text (see Introduction, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> needs a loading control to enable comparison of the expression levels of ATPC1 mutant proteins in different minira lines.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> contains a loading control, outlined and labeled as Ws-2, with the corresponding values of 100%, 50%, and 25% shown above the bands for comparison of wild-type (Ws-2) relative content with the <italic>minira</italic> mutants. As the number of mutant lines analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> required the use of multiple gels, loading controls were run on each gel to ensure that differences in development between gels would not be a factor.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the &quot;decreased levels of D1 protein&quot; mentioned in the text are not obvious and convincing from the single immunoblot shown in the figure.

These data are important to demonstrate that the increase in q<sub>I</sub> is indeed related to D1 photodamage rather than a type of sustained non-photochemical quenching.</italic> </p><p>We have updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to include a graph of quantified D1 protein levels from multiple biological experiments of leaves treated with lincomycin. While differences between individual leaves and western blots show some variation, the <italic>minira</italic> 3-1 D1 protein levels decrease faster than wild-type leaves under the same conditions as the other data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, confirming that the photoinhibition phenotypes observed correspond to damage to PSII rather than sustained PSII quenching.</p><p><italic>4) Concerning <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors state that this shows that there is no correlation between the extent of PSII damage (q<sub>I</sub>) and Q<sub>A</sub> redox state (q<sub>L</sub>) – they show three sub-figures, one for each light intensity used. If taken together (i.e., if the data had been plotted in one figure), would the relationship between q<sub>L</sub> and q<sub>I</sub> have much worse than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, which shows the relationship between Δψ and q<sub>I</sub>? This should be shown. The coexistence of two damage mechanisms would not be a surprise or a problem, nor would the entanglement of Q<sub>A</sub> redox state on the likelihood of voltage-driven backreaction-induced damage.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comment on this data and have taken the opportunity to expand our discussion about the potential influence of the Q<sub>A</sub> redox state on photoinhibition and recombination rates.</p><p>First, in preparing the manuscript, we plotted the data in the three panel view to allow the readers to disentangle light intensity and mutation-induced effects, but now present the data in one panel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). There is, indeed, a negative relationship between q<sub>L</sub> and q<sub>I</sub>, but most of this is dependent on light and not on the mutation. In other words, at each light intensity, we observed large dependence of q<sub>I</sub> between mutant lines even though q<sub>L</sub> remained fairly constant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) making the case that Q<sub>A</sub> redox state cannot by itself explain the effects.</p><p>However, we completely agree with the reviewer that the rate of recombination should be dependent not only on △<italic>ψ</italic>, but also on Q<sub>A</sub> redox state, and that if we consider both we should be able to see the expected relationship even across different light intensities. To test for this, we derived an equation (see subsection “Estimation of recombination rate” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) to estimate the combined effects of Q<sub>A</sub> redox state and △<italic>ψ</italic> on recombination through P<sub>680</sub>Pheo<sup>-</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel C, we do see a positive relationship between photoinhibition and this predicted recombination rate, though there is some scatter particularly with the wild type that suggests (not surprisingly) there are other factors that also influence photoinhibition, as discussed in the revised text. Overall, we are very happy that the reviewer suggested this point because it allowed us to present a more mechanistic view that supports the overall hypothesis.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors switch from Arabidopsis to spinach thylakoids, although the text and legend indicate that the ECS signal is similar to that seen in Arabidopsis. For consistency, why was this experiment not performed with Arabidopsis thylakoids? Also, what is the evidence that the pmf is &quot;stored almost exclusively as Δψ&quot;? (There is no gramicidin or valinomycin treatment shown in panel B.)</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, thylakoids from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tend to be very leaky to protons so that the <italic>pmf</italic>-induced effects are negated, and this effect can be quite variable from preparation to preparation. This is why we chose spinach, a well-established model for this type of experiment, as intact thylakoids are easily isolated.</p><p>As discussed within the text (Results, eighteenth paragraph), during the rapid transition from a dark adapted state to the light, the buffering capacity of the thylakoid lumen leads to a lag in the formation of a pH gradient, resulting in an immediate <italic>pmf</italic> formation that is composed almost exclusively as △<italic>ψ</italic>.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that SOSG does not appear to be in chloroplasts, so this raises a question about the origin of the singlet oxygen that is being detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Given the very short lifetime of singlet oxygen, it seems unlikely that it could diffuse from a site of generation in the PSII reaction centers in thylakoids, through the stroma and across the double envelope membrane of the chloroplast to react with SOSG in the cytosol. Also, how quantitative are the measurements of singlet oxygen using SOSG? A very recent review of this topic (Koh and Fluhr 2016 Plant Signal Behav, in press subsequent to submission of this manuscript) indicates that one should be cautious about quantification using SOSG. Some discussion of the limitations of this probe seems warranted.</italic> </p><p>We agree that one should be careful in making quantitative estimates of ROS based on dyes like SOSG, and have restricted our discussion to relative increases within our different treatments. We explicitly point out these caveats in the text (Results, fourteenth paragraph and subsection “<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>O<sub>2</sub> detection”).</p><p>Regarding the location of singlet oxygen generation in our samples, while we cannot specifically localize SOSG to the chloroplast, our confocal images imply that is it not excluded from thylakoid, as has been speculated by other groups (Hideg 2008, Central European J Biol 3(3), 273-284). However, it must be kept in mind that the SOSG fluorescence observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> were observed under specific light conditions (described within the figure legend). The localization of SOSG under a confocal microscope can generate SOSG fluorescence due to the intense laser light used to excite the dye, and therefore would not be useful in our understanding of physiological <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation.</p><p>While dye penetration cannot be targeted, and is clearly present throughout the cell and leaf, the increases we observed using SOSG strongly agree with our model that the singlet oxygen is produced as a function of photosynthetic reactions. The relationship between PSII recombination reactions, electric field effects on these reactions, as well as changes in SOSG fluorescence when the electric field is altered with valinomycin are all strong indicators that the SOSG signals are due to photosynthetic reactions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) A loading control for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is still needed. We apologize for not being clear about this essential revision in the previous decision letter. What is needed is not a dilution series of the wild type, which was already included in the figure, but additional panels showing that each lane of the blots was loaded with an equal amount of protein. This control is necessary to compare the expression level of ATPB in the different minira lines. This can be done by probing the blots with an antibody recognizing an unrelated protein whose level is the same in all lines, or at a minimum by showing the Coomassie-stained gels (as was done in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or Ponceau-stained blots to demonstrate equal protein loading of the lanes.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion about the loading control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. We have incorporated a Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain of identically run samples as the ones used for the blots to show equal protein loading of the mutant samples to the 100% wild type sample.</p><p><italic>2) As requested, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> was changed to a graph based on biological replicates, however from the error bars it is not clear that the difference between minira 3-1 and the wild type is significant. Statistical analysis of these data is needed. Also, the authors might want to consider showing these data in a line graph instead of a bar graph, for consistency with the corresponding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the suggestions for improving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We have incorporated another experiment into the figure (n=4), which improved the deviation between different samples. Over the course of the experiment displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the change in D1 content from the initial values is statistically significant between the wild type and <italic>minira</italic> 3-1, confirming that the q<sub>I</sub> quenching that we measured does not represent a long-lived quenching state but indeed a loss of PSII. We have also changed the representation for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> to a line graph for consistency.</p><p><italic>3) The response to essential revision #6 in the previous decision letter was not completely clear. In their response, the authors state that &quot;The localization of SOSG under a confocal microscope can generate SOSG fluorescence due to the intense laser light used to excite the dye, and therefore would not be useful in our understanding of physiological <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation.&quot; If this is the case, then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> should be omitted from the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We performed the confocal experiment to address test the possibility that SOSG does not adequately penetrate leaf cell layers (Hideg, E (2008) Central European Journal of Biology3(3)273-284), i.e. to convince ourselves that the method we employed was successfully delivering the SOSG dye throughout the leaf. The confocal microscopy images confirm that SOSG does indeed penetrate the cell layers and in this respect is a useful control. (We indicated that the confocal laser can induced SOSG photochemistry only to clarify that the images themselves do not represent strong background levels of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production). However, others groups (Dall’Osto et al. 2012, Ramel et al. 2013, Shumbe et al. 2016, cited at lines 263-246) have also presented evidence that SOSG adequately penetrates the cells of intact leaves, so our results are only confirmatory so we have removed the figure and associated discussion from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
