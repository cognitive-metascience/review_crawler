A major challenge is to determine how these components control the specificity and directionality of Notch signaling in developmental contexts. Here, we analyzed same-cell (<italic>cis</italic>) Notch-ligand interactions for Notch1, Dll1, and Jag1, and their dependence on Fringe protein expression in mammalian cells. We found that Dll1 and Jag1 can <italic>cis</italic>-inhibit Notch1, and Fringe proteins modulate these interactions in a way that parallels their effects on <italic>trans</italic> interactions. Fringe similarly modulated Notch-ligand <italic>cis</italic> interactions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Based on these and previously identified interactions, we show how the design of the Notch signaling pathway leads to a restricted repertoire of signaling states that promote heterotypic signaling between distinct cell types, providing insight into the design principles of the Notch signaling system, and the specific developmental process of <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal-ventral boundary formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02950.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02950.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02950.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, cells use a process called Notch signaling to communicate with neighboring cells. During this process, a protein known as a DSL ligand from one cell binds to a protein called a Notch receptor on a neighboring cell. This triggers a series of events in the neighboring cell that change how the genes in this cell are expressed. Notch signaling is involved in many processes including the early growth of embryos, the formation of organs and limbs, and the maintenance of stem cells throughout adult life.</p><p>Enzymes called Fringe enzymes can control Notch signaling by blocking or promoting the formation of the DSL ligand-Notch receptor pairs. It is also possible for a DSL ligand and a Notch receptor from the same cell to interact. This is thought to be important because it prevents an individual cell from sending and receiving Notch signals at the same time.</p><p>There are several different DSL ligands, Notch receptors and Fringe enzymes, so it is difficult to determine which configurations of receptors, ligands and Fringe enzymes can enable Notch signals to be sent or received. To address this problem, LeBon et al. investigated how Fringe enzymes acted on several different DSL-Notch receptor pairs in mammalian cells, and also in fruit flies. They focused in particular on the interactions that occurred within the same cell, as the role of Fringe enzymes in this type of interaction has not been examined previously.</p><p>The experiments revealed that Fringe proteins modify specific same-cell interactions in a way that enables a cell to receive one type of Notch signal from a neighboring cell and send a different type of Notch signal to another cell at the same time. More generally, these results show how an unconventional, ‘bottom-up’ approach can reveal the design principles of cell signaling systems, and suggest that it should now be possible to use these principles to try to understand which cell types send signals to which other cell types in many different contexts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02950.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02950.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>developmental patterning</kwd><kwd>notch pathway</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeBon</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeBon</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Tom V</given-names></name><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Hamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Tom V</given-names></name><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Hamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fringe proteins modulate cis inhibitory, same-cell interactions between the Notch receptor and its ligands to control whether, and in which direction, cells can signal to one another.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Notch signaling pathway mediates communication between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>). As the primary juxtacrine signaling pathway, Notch carries out the fine-detail work of animal development, from drawing sharp boundaries between cell populations, to laying out checkerboard-like lateral inhibition patterns across a tissue, to controlling fractal-like branching structures in vascular and lymphatic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irvine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Notch signaling occurs when a DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag2) ligand binds to a Notch receptor on a neighboring cell, triggering proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor and endocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain into the signal-sending cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fortini, 2009</xref>). This mechanism releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the CSL complex (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag1; also known as RBP-Jκ) to initiate transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fortini, 2009</xref>). In addition, Notch receptors and DSL ligands interact within the same cell in a process called <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">del Alamo et al., 2011</xref>). Overexpression and loss of function studies have revealed that DSL ligands can <italic>cis-</italic>inhibit the ability of a cell to receive a Notch signal, and that this effect depends on the interaction of the extracellular domains of the receptors and ligands in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D'Souza et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, Notch receptors can reciprocally block DSL ligands in the same cell from sending signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">del Alamo and Schweisguth, 2009</xref>). Previous in vitro studies support a simple model in which ligand <italic>cis-</italic>inhibition of receptors and receptor <italic>cis-</italic>inhibition of ligands represent a single process, with ligands and receptors in the same cell forming an inactive complex that prevents them both from interacting in <italic>trans</italic> with neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has suggested that these mutually inhibitory <italic>cis</italic> interactions between receptors and ligands in Notch and other signaling pathways can play a critical role in cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yaron and Sprinzak, 2012</xref>). To illustrate, we analyze the Notch signaling state of a cell, defined by the cell's quantitative ability of a cell to send or receive signal using a given ligand. We consider a cell expressing one type of ligand and one type of Notch receptor. If the cell produces more receptor than ligand, <italic>cis</italic> interactions efficiently remove most or all ligand but leave an excess of free receptor, enabling the cell to receive, but not send, Notch signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top left). On the other hand, if the cell produces more ligand than receptor, <italic>cis</italic> interactions sequester the receptor, leaving an excess of free ligand, and permitting the cell to send, but not receive, signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top right). In this simple case, the relative levels of ligand and receptor expression produce a sharp threshold between sending and receiving signaling states and thereby regulate the strength and direction of signaling between neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>). Consistent with the ratiometric nature of this model, many Notch-dependent developmental processes are highly sensitive to changes in receptor and ligand gene dosage, and show haploinsufficient mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Celis and Bray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duarte et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sprinzak et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02950.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cis</italic> interactions between receptors and ligands lead to exclusive sending and receiving signaling states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the blue shaded region, receptor expression exceeds ligand expression (as indicated schematically above plot), so that mutual <italic>cis</italic> interactions leave mainly free receptors, allowing the cell to receive, but not efficiently send, signals.

(<bold>B</bold>) There are multiple potential ways in which Notch1 could interact in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> with Jag1 and Dll1 ligands, and in which Fringe proteins could modulate these interactions.

However, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two DSL ligands, Delta and Serrate, while in mammals, there are four Notch receptors (Notch 1–4) and five canonical Notch ligands, three members of the Delta family (Dll1, Dll3, Dll4) and two members of the Serrate family (Jag1 and Jag2, homologues of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Serrate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">D'Souza et al., 2008</xref>). Each ligand–receptor pair can have a different interaction strength. For example, Dll4 interacts more strongly with Notch1 in <italic>trans</italic> than Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in vertebrates, Notch signaling processes typically utilize combinations of multiple receptors and ligands. For example, during angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels depends on complex spatial expression of Notch1, Dll4, and Jag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</xref>). In chick spinal cord development, generation of the six subtypes of sensory and motor neurons depends on distinct expression domains of Dll1 and Jag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marklund et al., 2010</xref>). In these and other examples, co-expression of multiple ligands and receptors enables a large number of possible <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions, making it difficult to determine which cells are communicating to which other cells through which receptors and ligands.</p><p>Further adding to the complexity, Fringe glycosyltransferases modulate the interaction between receptors and ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moloney et al., 2000</xref>). Fringe proteins act in the Golgi to transfer <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to <italic>O</italic>-fucose-modified EGF repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruckner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moloney et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> there is a single Fringe, while in mammals there are three homologues: Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), Manic Fringe (Mfng) and Radical Fringe (Rfng). In vitro co-culture experiments have revealed the differential effects of each Fringe on <italic>trans</italic>-activation from different DSL ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). When Lfng or Mfng is ectopically expressed in a receiver cell, <italic>trans</italic> signaling from Dll1 ligands is enhanced, while <italic>trans</italic> signaling from Jag1 ligands is decreased. The effects of Lfng and Mfng in vertebrate systems resemble the effects of Fringe in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which strengthens Delta signaling and inhibits Serrate signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panin et al., 1997</xref>). On the other hand, Rfng increases the <italic>trans</italic> response to both ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>). Despite this work, the effects of Fringe on <italic>cis</italic> interactions, if any, remain unknown. Given the central role of <italic>cis</italic> interactions in determining signaling states, it is therefore essential to determine whether and how Fringes influence these interactions.</p><p>In general, to determine the cell’s signaling state requires knowledge of (1) the levels of ligands, receptors and Fringe proteins; (2) the interaction strengths in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> for each ligand–receptor pair, and (3) how the Fringe proteins act individually and in concert to modulate <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions. Data for (1) are increasingly available in different systems, but (2) and (3) have not been measured comprehensively. Such measurements could enable prediction of the directionality and cell type specificity of signaling from expression measurements in diverse processes.</p><p>To begin to obtain these measurements, we analyzed Notch-ligand <italic>cis</italic> interactions and their dependence on Fringe proteins in cell culture. We studied the Dll1-Notch1 and Jag1-Notch1 ligand–receptor pairs, as these two ligands are frequently used simultaneously for signaling in the same tissue, and because clear differences in the effects of Fringe on these ligand–receptor pairs in <italic>trans</italic> have been established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>). To confirm that our measurements were qualitatively relevant for in vivo Notch-dependent processes, we tested our findings in a series of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants. Together, these data support a role for Fringe in modulating <italic>cis</italic> interactions in mammalian cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These data constrain the set of possible signaling states for cells expressing multiple Notch pathway components, and support the idea that Notch pathway architecture fundamentally favors heterotypic signaling between cells in distinct signaling states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Availability assay enables measurement of <italic>cis</italic> interactions in single cells</title><p>We developed a cell culture-based assay system to measure the <italic>cis</italic> interactions between different ligand–receptor pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a base cell line, we used CHO-K1 cells that support Notch signaling, but do not endogenously express Notch receptors and ligands. We constructed a stable CHO-K1 cell line constitutively expressing a ‘diverted’ Notch1 receptor, hN1(ΔICD)-Gal4<sup>esn</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Struhl and Adachi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>) where the intracellular domain of Notch1 is replaced with yeast Gal4. This receptor activates a UAS-reporter gene but not endogenous Notch targets. Next, we stably integrated tetracycline-inducible Dll1 or Jag1 ligands fused to the Cerulean fluorescent protein, allowing us to control and read out ligand expression with the inducer 4-epitetracycline (4-epiTc) and readout the expression level by cerulean fluorescence.

The images are analyzed using a custom Matlab script to identify the cells and take the mean of the total fluorescence within each cell for each fluorescence channel.

To adjust for this difference in efficiency of surface expression between the different ligands, we fit the total ligand vs ligand availability data from cells expressing ligand only with a linear fit. We use this fit to normalize the data for each ligand accordingly, allowing for comparison between different cell lines expressing different ligands.

Available Notch1 staining decreased to background levels in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing expression of either Dll1 or Jag1, indicating that both Dll1 and Jag1 ligands can fully reduce Notch availability. To confirm that this reduction in Notch availability was not an artifact of ligand overexpression, we compared wild-type Dll1 to Dll1-F199A, which contains a point mutation in the DSL domain that was previously shown to be partially deficient in <italic>trans</italic>-activation and <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>).

Altogether, these observations strongly support the conclusion that during <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development, Fringe increases the sensitivity of Notch to <italic>cis</italic>-Delta but decreases its sensitivity to <italic>cis</italic>-Serrate, similar to the effect of Lfng and Mfng in the mammalian context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Interactions between Notch ligands and receptors, both in <italic>cis</italic> and in <italic>trans</italic>, control the quantitative ability of cells to send or receive signals. Recent work with cells expressing one ligand (Dll1) and one receptor (Notch1) showed that strong and mutually inactivating <italic>cis</italic> interactions between Dll1 and Notch1 can force cells into mutually exclusive signaling states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). But how does this property persist or change in more complex contexts involving multiple ligand species and modulation by Fringe proteins? More generally, how do <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions, together with Fringe proteins, specify a particular set of signaling states, and how do those states determine the directionality and specificity of signaling?</p><p>Extrapolating from the data presented here, one can map out the set of possible signaling states generated by expression of various combinations of Notch1, Dll1 or Jag1 ligands, and one of the three mammalian Fringes. To identify the most qualitatively distinct possible signaling states, we analyzed the limiting cases of extremely high or low receptor/ligand expression ratios at either very low or very high Fringe levels, keeping in mind that the quantitative sending and receiving capabilities of real cells will generally depend on the actual expression levels.</p><p>For the Notch1+Dll1 cells, all three Fringe proteins maintained or strengthened mutually inhibitory <italic>cis</italic> interactions between Dll1 and Notch1. Thus, with or without Fringe expression, the ability of cells to send using Dll1 depends on the relative levels of Notch1 and Dll1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Rfng preserves or strengthens Notch1 interactions with both Dll1 and Jag1, in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>. As a result, Rfng expression maintains the same qualitative send or receive signaling states as observed without Rfng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>, second and third panels). On the other hand, Lfng and Mfng preserve or strengthen Notch1-Dll1 <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions, but diminish Notch1-Jag1 <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>).

Thus, for a cell expressing Notch1 and Dll1, expression of Fringe proteins does not appear to disrupt the exclusivity of sending and receiving capabilities.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02950.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fringe modulation of <italic>cis</italic> interactions generates a set of distinct Notch signaling states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lfng or Mfng modification of Notch1 enhances <italic>trans</italic> activation from Dll1 and weakens trans activation from Jag1 (left).

This analysis suggests the intriguing possibility that the Notch pathway architecture might generally be structured to favor heterotypic signaling (between cells in different states) over homotypic signaling (between cells in the same state). This can be seen in the schematic representations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where no cell contains both an incoming and outgoing arrow on the same ligand (same color), indicating that cells in each of these states should not be able to signal efficiently to other cells in the same state. Whether Notch signaling is broadly heterotypic across all contexts remains to be tested.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Signaling states in fly wing disc dorsal-ventral boundary formation</title><p>The signaling states shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> can provide insights into developmental processes. For example, consider boundary formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, a well-characterized developmental process involving both Notch ligands and Fringe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Micchelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irvine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troost and Klein, 2012</xref>). In the first stage of boundary formation, cells within the dorsal and ventral compartments of the wing disc signal to one another, forming a sharp stripe of Notch activation at the interface between the two cell populations. This Notch activity drives the expression of the Notch target genes E(spl), Wingless, and Cut, which together refine the expression patterns of Notch ligands and regulate the spatial pattern of Notch activation in subsequent stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>). For this discussion, we focus on the initial step before these feedback mechanisms become active. Dorsal cells express Notch, Delta, Serrate, and Fringe, while ventral cells express Notch and Delta only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Because Fringe blocks Serrate-Notch <italic>trans</italic> signaling, dorsal cells do not signal to one another with Serrate, but can signal with Serrate to ventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irvine, 1999</xref>). However, Fringe also promotes Delta-Notch <italic>trans</italic> signaling, so dorsal cells respond to Delta expressed by ventral cells. In this way, signaling can only occur at the interface between the two cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fortini, 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02950.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for Notch signaling states during dorsal-ventral boundary formation in the Drosophila wing disc.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc during the third larval instar. During this stage of development, a sharp stripe of Notch signaling occurs at the interface of the dorsal and ventral wing compartments (blue nuclei), leading to upregulation of target genes that drive further wing development. (<bold>B</bold>) The first step of boundary formation, with signaling states indicated in cartoons above. Initially, ventral cells express Notch and Delta. Because ventral cells can receive signal, Notch must be in excess of Delta to achieve a receiving signaling state. Dorsal cells express Serrate, Notch, Delta, and Fringe (magenta outline denotes Fringe expression). Fringe promotes Delta-Notch <italic>cis</italic> interactions but weakens Serrate-Notch <italic>cis</italic> interactions, enabling dorsal cells to simultaneously receive signals from Delta while sending signals with Serrate. Thus, the first signaling step occurs from dorsal to ventral cells (green arrow). We cannot rule out that there may be some low level signaling from Delta expressed in dorsal cells as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al. (2003)</xref>; however, experiments suggest that Delta in ventral cells is dispensable for proper wing development. (<bold>C</bold>) The second step of signaling begins with upregulation of Delta in activated ventral cells. These cells switch to a sending state, and <italic>trans</italic> activate dorsal cells. We cannot rule out the possibility that these cells send signal to their ventral cell neighbors; however, because Delta cannot efficiently send in a Fringe-negative background, and because of the existence of feedback mechanisms at this stage, Notch activation is kept to low enough levels to prevent upregulation of target genes involved in wing margin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>). The result is the observed pattern of Notch activation at the boundary of dorsal and ventral compartments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02950.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02950.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02950-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>This picture of boundary formation appeared to challenge the notion that send and receive signaling states are exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, elegant mosaic experiments based on mis-expression of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>), have suggested that both dorsal and ventral cells are capable of receiving signals, that is, all cells are in a receiving state. But in order for signaling to occur, some cells must also possess the capability to send signals. Thus, it appears that some cells should be able to send and receive signal simultaneously.</p><p>Fringe modulation of <italic>cis</italic> interactions, reported above, together with a recent developmental study of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troost and Klein, 2012</xref>) suggest a potential resolution to this discrepancy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troost and Klein (2012)</xref> recently examined signaling at the boundary with higher time resolution than in previous work. They found that in the early stages of wing margin formation, signaling occurred in two sequential phases: first, dorsal cells signal via Serrate to ventral cells. Subsequently, ventral cells up-regulate Delta and signal back to dorsal cells.</p><p>In this model, because ventral cells are initially capable of receiving, they should have an excess of Notch over Delta, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> (ventral). The data presented here suggest that in dorsal cells, Fringe should strengthen <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition between Delta and Notch, while weakening <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition between Serrate and Notch. Because dorsal cells are initially in a receiving state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>), Delta expressed by these cells should not efficiently activate Notch in neighboring dorsal cells. Indeed, <italic>Delta</italic> mutant clones in the dorsal compartment do not affect adult wing margin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>), indicating that Delta-mediated signaling among dorsal cells, which occurs at most very weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al., 2003</xref>), is dispensable for normal wing margin formation. The formation of a mutually inactivating, <italic>cis</italic>-inhibitory interaction between Delta and Notch could explain why dorsal cells do not strongly activate one another even though they express and are responsive to Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al., 2003</xref>). At the same time, Fringe could allow Serrate and Notch to both remain available simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, dorsal), a state resembling that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> (far right panel). Thus, in the first phase, signaling would occur only from dorsal to ventral, as observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troost and Klein, 2012</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the dynamic and complex expression patterns of Notch, ligands and Fringe in developmental contexts could superimpose additional layers of regulation on the effects of Fringe on <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> interactions between Notch and ligands.</p><p>Notch activation in ventral cells in the first phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) causes them to up-regulate Delta expression, switching them to a Delta-sending state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In this second phase, ventral cells can <italic>trans</italic>-activate dorsal cells, which remain responsive to Delta. In principle, ventral sender cells could send to adjacent ventral cells; however it seems that at least in flies, Delta cannot send efficiently to cells that lack Fringe expression, and therefore in the flanking ventral cells Notch activity cannot achieve high enough levels to induce Cut and Wingless expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>). This interpretation requires Fringe modulation of <italic>cis</italic> interactions, as observed here, and implies that signaling during boundary formation is heterotypic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Troost and Klein, 2012</xref>). It will be interesting to see if other Notch-dependent boundary formation processes involve similar Notch signaling states and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irvine, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Knowledge of Fringe effects on <italic>cis</italic> interactions could help resolve contradictory findings</title><p>These results could help explain other puzzling observations. For example, one of the most striking vertebrate Notch phenotypes is disorganized somitogenesis in Notch pathway mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Irvine, 1999</xref>). In mice and chicks, Lfng is required for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis, 1998</xref>). However, Lfng inhibits Notch1-Dll1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale et al., 2003</xref>), rather than promoting signaling as expected from previous analysis of its effect on <italic>trans</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>). The ability of Lfng to strengthen Dll1-Notch1 <italic>cis</italic> interactions could explain this phenomenon, since Lfng would tend to reduce the abundance of Dll1 and Notch1 available for <italic>trans</italic> signaling interactions.</p><p>Based on these results and others, different configurations of receptors and ligands, through <italic>cis</italic> interactions, could work to specify distinct signaling states in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). These states are more complex than just ‘send’ and ‘receive’ but are still highly constrained by <italic>cis</italic> interactions and the ways they can be modulated. Understanding what signaling states are possible, how expression levels of various pathway components determine those signaling states, and how cells in different signaling states interact with one another, could provide a useful way to think about the Notch signaling system more generally and to infer the directionality and specificity of signaling in more complex contexts.</p><p>However, many questions remain. We still lack systematic measurements of the interaction strengths, in <italic>cis</italic> and in <italic>trans</italic>, for the full repertoire of ligand–receptor pairs, and their quantitative dependence on Fringe expression levels. Given that multiple Fringe proteins are co-expressed in many systems, we will need to examine how Fringe proteins combine to influence Notch signaling. Fringe proteins are also known to modify the DSL ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panin et al., 2002</xref>); however, a functional role for sugar modifications of the DSL ligands has not been forthcoming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). A potential effect of these modifications on <italic>cis</italic> interactions, if it exists, would also need to be accounted for in a more complete model. Finally, additional components beyond ligands, receptors, and Fringes may need to be considered in developing a more predictive view of Notch signaling. We anticipate that the experimental approaches developed here can be generalized to address these questions and provide a deeper understanding of the basic design principles of the Notch signaling system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>CHO-K1 cells were maintained as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sprinzak et al.

The reviewers felt, however, that the studies in the wing were less compelling, and many of the conclusions needed to be qualified for this section. There were also some concerns about the effect of possibly masking PDZ domain interactions. In detail, the reviewers felt that:</p><p>1) Some of the effects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are very weak. For example, the authors attempt to identify phenotypes indicative of effects of fng on cis interactions. For Ser, the key comparison is the genotype shown in 6I vs 6E and G. It looks like a simple additive effect. Also, the quantitation of the E vs I genotypes (5th vs 9th columns in K), shows that for 95% of the flies there is no effect, and for 5% there is a shift of one “class” I would guess that this is within the range of what one could see just by changes in genetic background, more rigorous experiments would be needed to make a convincing statement as to whether one is seeing effects of Fng on cis interactions here.</p><p>2) To interpret the effects of changing gene dosage as affecting cis versus trans effects, one also has to be mindful of the expression patterns of all of these genes relative to where Notch activation is occurring. Each of the players they are examining (Delta, Serrate, Fringe), have complex and dynamic expression patterns with respect to both the wing margin and the veins, but this aspect is ignored. This caveat should be discussed in the revised submission.</p><p>3) The in vitro assay is very elegant; however, it seems like most (if not all) experiments where performed using ligand fusions. The nature of these fusions should be discussed a little more in the text. As ligands bind to PDZ proteins (which often require binding motifs to be presented at or near the C-terminus, one might imagine that C-terminal fusion proteins could alter ligand trafficking). If this point does not apply, or if this reviewer has misunderstood the nature of the fusions involved, then textual changes to make this clear should be considered. If this issue is not controlled for, then we would recommend the authors should repeat one or two of the assays with completely wild type ligands, just to show that their conclusions are still valid in this context.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) A weakness in the authors’ interpretation of their results comes out where they make statements like “This suggests the intriguing possibility, which will need to be tested in additional contexts, that the Notch pathway architecture permits heterotypic signaling (between cells in different states) but not homotypic signaling (between cells in the same state).” And “cis-inhibition of Delta could thus explain why dorsal cells do not signal to one another, even though they express and are responsive to Delta.”</p><p>In fact, there is evidence in the published literature, based on analysis of Delta mutant clones, that dorsal cells do signal to each other through Delta (in addition to receiving a Delta signal from ventral cells).

Instead, what we observed was a worsening of the wing margin loss phenotype, consistent with a further loss of Notch signaling. The phenotypes observed in the 1X Notch 3X Serrate 1X fringe animals are not simply an addition of the 1X Notch 1X fringe and 1X Notch 3X Serrate phenotypes; instead, we observe a qualitatively new phenotype – the “Class 3” L3 and L4 wing margin loss, that we had previously only seen among 1X Notch 4X Serrate animals. This defect is never observed in the 1X Notch 3X Serrate animals or in 1X Notch 1X fringe animals. Thus, the effect of Fringe loss in this background is only consistent with a picture where Fringe blocks the cis inhibition of Notch signaling by Serrate.</p><p>To show that these effects are not specific to the genetic background of the animals tested in these experiments, we performed additional studies on the effects of Fringe. We examined the outcomes of removing a copy of fringe from 2X (wild-type) Notch 4X Serrate or 2X Notch 4X Delta flies. With two copies of fringe, these animals exhibit no wing margin abnormalities. However, removing a copy of fringe from the 4X Serrate animals results in Notch loss of activity phenotypes at the wing margin which was more severe than 3X Serrate 1X fringe animals shown in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). By contrast, removing a copy of fringe from the 4X Delta animals did not result in wing margin phenotypes. To reiterate the point above: if Fringe only affected Serrate-Notch trans activation, one would expect that removing a copy of fringe would lead to gain of Notch signaling defects, such as wing outgrowth, due to an increase in Serrate-Notch signaling. But not only did we not observe any gain of Notch signaling effects, we instead observed loss of Notch signaling phenotypes in a proportion of the animals that worsens as we increase the Serrate gene dosage. These results are consistent with a model in which the normal role of Fringe is to block Serrate-Notch cis-inhibition.</p><p>The new data are shown in an expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We have also added additional text to the manuscript to better explain these data and the points above.</p><p><italic>2) To interpret the effects of changing gene dosage as affecting cis versus trans effects, one also has to be mindful of the expression patterns of all of these genes relative to where Notch activation is occurring. Each of the players they are examining (Delta, Serrate, Fringe), have complex and dynamic expression patterns with respect to both the wing margin and the veins, but this aspect is ignored. This caveat should be discussed in the revised submission</italic>.</p><p>We agree and we have added text in the revised manuscript to describe the dynamics of expression of each of the components in both wing margin and wing veins and to discuss this caveat. We emphasize that wing vein formation mainly relies on expression of the Delta ligand, while wing margin formation relies on expression of both DSL ligands as well as feedback from Notch target genes.</p><p><italic>3) The in vitro assay is very elegant; however, it seems like most (if not all) experiments where performed using ligand fusions. The nature of these fusions should be discussed a little more in the text. As ligands bind to PDZ proteins (which often require binding motifs to be presented at or near the C-terminus, one might imagine that C-terminal fusion proteins could alter ligand trafficking). If this point does not apply, or if this reviewer has misunderstood the nature of the fusions involved, then textual changes to make this clear should be considered. If this issue is not controlled for, then we would recommend the authors should repeat one or two of the assays with completely wild type ligands, just to show that their conclusions are still valid in this context</italic>.</p><p>To make sure this potential issue is clear in the manuscript, we now explicitly describe potential problems with using ligand-fusion proteins in the Results section.</p><p>More importantly, we added a new figure and experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>) to address this issue. We directly compared the effects of transient expression of tagged and untagged ligands on Notch1 availability. We found that both the CFP-tagged ligands and untagged ligands fully reduced Notch1 availability to background levels, indicating that both ligands are capable of cis inhibition. Further, co-expression of Lfng preserved the ability of both tagged and untagged Dll1 to cis-inhibit Notch1, but weakened both tagged and untagged Jag1 cis-inhibition of Notch1. These results indicate that these key qualitative conclusions of the paper hold for untagged as well as tagged ligands. Together, these results show that the tagged ligand-fluorescent protein fusions proteins behave qualitatively similarly to their untagged counterparts, at least for these experiments.</p><p>We have also added some clarification in the methods section to describe the construction of the ligand-FP fusions (Table 2).</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A weakness in the authors interpretation of their results comes out where they make statements like “This suggests the intriguing possibility, which will need to be tested in additional contexts, that the Notch pathway architecture permits heterotypic signaling (between cells in different states) but not homotypic signaling (between cells in the same state).” And “cis-inhibition of Delta could thus explain why dorsal cells do not signal to one another, even though they express and are responsive to Delta</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>In fact, there is evidence in the published literature, based on analysis of Delta mutant clones, that dorsal cells do signal to each other through Delta (in addition to receiving a Delta signal from ventral cells).

In the Doherty et al. reference (an important paper that we now cite in the manuscript), the authors reported that ectopic Dl expression could activate Notch in dorsal cells. However, loss of endogenous Dl in dorsal compartment clones did not lead to any wing margin defects, suggesting that dorsal Dl signaling does not play a critical role in wing development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>, presented robust evidence for activation of Notch target genes by ectopic Delta-expressing clones on the dorsal side of the boundary, but no indication for a signaling activity of endogenous Dl in the dorsal compartment. Both of these results are consistent with the picture presented in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 &amp; 8</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, the Lei et al paper includes one mutant clone experiment suggesting that endogenous Delta expression in dorsal cells of the wing disc contributes to increases in Serrate expression in dorsal cells, i.e. that endogenous, presumably homotypic, Delta-Notch signaling occurs among the dorsal cells and contributes to Serrate upregulation in the dorsal compartment. In their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-H'</xref> we see 3 Dl- clones. Clone 1 is large, spans both the dorsal and ventral compartments, and loses Serrate expression, most likely because the positive feedback loop between ventral Delta and dorsal Serrate is lost. Clone 2 is small and does not affect Serrate expression. Clone 3 is dorsal and seems to mildly affect Serrate expression. The authors interpret this as Delta trans-activation in the dorsal compartment. However, the effect is weak at best for a few reasons: First, the loss of Delta expression on the dorsal side does not lead to any wing margin defects in their work, indicating no physiological role for this putative homotypic signaling. Second, you can still see Serrate expression in the clone, indicating that it is at most a partial effect. Third, it appears to be based on only a single clone. Thus, the results in Lei et al do not provide strong evidence for signaling among dorsal cells and suggest that if it does occur it is certainly a less important effect than the heterotypic signaling between dorsal and ventral during boundary formation.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we explicitly discuss these issues and cite these references to acknowledge this work, while also emphasizing that heterotypic signaling plays a much more important and non-redundant role in wing margin formation (see text and caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Most importantly, all evidence still indicates that the effects of Fringe on cis interactions between Notch and ligands is a key mechanism for the dominance of heterotypic signaling over homotypic signaling in this developmental context.</p><p><italic>2) “Troost and Klein recently examined signaling at the boundary with higher time resolution than in previous work. They found that signaling occurred in two sequential phases: First, dorsal cells signal via Serrate to ventral cells. Subsequently, ventral cells up-regulate Delta and signal back to dorsal cells</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>Actually, that's been known for at least 15 years before the Troost &amp; Klein paper, e.g., see</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33"><italic>Micchelli et al 1997</italic></xref>.</p><p>The Micchelli et al. paper does describe sequential signaling at the boundary through the dynamic expression of Cut and Wingless, and the effects of these target genes on Notch activity. Cut expression is activated by Notch signaling at the dorsal ventral wing boundary, and is maintained indirectly by Wingless via upregulation of Delta and Serrate in cells flanking the boundary.</p><p>However, our model focuses on the earliest step in this process, prior to the emergence of Cut expression; the first Notch signal exchanged between dorsal and ventral cells. In the Micchelli et al. reference this initial step is described as “reciprocal.” The Doherty et al. paper suggests and the Troost &amp; Klein paper demonstrates that this initial reciprocal step is in fact two sequential steps. Our original manuscript omitted describing these signaling events in the later stages, which might have led to confusion between the events in the early and late stages of boundary formation. In the new manuscript, we have added additional text describing the late stages of boundary formation and have tried to clearly specify which stage we are talking about.</p></body></sub-article></article>
