hypertonic conditions activates a MAPK (Hog1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and ortholog p38 in human cells). In yeast, intracellular glycerol accumulates to counterbalance the high external osmolarity. To prevent glycerol efflux, Hog1 action impedes the function of the aquaglyceroporin Fps1, in part, by displacing channel co-activators (Rgc1/2). However, Fps1 closes upon hyperosmotic shock even in <italic>hog1</italic>∆ cells, indicating another mechanism to prevent Fps1-mediated glycerol efflux. In our prior proteome-wide screen, Fps1 was identified as a target of TORC2-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muir et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that Fps1 is an authentic Ypk1 substrate and that the open channel state of Fps1 requires phosphorylation by Ypk1. Moreover, hyperosmotic conditions block TORC2-dependent Ypk1-mediated Fps1 phosphorylation, causing channel closure, glycerol accumulation, and enhanced survival under hyperosmotic stress. These events are all Hog1-independent. Our findings define the underlying molecular basis of a new mechanism for responding to hypertonic conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09336.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09336.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>aquaglyceroporin</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>osmosensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM07232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muir</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Leskoske</surname><given-names>Kristin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley (University of California, Berkeley)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muir</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM21841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorner</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002894</institution-id><institution>Foundation of the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology (ACAAI Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator Award 11-0118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorner</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Muir et al., 2014), we validate the utility of a screen for new protein kinase substrates and define the underlying molecular basis of a new mechanism for responding to hypertonic conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, target of rapamycin (TOR) Complex 2 (TORC2)-dependent signaling responds to multiple plasma membrane-perturbing stresses, including sphingolipid depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roelants et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2011</xref>), heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2012</xref>), and both hypotonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berchtold et al., 2012</xref>) and hypertonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) conditions. The essential downstream effector of TORC2 is the protein kinase Ypk1 (and its paralog Ypk2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casamayor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roelants et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2004</xref>).</p><p>To understand how TORC2-Ypk1 signaling elicits cellular responses, we performed a genome-wide screen to discern previously unidentified Ypk1 substrates and thereby discovered that ceramide synthase activity is stimulated by TORC2-Ypk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muir et al., 2014</xref>). Among other potential targets, our screen pinpointed two proteins involved in glycerol metabolism, aquaglyceroporin Fps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luyten et al., 1995</xref>) and Gpt2/Gat1, an enzyme that converts glycerol-3P to phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zheng and Zou, 2001</xref>), a precursor to other phospholipids and triacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henry et al., 2012</xref>). Both candidates warranted further investigation because, as we showed, Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits another enzyme in glycerol metabolism, Gpd1, which generates glycerol-3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>GPD1</italic> expression is highly induced by hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albertyn et al., 1994b</xref>). Second, accumulation of intercellular glycerol is essential for yeast cell survival under hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Westfall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito and Posas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hohmann, 2015</xref>). Thus, we suspected that TORC2-Ypk1 signaling might play an as yet unrecognized role in the cellular response to hyperosmotic shock.</p><p>Hyperosmotic conditions evoke two known signaling modalities. Pathways coupled to alternative osmosensors (Sln1 and Sho1) activate MAPK Hog1, which drives both transcription-independent and -dependent responses that markedly increase both production and intracellular retention of glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Westfall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saito and Posas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hohmann, 2015</xref>). Hyperosmotic shock also increases cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] thereby activating calcineurin (CN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denis and Cyert, 2002</xref>), promoting processes that stimulate retrieval of excess plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15a">Guiney et al., 2015</xref>). Although both CN-deficient and <italic>hog1∆</italic> cells are quite sensitive to the ionic imbalances caused by high salt (e.g., 1 M NaCl), <italic>hog1∆</italic> cells are significantly more sensitive to hypertonic stress per se, such as a high concentration of an uncharged impermeant osmolyte (e.g., 1 M sorbitol).</p><p>Our understanding of the response to high osmolarity remains incomplete, however. Although it is well documented that preventing glycerol efflux through the aquaglyceroporin Fps1 is essential for yeast to survive hyperosmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luyten et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tamás et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duskova et al., 2015</xref>), and that activated Hog1 can negatively regulate this channel by displacing the Fps1-activating proteins Rgc1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), Fps1 still closes in response to hyperosmotic shock in <italic>hog1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tamás et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babazadeh et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we explored the possibility, as suggested by our screen, that Fps1 is an authentic target of TORC2-dependent Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation, that this modification is important for Fps1 function, and that it is under regulation by hyperosmotic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ypk1 phosphorylates Fps1 and hyperosmotic shock inhibits this phosphorylation</title><p>The 743-residue enzyme Gpt2 contains one Ypk1 phospho-acceptor motif (<sc>646</sc><named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">R</named-content>S<named-content content-type="author-callout-style2">R</named-content>SS<named-content content-type="author-callout-style1">S</named-content><bold>I</bold><sc>652</sc>). At such sites, Ser residues just penultimate to the canonical one (in red) can be phosphorylated in a Ypk1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelants et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we generated a Gpt2(S649A S650A S651A) mutant. One or more of these three Ser residues is phosphorylated in vivo because, compared to wild-type, Gpt2<sup>3A</sup> exhibited a distinctly faster mobility upon SDS-PAGE, a hallmark of decreased phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), just like wild-type Gpt2 treated with phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Briefly, samples (∼40 ml) of exponentially-growing cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1 ml of medium, recollected and the resulting cell pellets frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at −80°C prior to analysis. Each cell pellet was boiled for 10 min in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.0). This eluate was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,200 rpm (16,100×<italic>g</italic>) in a microfuge (Eppendorf 5415D). Glycerol concentration in the resulting supernatant fraction was measured using a commercial enzymic assay kit (Sigma Aldrich) and normalized to the protein concentration of the same initial extract as measured by the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradford, 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence microscopy of Fps1-GFP</title><p>An <italic>fps1Δ</italic> strain was transformed with plasmids expressing wild-type Fps1-GFP or the mutant Fps1-GFP derivatives and grown in selective medium to mid-exponential phase.

Cells expressing Fps1-3xFLAG (yAM271-A), Fps1<sup>3A</sup>-3xFLAG (yAM272-A) or untagged Fps1 (BY4742) were transformed with empty vector or the same vector expressing Fps1-3xFLAG (pAX302) or Fps1<sup>3A</sup>-3xFLAG (pAX303) under control of the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter. These transformants were then co-transformed with a plasmid expressing Rgc2-3xHA under control of the <italic>MET25</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Cultures of each were grown to mid-exponential phase in SCD-Ura-Leu. Cultures were then diluted to A<sub>600 nm</sub> = 0.2 in 1 l of SCD-Ura-Leu-Met to induce expression of Rgc2-3xHA and Fps1-3xFLAG and grown at 30°C for 4 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml of TNE+Triton+NP-40 (50 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM NaVO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM Na-PPi, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton-X100, 1.0% NP-40, 1× cOmplete protease inhibitor [Roche, Pleasanton, California, United States]). The cells were then lysed cryogenically using Mixer Mill MM301 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany). The lysate was thawed on ice and then clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,500 rpm (13,000×<italic>g</italic>) in the SS34 rotor of a refrigerated centrifuge (Sorvall RC-5B). Protein concentration of the clarified lysate was measured using BCA reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) and then Fps1-3xFLAG was immunoprecipitated from a volume of extract containing a total of 10 mg protein using 50 μl of mouse anti-FLAG antibody coupled-agarose resin (Sigma Aldrich) equilibrated in TNE+Triton+NP-40. Binding was allowed to occur for 2 hr at 4°C. The resin was then washed extensively with TNE+Triton+NP-40 and the proteins remaining bound were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies to detect both Fps1-3xFLAG and Rgc2-3xHA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH Predoctoral Training Grant GM07232 and a Predoctoral Fellowship from the UC Systemwide Cancer Research Coordinating Committee (to AM), by NIH Predoctoral Training Grant GM07232 (to KLL), by NIH R01 Research Grant GM21841 and Senior Investigator Award 11-0118 from the American Asthma Foundation (to JT).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and two reviewers. One of the two reviewers, Susan Henry, has agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were interested in your elucidation of a new TORC2-Ypk1-Fps1 pathway that serves as a Hog1-independent backup mechanism for cell survival in response to hyperosmotic stress acting by closing the Fps1 channel for glycerol efflux, resulting in glycerol accumulation and cell survival during hyperosmotic stress, and they are both in favor of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with revision.</p><p>Please address the specific points raised by Reviewer 2, which all appear feasible to do within a short time frame.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>Prior work from this group had shown that phosphorylation of the Ypk1 protein kinase at its TORC2-dependent sites is eliminated rapidly during hyperosmotic shock but that this loss is attenuated within 10-15 min, but this attenuation was found to be independent of known stress response pathways, including the Hog1 MAPK. Their previous proteomic screen had also identified Fps1p as being a target of the Ypk1p protein kinase.</p><p>This current paper provides strong and clear evidence that the aquaglyceroporin Fps1p is a bona fide target of Ypk1, a TORC2-dependent protein kinase, upon exposure of yeast cells to hypertonic stress. This current work also demonstrates for the first time that the open channel state of Fps1 is dependent on phosphorylation by Ypk1p. In addition, and importantly, the authors show that in wild-type cells, under hyperosmotic stress conditions, TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Fps1 by Ypk1 is blocked. They show that this results in closure of the Fps1 channel for glycerol efflux, resulting in glycerol accumulation during hyperosmotic stress, which in turn leads to increased cell survival under these conditions.</p><p>The evidence presented also indicates that these responses are not dependent on the Hog1 MAPK pathway, which is also activated during hypertonic stress. Thus, this work identifies a novel mechanism involved in survival under hypertonic stress that is Hog1 independent, but TORC2-dependent.</p><p>Overall, the data are of high quality and importance and reveal a novel mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Muir et al. follow up a previous genome-wide screen in which they identified potential Ypk1 substrates. They now confirm that aquaglyceroporin (Fps1) is a target of Ypk1. The authors demonstrate that TORC2-Ypk1 signaling initiates Fps1 phosphorylation to promote Fps1 channel opening. Phospho-deficient Fps1 is in a closed state and confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress and arsenite. They also show that hyperosmotic stress inhibits TORC2-Ypk1 signaling.</p><p>1) It has been reported already that the Slm proteins activate TORC2-Ypk1 signaling in response to hypo-osmotic stress (Berchtold et al.

In this regard, and as enumerated below, several of the issues raised by Reviewer #2 are already addressed in prior published work from ourselves and others, and certain other issues are addressed by results now provided in the revised manuscript (which were not originally included in the initially submitted manuscript because of the length limitations of the Research Advance format).

They now confirm that aquaglyceroporin (Fps1) is a target of Ypk1. The authors demonstrate that TORC2-Ypk1 signaling initiates Fps1 phosphorylation to promote Fps1 channel opening. Phospho-deficient Fps1 is in a closed state and confers resistance to hyperosmotic stress and arsenite. They also show that hyperosmotic stress inhibits TORC2-Ypk1 signaling</italic>.</p><p>We thank this referee for the generally correct synopsis of the novel findings reported in our study. However, this referee felt that we needed to better address and/or experimentally document several of our findings. Our disposition of those concerns is described below.</p><p><italic>1) It has been reported already that the Slm proteins activate TORC2-Ypk1 signaling in response to hypo-osmotic stress (Berchtold et al. Nat Cell Biol. 14:542, 2012). Do the Slm proteins inhibit TORC2-Ypk1 in response to hyperosmotic stress? Also, the Berchtold et al. studies should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The main focus of this Research Advance was to demonstrate unequivocally that Fps1 is indeed an authentic in vivo substrate of the TORC2-Ypk1 signaling axis and to elucidate the physiologically role of these post -translational modifications. Moreover, given the space limitations of a Research Advance, we feel that it is well beyond the scope of this report to demand that we also elucidate the mechanism by which hyperosmotic shock ablates transiently the TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Ypk1, and whether the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins may or may not be involved at this level of regulation.</p><p>Nonetheless, in this same regard, existing data in the literature indicate that it would be technically very difficult to directly address the question posed by Reviewer #2 about whether the Slm1 (and/or Slm2) proteins are required for the observed down-regulation of TORC2-Ypk1 signaling under hyperosmotic conditions, for the following reasons. There are only two known conditions under which <italic>slm1∆slm2∆</italic> cells are viable and in which, <italic>theoretically</italic>, we could ask whether or not 1 M sorbitol is still able to cause a drop in TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1 when the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins are absent.</p><p>First, a <italic>slm1∆slm2∆sac7∆</italic> triple mutant is viable, as shown by work from Scott Emr's lab [Audhya A et al. (2004) EMBO J<italic>.</italic> 23: 3747 -3757]. <italic>SAC7</italic> encodes a primary GAP for yeast Rho1 and, as shown in collaborative work by Yoshi Ohya and David Levin [Kamada Y et al. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271: 9193-9196], Rho1 is the activator of yeast Pkc1 [misnamed because it really is more related to the mammalian Rho- (and Rac-) activated PKR2/PKNγ; see Vincent S, Settleman J (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol<italic>.</italic> 17: 2247-2256; Mukai H (2003<italic>) J. Biochem. (Tokyo)</italic> 133: 17-27]. In any event, loss of Sac7 up-regulates Pkc1 signaling and, as we demonstrated before [Roelants FM et al<italic>.</italic> (2002) Mol. Biol. Cell 13: 3005 -3028], any perturbation that up-regulates Pkc1 function bypasses the inviability of cells deficient in Ypk1 and Ypk2 signaling, presumably because some aspects of the cell wall integrity pathway act in parallel or are semi-redundant with functions normally controlled by Ypk1 and Ypk2. The problem arises, however, from observations reported by Ted Powers lab [Niles BJ et al. (2012) PNAS 109: 1536–1541]. They examined the state of Ypk1 phosphorylation in <italic>slm1∆slm2∆sac7∆</italic> triple mutant and found that Ypk1 phosphorylation at both its activation loop (T504) and at one of its critical TORC2 sites (T662), as judged for the latter using a phospho-site-specific antibody they themselves generated, were greatly reduced. Thus, because TORC2- mediated phosphorylation is already way down in this background, it would be very challenging and probably not meaningful to examine whether the level of T662 phosphorylation goes down further in response to challenge with 1 M sorbitol.</p><p>Second, a <italic>slm1∆slm2∆</italic> double mutant expressing a constitutively-active allele, Ypk1(D242A), is also able to grow. However, this allele is able to bypass the need for functional TORC2, as judged by its ability to rescue the lethality of a <italic>tor2</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup> mutant or treatment of cells with a TORC2 inhibitor [Roelants FM et al. (2011) PNAS 108: 19222-19227] or <italic>avo3∆</italic> cells, which are deficient in TORC2 activity [Niles, op. cit.]. However, the same problem arises here too because, as judged by using exactly the same antibody (generously provided by Ted Powers), we have found that T662 phosphorylation is virtually undetectable on Ypk1(D242A) in <italic>slm1∆slm2∆</italic> cells (K. Leskoske, unpublished data). Thus, once again, because TORC2-mediated phosphorylation is already way down in this background, it would be very challenging and probably not meaningful to examine whether the level of T662 phosphorylation goes down further in response to challenge with 1 M sorbitol.</p><p>Finally, although the lethality of Slm1- and Slm2-deficient cells clearly arises from a lack of sufficient Ypk1 function, exactly why Slm1- and Slm2-deficient cells have low apparent TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1 is not clear. Slm1 and Slm2 were identified originally as PP2B/calcineurin-binding proteins nearly contemporaneously in three different labs [Bultynck G et al. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol. 26: 4729-4745; Tabuchi M et al. (2006) Mol. Cell. Biol<italic>.</italic> 26 : 5861 -5875; Daquinag A et al. (2007) Mol. Cell. Biol<italic>.</italic> 27: 633-650]. Hence, in the absence of Slm1 and Slm2, there will be a lack of proper sequestration of PP2B. Thus, the low level of Ypk1 phosphorylation observed when Slm1 and Slm2 are absent could arise, potentially, from an enhanced rate of dephosphorylation of Ypk1 itself or of some site in a component of TORC2 critical for its activity on Ypk1, or both. Alternatively, because Slm1 and Slm2 contain lipid-binding PH domains near their C-terminus [Yu JW et al. (2004) Mol. Cell 13 : 677-688; Gallego O et al. (2010) Mol. Syst. Biol<italic>.</italic> 6: 430.1-430.15] and both are considered subunits of TORC2 [Gaubitz C et al. (2015) Mol. Cell 58: 977- 988] it is possible that, in the absence of Slm1 and Slm2, inefficient or improper membrane tethering of TORC2 is responsible for the reduction in Ypk1 phosphorylation observed in <italic>slm1∆slm2∆</italic> cells. Neither we nor any other yeast researcher has yet adequately resolved these issues. Nonetheless, as requested by Reviewer #2, we have added a sentence to the Discussion pointing out that it is possible that the response to hyperosmotic shock might be mediated by some influence on the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins, and we cite the Berchtold et al. reference in this context (although the Berchtold paper was already cited in our original manuscript).</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A-C</italic></xref><italic>: The authors show that TORC2-Ypk1 signaling promotes phosphorylation of Fps1 on three serine residues (Ser181, Ser 185, Ser570) as determined by resolving “phospho-”Fps1 in phos-tag gels.

(2013) Cell Rep. 5: 1725-173]. We see no necessity to recapitulate those experiments, especially because our results indicate that the inhibitor reduces phosphorylation of Fps1 at its Ypk1 sites, as expected because Ypk1 activity is TORC2-dependent, fully consistent with the conclusions of Kliegman [op. cit.].</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>: The authors show that TORC2 activity is inhibited upon sorbitol treatment, as determined by mobility shift of Ypk1 in a phos-tag gel.

So, the isoforms generated on Phos-tag™ gels by the Ypk1<sup>7A</sup> mutant used are a reliable reporter of its TORC2-mediated modification. Nonetheless, as requested by Reviewer #2, we now provide new data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4A</xref>) that directly address this issue by showing using the reagent recommended by the referee, namely anti-P-T662 site antibody (again, generously provided by Ted Powers), that phosphorylation at this site is rapidly and completely abrogated when cells are treated with 1 M sorbitol, in agreement with our independent analysis using Ypk1<sup>7A</sup>. In addition, we now demonstrate by phosphatase treatment that the observed isoforms are indeed due to phosphorylation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4B</xref>), as also requested by Reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>5) The authors state: “Thus, Fps1 is a bona fide Ypk1 substrate.” To make this claim, they should provide evidence that Ypk1 directly phosphorylates Fps1.

The authors have previously performed in vitro Ypk1 assays</italic>.</p><p>Like other demonstrated targets of Ypk1 (e.g. Orm1, Orm2, Lac1, Lag1), Fps1 is a polytopic integral membrane protein. Hence, as for these other substrates, we use large soluble fragments of the protein that contain its cytosolically disposed domains as the phospho-acceptor in in vitro kinase reactions. Thus, as requested by Reviewer #2, and as an illustrative example, we now provide new data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) that directly address this issue by documenting that a large (139-residue) fragment of Fps1 containing one of the three primary Ypk1 phosphorylation sites observed in vivo (S570) is indeed phosphorylated in Ypk1-specific manner in vitro and solely at this Ypk1 site (S570), as we previously described as “data not shown” [Muir A et al.

The modest, but measurable, decrease in vegetative growth rate caused by the complete absence of Fps1 has been noted previously by others [Yoshikawa K et al.

Presumably, retention of this channel [∼1,000 copies per cell; Ghaemmaghami S et al. (2003) Nature 425: 737-741], even in closed form, preserves some aspect of cell function that becomes slightly compromised when this integral plasma membrane protein is missing.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A-B</italic></xref><italic>: Based on data showing that Fps1</italic><sup><italic>3A</italic></sup> <italic>mutant cells are resistant to arsenite, the authors conclude that Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation promotes Fps1 channel opening.

In this instance, however, we found that an Fps1<sup>3E</sup> mutant exhibited arsenite resistance, comparable to that displayed by Fps1<sup>3A</sup>. Therefore, it seems that, in the case of this particular protein and these particular sites, Ser-to-Glu mutations are not an adequate mimic for authentic phosphate groups.</p></body></sub-article></article>
