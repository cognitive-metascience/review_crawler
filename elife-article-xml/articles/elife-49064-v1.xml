surrounds and protects the vertebrate body. It develops from a bilayered epithelium formed of the outer periderm and underlying basal epidermis. How apicobasal polarity is established in the developing epidermis has remained poorly understood. We show that both the periderm and the basal epidermis exhibit polarised distribution of adherens junctions in zebrafish. aPKC, an apical polarity regulator, maintains the robustness of polarisation of E-cadherin- an adherens junction component- in the periderm. E-cadherin in one layer controls the localisation of E-cadherin in the second layer in a layer non-autonomous manner. Importantly, E-cadherin controls the localisation and levels of Lgl, a basolateral polarity regulator, in a layer autonomous as well non-autonomous manner. Since periderm formation from the enveloping layer precedes the formation of the basal epidermis, our analyses suggest that peridermal polarity, initiated by aPKC, is transduced in a stepwise manner by E-cadherin to the basal layer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>E-cadherin</kwd><kwd>aPKC</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>500129-Z-09-Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonawane</surname><given-names>Mahendra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001405</institution-id><institution>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12P121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonawane</surname><given-names>Mahendra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polarity cascade initiated by aPKC in the periderm is transduced by adherens junction component E-cadherin to the basal epidermis during the development of zebrafish bilayered epidermis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The metazoan body is covered by the epidermis, an epithelium having a major function in the maintenance of milieu interior. This epithelium is multi-layered or stratified in vertebrates. During embryogenesis, the mammalian epidermis begins as a single layer, becomes bilayered and eventually develops into a multi-layered and keratinised tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans and Rutter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koster and Roop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">M'Boneko and Merker, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakamura and Yasuda, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Saathoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smart, 1970</xref>). In zebrafish, the early bilayered epidermis is formed of an outer periderm, which differentiates from the enveloping layer (EVL), and inner basal epidermis that develops from the non-neuralised ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Hwang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimmel et al., 1990</xref>). This bilayered epithelium is present in the embryonic and larval stages but becomes multi-layered during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Hwang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Le Guellec et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that the epidermis is polarised at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Getsios et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muroyama and Lechler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Watt, 2001</xref>). While such polarisation exists at multiple levels, it is more profound in terms of localisation of various junctional components. Tight junction components such as Cldn-1, ZO-1 and Occludin are localised differentially across layers in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kirschner and Brandner, 2012</xref>). Desmosomal cadherins, plakophillins, envoplakin and periplakin show differentiation dependent changes in expression levels across layers in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Getsios et al., 2004</xref>). Besides, hemidesmosomes mediating the cell-matrix adhesions form only in the basal domain of basal epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hieda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owaribe et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>). However, the steps and mechanisms involved in polarisation of the different developmental forms of the epidermis – monolayered, bilayered and multilayered - have remained elusive.</p><p>A simple epithelium has a well-defined apicobasal polarity; the side that faces the lumen or external environment is defined as the apical domain and the side that is in contact with the basement membrane and neighbouring cells is called the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tepass, 2012</xref>). In vertebrates, the tight junctions demarcate the apical domain and thus separate the apical domain from the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tepass, 2012</xref>). In addition, simple epithelia possess an apical zonula adherens, a tight belt of cadherin mediated adherens junctions. The formation and proper apical localisation of tight and adherens junctions marks an important step in polarisation of the epithelial sheet and is tightly controlled by the epithelial polarity pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laprise and Tepass, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>). At least four modules or pathways are important for establishment and maintenance of apicobasal polarity in the simple epithelia. Amongst these aPKC-Par3-Par6, Crb-Sdt-Patj control the apical polarity and Lgl-Dlg-Scrb, Yurt-Cora-Nrx IV-Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase regulate the basolateral polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilder and Perrimon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laprise et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tepass et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wodarz et al., 1995</xref>). The loss of <italic>apkc</italic> function results in the disruption of adherens junctions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>), the intestine and retinae of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horne-Badovinac et al., 2001</xref>), and in the neuroepithelium of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Imai et al., 2006</xref>). The absence of <italic>lgl</italic> function results in mislocalisation of the adherens junctions and expansion of apical domain in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanentzapf and Tepass, 2003</xref>). Similar to adherens junctions, formation and localisation of tight junctions is also shown to be regulated by cell polarity regulators <italic>apkc</italic> and <italic>lgl</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chalmers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yamanaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yamanaka et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In mouse epidermis, aPKC regulates the cell division plane and maintains the stem cells in a quiescent stage in the hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfrich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Osada et al., 2015</xref>). The aPKC function is also required to build trans epithelial resistance in the basal keratinocytes cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfrich et al., 2007</xref>). In the embryonic epidermis, <italic>heart and soul (has)/apkc λ/í</italic> functions to control the elongation of microridges, actin based apical projections on the zebrafish peridermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raman et al., 2016</xref>). Amongst the basolateral components, <italic>penner/lgl2</italic> function is essential for the formation of hemidesmosomes in the basal epidermis and to promote the elongation of microridges in the periderm in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>psoriasis/atp1b1a</italic> - encoding a subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase – regulates localisation of Lgl as well as E-cadherin and functions as a cell non-autonomous tumour suppressor in hypotonic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatzold et al., 2016</xref>). Despite these earlier attempts, the functions of aPKC and Lgl in regulation of epidermal polarity and adherens junction formation, specifically in the developing vertebrate epidermis, have remained poorly understood.</p><p>Adherens junctions contribute towards the polarisation of simple epithelia. The loss of <italic>shotgun/de-cadherin</italic> and <italic>armadillo/β-catenin</italic> function is known to perturb the polarity and architecture of epithelial tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanentzapf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tepass et al., 1996</xref>). In mouse, epidermis- specific E-cadherin knockout shows mislocalisation of aPKC and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, E-cadherin is also required for the formation of tight junctions and regulation of hemidesmosome formation in the epidermis of mouse and zebrafish, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). So far, it has remained unclear whether E-cadherin is localised in a polarised manner in the epidermal layers and whether it regulates cell polarity in the developing epidermis.</p><p>Here we show that in the zebrafish embryonic bilayered epidermis, the adherens junctions show a polarised distribution in each layer of the epidermis. Unexpectedly, we observe that in the periderm, E-cadherin localisation increases from the apical to the basal domain, while the basal epidermis exhibits a reverse trend. Thus, E-cadherin levels are highest at the interlayer junction. Cell polarity regulator aPKCλ/í controls the levels of E-cadherin in epidermal cells. Importantly, aPKCλ/í function is required to maintain robustness of the polarised distribution of E-cadherin in peridermal cells. We further demonstrate that E-cadherin in one layer influences E-cadherin and Lgl localisation in the juxtaposed layer. Thus, our data reveal that E-cadherin, by virtue of being a connector of the two layers, transduces polarity cues across the epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adherens junctions exhibit a polarised distribution within each layer of the bilayered epidermis with maximum levels at the inter-layer interface</title><p>It has been shown that the epidermis, a stratified epithelium, is polarised at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Getsios et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muroyama and Lechler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Watt, 2001</xref>). To address whether a simple bilayered epidermis in developing zebrafish embryos exhibits polarity with respect to adherens junctions, we performed immunostainings for E-cadherin (Cdh-1), a trans-membrane component of adherens junctions. To demarcate the apical domain, we used aPKC that marks the apical domain in the periderm and analysed the localisation of E-cadherin along the apicobasal axis. Analysis of successive confocal slices in z-stacks and immuno-histological sections revealed that the localisation of E-cadherin increases gradually along the apicobasal axis of the peridermal cells at 48 hours post-fertilisation (hpf; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A1, B1</xref>). To investigate this E-cadherin polarity better, we analysed embryos stained for transgenically driven Lyn-GFP, which marks the peridermal membrane, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haas and Gilmour, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sonal et al., 2014</xref>) and E-cadherin by histology and those additionally stained for aPKC by confocal microscopy. These analyses further indicated that the E-cadherin localisation increased gradually along the apico-basal axis in the periderm at 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 B2, B3, B4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We further sought to analyse the localisation of E-cadherin with respect to Lgl2. Immunolocalisation analyses by confocal microscopy as well as histology revealed that E-cadherin colocalised with Lgl, both in the periderm as well as in the basal epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polarised localisation of E-cadherin in zebrafish bilayered epidermis during early development.</title><p>Confocal images of the periderm (<bold>A1</bold>) and basal epidermis (<bold>A2</bold>) showing localisation of E-cadherin (magenta) and aPKC (green) along various cell-heights at 48hpf in wild type embryos.

We normalised the cell heights, fitted the data along the cell height using ‘locfit’ and interpolated the intensity values at comparative intermediate cell heights (see Materials and methods). The interpolated intensities at the chosen cell heights were then plotted as boxplots and compared across various developmental stages. This analysis revealed that the mean E-cadherin levels increase gradually from the apical to the basal domain, plateauing at the basal domain of the peridermal cells, at all stages analysed between 24 to 72hpf. Thus, E-cadherin is localised in a polarised manner along the apicobasal axis in peridermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A1, C1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the basal epidermis, this distribution is reversed. E-cadherin levels were found to be higher at the apical domain and decreased gradually towards the basal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A2, B2, B5, C2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). During development, the mean E-cadherin intensity at each z-level increased in both the periderm and basal epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C1, C2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A similar trend was observed for β-catenin, another component associated with the adherens junctions, in the periderm and basal epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the localisation of adherens junction components seems to increase over time in the epidermis, especially from 48hpf to 72hpf. To verify the polarised localisation of E-cadherin further, we measured the levels of E-cadherin in live at 48hpf by expressing an mCherry tagged version of E-cadherin in the background of Lyn-GFP. Corroborating the findings from fixed samples, we observed a gradual increase in E-cadherin-mCherry levels across the apico-basal axis in the periderm, and a reverse trend in the basal epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, E-cadherin and β-catenin localisation indicate that adherens junctions are present in a polarised manner in the zebrafish bilayered larval epidermis. The membrane levels of these two adherens junction components increase along the apicobasal axis in the periderm. This trend is reversed in the basal epidermis. Thus, the maximum levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin are present at the interface of both the layers. Besides, there is a significant increase in the membrane localisation of E-cadherin and β-catenin during development, especially between 48hpf to 72hpf, suggesting an increase in the formation of adherens junctions during epidermis development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>aPKC promotes robustness of the polarisation of adherens junctions in the bilayered epidermis</title><p>In simple epithelia, polarity pathways Par3-Par6-aPKC and Dlg-Scrib-Lgl regulate the localisation of adherens junction components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wodarz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>).

The apical perimeter of the mutant peridermal cells was also smaller than that of siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A3</xref>, Mann Whitney U test, p&lt;0.05). We probed if the abnormal cellular morphology was restricted only to the taller cells. Taking the distribution of the sibling cells as a reference, the cells were classified as tall, medium or short (see Materials and methods for details; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We analysed these cells separately for both the wild-type siblings and <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant embryos. Since there were only two ‘short’ cells in <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutants, we pooled them with medium heighted cells. We found that taller cells of <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutants had a smaller apical perimeter as compared to wild type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3 C1</xref>; Mann Whitney U test, p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, the apical perimeter of the medium/short heighted cells in <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant was also smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3 D1</xref>; Mann Whitney U test, p&lt;0.05). These data suggest that, irrespective of the cell height, mutant cells are more columnar than the sibling cells. In contrast, there was no significant effect on the morphology of the basal epidermal cells in <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant embryos as compared to the siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B2, B3</xref>).</p><p>We further asked whether aPKC loss results in a perturbation of the polarised distribution of adherens junctions. We reasoned that systematic quantification would be required to reveal any effect of aPKC loss on polarity. To begin with, we identified the plane at which E-cadherin levels were the highest in each peridermal cell, and this level was considered to be 100%. Keeping this as a reference, we normalised the E-cadherin levels at other planes. The data were plotted as a scatterplot, with the points binned in 15 bins. If the distribution remained unaltered, one would expect the maximum E-cadherin intensity to be achieved at the basal domain of peridermal cells. Thus, the cells having highest intensities at places other than the basal domain would contribute to the noise. We observed that, while sibling peridermal cells show a noisy but gradual increase in E-cadherin intensity along the apico-basal axis, the mutant peridermal cells exhibit increased noise and reduced robustness in polarised E-cadherin distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A4</xref>). Similar analysis on the basal epidermal cells did not show any obvious effects on the polarised distribution of E-cadherin in the <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B4</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the ‘noise index’ in the periderm a linear regression was fitted to the sibling data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.731). Next, we identified and counted the <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant and sibling data points lying outside the 99% prediction interval for the siblings. Cells with even a single data point lying outside 99% interval were considered as having abnormal distribution of E-cadherin localisation. The noise index (abnormal cells*100/total cells) thus estimated was 24% for <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant as compared to 8% for the siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A5</xref>).</p><p>Since <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant periderm consists of cells that are taller than or comparable to wild type in height, we further asked whether this noise arises due to a variation in cell heights. We separately analysed the polarised distribution of E-cadherin in ‘tall’ and ‘medium/short’ cells, as classified earlier, in the periderm of <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant embryos using the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A4</xref>. Interestingly, in the periderm of <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutants, irrespective of the cell heights, a decrease in the robustness of polarisation and an increase in noise index was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3, C3, D2, D3</xref>). These data suggest that the effect on E-cadherin polarisation in <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant embryos is independent of the cell heights.</p><p>We further performed the polarity analysis by analysing localisation of exogenously expressed E-cadherin-mCherry in live embryos. This analysis corroborated the findings that in the absence of <italic>has/apkc</italic> function, peridermal cells show a decrease in membrane localisation of E-cadherin-mCherry, reduction in the robustness of E-cadherin polarisation and increase in the noise index as compared to WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,D,E</xref>). Interestingly, injection of <italic>e-cadherin-mCherry</italic> mRNA, which presumably increases the total pool of E-cadherin (endogenous + exogenous), specifically rescued the cell-height phenotype in the periderm of <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutants over the control injections of <italic>CAAX-mCherry</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test; significance values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s4sdata2">Figure 2—figure supplement 4—source data 2</xref>). This exogenously added E-cadherin failed to rescue the smaller apical perimeter of the mutant peridermal cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These data confirmed that aPKC regulates the polarised distribution of E-cadherin in the periderm via the cell polarity pathway and not by controlling the cell height or levels of E-cadherin.</p><p>We then checked for the effects on adherens junctions in <italic>pen/lgl2</italic> background.

In the zebrafish bilayered epidermis, E-cadherin localises to the basolateral domain of the peridermal cells and to the apico-lateral domain of the basal epidermal cells. Since it is involved in homophilic adhesion, it is likely that lateral membrane localisation indicates adhesion between two neighbouring peridermal cells and two basal epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A1, A2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Similarly, the localisation of E-cadherin to the basal domain of the peridermal cells and apical domain of the juxtaposed basal epidermal cells reflects cadherin-mediated adhesion between the periderm and basal epidermal cells.</p><p>We hypothesised that, due to homophilic adhesion, localisation of E-cadherin in one layer would determine the membrane levels in the other layer. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down <italic>e-cadherin</italic> in a clonal manner, either in the periderm or the basal epidermis, and checked the E-cadherin levels at the membrane in the other layer. To achieve this, we injected e<italic>-cadherin</italic> morpholino along with GFP mRNA, as a tracer, in one of the blastomeres at 16–64 cell stage. To prove that the morpholinos injected this way partition together with the mRNA, we injected 3’- Carboxyfluorescein tagged standard control morpholino with mCherry mRNA. We found that mCherry labelled peridermal or basal epidermal clones showed tight association with the fluorescent morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Of the 23 clones analysed this way, 21 showed co-localisation of mCherry with the morpholino. None of the clones showed inter layer diffusion and 2/23 clones either did not show co-localisation or showed diffusion of morpholino beyond mCherry expression within the layer. We knocked down <italic>e-cadherin</italic> function this way in either the periderm or the basal epidermis. We observed that the reduction of E-cadherin levels was not restricted to the peridermal clones, which received the morpholino, but was also seen in the underlying basal epidermal cells. Of the 23 peridermal clones analysed, 19 clones showed a layer non-autonomous effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This was reciprocally true for the basal epidermal clones. Of 44 basal epidermal clones analysed, 36 showed layer non-autonomous effect on membrane levels of E-cadherin in the periderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Most importantly, this reduction in the levels of E-cadherin was not limited to the interface between the clone and underlying or overlying cells but was also observed at the lateral domains of the cells of the juxtaposed layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). We further quantified E-cadherin levels in the morphant clones that showed qualitative effect by dividing the cell-boundaries into six categories as described ahead (See methods for details; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1 C1, C2</xref>). The quantifications from three independent experiments were analysed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2 A1-D2</xref>). This analysis confirmed that, whether in the periderm or basal epidermis, the clonal knockdown of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> resulted in a marked and statistically robust reduction in E-cadherin levels within the clone (CC) and at the cell-boundaries in the juxtaposed layer that completely overlapped (CO) with the clone. The effect on the non clone-clone boundaries (NC) was moderate. These quantifications also revealed a reduction in E-cadherin at the boundaries between the nearby non-clonal cells (NN) and the boundaries in the juxtaposed layer that partially overlap (PO) or do not overlap (NO) with the morphant clones. However, this effect on PO, NO and NN was statistically not as robust and varied across the three sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2 A1-D2</xref>; Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test; significance values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata5">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata9">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 9</xref>).

The knockdown of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> in either the peridermal or the basal epidermal clones showed an increase in Lgl2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In addition, E-cadherin deficiency in the periderm caused an increase in Lgl at the lateral membrane of the underlying basal epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, E-cadherin deficiency in the basal epidermis caused an increase in Lgl2 levels at the lateral domain of the juxtaposed peridermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This non-autonomous effect was observed in 27 clones out of total 34 clones. The layer autonomous as well as non-autonomous increase in Lgl2 levels in the absence <italic>e-cadherin</italic> function was patchy. Further quantification of the Lgl levels in clones that showed qualitative effect, confirmed a robust increase in Lgl2 levels in a layer autonomous as well as layer non autonomous manner.

In the first construct, the first two extracellular domains (ΔEC1-EC2-Ecad), which would abrogate homophilic interactions between cadherin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kardash et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leckband and de Rooij, 2014</xref>), were deleted. In the second construct, the β-catenin binding domain - which is important for cytoskeletal interaction- was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leckband and de Rooij, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niessen et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike full-length construct, the mRNA synthesised from the deletion constructs and injected in a clonal manner did not yield any localisation of these deletion forms of E-cadherin. This precluded the possibility of complementing the morpholino induced E-cadherin deficiency by these two E-cadherin deletions. However, upon plasmid injection, ΔEC1-EC2-Ecad localised to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4 A1, B1, C1</xref>). While the total membrane-bound E-cadherin pool seem to increase in these clones, presumably due to presence of endogenous E-cadherin and exogenously expressed mutant version, we did not observe any non-autonomous effect on E-cadherin localisation in cells of the juxtaposed layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4 A2, A4, B2, B4</xref>). Interestingly, of the 19 clones expressing ΔEC1-EC2-Ecad version, 16 showed increased levels of Lgl2 in a layer autonomous as well as non-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4 A3, A5, B3, B5</xref>). However, there was no detectable change in aPKC levels or localisation in 15 such clones analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4 C3, C4</xref>). Despite repeated attempts, we did not observe membrane localisation of plasmid encoded mutant form of E-cadherin in which β-catenin binding domain was deleted. This could possibly be due to the increased endocytosis of the mutant version of the E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, the loss of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> function results in a loss of β-catenin localisation, suggesting a reduction in adherens junction formation. E-cadherin restricts the localisation of aPKC to the apical domain in the periderm in a cell autonomous manner, and controls the localisation of Lgl in a layer autonomous and non-autonomous manner. Our results suggest that extracellular domains of E-cadherin play important role in controlling localisation of Lgl2 within and across the layers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The developing epidermis, developing urinary bladder and epithelia in mammary ducts and sweat gland ducts are bilayered in nature whereas the adult epidermis, oesophagus lining and cornea are multi-layered epithelial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui and Schlessinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kierszenbaum and Tres, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newman and Antonakopoulos, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Standring, 2016</xref>). How polarity is regulated in such bi-layered and multilayered epithelia has remained poorly understood. Here we have used zebrafish developing epidermis, a bilayered epithelium, as a model to show that adherens junctions are localised in a polarised manner. In addition, we have also unravelled the importance of aPKC and E-cadherin in the maintenance of cell-polarity in epidermal layers.</p><p>In vertebrate as well as invertebrate simple epithelia, zonula adherens forms at the apicolateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grawe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kierszenbaum and Tres, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Standring, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wodarz et al., 2000</xref>). Besides the apical belt of zonula adherens, adherens junctions are also reported to be present in the lateral domain in MDCK cells and follicular epithelium in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanentzapf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zinkl et al., 1996</xref>). Though shown to be present at the lateral domains, it remains unclear how adherens junctions are distributed in multi-layered epithelial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirai et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horiguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ishiko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). Here we have demonstrated that adherens junctions are distributed in a polarised manner in the zebrafish bilayered embryonic epidermis. Peridermal cells show an increase in the level of E-cadherin and β-catenin, and thus adherens junctions, from the apical to the basal domain whereas the basal epidermal cells show a reverse trend. Thus, the interface of the two layers has the maximum E-cadherin levels. This is a unique system in which the two juxtaposed layers of the epithelium show reversed polarity with respect to the localisation of adherens junctions. Consistent with this, we did not observe localisation of aPKC in the apical domain of the basal epidermal cells during early development. It appears that the molecular identity of the histological apical domain of the basal epidermal cells remains undefined at the early stages of the epidermis development. Alternatively, it may be a feature of the bilayered epithelial systems in general. The basal epidermal cells may get the apical identity at the ‘molecular’ level possibly at a later stage when the polarity of the basal cells becomes important for the asymmetric cell division during stratification, as shown in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helfrich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niessen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Osada et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The polarity proteins regulate the formation and localisation of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bossinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Qin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yamanaka et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>apkc</italic> function has been shown to be important for the formation and/or localisation of adherens junction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast as well as in vertebrate epithelia including neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horne-Badovinac et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Imai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Osada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rolls et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). Our data indicate that aPKCλ/¡ function is required to reduce the noise in E-cadherin localisation to generate robust polarised distribution of adherens junctions. A systematic quantification followed by rigorous data analysis is required to unravel this phenotype. Importantly, the decreased robustness in polarity is not a consequence of changes in the peridermal cell morphologies or E-cadherin levels, suggesting that aPKC controls the polarised E-cadherin localisation primarily via the polarity pathway. Intriguingly, the basolateral regulator <italic>lgl2</italic> does not seem to be required for the polarised distribution of E-cadherin. However, this could be due to the redundant functioning of the two <italic>lgl</italic> paralogues or due to maternally derived Lgl2, which remains to be tested.</p><p>E-cadherin participates in homophilic adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tomschy et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shamir et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vleminckx et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yokoyama et al., 2001</xref>), we observed a reduction in E-cadherin localisation at the boundary between cells that are wild type and cells that are deficient for E-cadherin. Furthermore, our analyses presented here indicate that the knockdown of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> in a clonal manner in one layer results in the loss of E-cadherin localisation at the interface between the two layers. However, interestingly, the localisation of E-cadherin at the lateral domains is also affected in cells in the layer abutting the E-cadherin deficient clone. This clearly indicates that E-cadherin in one layer controls the localisation of E-cadherin at the lateral domains of the juxtaposed cells in a layer non-autonomous manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show a layer non-autonomous role of E-cadherin in a multi-layered epithelium. Our data, despite the variations across experiments, also indicate that weaker effect of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> loss may spread beyond the clone and the cells of the juxtaposed layer that are directly in contact with the clone. More sensitive methods of E-cadherin detection levels are required to reproducibly detect such weaker effect away from the deficient clone.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that the disruption of adherens junctions leads to a loss of polarity and epithelial integrity in simple epithelia such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm and follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanentzapf et al., 2000</xref>). In multi-layered epithelia, a loss of <italic>e-cadherin</italic> function leads to mislocalisation of aPKC and improper formation of tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). We observed that <italic>e-cadherin</italic> loss leads to mislocalisation of aPKC in the periderm. In addition to the tight apical localisation, increased non-membranous accumulation of aPKC is seen in the basal part of the E-cadherin deficient peridermal cells. This aPKC phenotype is not apparent in the peridermal cells when the <italic>e-cadherin</italic> is knocked down in the basal epidermis resulting in decrease in E-cadherin levels in the periderm. It is plausible that the weaker reduction in E-cadherin levels in the periderm upon <italic>e-cadherin</italic> knockdown in the basal epidermis may not be enough to mislocalise aPKC. The effect on the apical domain is limited only to aPKC. We did not observe any effect on localisation of tight junction component ZO-1. Presumably, the presence of maternally deposited E-cadherin protein facilitates the tight junction formation in EVL cells. The effect on polarity, upon <italic>e-cadherin</italic> knockdown, is also manifested by increased localisation of Lgl. The depletion of E-cadherin results in a layer autonomous as well as layer non-autonomous increase in Lgl localisation. Our Lgl data reveal that the polarity of one layer is linked with the polarity of the neighbouring layer via E-cadherin.</p><p>How is the E-cadherin localisation at the lateral domain in one layer achieved by E-cadherin present in another layer? How does E-cadherin regulate Lgl levels? How does absence of E-cadherin in clones propagated to the cell-boundaries that are away from the clones? E-cadherin regulates homophilic cell adhesion, achieves mechanical coupling, participates in cell signalling and controls cortical tension in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chappuis-Flament et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gottardi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lecuit and Yap, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maître et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Onder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Takeichi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tunggal et al., 2005</xref>). It is likely that the layer autonomous and layer non-autonomous regulation of adherens junction and Lgl2 localisation happens via some of these mechanisms. The fact that expression of EC1-EC2 domain deleted form of E-cadherin does not influence the E-cadherin localisation layer-non-autonomously but alters Lgl localisation in autonomous as well as non-autonomous manner, indicates that homophilic interaction dependent mechanism(s) may not play a role in regulation of Lgl2 localisation. It is therefore likely that additional tension mediated mechanism(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simões et al., 2010</xref>) might be contributing towards this regulation. The effect on Lgl2 and E-cadherin localisation away from E-cadherin deficient clonal boundaries can be explained via such tension-based mechanisms. Clearly, more analysis is required to understand the mechanism of layer non-autonomous control of adherens junction formation and layer autonomous as well as layer non-autonomous regulation of Lgl2 localisation by E-cadherin.</p><p>Our data presented here along with the previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>) allow us to propose a model for polarisation of the bilayered epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates from the enveloping layer (EVL). The basal epidermis differentiating from the ventral non-neural ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Hwang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kimmel et al., 1990</xref>) underlies the periderm. EVL cells are polarised along the apicobasal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukazawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lepage et al., 2014</xref>) and are likely to pass on this polarity to the peridermal cells. As the first step in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), aPKC regulates the polarised localisation of E-cadherin in the periderm. The basal epidermal cells do not exhibit apical localisation of aPKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistently aPKC does not control polarity in the basal epidermal cells. During the early phase of epidermis development, E-cadherin begins to localise in the basal epidermal cells at 22 hpf (Arora and Sonawane, unpublished observations). The peridermal E-cadherin- via homophilic interactions - organises E-cadherin in the basal epidermis. We propose that, as a consequence of homophilic interactions, the higher levels of E-cadherin in the basal domain of the periderm allow greater localisation of E-cadherin in the apical domain of the juxtaposed basal cells. Thus, initiating polarity in the basal epidermis. In addition, E-cadherin controls the levels of Lgl2 at the cortex (current analysis), which is essential for the formation hemidesmosomes that mediate basal cells-to-matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>). Whether Lgl in the basal epidermis is organised by peridermal E-cadherin or E-cadherin in the basal epidermis, remains unclear. Our results presented here also explain how E-cadherin and Lgl2 function antagonistically to regulate the hemidesmosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model proposing stepwise polarisation of the zebrafish embryonic epidermis.</title><p>The periderm, polarised at EVL stages, has apically localised aPKC. aPKC controls the polarisation of E-cadherin (E-cad).

However, it is important to note that in the absence of aPKC function, the E-cadherin polarity is noisy but not completely lost, possibly due to existence of redundant mechanisms. Such a partially polarised periderm may still be able to transduce the polarity cues to the basal epidermis to set up the E-cadherin polarity. Therefore, the possibility of aPKC regulating polarity in the basal epidermis via peridermal E-cadherin needs to be investigated further by eliminating the redundant mechanisms that control E-cadherin polarity in the periderm. Our proposed model and the approach establish a conceptual and analytical framework to systematically tease apart the mechanisms involved in polarity establishment across bilayered and multilayered epithelial systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish strains</title><p>All experiments were done in Tübingen (Tü) strain unless mentioned otherwise.

For line plots, a line was drawn across the area marked and intensity profile was plotted using Fiji’s inbuilt function. For quantifications across z-stacks, the cell boundaries were marked using line tool with a fixed width of 7 pixels to cover the cell membrane and the levels were measured at each z-level. For each condition, 4–6 non-neighbouring cells were quantified from each embryo. 7–10 embryos were quantified with minimum 30 cells per set. Note that quantification was done where the lateral domains were clearly visible. At the apical domain of the basal epidermis, neuronal axons interfere in quantifications. Therefore, such slices (typically 1–2 slices) were excluded from quantifications. At least three sets were quantified for each experiment unless mentioned otherwise. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, two sets with minimum of 25 cells at each time point from each set or average 35 boundaries per category per set were quantified. For live imaging experiments, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) at least two sets with minimum of 29 cells were quantified. All the details of number of cells/boundaries/clones analysed for each experiment has been provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>. The data were then exported to R statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) on RStudio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">RStudio T, 2016</xref>) for further analysis.

For comparison between different conditions for E-cadherin or Lgl, the cell heights were normalised from 0 to 1, with 0 being apical and one being the basal, for each cell. Curves for Normalised Height versus E-cadherin levels were plotted for each cell. Each of these curves were then fitted using ‘locfit’ regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loader, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loader, 1999</xref>) in R statistical software, to interpolate E-cadherin and Lgl intensity values at fixed normalised heights of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for each cell and thus get comparative values irrespective of the data acquisition points. These interpolated points were then used for comparisons between different genetic conditions.</p><p>For height-wise classification of peridermal cells of wild-type siblings and <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutants, distribution of the sibling cells was used as a reference. Cells were classified as ‘Tall’ when their heights were above the third quantile of this reference distribution, ‘medium’ when the cell heights were between the first and the third quantile, and ‘short’ when the heights were below the first quantile of the reference distribution as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>In order to see the effect on the polarised distribution of E-cadherin, the maximum value of E-cadherin in each cell was normalised to 100% and the points were then plotted as a scatter plot. For better visualisation of points, the plot was binned in 15 bins on both the axes. Presence of a data point/s in the bin is represented as a coloured box. The number of data points in a bin is directly correlated to the darkness of the coloured boxes. More data points yielded darker boxes. To estimate the cells showing the abnormal E-cadherin distribution, a linear regression was fitted to the sibling data presented in graphs for aPKC sib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 A4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3 C2, D2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Regressions when fitted to the mutant data showed slopes and intercepts close to siblings, thus indicating the trends for both the genetic conditions are similar (not shown) but the noise levels may differ. The sibling data fitted with the regression line and a prediction interval of 99% is considered to encompass the baseline variability in siblings. Thus, data points lying outside this 99% prediction interval is classified as the noise in siblings. Since the sibling data provide the baseline for comparison, the noise in the mutant data was estimated as the mutant data points lying outside the 99% prediction interval of the sibling data. Any sibling or mutant peridermal cell having one or more data point outside 99% prediction interval was considered to have an abnormal distribution, contributing towards noise. The noise index was estimated as the percentage of the number of cells showing abnormal distribution.</p><p>For boundary wise quantifications for E-cadherin or Lgl levels, (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C,E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 B5, B6, C5, C6</xref>) the boundaries were divided into total six categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1 C1,C2</xref>). To check for the layer autonomous effects, the boundaries were categorised as a) boundaries within the morphant clone cells (Clone-Clone or CC), b) boundaries between a clonal cell and a non-clonal cell (Non Clone- Clone or NC), and c) those between two non-clonal cells (Non Clone- Non Clone or NN). To check for the layer non autonomous effects, we categorised boundaries as d) those lying completely over/under a morphant clone (Complete Overlap or CO), e) or lay partially over/under the morphant clones (Partial Overlap or PO) and f) having no overlap with the morphant clones (No Overlap or NO) as shown in the schematic.</p><p>The statistical analysis was done using SigmaPlot 13 and R statistical software. Since most of the data failed Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test, non-parametric statistical test- Mann Whitney U test or Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test were performed. A p-value&lt;0.05 was kept as a threshold for significance, in some cases threshold was extended till 0.08. Graphs were plotted in R and line plots were plotted in Fiji.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge TIFR-DAE and Wellcome-trust-DBT-India-Alliance (MS) for funding and Dr. Kalidas Kohale for zebrafish maintenance.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Animal experimentation: The zebrafish maintenance and experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee vide Reference- TIFR/IAEC/2017-11.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>R scripts consisting of codes used to analyse data for localisation of E-cadherin and Lgl, and for cell morphological parameters from various genetic conditions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-49064-supp1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-49064-transrepform-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

E-cadherin in zebrafish&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This paper breaks new ground into how apicobasal polarity is established in the developing epidermis using the zebrafish as a model. While we all felt that the paper was of fundamental interest to our larger understanding of how apical-basal polarity is established in developing epidermis, all of the reviewers in their reviews and discussion had concerns about the basic localization of E-cadherin. This was a concern for the wild type samples--as they differed between different figures, which made interpretation of modulations with different mutants difficult to interpret. We all felt that all E-cadherin localization studies as well as other localizations needed to be shown within the context of other clear markers. Without the comparisons, it is difficult to assess where proteins are localizing (a sort of chicken and egg conundrum). Even having an overall membrane marker like DiI and DNA stain might be useful backdrops in which to make these comparisons as well as scans going through several cell layers, so that one could see E-cadherin basally in the top layer and apically in the bottom layer. Other points raised by the specific comments of reviewers (below) question the causality of the E-cadherin experiments and would also need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Arora and colleagues demonstrates a novel mechanism for how epidermal cells within the zebrafish establish apical basal polarity during development, which could have implications for other bilayered epithelia that coat organs. They show that, surprisingly, E-cadherin is polarized more basally in the outer peridermal cells and apical in the basal cells. Using morpholinos and E-cadherin rescue that E-cadherin in one layer sets up polarity in the overlying or underlying layer. Using mutations in lgl and has (apkc), they show that E-cadherin and apkc restrict localization of each in a cell-autonomous way and that E-cadherin negatively regulates Lgl localization. This is a nice study that shows how polarity may be set up in multilayered epithelia that by inference of how cell-cell contacts are set up and reinforced in a monolayer extrapolates a novel function in a bilayer for setting up polarity in the layer below or above. I think that this study is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> but I have some issues that I would like the authors to address before this happens.</p><p>1) The manuscript needs tightening up. It is written in a long-winded way with too much detail in the main text where I found it difficult to follow the main directive of each experiment. Likewise, the figures could be more compact-there were many times where I wanted to see several of the markers that they were looking at co-stained, rather than in supplementary figures at the bottom that lacked the other marker context. I think it is imperative that the co-stainings are together, especially as the localization at the apex or base is being measured.</p><p>2) The apical versus basal localization needs better analysis and description. Everyone assumes that E-cadherin localizes apically so it is still hard to believe that most of it is basal in the periderm. To prove this better, they need to (a) label with another marker in the same cells so that we can be certain that we are actually starting at the top of the cell and scanning to the very bottom of the cell, (b) indicate in μm where we are from the top of the cell, (c) show a scan going from the top of a peridermal cell to the bottom of the basal cell. I think that these experiments would prove their point better as it currently seems very arbitrary what they call top and bottom. Again, this study could be combined with the other markers (b-catenin, lgl, apkc) in Figure 1, which could correlate well with the model in Figure 6. As it is now, we have to piece together the bits of data and it isn't obvious or all that convincing.</p><p>3) Why is there more E-cadherin apically in Figure 2 wildtype than in Figure 1? In Figure 1 there is hardly any E-cadherin and that just seems weird.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes how the epidermis polarizes in zebrafish. The authors propose that aPKC promoted E-cadherin polarization in periderm affects the levels of E-cadherin and Lgl2 in the underlying basal epidermal cell layer. The mutant phenotypes are very carefully analysed and the reduction of E-cadherin in a layer non-autonomous manner is an interesting observation. However, I believe there are serious issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors observe a reversed trend for E-cadherin polarity in periderm and underlying basal epidermal cell layers. How can this observation be reconciled with the non-reversed apicobasal polarities of these two layers?</p><p>2) The authors suggest a novel stepwise mechanism of polarity transduction. However, the lasting polarity of basal epidermal cells in has/apkc mutants might support an independent mechanism of polarization in this layer. Moreover, the data on E-cadherin knock-down do not clearly support an E-cadherin mediated transduction of polarity mechanism. E-cadherin knock down experiments should be better quantified, just like the mutant phenotypes. aPKC, E-cadherin and Lgl2 polarity distributions with reduced levels of E-cadherin should be provided. Only this will allow to conclude on the role of E-cadherin trans-binding in cell polarization.</p><p>3) Trans-interactions of E-cadherin is the suggested mediator of stepwise polarity transduction. However, a mechanistic insight into this process is lacking. The authors should come up at least with some preliminary insight into the mechanism(s) by which E-cadherin trans-binding controls the level and distribution of E-caherin in the binding cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors study a very important question, which is how the polarized distribution of adherens junctions in the developing epidermis is achieved. Specifically, they show that in zebrafish embryos the periderm and basal epidermis display an opposite gradient of E-cadherin expression and state a role of aPKC in maintaining this E-cadherin gradient in the periderm. Furthermore, they propose that peridermal polarity, initiated by aPKC, is transduced in a stepwise manner by E-cadherin to the basal layer in a non-autonomous manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the results rely exclusively on the quantification of fluorescence intensity in several cell boundaries, at each z-point, manually applying Fiji software tools. These values are then converted to AU. However, no other means supporting the use of this approach are provided. I think it is difficult to use measurements of fluorescence intensity of antibody staining for comparisons. Can the authors provide other experiments to support the exclusive use of this approach?</p><p>2) Authors say that adherens junctions are localized in a polarized manner. However, there is a discrepancy: they show that E-cadherin is faintly present at 48hpf in the basal domain of the periderm, whereas expression of β-catenin can be observed since 24hpf. How can this be explained? What is β-catenin attached to? Can this unveil one of the drawbacks pointed in before?</p><p>3) The &quot;length&quot; of the apico-basal gradient and cell sizes are measured according to the number of z-stacks that show the specific staining. Authors should provide the z-stacks projections to back up all the performed quantifications. With this information they will be able to observe at what apico-basal level aPKC disappears, and E-cadherin expression appears. One possibility is to use the transgenic line Lyn:GFP, and immunostain for E-cadherin and aPKC in that context. This would help to understand what happens with the height of the cells. According to the Figure 2B1 it seems that the mutant cells are indeed smaller than the wt siblings (in the very same square surface 4 wt basal epidermis wt cells can fit, and around 6 has/apkc cells are included), although the apical perimeter measurements do not show so. Are the authors sure that all pictures have the same magnification? Are the cells smaller but have more membrane blebblings that could account for these numbers? Shouldn't the numbers be normalized according to overall membrane staining, not to E-cadherin expression?</p><p>4) The functional experiments do not provide convincing data to support the stated conclusions. Again, all the analyses rely on the approaches mentioned before, and they are difficult to interpret. How aPKC, lgr and E-cadherin are distributed along the apico-basal domain? This would be important to better understand the phenotypes.</p><p>5) Controls about the efficiency of the morpholino should be included, as well as numbers of embryos displaying the phenotype. It would be nice to have more information about the kind of morpholino employed.</p><p>Can authors provide the numbers for wt/mutants? How many cells/boundaries were analyzed and how many embryos displayed the phenotype? Can they provide information about the penetrance and the expressivity of the observed phenotypes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49064.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While we all felt that the paper was of fundamental interest to our larger understanding of how apical-basal polarity is established in developing epidermis, all of the reviewers in their reviews and discussion had concerns about the basic localization of E-cadherin.

We would like to point out that the study involves fluorescence intensity measurements and it was important to maintain the fluorescence intensities at non-saturating levels while imaging. The intensity differences seen in some of our samples are a consequence of our attempt to control the saturation. The E-cadherin levels are high at 72hpf and show saturation while imaging if the gain is set according to the 48hpf embryos. As a consequence, in these sets wherein the PMT gain is set using 72hpf, the E-cadherin intensity at 48hpf seems much weaker in comparison to the other sets. This is obvious when Ecadherin levels at 48hpf in Figure 1A are compared with those in Figure 2. We have included these imaging details in the Materials and methods section in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We all felt that all E-cadherin localization studies as well as other localizations needed to be shown within the context of other clear markers. Without the comparisons, it is difficult to assess where proteins are localizing (a sort of chicken and egg conundrum). Even having an overall membrane marker like DiI and DNA stain might be useful backdrops in which to make these comparisons as well as scans going through several cell layers, so that one could see E-cadherin basally in the top layer and apically in the bottom layer.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very good suggestion. To address this issue, we tried various membrane labels such as CAAX-GFP, CAAX-mCherry, DiI, FM 1-43 dye, WGA, and Tg(bactin:mKate2-ras) (Sidhaye and Norden, 2017) to mark the membrane in both the epidermal layers.

To obtain preliminary mechanistic insights into the functioning of E-cadherin in regulation of polarity, we attempted to test whether the function of E-cadherin as a mediator of adhesion or its role in organisation of cortex/signalling is important for regulation of polarity across the layers. For this, we generated mutant version of E-cadherin lacking a) EC-1 and EC-2 domains (Kardash et al., 2010; Leckband and de Rooij, 2014) and b) the cytoplasmic tail of Ecadherin, which harbours β-catenin binding domain (Gottardi et al., 2001). Unfortunately, both these deletion mutants did not localise when mRNA was injected, precluding the possibility of assessing them in E-cadherin deficient background (by morpholino injections). Also, upon plasmid injections, only EC1-EC2 domain deletion localised to the membrane. Our data indicate the EC1EC2 domain, presumably via tension-mediated mechanisms, regulate Lgl localisation in the epidermis. This preliminary analysis has been included in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Arora and colleagues demonstrates a novel mechanism for how epidermal cells within the zebrafish establish apical basal polarity during development, which could have implications for other bilayered epithelia that coat organs. They show that, surprisingly, E-cadherin is polarized more basally in the outer peridermal cells and apical in the basal cells. Using morpholinos and E-cadherin rescue that E-cadherin in one layer sets up polarity in the overlying or underlying layer. Using mutations in lgl and has (apkc), they show that E-cadherin and apkc restrict localization of each in a cell-autonomous way and that E-cadherin negatively regulates Lgl localization. This is a nice study that shows how polarity may be set up in multilayered epithelia that by inference of how cell-cell contacts are set up and reinforced in a monolayer extrapolates a novel function in a bilayer for setting up polarity in the layer below or above. I think that this study is suitable for eLife but I have some issues that I would like the authors to address before this happens.</p><p>1) The manuscript needs tightening up. It is written in a long-winded way with too much detail in the main text where I found it difficult to follow the main directive of each experiment. Likewise, the figures could be more compact-there were many times where I wanted to see several of the markers that they were looking at co-stained, rather than in supplementary figures at the bottom that lacked the other marker context. I think it is imperative that the co-stainings are together, especially as the localization at the apex or base is being measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tightened up the manuscript by either eliminating the unimportant details or by moving them to the methods part. We have also revised the Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to include all the co-staining together for the ready reference of the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The apical versus basal localization needs better analysis and description. Everyone assumes that E-cadherin localizes apically so it is still hard to believe that most of it is basal in the periderm. To prove this better, they need to (a) label with another marker in the same cells so that we can be certain that we are actually starting at the top of the cell and scanning to the very bottom of the cell, (b) indicate in μm where we are from the top of the cell, (c) show a scan going from the top of a peridermal cell to the bottom of the basal cell. I think that these experiments would prove their point better as it currently seems very arbitrary what they call top and bottom. Again, this study could be combined with the other markers (b-catenin, lgl, apkc) in Figure 1, which could correlate well with the model in Figure 6. As it is now, we have to piece together the bits of data and it isn't obvious or all that convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very useful suggestion. To address this comment, we tried several membrane markers such as CAAX-GFP, CAAX-mCherry, DiI, FM 1-43 dye, Tg(bactin:mKate2-ras) (Sidhaye and Norden, 2017) and WGA to mark the membrane in both the epidermal layers. As stated above Lyn-GFP driven in peridermal cells by <italic>claudin b</italic> promoter (suggested by reviewer # 3) worked the best. We have now provided histological sections as well as confocal scans going through the entire epidermis (top of the periderm to the bottom of the basal epidermis) showing localization of E-cadherin, aPKC and Lgl in the context of Lyn-GFP. These data are included in revised Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We have also mentioned the actual distance (in µm) of the confocal slice from the top</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why is there more E-cadherin apically in Figure 2 wildtype than in Figure 1? In Figure 1 there is hardly any E-cadherin and that just seems weird.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewers’ concern. As stated in response to the Editor’s comment, the intensity differences are a consequence of our attempt to avoid the saturation. E-cadherin levels are high at 72hpf and show saturation while imaging if the PMT gain is set according to the 48hpf embryos. Therefore, in sets wherein the PMT gain is set using 72hpf, the E-cadherin intensity at 48hpf seems much weaker in comparison to the other sets. We have included imaging details in the Materials and methods section in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper describes how the epidermis polarizes in zebrafish. The authors propose that aPKC promoted E-cadherin polarization in periderm affects the levels of E-cadherin and Lgl2 in the underlying basal epidermal cell layer. The mutant phenotypes are very carefully analyzed and the reduction of E-cadherin in a layer non-autonomous manner is an interesting observation. However, I believe there are serious issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors observe a reversed trend for E-cadherin polarity in periderm and underlying basal epidermal cell layers. How can this observation be reconciled with the non-reversed apicobasal polarities of these two layers?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Our data clearly points to the fact that E-cadherin polarity is reversed in the epidermal layers. While there is basolateral enrichment of E-cadherin in the periderm, its localisation in the basal epidermis is clearly enriched at the apico-lateral domain. However, we did not observe localisation of aPKC in the apical domain of the basal epidermal cells during early development. This means that although there is a histologically defined apical domain (opposite to the basal domain facing the ECM) for the basal cells, this domain may not be molecularly specified at this early stage. It appears that the molecular identity of the histological apical domain of the basal epidermal cells remains undefined at the early stages of the epidermis development (or it may be a feature of the bilayered epithelial systems in general). E-cadherin sets up the rudimentary but reversed polarities in the periderm and basal epidermis, making apical domain of the periderm (aPKC localisation, microridges) and basal domain of the basal epidermis (hemidesmosome formation), more specified. The basal epidermal cells may get the real apical identity at the “molecular” level possibly at a later stage when the polarity of the basal cells becomes important for the asymmetric cell division during stratification, as shown in mice (Helfrich et al., 2007; Lechler and Fuchs, 2005; Niessen et al., 2013; Tunggal et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2011, 2014). Experimental reconciliation of the reversed E-cadherin polarity with the non-reversed apical-basal polarities require much detailed analyses involving multiple apicalbasal markers at early as well as later developmental stages. Such analyses are not feasible at this stage. Therefore, we have discussed this issue in detail in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors suggest a novel stepwise mechanism of polarity transduction. However, the lasting polarity of basal epidermal cells in has/apkc mutants might support an independent mechanism of polarization in this layer. Moreover, the data on E-cadherin knock-down do not clearly support an E-cadherin mediated transduction of polarity mechanism. E-cadherin knock down experiments should be better quantified, just like the mutant phenotypes. aPKC, E-cadherin and Lgl2 polarity distributions with reduced levels of E-cadherin should be provided. Only this will allow to conclude on the role of E-cadherin trans-binding in cell polarization.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have quantified E-cadherin, Lgl and aPKC levels to measure the effect on their localization upon <italic>e-cadherin</italic> knockdown. These analyses clearly reveal the layerautonomous as well as layer non-autonomous effect of E-cadherin loss in the epidermis.</p><p>As for the lack of polarity phenotype in the basal epidermis of the <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant – – it is important to note that in the absence of aPKC function, the E-cadherin polarity is noisy but not completely lost. Such a partially polarised periderm may still be able to transduce the polarity cues to the basal epidermis to set up the E-cadherin polarity. However, in the absence of E-cadherin in the periderm, such polarity cues are completely lost resulting in a loss of E-cadherin localisation and increased Lgl localisation in the basal layer. It is likely that there are redundant mechanisms controlling E-cadherin polarity in the periderm. To fully perturb the E-cadherin polarity, disruption of these redundant pathway components would be essential. These arguments have been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Trans-interactions of E-cadherin is the suggested mediator of stepwise polarity transduction. However, a mechanistic insight into this process is lacking. The authors should come up at least with some preliminary insight into the mechanism(s) by which E-cadherin trans-binding controls the level and distribution of E-caherin in the binding cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We made an attempt to get mechanistic insights using mutant version of E-cadherin lacking EC-1 and EC-2 domains (Kardash et al., 2010; Leckband and de Rooij, 2014) and cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin, which harbours β-catenin binding domain (Gottardi et al., 2001). This approach did not yield clear results. Both the deleted versions did not localise when mRNA was injected. This did not allow us to test their phenotypes in the absence of endogenous E-cadherin (achieved by morpholino injections). Besides, plasmid encoded cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant did not localise to the membrane in our hands. EC1-EC2 domain deleted version of E-cadherin localised to the membrane when expressed under CMV promoter using plasmid. Our data suggest that EC1-EC2 domains are important for regulation of Lgl localisation. However, expression of this mutant version did not have any influence on E-cadherin localisation either autonomously or in layer-non-autonomous manner. These data suggest that the effect is not mediated via homophilic interactions but tension-mediated mechanisms are at play in this regulation. This is also supported by the fact that loss of E-cadherin results in much wide-spread (beyond the clones) phenotypes in E-cadherin and Lgl2 localisation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper the authors study a very important question, which is how the polarized distribution of adherens junctions in the developing epidermis is achieved. Specifically, they show that in zebrafish embryos the periderm and basal epidermis display an opposite gradient of E-cadherin expression and state a role of aPKC in maintaining this E-cadherin gradient in the periderm. Furthermore, they propose that peridermal polarity, initiated by aPKC, is transduced in a stepwise manner by E-cadherin to the basal layer in a non-autonomous manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the results rely exclusively on the quantification of fluorescence intensity in several cell boundaries, at each z-point, manually applying Fiji software tools. These values are then converted to AU. However, no other means supporting the use of this approach are provided. I think it is difficult to use measurements of fluorescence intensity of antibody staining for comparisons. Can the authors provide other experiments to support the exclusive use of this approach?</p></disp-quote><p>Currently, quantification of fluorescence intensity is the best possible way for us to show the Ecadherin polarity, at the endogenous levels, and assess the effect of <italic>apkc</italic> loss on it. We have done this reproducibly in the lab and others have also used similar approaches (Bradley and Drissi, 2011; Hultin et al., 2017; Mantyh et al., 1997; Pocha et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2003). To address the reviewers’ concern, we have included live imaging based quantification of mCherry tagged E-cadherin. These analyses further support our claim of reverse polarity of E-cadherin in the epidermal layers of zebrafish (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) as well as the noisy polarity phenotype that we observe in <italic>has/apkc</italic> mutant (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>In addition, we have included histological sections to show the polarised localisation of Ecadherin. We have also analysed localisation of E-cadherin, Lgl2 and aPKC in the presence of a membrane marker (lyn-GFP) using immunohistology.

However, there is a discrepancy: they show that E-cadherin is faintly present at 48hpf in the basal domain of the periderm, whereas expression of β-catenin can be observed since 24hpf. How can this be explained? What is β-catenin attached to? Can this unveil one of the drawbacks pointed in before?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that the depletion of E-cadherin results in a considerable reduction in Betacatenin localisation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This result indicates that there are no other cadherins, (for example, P-cadherin) present in the epidermis, to which Β-catenin binds. We have used cross-reacting primary antibodies raised against mouse E-cadherin and chicken Betacatenin. The binding affinities of these cross-reacting antibodies towards the zebrafish antigen may not necessarily be the same. This would explain the intensity difference seen between Ecadherin and Β-catenin staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The &quot;length&quot; of the apico-basal gradient and cell sizes are measured according to the number of z-stacks that show the specific staining. Authors should provide the z-stacks projections to back up all the performed quantifications. With this information they will be able to observe at what apico-basal level aPKC disappears, and E-cadherin expression appears. One possibility is to use the transgenic line Lyn:GFP, and immunostain for E-cadherin and aPKC in that context. This would help to understand what happens with the height of the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very useful suggestion.
