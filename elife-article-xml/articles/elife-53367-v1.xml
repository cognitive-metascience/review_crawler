strategies for overcoming resistance to platinum chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma has previously been hampered by inappropriately tailored in vitro assays of drug response. Therefore, using a pulse model that closely mimics the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum therapy, we profiled cisplatin-induced signalling, DNA-damage and apoptotic responses across a panel of human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. By coupling this data to real-time, single-cell imaging of cell cycle and apoptosis we provide a fine-grained stratification of response, where a P70S6K-mediated signalling axis promotes resistance on a <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype or null background, but not a mutant <italic>TP53</italic> background. This finding highlights the value of in vitro models that match the physiological pharmacokinetics of drug exposure. Furthermore, it also demonstrates the importance of a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between somatic mutations and the signalling networks that govern drug response for the implementation of any consistently effective, patient-specific therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer, and it emerges because of a variety of harmful genetic changes, or mutations.

Yet, only 30% of patients actually respond to the therapy.

These experiments showed that the lung adenocarcinoma cells which resisted treatment also carried high levels of a protein known as P70S6K. Pairing platinum-based chemotherapy with a drug that blocks the activity of P70S6K killed these resistant cells. This combination also treated human lung adenocarcinoma tumours growing under the skin of mice. However, it was ineffective on cancerous cells that carry a mutation in a protein called p53, which is often defective in cancers.</p><p>Overall, this work demonstrates the need to refine how drugs are tested in the laboratory to better reflect real-life conditions.

Lung adenocarcinoma is typically diagnosed late, meaning that most patients require systemic chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Platinum-based chemotherapy is likely to remain an important treatment modality for these patients due to the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies in EGFR, ALK or ROS mutant tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lindeman et al., 2018</xref>), and the fact that most patients do not respond to single agent immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doroshow et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the use of platinum-based chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma for over four decades, response rates remain below 30% due to the prevalence of innate resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pilkington et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonanno et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, dose-related nephrotoxicity remains a challenge in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pabla and Dong, 2008</xref>). Strategies to improve platinum efficacy could therefore significantly improve outcomes for lung adenocarcinoma patients. However, unravelling platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma has proven challenging, as over 147 mechanisms of resistance have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart, 2007</xref>), yet there remains a lack of viable clinical options to improve response rates.</p><p>From an experimental viewpoint, discordance between the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum chemotherapies and their use within in vitro assays has likely contributed to the identification of putative resistance mechanisms and drug targets that have not ultimately translated to the clinic. Traditionally, in vitro methods for the investigation of drug response have involved culturing cancer cells in the continuous presence of high-dose chemotherapy over several days. This contrasts with pharmacokinetic studies in humans and rodents demonstrating that both cisplatin and carboplatin are rapidly cleared from the circulation, and the tumour, within 2–3 hr following administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johansen et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, in this study we have utilised a cisplatin pulse model, which more closely recapitulates these physiological pharmacokinetics, aiming to maintain the fidelity of the apoptotic mechanism mediated by cisplatin in vivo.</p><p>We have previously shown that predictive computational models of drug-induced apoptotic signalling dynamics can be used as a prognostic indicator of neuroblastoma patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fey et al., 2015</xref>). To move towards a similar concept to platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma, we now present an in-depth analysis of the dynamic signalling response to a pulse of platinum chemotherapy, describing the relationship between a number of key signalling nodes, the DNA damage response and platinum sensitivity. Importantly, we also propose a therapeutic strategy targeting P70S6K using the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib, with the potential to improve the efficacy of current platinum-based treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Continuous versus pulsed cisplatin treatment</title><p>In order to directly compare the response of lung adenocarcinoma cells to the continuous presence of cisplatin, or a pulse of cisplatin that mimics in vivo pharmacokinetics (2 hr, 5 μg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we monitored the growth and apoptosis of the innately resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marini et al., 2018</xref>) by both live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a cell viability assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), under both conditions. This analysis demonstrated that while continuous exposure to cisplatin resulted in decreased cell number and increased apoptosis over 72 hr, a pulse of cisplatin only reduced the rate of cell proliferation and did not induce apoptosis.</p><p>To further examine the differences between these two models, we used multiplexed, bead-based protein analysis to investigate the DNA damage, apoptotic and signalling response for key pathway components previously implicated in the response to continuous cisplatin exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As might be expected, the continuous exposure model resulted in a significantly elevated and sustained DNA damage response when compared to the pulse model, particularly for the phosphorylation of Chk2 (Ser345), p53 (Ser15 and Ser46), pH2A.X (Ser139 - γH2A.X) and expression of p21 and MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This heightened DNA damage response during the continuous exposure to cisplatin was also reflected in the increased activation of Caspase 3, which was completely absent for the pulse model. Furthermore, while p38 and ERK activation were significantly increased in cells continuously exposed to cisplatin, the expression of MCL-1 and detection of MCL-1/Bak dimers only significantly increased in cells treated with a pulse of cisplatin. This finding demonstrates that not only does the continuous exposure model result in a DNA damage and apoptotic response that is incongruent with that observed following a pulse of cisplatin, the dynamics of key signalling pathways are fundamentally different between these two treatment models. Taken together, this data demonstrates that previous mechanisms of platinum resistance established using a continuous exposure model should be reconsidered in the light of these new findings regarding the response to physiological levels of drug exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Response to cisplatin is not associated with either TP53 status or drug-efflux</title><p>To investigate potential mechanisms of platinum resistance using a model consistent with the physiological pharmacokinetics of platinum therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we applied this cisplatin pulse model to a panel of six lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with distinct <italic>TP53</italic> mutation backgrounds (two wildtype lines, two mutant <italic>TP53</italic> lines and two <italic>TP53</italic> null) and measured the apoptotic response at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Furthermore, these cisplatin-DNA adducts progressively resolved over a 72 hr period in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming that pathways responsible for facilitating the removal of cisplatin adducts are also functional across this panel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Multi-dimensional analysis of cisplatin-induced signalling dynamics</title><p>To gain an understanding of the wider signalling networks associated with resistance to platinum therapy, we utilised multiplexed, magnetic bead based assays to profile the signalling and DNA damage response at multiple time points following a 2 hr pulse of cisplatin, across all six cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For this analysis, we tracked the dynamics of 47 different protein analytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) over a 72 hr period, focusing on elements of signalling network structures that we recently implicated in platinum chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marini et al., 2018</xref>), including the MAPK, PI3K/mTOR, NF-κB and TGFβ pathways, as well as a number of key apoptotic mediators and DNA damage response proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>From this dataset, a clear correlation can be seen between the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status of each cell line and the dynamics of the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), which validates the fidelity of the multiplexed platform for this type of analysis. In line with the detection of cisplatin-DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), Chk1 (Ser345) phosphorylation increased rapidly in all lines following the 2 hr pulse, followed by a slower wave of Chk2 (Thr68) phosphorylation in all lines except SW-1573. Within both the <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype cell lines (A549 and SW-1573) this was followed by phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15 and Ser46), the accumulation of total p53 and increased expression of the p53 transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21. In the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant cell lines (NCI-H1573 and NCI-H1975) p53 phosphorylation still occurred, however in line with their loss of DNA binding capability, this did not result in increased expression of MDM2 or p21. As would be expected for the <italic>TP53</italic> null lines (NCI-H358 and NCI-H1299), p53 is absent and therefore not detected in either the total or phosphorylated form. Interestingly though, there was a significant increase in p21 and MDM2 expression in the NCI-H358 line in the absence of p53 expression.</p><p>As we had already determined that <italic>TP53</italic> status alone was not sufficient to explain resistance to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we further analysed the whole dataset by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This form of dimensionality reduction can be used to identify correlative relationships between variables within a large dataset, and here we have used it to create a visual representation of the association between key signalling nodes and the response to cisplatin across the entire cell line panel. Using this multi-dimensional analysis, we were able to capture ~70% of variance in the dataset within the first four principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Unsurprisingly, plotting the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) resulted in separation of the cell lines primarily according to their <italic>TP53</italic> status. As might be expected, within PC1 and PC2 the <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type A549 and SW-1573 lines associated with higher p21 and MDM2 expression, while the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant lines separated from the <italic>TP53</italic> null lines mostly on the basis of higher p53 expression and phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). However, plotting the third and fourth principal components (PC3 and PC4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>) created a clear delineation between the three most resistant cell lines (A549, NCI-H358 and NCI-H1573), which cluster towards the left hand side of PC3 (x-axis), and the three most sensitive lines (SW-1573, NCI-1975 and NCI-H1299) which move progressively along PC3 over the 72 hr timeframe.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualisation of principal component 1 (PC1) against component 2 (PC2) for the principal component analysis of cisplatin induced signalling across the cell line panel.

While increasing levels of apoptosis are observed over time in the three sensitive cell lines (SW-1573, NCI-1975 and NCI-H1299), the three resistant cell lines display significantly lower levels of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and do not move along PC3 towards the region of DNA damage and apoptosis. Instead the NCI-H358 and NCI-1573 lines remain towards the left hand side of PC3, in a region characterised by higher phosphorylation of the mTOR pathway component P70S6K (Thr389), the MAPK components MEK1 (Ser217/221) and P90RSK (S380), NF-κB (S536) and IκBα (Ser32/36) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The resistant A549 line also remains shifted towards the left of PC3, although also moves up PC4 towards a region with higher expression of TGFβRII, cleaved caspase 9, pAkt (Ser473) and pSTAT3 (Ser727) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The association of elevated pMEK (Ser217/221), pNF-κB (S536), pSTAT3 (Ser727) and pP70S6K (Thr389) within these resistant cell lines was also further confirmed by western blotting of independent samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The clear separation of resistant and sensitive cell lines within this multi-dimensional analysis suggests an antagonistic relationship between apoptosis promoted through the progressive accumulation of DNA-damage following a cisplatin pulse, and elevated mTOR, MAPK, Akt, STAT or NF- κB signalling events. However, as a statistical process, relationships derived from a principal component analysis are purely correlative in nature and require a further degree of validation before any causative conclusions may be drawn. We therefore sought to identify effectors of platinum resistance by including specific inhibitors of these signalling pathway components during and after the 2 hr cisplatin pulse, followed by a measurement of apoptosis at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using the resistant A549 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and NCI-H358 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) cell lines we observed that specific inhibitors of Akt (MK2206), STAT3 (S3I-201), MEK (UO126) or NF- κB (SC-75741) did not significantly increase apoptosis in either cell line, suggesting that while elevated activity of these signalling proteins may be present in one or both of these resistant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), they are not causally associated with resistance to cisplatin. Instead, under these conditions, only the inhibition of P70S6K with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. P70S6K is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase known to require phosphorylation by both PI3K and mTOR for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sunami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moser et al., 1997</xref>). While dactolisib will result in the inhibition of a number of substrates downstream of both PI3K and mTOR, the lack of sensitisation by an Akt inhibitor (MK2206) suggests a specific role for P70S6K in mediating resistance to cisplatin.</p><p>Taking the opposite approach, elevated levels of JNK pathway activity (pJNK, pc-Jun) were also observed following cisplatin treatment within the SW-1573 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,E</xref>). However, the inclusion of a JNK inhibitor (JNK inhibitor VIII) did not prevent cisplatin induced apoptosis in this cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that JNK activity was not promoting apoptosis in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>P70S6K promotes platinum resistance in lung adenocarcinoma</title><p>Comparing the relative expression levels of phosphorylated P70S6K across our stratified panel of cell lines, higher expression was observed in the resistant NCI-H358 and NCI-H1573 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This expression pattern was also mirrored by the levels of total P70S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which seems to be primarily driving the observed levels of P70S6K phosphorylation. Interestingly, the resistant A549 line did not have elevated P70S6K expression or phosphorylation, although as reflected in the PCA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) this cell line did have high expression of the P70S6K substrate, Ribosomal Protein S6, leading to a level of phosphorylation equivalent to that observed in the resistant NCI-H358 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Utilising the highest expressing (NCI-H358) and lowest expressing (NCI-H1299) lines, which are also both <italic>TP53</italic> null, we observed that cisplatin treatment resulted in greater caspase 3 cleavage and γH2A.X expression in the sensitive NCI-H1299 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is in line with the multiplexed signalling analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Crucially, treatment of the resistant NCI-H358 line with dactolisib during and after the cisplatin pulse increased both caspase 3 cleavage and γH2A.X expression to that observed in the sensitive NCI-H1299 line. Conceptually, this now mimics the movement of the resistant NCI-H358 line along PC3 of our PCA analysis, towards the region of DNA damage and apoptosis characterised by the sensitive cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). This finding demonstrates that while this form of multi-dimensional analysis of signalling networks creates a set of correlative relationships, this data can also be utilised to investigate causal effectors of downstream cellular behaviour.</p><p>As mentioned above, dactolisib can efficiently inhibit the phosphorylation of P70S6K, but will also result in the inhibition of a number of other potential PI3K/mTOR substrates. To confirm that P70S6K is a key downstream component mediating platinum resistance in this context, we knocked down P70S6K using two independent siRNAs in the NCI-H358 line, prior to proceeding with a cisplatin pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Under these conditions, cisplatin treatment resulted in significantly higher caspase 3 cleavage and γH2A.X expression in the P70S6K knockdown NCI-H358 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), whilst P70S6K knockdown did not further sensitise the already cisplatin-sensitive NCI-H1299 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, P70S6K knockdown with both siRNAs also significantly increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the NCI-H358 cells, to the same extent as that observed with dactolisib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the efficacy this combination therapy approach in vivo and validate the findings of our pulse model, we treated mice bearing NCI-H358 xenografts with either carboplatin, dactolisib, or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). For this model, dactolisib (45 mg/kg) was delivered by oral gavage, prior to a one-off intraperitoneal injection of carboplatin (60 mg/kg), and throughout the course of the experiment. Under these conditions, carboplatin had no significant effect upon tumour growth, while dactolisib had a moderate effect as a single agent that was only significant at days 14 and 17. However the combination of carboplatin and dactolisib completely halted tumour growth, even up to 28 days following the single pulse of carboplatin treatment. Furthermore, an analysis of tumour sections revealed that the carboplatin and dactolisib treated xenografts were not only smaller in size, but also had significantly larger regions of necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>These findings demonstrate that elevated P70S6K activity can specifically mediate resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma, which can be effectively targeted with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib. Importantly, elevated P70S6K activity is frequently observed in several cancer subtypes, including lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and its overexpression is commonly associated with aggressive malignant phenotypes and poor overall prognoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ip and Wong, 2012</xref>).

Notably, the NCI-H1573 (<italic>TP53</italic> mutant) and NCI-H358 (<italic>TP53</italic> null) cells delayed for more time in G2 (G2 arrest; mean 2443 min and 2555 min respectively) compared to A549 cells (mean 1426 min), after which the mutant and null cells often entered a prolonged aberrant mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in a small increase in cells dying during mitosis or in the following G1/S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, death after mitosis; DAM). In contrast, A549 cells rarely entered into mitosis, instead many of these S/G2 arrested cells turned from green (S/G2) back to red (G1) without undergoing mitosis (G2-exit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar G2-exit, senescence state has been reported to be dependent on p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gire and Dulic, 2015</xref>) and likely provides <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype cells protection from death by preventing progression through an aberrant mitosis. Therefore, to confirm the specific role of p53 in this context, this assay was repeated with an siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In line with this hypothesis, this orthogonal approach revealed a significant increase in G2-arrest in the p53 knockdown cells, along with a decrease in occurrence of G2-exit, effectively pheno-copying the observed difference between the A549 wildtype and NCI-H358 p53 null cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>Treatment of all cell lines with dactolisib as a single agent also caused a significant increase in G1 arrest both before (G1 ABM) and after mitosis (G1 AAM), irrespective of <italic>TP53</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Consequently, for all cell lines, dactolisib treatment of cells within early G1 phase during the cisplatin pulse resulted in many cells remaining arrested and viable in G1 (G1 ABM), highlighting the importance of DNA replication for inducing cisplatin induced toxicity and killing. However, for the <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype and null cells that were in late G1 or S phase at the time of cisplatin pulsing, dactolisib treatment significantly reduced S/G2 transit time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and greatly increased the number of cells that underwent apoptosis before mitosis (Death before mitosis; DBM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Notably, dactolisib treatment did not prevent cisplatin treated cells from entering into an aberrant mitosis, but did significantly increase the duration of mitotic arrest, independent of <italic>TP53</italic> status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which correlated with an increase in death during or after mitosis (DAM) in <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype and null, but not mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Surprisingly, dactolisib treatment did not result in any sensitisation of <italic>TP53</italic> mutant H1573 cells to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which also corresponded with a failure of dactolisib to significantly reduce S/G2 phase transit time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In summary, combination therapy with dactolisib sensitised actively cycling cells to cisplatin through distinct mechanisms dependent on <italic>TP53</italic> status. In the <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype A549 cells it induced pre-mitotic cell death and prevented cells from undergoing a protective G2-exit, which is likely partially dependent on the p53-p21 axis. Similarly, in the <italic>TP53</italic> null line, dactolisib promoted both pre-mitotic cell death and the entry of cells into a prolonged deleterious aberrant mitosis, the latter likely due to a weakened p53-dependent G2 checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Engeland, 2018</xref>). While in <italic>TP53</italic> mutant H1573 cells, there was no significant sensitisation due to a sustained S/G2 arrest in the presence of dactolisib.</p><p>To further confirm the specific role of P70S6K in this cell cycle phenotype, this assay was repeated along with siRNA mediated P70S6K knockdown in the resistant NCI-H358 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This approach demonstrated that specific ablation of P70S6K in this model resulted in a non-significant trend towards a shortened G2-arrest with both P70S6K siRNAs, and a greatly increased cell death both before (DBM) or after mitosis (DAM). While the non-significant decrease in G2-arrest observed upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of P70S6K may have been limited by potential heterogeneity in the level of knockdown achieved, the increase in cell death further suggests that dactolisib mediated inhibition of P70S6K is responsible for the sensitisation of lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Response to dactolisib is dependent upon TP53 status</title><p>A notable observation arising from this cell cycle analysis was the ability of dactolisib to increase apoptosis by preventing an unexpected cell cycle arrest in the <italic>TP53</italic> null NCI-H358 cell line. Interestingly, this association between cell cycle arrest and cisplatin resistance can also be observed from the original analysis of signalling dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). While both the NCI-H1299 and NCI-H358 cell lines are <italic>TP53</italic> null, there was an increased expression of p21 following cisplatin treatment in the resistant NCI-H358 line, but not the sensitive NCI-H1299 line. Importantly, the increased p21 expression by NCI-H358 cells was also observed by western blotting of independent samples and was efficiently inhibited by both treatment with dactolisib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and the specific knockdown of P70S6K with siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, this data suggests that P70S6K activity is necessary for promoting p21 expression in order to maintain cell cycle arrest following cisplatin treatment. However, in the absence of p53, we observed that this may potentially be mediated by the related transcription factor p63, which is elevated in the NCI-H358 line following treatment with cisplatin, and also inhibited by the addition of dactolisib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) or treatment with P70S6K siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Response to dactolisib is dependent upon <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting on lysates from NCI-H358 and NCI-H1299 cells following a cisplatin pulse, with the addition of dactolisib (1 µM), as indicated.

In accordance with this hypothesis, and in line with the FUCCI single-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), both the <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype cell lines were significantly sensitised to cisplatin by the addition dactolisib, as was the resistant <italic>TP53</italic> null line, NCI-H358 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>). The sensitive <italic>TP53</italic> null line, NCI-H1299, was not further sensitised and appeared to already be at the upper limit of apoptosis within this model. Also, in line with the FUCCI analysis, dactolisib was not able to increase cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant line NCI-H1573, whilst it significantly antagonised cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant NCI-H1975 line.</p><p>While <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status alone is not sufficient to determine sensitivity to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this dependence upon <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status for dactolisib-mediated sensitisation to cisplatin treatment is likely explained by considering the ability of p21 to either maintain a G2-arrest, or promote an aberrant G2-exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gire and Dulic, 2015</xref>), thereby preventing DNA damage induced apoptosis occurring during, or shortly after mitosis. In line with this hypothesis, the addition of dactolisib to the <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype A549 cell line inhibited cisplatin-induced p53 and p21 accumulation, resulting in elevated markers of DNA damage (γH2A.X expression) and apoptosis (caspase 3 cleavage) following cisplatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, in the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant NCI-H1573 line, which was not sensitised by dactolisib, p21 expression was not significantly elevated following cisplatin treatment, and γH2A.X expression and caspase 3 cleavage were unchanged by the addition of dactolisib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic outlining the effect of cisplatin on cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis across the spectrum of TP53 mutation states, and the influence of P70S6K expression levels or inhibition upon these processes.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53367-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To further validate this link between sensitisation by dactolisib and <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status, we took another panel of 8 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and correlated their relative expression of phosphorylated P70S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) to their apoptotic response to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This secondary analysis revealed a general trend towards higher levels of phosphorylated P70S6K and decreased apoptosis in response to cisplatin across the whole panel. However, the strength of this correlation was greatly increased when considering the <italic>TP53</italic> status of the lines, with a strong correlation observed for wildtype <italic>TP53</italic> lines (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.6092) but no correlation for <italic>TP53</italic> mutant lines (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.1764). In agreement with our finding that elevated P70S6K activity promotes resistance in a <italic>TP53</italic> dependent manner, combination therapy with cisplatin and dactolisib significantly sensitised the high pP70S6K/<italic>TP53</italic> wildtype NCI-H292 cell line, but not the high pP70S6K/<italic>TP53</italic> mutant NCI-H2009 line. Therefore, this data demonstrates that P70S6K promotes an aberrant G2-exit or prolonged G2-arrest following cisplatin treatment, presumably through enhanced translation of p53/p21 in <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype cell lines and p63/p21 in <italic>TP53</italic> null lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, in the presence of mutant p53, P70S6K is not able to influence this DNA damage induced signalling axis and is therefore not associated with sensitivity to cisplatin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of studies have been performed investigating the potential mechanisms of resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart, 2007</xref>), although this has yet to result in the identification of clinically successful combination therapies for lung adenocarcinoma. One potential explanation for the high number of in vitro findings that have not translated to the clinic is the use of experimental techniques that do not replicate the in vivo pharmacokinetics of platinum therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). To date, most in vitro approaches have involved continuously culturing cell lines in the presence of high doses of platinum chemotherapy for multiple days, potentially allowing for more extensive DNA damage and off-target effects that would not be seen in vivo. Here we have utilised a pulse model that more accurately models both the concentration and timing of cisplatin that would be observed clinically. This is an important consideration, as platinum therapies are known to act via the formation of DNA adducts, although they are also capable of bonding with proteins and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jamieson and Lippard, 1999</xref>). It is likely that the continuous culturing of cells in the presence of high doses of these drugs in vitro would result in the accumulation of numerous off-target adducts and the activation of a stress response incongruent with the actual in vivo apoptotic mechanism. Indeed, this effect may be apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>/2, where p38 activity is induced by the continuous exposure model, but not by the pulse model. A number of previous studies have implicated the activity of p38 in mediating resistance to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pereira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galan-Moya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hernández Losa et al., 2003</xref>), however we did not observe highly elevated p38 signalling in any cell line following the cisplatin pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), nor a correlation between p38 activity and the apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Instead, through the use of this pulse model, and by overlaying real-time apoptosis data onto a multivariate signalling analysis across a panel of lung adenocarcinoma lines, we have now identified elevated P70S6K activity as an effector of inherent platinum chemoresistance. High levels of P70S6K expression have previously been associated with aggressive tumour behaviour in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), as well as other cancer types such as breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holz, 2012</xref>), colorectal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nozawa et al., 2007</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>) cancers. This is also supported by our analysis of P70S6K expression patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where high mRNA and protein levels were both associated with poor overall survival, and P70S6K protein expression was significantly elevated in relapsed tumours. Importantly, we also propose that combination therapy with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor dactolisib can sensitise lung adenocarcinomas to platinum chemotherapy, although only in the context <italic>TP53</italic> WT or <italic>TP53</italic> null tumours. This detailed mechanistic understanding is especially important given that P70S6K amplification can occur on a background of either mutant or wildtype <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, dactolisib will result in the inhibition of a number of substrates downstream of PI3K and mTOR. However, as the specific knockdown of P70S6K with siRNA recapitulated the effects of dactolisib on p63, p21, γH2A.X, cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis, it is likely that the elevated expression and activity of P70S6K in resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells is the functional target of dactolisib and a causal effector of platinum resistance in these cells. Further supporting this central role of P70S6K, previous research has demonstrated that P70S6K can regulate cell cycle progression via the enhanced translation of p21 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guégan et al., 2014</xref>), although our data also suggest that P70S6K may also play a role in the enhanced expression of both p53 and p63 in this context.</p><p>The combination of cisplatin and dactolisib has also previously been proposed for osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>) and bladder cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moon et al., 2014</xref>). However, our finding that this combination therapy is effective in <italic>TP53</italic> WT and null, but not <italic>TP53</italic> mutant tumours, has significant implications for the clinical application of these drugs and the design of potential clinical trials. This fine grained stratification of response is an important finding, as the failure of many clinical trials is frequently attributed to the lack of suitable biomarkers to stratify the patient cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hay et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting the value of our approach that is capable of dissecting the mechanism of variable drug response across differing genetic backgrounds. The inability of dactolisib to regulate p21 expression in <italic>TP53</italic> mutant tumour cells following cisplatin treatment likely underlies the inability of dactolisib to sensitise these cells to cisplatin. Therefore, within the context of a potential clinical trial for this drug combination, the <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status of each patient tumour would be a central consideration for identification of the most effective treatment strategy and an understanding of individual patient response. However, this finding is also widely applicable to the understanding of how cancer-related signalling networks govern drug response and chemoresistance, and how a thorough characterisation of these dynamics will be necessary for the proper design and implementation of any consistently effective, patient-specific therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cells were FACS sorted based upon Venus fluorescence, and the resulting cell population transduced again with mCherry-hCdt1(30/120) lentiviral particles. mCherry positive cells were FACS sorted, resulting in a double positive population used for live cell imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Samples for flow cytometry were fixed in −20°C ethanol overnight, and then resuspended in a DNA staining solution containing 10 mg/mL RNaseA and 1 mg/mL propidium iodide for 30 min before analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using BD FACS Canto II system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>For the visualisation of cisplatin-DNA adducts following treatment with a pulse of cisplatin (5 μg/mL, 2 hr), cells were grown on Histogrip (Life Technologies) coated glass coverslips. Prior to fixation, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, fixed with ice-cold 100% Methanol and stored overnight at −20°C. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min with 2M HCl to denature the DNA. Cells were washed again and incubated in 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to quench the endogenous peroxidases, before blocking for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 C in blocking solution. The following day, cells were incubated with Secondary-Biotinylated Ab at RT, before incubating them with ABC solution (Vectastain elite ABC HRP kit, Vector Laboratories). Cells were later incubated with TSA solution (TSA plus Cyanine 3 System, PerkinElmer). DNA was stained with H33342 and images collected using a Leica DMI5500 (40x magnification). Images were quantified using Fiji Software. Briefly, color images were split into separate channels. H33342 channel was used to identify the nucleus and generate a mask that was placed on top of the CisPt-DNA channel to quantify the signal coming from the nuclear area. Cytoplasmic area was manually identified in each cell and signal quantified. Background signal was obtained and subtracted from the nuclear and cytoplasm signal. From this data, a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was obtained for between 100 and 200 cells at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MAGPIX multiplex assays</title><p>Multiplex analysis was performed using a Bio-Plex MAGPIX system (#171015044) and Bio-Plex Pro-Wash Station (Biorad). All cell lysates were prepared using standard cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) TritonX-100) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were analysed on all kits, according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Images were taken every 20 min for 72 hr. Before adding any drug (cisplatin, dactolisib or both) an image was taken in order to annotate the cell cycle phase before commencing treatment. Individual cells were tracked manually, with the colour of the nucleus annotated at each time point (Red = G1; Yellow = G1/S, Green = S/G2), the cells were also scored for nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and early signs of anaphase. Mitotic length was calculated by the time period from commencement of NEBD to anaphase. Interphase length was calculated from anaphase to the next daughter cell NEBD. Only one daughter was followed and annotated. Tracking graphs were generated using Prism 7.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr Atsushi Miyawaki (Riken, Japan) for provision of the mVenus-hGeminin(1/110) and mCherry-hCdt1(30/120) constructs for FUCCI imaging.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The analysis of lung adenocarcinoma patient samples and associated clinical data was approved by the St Vincent's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (LNR/18/SVH/6).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors utilized an in vitro model that mimics more physiologically relevant conditions of platinum-based chemotherapy. They achieved this by treating a panel of NSCLC cell lines with a 2 hours pulse of platinum-based chemotherapy and analyzing the effects at 72 hours after the pulse. This is to avoid off-target effects after a prolonged 72 hr period of continuous cisplatin treatment that can create and impair the correct analysis of the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to therapy. The authors originally apply a multidimensional analysis of signaling networks generating correlative evidence that can be functionally investigated. Based on these original approaches, the authors find a role of p70S6K in mediating resistance of NSCLC cell to platinum-based chemotherapy, while not confirming some other mechanisms previously identified in cells subjected to a continuous platinum treatment. Moreover, the authors find that in NSCLC patients, the expression of p70S6K correlates with a worse prognosis and worse response to chemotherapy, independently of the mutational status of the <italic>TP53</italic> gene. Using in vitro and mouse xenograft experiments, the authors show that the combination of chemotherapy with inhibitors of p70S6K or si-p70S6K increases sensitivity to platinum. The work is original, well performed and logically structured. However, the reviewers feel that the mechanistic insight is confounded by the reliance on a relatively non-specific small molecule. Improvement of the mechanistic insights through more specific perturbations would improve the rigor and impact of this manuscript. Additionally, the reviewers request that more attention to the flow of the manuscript be paid, and that the authors explain the data presented in a more streamlined and easy to follow manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pointed out by the authors, dactolisib inhibits the activity of many targets other than P70S6K, including &quot;a number of other PI3K/mTOR substrates.&quot; That is quite a list of potential off-target mechanisms. The single experiment in vitro looking at knockdown of P70S6K is encouraging, but it is disappointing that the authors did not validate many of the other effects using this potentially more specific perturbation, instead relying on dactolisib. Further validation with a more specific inhibitor and/or knockdown of P70S6K with a minimum of two short hairpins or siRNAs is recommended to support their many other conclusions, including the cell cycle analysis and also preferably the mouse xenograft experiments.</p><p>2) The experiments in Figure 1 comparing the 2 hr vs. 72 hr cisplatin treatment is a bit overstated. It is not surprising that the effects of the two different treatments would be distinct in terms of DNA damage, cell signaling activities, or cell fate. Focusing on the effects of the 2 hr treatment is commendable as being more physiologically relevant and is worthwhile including as a main figure; the 72 hr comparison is better as a supplementary figure.</p><p>3) Going all the way to PC3 and PC4 to identify an effect is a little unusual, as those principal components should indicate rather modest contributions. This is particularly concerning given that subsequent validations for the most part rely on a more broad-spectrum inhibitor, which could affect many signaling molecules with higher contributions to PC1 and PC2. Are there significant components of PC1 and PC2 that are affected by dactolisib?</p><p>4) The flow of the manuscript is uneven, and the manuscript needs a significant amount of attention: For several figures, the number of figures mentioned in the text does not match the described figures, and the presentation of data is confusing. For example, there is no Figure 1G that the authors keep referring to in the text. Explain better Figure 1E. What is IF ratio? Explain better plots in Figure 2 and Figure 3: what does it mean &quot;component 1, component 2 etc?&quot; in what do these components represent? Also, it is a bit confusing why the response to cisplatin in NSCLC cell lines is independent on the <italic>TP53</italic> status, while the response to p70S6K inhibitors is dependent on it. Can the authors explain this point better? Additional experimental work is required to support such evidence.</p><p>Figure 1B and D: It may be better to use a proliferation assay (MTT or EdU) instead of the number of cells. Also, for Figure 4E and F, add statistics. In the subsection “Response to dactolisib is dependent upon <italic>TP53</italic> status”, the link between p21, γ-H2AX and casp3 is not clear. In the third paragraph of the Introduction, the description of previous findings of Fey et al., 2015, is not clear. Clarify the relative sentence. Explain better the choice of molecules belonging to pathways previously implicated in the response to continuous cisplatin exposure, listing them in a table. Explain the function of MCL<sup>-</sup>1 in this context. Along the same lines, explain better the multi-dimensional analysis. It is difficult to interpret.</p><p>In the subsection “Continuous versus pulsed cisplatin treatment”, the authors show that many signaling pathways activated upon continuous exposure of cells with platinum, are not activated after the 2 hours pulse at the 72h time point. The authors consequently define the previous observations of other researcher as &quot;artifacts&quot;. The authors need to replace the term 'artifact' with something more professional, such as &quot;previous data that should be reconsidered in the light of these new findings&quot;. As another example, the reference to Figure 1C at the end of the subsection “Response to cisplatin is not associated with either <italic>TP53</italic> status or drug-efflux”, should be reference to Figure 1E? The axis labels in Figures 2A and D are in odd positions. The axes in Figures 2B and D are unlabeled. Caption for Figure 2D should read, &quot;Visualization of component 3 against component 4…&quot; In the subsection “Validation of model-based observations”, the live cell assay for measuring caspase activity should be better explained in the main text and the caption for Figure 3A. The explanation in the legend for Figure 2—figure supplement 1B is sufficient, it's just confusing because that comes later in the manuscript than the description of the experiment in Figure 3A. The statement &quot;in the absence of p53, we observed that this can be mediated by the related transcription factor p63&quot; is too strongly worded and not fully supported by the findings. A correlation has been shown, not causation. This statement needs to be reworded more cautiously.</p><p>5) In Figure 5, the authors show that the p53 null NCI-H358 cells had greater G2 arrest compared to the p53 WT A549 cells following cisplatin pulsing, which they attribute to varying p53 status. To show that this trend is not due to some other factor that differs between these cell lines, the authors should test this after a p53 KO or p53 knockdown with siRNAs or shRNAs in A549 or p53 overexpression in NCI-H358 cells to see if the effect of p53 status is consistent within the same cell line. Also, Figure 7 needs to be toned down especially for the p53 null cells where the authors propose p63 as an effector of cisplatin. For the P70S6K knockdown in Figure 3G, what is the effect on cisplatin sensitive cell lines? This is an important control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53367.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pointed out by the authors, dactolisib inhibits the activity of many targets other than P70S6K, including &quot;a number of other PI3K/mTOR substrates.&quot; That is quite a list of potential off-target mechanisms. The single experiment in vitro looking at knockdown of P70S6K is encouraging, but it is disappointing that the authors did not validate many of the other effects using this potentially more specific perturbation, instead relying on dactolisib. Further validation with a more specific inhibitor and/or knockdown of P70S6K with a minimum of two short hairpins or siRNAs is recommended to support their many other conclusions, including the cell cycle analysis and also preferably the mouse xenograft experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To further examine the specific role of P70S6K in the response to cisplatin we have now performed the FUCCI imaging analysis in the resistant NCI-H358 cell line with two siRNAs targeting P70S6K (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). In line with the effects observed with dactolisib in this assay, we observed a non-significant trend towards a shortened G2-arrest, and an increase in apoptosis in cells treated with cisplatin following knockdown of P70S6K, an effect that is consistent between each siRNA.</p><p>One potential limitation in this assay is the heterogeneity of transient siRNA-mediated knockdown that will be achieved at the single-cell level. While this may have limited our ability to generate significant results using single-cell analysis such as FUCCI, this new data still reinforces two key observations from the original manuscript. Firstly, it further suggests that P70S6K has a specific role in maintaining a protective G2 arrest following cisplatin treatment within platinum resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells. Secondly, it highlights the role of dactolisib mediated P70S6K inhibition in sensitizing resistant cells to this cisplatin treatment.</p><p>Because of this result, we also tested the specific P70S6K inhibitor LY2584702 within our cell lines. However, following a one hour incubation with this inhibitor we did not observe any inhibition of P70S6K, as measured by S6 phosphorylation. Using a longer incubation time of 24 hours we observed ~10% inhibition at a concentration of 1 µM, and ~60% inhibition with a concentration of 10 µM. Therefore, due to this poor efficacy we did not proceed with any further experiments using this inhibitor.</p><p>Therefore, the addition of the P70S6K siRNA data has resulted in the following changes in the manuscript text:</p><p>“To further confirm the specific role of P70S6K in this cell cycle phenotype, this assay was repeated along with siRNA mediated P70S6K knockdown in the resistant NCI-H358 cell line (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). […] While the non-significant decrease in G2-arrest observed upon siRNA-mediated knockdown of P70S6K may have been limited by potential heterogeneity in the level of knockdown achieved, the increase in cell death further suggests that dactolisib mediated inhibition of P70S6K is responsible for the sensitisation of lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin treatment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments in Figure 1 comparing the 2 hr vs. 72 hr cisplatin treatment is a bit overstated. It is not surprising that the effects of the two different treatments would be distinct in terms of DNA damage, cell signaling activities, or cell fate. Focusing on the effects of the 2 hr treatment is commendable as being more physiologically relevant and is worthwhile including as a main figure; the 72 hr comparison is better as a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed panels A, B and C from Figure 1. These have now become a new Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Going all the way to PC3 and PC4 to identify an effect is a little unusual, as those principal components should indicate rather modest contributions. This is particularly concerning given that subsequent validations for the most part rely on a more broad-spectrum inhibitor, which could affect many signaling molecules with higher contributions to PC1 and PC2. Are there significant components of PC1 and PC2 that are affected by dactolisib?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is intriguing that analyzing PC3 and PC4 in this way gave a better distinction between resistant and sensitive cell lines. Within this analysis, PC1 and PC2 were mostly dominated by p53 pathway components (i.e. p53, p-p53, p21, MDM2), which displayed a highly dynamic and variable response between the cell lines, but did not ultimately correlate with the apoptotic response to cisplatin. However, as already demonstrated in Figure 6, dactolisib has a significant effect upon cisplatin mediated expression of p53, p63 and p21. Therefore, while it does not dominate PC1 or PC2, it is likely this ability of P70S6K to finely tune the p53 response that underlies its ability cause resistance to cisplatin in a <italic>TP53</italic> status dependent manner.</p><p>To provide clarity on the nuanced role of P70S6K we have made the following alterations to the text describing the proposed mechanism within the Results section:</p><p>“While <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status alone is not sufficient to determine sensitivity to cisplatin (Figure 1B), this dependence upon <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status for dactolisib-mediated sensitisation to cisplatin treatment is likely explained by considering the potential role of p21 in maintaining a G2-arrest or promoting an aberrant G2-exit, and thereby preventing DNA damage induced apoptosis occurring during, or shortly after mitosis. […] However, in the <italic>TP53</italic> mutant NCI-H1573 line, which was not sensitised by dactolisib, p21 expression was not significantly elevated following cisplatin treatment, meaning that γH2A.X expression and caspase 3 cleavage were unchanged by the addition of dactolisib (Figure 7).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The flow of the manuscript is uneven, and the manuscript needs a significant amount of attention: For several figures, the number of figures mentioned in the text does not match the described figures, and the presentation of data is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these formatting errors, each has been corrected as indicated below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, there is no Figure 1G that the authors keep referring to in the text.

We have now altered the presentation of these figures, the wording of the figure legend and the descriptions of the components within the text to more clearly represent the identity of each principal component. The updated figure legend now reads:</p><p>“Figure 2: Principal component analysis. […] (E) Distribution of the analytes according to their weighting within PC3 and PC4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is a bit confusing why the response to cisplatin in NSCLC cell lines is independent on the TP53 status, while the response to p70S6K inhibitors is dependent on it. Can the authors explain this point better? Additional experimental work is required to support such evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The answer to this reviewer’s comment is similar to the one above describing the role of P70S6K in modulating significant components from PC1 and PC2. Therefore, as described above, to further expand upon the interplay between <italic>TP53</italic> status and P70S6K we have expanded the explanation of the data from Figure 6, which details the proposed mechanism of dactolisib mediated sensitization through the actions of P70S6K on the p53 pathway, which is summarized in Figure 7. This section now reads:</p><p>“While <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status alone is not sufficient to determine sensitivity to cisplatin (Figure 1B), this dependence upon <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status for dactolisib-mediated sensitisation to cisplatin treatment is likely explained by considering the potential role of p21 in maintaining a G2-arrest or promoting an aberrant G2-exit, and thereby preventing DNA damage induced apoptosis occurring during, or shortly after mitosis.

Therefore, this data demonstrates that P70S6K promotes an aberrant G2-exit or prolonged G2-arrest following cisplatin treatment, presumably through enhanced translation of p53/p21 in <italic>TP53</italic> wildtype cell lines and p63/p21 in <italic>TP53</italic> null lines (Figure 7). However, in the presence of mutant p53, P70S6K is not able to influence this DNA damage induced signalling axis and is therefore not associated with sensitivity to cisplatin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B and D: It may be better to use a proliferation assay (MTT or EdU) instead of the number of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>For the previous Figure 1B (now Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), we have now included an additional figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), which is an MTS assay demonstrating the difference between the continuous and pulsed cisplatin models.

However, we disagree that this readout of cell metabolism should be used for the experiment in Figure 1D (now Figure 1B). The purpose of this data was to directly measure the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to a pulse of cisplatin, this cannot be achieved with an MTS assay.</p><p>The addition of this MTS assay has led to the following changes in the manuscript text:</p><p>“In order to directly compare the response of lung adenocarcinoma cells to the continuous presence of cisplatin, or a pulse of cisplatin that mimics in vivo pharmacokinetics (2h, 5 μg/mL) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), we monitored the growth and apoptosis of the innately resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line (Marini et al., 2018) by both live cell imaging (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and a cell viability assay (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), under both conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, for Figure 4E and F, add statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant p values have now been included within Figure 4E and F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the subsection “Response to dactolisib is dependent upon TP53 status”, the link between p21, γ-H2AX and casp3 is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>As above, we have further expanded upon the proposed mechanism within the Results section describing the data within Figure 6.
