internalization and presentation of antigens to helper T cells. To acquire antigens displayed by antigen-presenting cells, B cells form immune synapses and extract antigens by the mechanical activity of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. While cytoskeleton organization driving the initial formation of the B cell synapse has been studied, how the cytoskeleton supports antigen extraction remains poorly understood. Here we show that after initial cell spreading, F-actin in synapses of primary mouse B cells and human B cell lines forms a highly dynamic pattern composed of actin foci interspersed with linear filaments and myosin IIa. The foci are generated by Arp2/3-mediated branched-actin polymerization and stochastically associate with antigen clusters to mediate internalization. However, antigen extraction also requires the activity of formins, which reside near the foci and produce the interspersed filaments. Thus, a cooperation of branched-actin foci supported by linear filaments underlies B cell mechanics during antigen extraction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>immune synapse</kwd><kwd>antigen</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>B cell receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wasim</surname><given-names>Laabiah</given-names></name><name><surname>Malinova</surname><given-names>Dessislava</given-names></name><name><surname>Tolar</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>648228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malinova</surname><given-names>Dessislava</given-names></name><name><surname>Tolar</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two modes of actin polymerization, branched and linear, cooperate in B cells to extract antigens from surfaces of presenting cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Generation of high-affinity, protective antibodies requires B cell uptake of antigens via their antigen-specific B cell receptors (BCRs). After antigen binding, the BCR undergoes endocytosis and delivers the antigen into intracellular processing compartments, where antigenic peptides are loaded onto major histocompatibility II (MHC II) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoogeboom and Tolar, 2016</xref>). Presentation of the peptide-MHC II complexes on the surfaces of B cells solicits T cell help and promotes B cell proliferation and differentiation into germinal center, memory and plasma cells.</p><p>The uptake of soluble antigen by the BCR occurs predominantly via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stoddart et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the uptake of antigens from antigen-presenting immune or stromal cells requires additional forces generated by the acto-myosin cytoskeleton through the formation of B cell immune synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batista et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleire, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>). Myosin IIa is thought to be central to generation of these forces, because it is not required for endocytosis of soluble antigens, but promotes force-mediated antigen extraction from presenting cells in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoogeboom et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in B cell synapses that leads to antigen extraction is incompletely understood. Synaptic actin polymerization is mediated by two mechanisms: the Arp2/3 complex producing branched actin networks, and formins producing linear actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>). It is thought that these distinct actin nucleation pathways are activated in the synapse periphery and create an outer band of branched actin and inner ring of contractile acto-myosin filaments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoogeboom and Tolar, 2016</xref>). The constant generation and turnover of the actin results in centripetal flow with central actin clearance. Indeed, in naive B cells interacting with stiff experimental substrates, such as glass or glass-supported planar lipid bilayers, F-actin forms a prominent peripheral ring resembling lamellipodia, and an area with contractile arcs, while the synapse center is clear of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleire, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Treanor et al., 2011</xref>). However, B cell synapses also contain prominent, but poorly characterized F-actin spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nowosad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Treanor et al., 2010</xref>). Similar spots, termed actin foci, were recently observed in T cell synapses on planar lipid bilayers, where they colocalize with T cell receptor microclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, the relevance of this actin organization for B cell antigen extraction is unclear as antigen uptake from these stiff substrates is mechanically inefficient and antigens are instead enzymatically digested out through the release of lytic enzymes into the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Spillane and Tolar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, studies using soft substrates, such as plasma membrane sheets (PMSs), which promote mechanical antigen extraction similar to that occurring with live antigen presenting cells, found that actin formed abundant foci throughout the synapse with little central clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>). These actin foci were highly dynamic and colocalized with membrane invaginations during antigen uptake, suggesting their involvement in antigen extraction. However, how these actin structures cooperate with other actin filaments and with myosin IIa contractility to produce extraction forces is not clear.</p><p>One possibility is that myosin IIa causes contraction of formin-generated actin filaments connecting to, or sweeping through the actin foci to generate inward or lateral forces, respectively. This mechanism would be similar to transport of antigen clusters from the synapse periphery to the center by the contractile act-myosin arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, inward forces on the BCR can be generated by actin polymerization within the actin foci, with the help of membrane-bending proteins orienting the membrane for invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hinze and Boucrot, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaksonen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we image the F-actin at the B cell synapse using super-resolution microscopy in 2D and 3D, and using live-cell imaging with high temporal resolution to resolve the structures that are relevant for antigen extraction. We show that the B cell immune synapse contains a highly stochastic and dynamic pattern of actin foci interspersed with actin fibers. The pattern originates from transient spots of Arp2/3 activity generating branched actin in the foci and from closely associated formin activity producing the surrounding linear filaments. The actin foci are more intimately associated with antigen endocytosis, however, manipulation of the actin-polymerization pathways shows that both Arp2/3 and formins are needed for antigen uptake. We propose that these two actin polymerization mechanisms create a functional foci-filament network which translates local bursts of actin polymerization into an inward force for antigen internalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extraction of antigen is mediated by actin foci interspersed with linear filaments</title><p>To understand the structure and dynamics of the F-actin cytoskeleton in B cell synapses specifically during antigen uptake, we imaged primary B cells from Lifeact-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Riedl et al., 2010</xref>) incubated with PMSs loaded with a surrogate antigen, anti-Igκ F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy time-lapses showed that after initial cell spreading, between 5 and 20 min after synapse formation, the Lifeact-labeled F-actin was distributed throughout the synapse in a range of small structures including actin foci and short fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 3D imaging verified that during these 20 min, B cells were extracting the antigen as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). TIRF microscopy with a 100 ms time resolution showed that the F-actin was highly dynamic and that the foci and fibers were appearing stochastically, and often, merged, split or interconverted between each other (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, left panel). To analyze the actin structures, we segmented the actin foci and fibers from the Lifeact images using round and linear filtering elements, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, right panel). This automated segmentation was more sensitive than manual foci detection, and the identified foci positions were indistinguishable from segmentation results produced by four individual researchers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore used the automated segmentation as an unbiased quantification tool to analyze all imaged cells. Segmentation of actin foci and fibers from time-lapse microscopy of the primary mouse B cells showed that foci numbers per area remained stable at about 5 per 10 μm2 during the 20 min of imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), but that most individual foci persisted for less than 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A similar pattern of foci and interconnecting fibers was also observed in the human Ramos cell line, a commonly used B cell lymphoma line, although these cells were larger and had more filopodia emanating from the sides of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Actin structure of the B cell synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF images of a Lifeact-GFP (green) expressing primary mouse B cell making a synapse with a PMS loaded with the surrogate antigen anti-Igκ F(ab’)<sub>2 </sub>(magenta), at indicated times from the initial contact.

To segment foci, Lifeact-GFP image was first bandpass-filtered using a Gaussian spot matching the apparent size of the foci (about 300 nm in diameter). In parallel, the image is filtered with linear elements of the apparent width of the actin filaments (about 250 nm) and oriented in all directions using 18-degree rotation. The difference between maximum and minimum filter values is used to suppress linear structures in the spot-filtered image. Foci segmentation mask is further thresholded using a value derived from the mean Lifeact-GFP intensity and the resulting mask is cleaned up by removing small scattered spots, spots that are highly elongated and spots that do not persist for at least two consecutive frames. To segment fibers, Lifeact-GFP image is bandpass-filtered using the linear filaments and taking the maximum value. The filtered image is thresholded again using a value derived from the mean Lifeact-GFP intensity.

Super-resolution reconstruction of the F-actin showed numerous dense actin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), interspersed by a sparse network of fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). This pattern filled the body of the synapse and was surrounded by thin lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>Dual color live-cell TIRF microscopy indicated that although the actin structures did not overtly colocalise with antigen, some actin foci did transiently coincide with antigen clusters (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), in line with previous data. To understand the structure of the F-actin at the sites of antigen extraction in more detail, we used 3D super-resolution imaging of F-actin and overlaid the super resolution actin image with epifluorescence stacks of antigen images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Antigen clusters that were being internalized could be identified, because they were lifted several hundred nanometers from the PMSs. Such lifted clusters of antigen were surrounded by dense F-actin foci from the sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). Measurement of the height of all the actin foci showed that more than 20% of them extended more than 200 nm into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). This suggests that foci are the actin structures associated with antigen movement into the cell and thus likely correspond to actin spots previously associated with membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>). The 3D STORM reconstruction also indicates that the actin foci interact with antigen clusters from the sides or from below, suggesting that they are involved in the transport of the antigen to the interior of the cell.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48093-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Actin foci transiently colocalise with antigen clusters.</title><p>Video shows TIRF timelapse of lifeact-GFP (lifeact) in a primary mouse B cell interacting with anti-Igκ F(ab’)<sub>2</sub>-AlexaFluor647-loaded PMS (antigen).

We found that internalization of soluble surrogate antigen anti-Igκ F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> or soluble transferrin by naive mouse B cells was only very modestly sensitive to inhibition of either of the Arp2/3 complex or formins, or to complete block in actin polymerization by cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, internalization of soluble anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> antibodies by Ramos cells was not significantly inhibited by blocking Arp2/3 or formin activity, although some inhibition was achieved by treatment with cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, the uptake of soluble antigen is relatively independent of actin polymerization. In contrast, extraction of the surrogate antigens by either primary cells or Ramos cells from PMSs was completely abolished by blocking actin polymerization with latrunculin A, indicating importance of actin polymerization for force-mediated uptake of membrane antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). The uptake of antigens from PMSs was also markedly sensitive to inhibition of Arp2/3 by CK666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In addition, CRISPR-mediated targeting of ARPC2 in Ramos cells decreased antigen uptake from PMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), significantly for two of the three gRNAs. Thus, Arp2/3 activity is critical for uptake of antigens from PMSs. Targeting of DIAPH1 and FMNL1 yielded more variable results with a trend towards inhibition that did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the redundancy of these two formins with other formin family members in regulation of actin polymerization. However, inhibition of formins by SMIFH2 strongly reduced synaptic antigen internalization in both primary B cells and Ramos cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).Thus, these results overall support the conclusion that both Arp2/3 and formins are important for the uptake of antigens from the synapse, indicating the importance of both the formation and the dynamics of the actin foci and further support from actin fibers in extraction of membrane-presented antigens.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Importance of actin polymerization pathways in membrane antigen extraction.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Internalization of soluble anti-Igκ F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> by naive mouse B cells (<bold>A</bold>) or soluble anti-IgM F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> by Ramos cells treated with the indicated inhibitors.

About 30% occurred with actin fibers, while less than 10% associated with foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Most mechanical activity thus comes from areas containing actin fibers. However, correcting for the much smaller area of the cells occupied by foci showed that the actin foci were three times more efficient at applying forces on the PMSs than fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, both foci and fibers apply pulling forces on the antigen-presenting membrane, but with different geometry and efficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of actin structures on mechanical activity during antigen extraction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF image of a Lifeact-GFP-expressing Ramos cell (green) interacting with anti-IgM F(ab’)2-loaded PMS stained with DiI (magenta).

We found that the overall number of membrane pulling events was not affected by either of the inhibitors compared to the DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, Ramos cells treated with CK666 often generated elongated membrane structures in the synapse, with some cells producing excessively long and convoluted membrane tubules and ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">4</xref>). To quantify this effect, we classified the DiI images of the PMS in immune synapses as containing only pulled spots, a mixture of spots and short tubules, and a predominance of tubules or ridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The analysis showed that the pulling activity of CK666-treated Ramos cells resulted in fewer synapses containing only spots and more synapses dominated by tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These data are consistent with formin-generated fibers predominantly contributing to long-range antigen movement along the plasma membrane. Overall, while actin polymerization either through Arp2/3 or formins exerts mechanical forces in the immune synapse, coordinated function of both of these actin polymerization mechanisms is required to extract antigen in a manner that leads to efficient endocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that after initial cell spreading, the B cell synapse contains a stochastic pattern of foci and fibers. These structures are generated locally in the synapse by transient activities of the Arp2/3 complex and formins, respectively and are important for antigen extraction. Despite their different mechanism of production, the foci and fibers are closely related as they are often generated from each other during their constant turnover. This is also illustrated by colocalization of both Arp2/3 and formins with the actin foci, leading to production of both branched actin and linear filaments from the same sites. This actin behavior produces network-like connectivity that is distinct from the actin structure of CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murugesan et al., 2016</xref>) and CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ritter et al., 2015</xref>) T cell synapses and also differs from B cell synapses formed with stiff substrates, where peripheral lamellipodial actin, and acto-myosin contractile rings occupy distinct domains of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleire, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that when B cells extract antigens from live antigen-presenting cells, actin foci and fibers form nodes and edges in a loosely connected network, whose function is required for efficient antigen extraction. In this model, stochastic Arp2/3 activation produces actin foci by local bursts of branching of preexisting short filaments. Branched actin polymerization may either push on the membrane to generate protrusions, similarly as it happens in podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van den Dries et al., 2019</xref>), or synergize with BCR-dependent signaling and endocytic proteins to produce an invagination of the plasma membrane and extract the antigen. Formin-generated filaments may stabilize the foci by surrounding and connecting them, which, along with crosslinking and tensioning by myosin IIa, could help to direct the foci-generated forces perpendicularly to the plasma membrane. In addition, the linear filament polymerization out of the foci may help to extend the range of the inward movement or enhance the extraction force directly.</p><p>This model is supported by our observation and manipulation of the two major regulators of actin polymerization, the Arp2/3 complex and formins. The foci are selectively marked by stoichiometric incorporation of ARPC2 and they disperse after inhibition of Arp2/3 function, consistent with a branched-actin structure. The importance of the Arp2/3 complex in foci formation is consistent with previous data linking activators of the Arp2/3 complex, WAS WIPF1 and ITSN2, with foci formation in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janssen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>) and in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burbage et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Keppler et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, formins, such as DIAPH1, localize less specifically to the foci and their activity instead generates interspersed actin fibers. Thus, both Arp2/3 and formins are active throughout the B cell synapse during antigen uptake without large-scale segregation. Our data thus extend previous knowledge of the importance of Arp2/3 complex in the generation of the lamellipodial actin ring and centripetal membrane flow important for B cell adhesion, BCR signaling and B cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our data also show that Arp2/3-generated actin foci are intimately associated with antigen extraction, as seen in instances of their presence at the sites of antigen endocytosis and their close, albeit stochastic, relationship to BCR tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and CCPs. Our model thus suggests that forces that lead to antigen extraction are dependent on new actin polymerization in actin foci. This hypothesis is supported by previous observation that F-actin is continuously accumulating on individual membrane invaginations during B cell antigen uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>). If the plasma membrane is instead pulled inward by myosin IIa contractility, F-actin should accumulate before the membrane starts invaginating and then move inward during invagination. In addition, our 3D superresolution imaging shows that actin is associated with the sides of the antigen clusters during internalization, where polymerization could contribute to membrane invagination. Foci-like structures were also associated with antigen extraction from gel-like substrates in a recent study, where they were found protruding into the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus possible that Arp2/3 generated actin structures can both push and pull on the antigen presenting cell, eventually using actin polymerization for antigen extraction.</p><p>Nevertheless, our data also indicate that the branched actin polymerization in the foci is not sufficient to extract antigen as inhibitions of formin and myosin IIa activities also inhibit antigen uptake. Since formin inhibition altered foci dynamics, we hypothesize that formins together with myosin IIa provide stability to actin polymerization in the foci that helps the branched actin to expand in between the future base and tip of the invagination, generating an inward force, as opposed to a lateral force and a comet-like movement along the plasma membrane. A similar stabilizing role for myosin contractility was suggested for function of CCPs in other cells types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekar et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, myosin contractility or fiber dynamics may help to dislodge the antigen from the presenting membrane before endocytosis through actin foci. Finally, it is possible that formin-mediated actin polymerization out of the foci extends the range of movement of the foci during late stages of antigen endocytosis. The latter two points are supported by the observations of cells after pharmacological inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex, when the residual fibers are able to transport antigen clusters and pull large membrane ridges or tubules from the presenting membrane both by their contractile motion and by their growth. Future studies will be needed to dissect the role of these mechanisms further and also to determine the exact roles of specific formin family members for these processes as our knock outs of DIAPH1 and FMNL1 were not sufficient to fully recapitulate formin inhibitor treatment.</p><p>The actin organization and mechanism of antigen extraction studied here pertains primarily to the synapses formed by naive and memory B cells, where antigen extraction is directly followed by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nowosad et al., 2016</xref>). Another mechanism to extract antigen, not directly coupled to endocytosis, exists in germinal center B cells. In these cells, peripheral actomyosin-rich pod like protrusions extract antigen and transport it by outward actin flow along the plasma membrane away from the antigen-presenting surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kwak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nowosad et al., 2016</xref>). The regulation of actin in these structures has not yet been investigated, but may also involve Arp2/3-generated branched actin as they resemble miniature lamellipodia. Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization is therefore likely a general requirement for antigen extraction from antigen-presenting cells.</p><p>Unexpectedly, our data show that the formation of the actin foci in naive B cells does not require antigen stimulation. The actin foci may thus be generated continuously as a general property of the B cell cortical cytoskeleton. In agreement with this observation, the majority of actin foci in the synapse do not associate with antigen clusters, or with CCPs. However, a small fraction of actin foci did associate with antigen clusters and to a lower degree with CCPs. Since BCR signaling regulates actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tolar, 2017</xref>), including foci dynamics shown here, as well as CCP dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stoddart et al., 2002</xref>) we speculate that a local synergy between BCR signaling, actin dynamics and CCP formation at BCR clusters either enhances the rates of formation of endocytic structures, or stabilizes otherwise abortive events to promote efficient antigen uptake. More detailed observations of BCR signaling during interaction of BCR clusters with foci and CCPs will be needed in the future.</p><p>Our data establish a new view on the architecture of B cell synapses and on the molecular basis driving its formation. This information can be used to better understand the role of F-actin not just in B cell antigen endocytosis, but also in receptor signaling at the plasma membrane. The organization of the BCR, and other signaling receptors on B cell surfaces critically depend on actin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattila et al., 2016</xref>) and defects in actin polymerization contribute to the dysregulation of signaling in primary immunodeficiencies and in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tolar, 2017</xref>). Our studies should guide future investigations of the regulation Arp2/3 and formin pathways in B cells in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice and heterozygous Lifeact-EGFP mice on a C57BL/6 background were used as a sources of primary mouse B cells.

No cells were excluded from analysis provided they passed the intensity threshold. Foci were enhanced by convolution with a 325 or 450 nm gaussian-shaped filter for primary and Ramos B cells, respectively, and the convoluted images were thresholded by setting pixels below a threshold value, defined as a fraction of the cell’s mean actin intensity, to zero. Fibers were enhanced separately by taking the maximum value of images convoluted with 325 or 450 nm line-shaped filters (for primary and Ramos B cells, respectively) rotated at 18-degree increments to account for filament of all orientations. Candidate foci were then detected as areas where the foci mask pixel values exceeded the fiber mask values and further cleaned up by removing small and highly elongated objects. For live cell images, the foci candidates were then tracked through the timelapse and foci not persisting for at least two frames were discarded. Final foci numbers were counted as the mean number of foci per time point and normalized per area of the cell. Foci displacement was calculated as the distance between the start and end positions divided by lifetime. Fibers were identified as areas where the fiber mask exceeded a threshold defined as a fraction of the cell’s actin intensity. Pixels belonging to foci were excluded from the fiber areas. The threshold values were adjusted between different experiments carried out on different cells or acquired with different instruments, but were kept constant for all conditions within each experiment.</p><p>To compare automated segmentation of actin foci to their manual identification, two primary B cell timelapses were segmented by the automated analysis and by four researchers knowledgeable of the actin structures, but blinded to the results of the automated segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We compared the total number of foci detected in the timelapses and also the centers of their positions using a 5-pixel and 1-frame tolerance. ‘True positive rate’ of the automated segmentation was calculated compared to each human researcher as the percent of the human-detected foci that were also detected by the computer. ‘False positive rate’ of the automated segmentation was calculated as the percent of foci detected by the computer but not detected by the human. As a comparison, foci positions obtained by the human researchers were also compared to each other using the same calculations.

To quantify the frequency of synapses containing only DiI spots, a mixture of tubules and spots, or predominantly tubules, synapses were manually classified based on the three examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of substrate-bound antigen internalization</title><p>For quantification of antigen uptake from PMSs, cells were incubated with inhibitors for 15 min at 37°C before incubation with PMSs in the continued presence of the inhibitors for 30 min. Large-scale image datasets and their processing was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nowosad et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, experimental images were cropped, aligned, background subtracted and corrected for flatfield and spectral bleedthroughs. Cells were segmented using B220 staining (primary B cells) or CD19 (Ramos cells). CellScore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nowosad et al., 2016</xref>) was used to gate on live B cells. To detect extracted antigen in the z-stack images, each image was bandpass-filtered and antigen clusters were identified in planes above the synapse by a user- specific global threshold. Total fluorescence of extracted antigen was calculated as the sum of pixel intensities of the background-corrected extracted clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Soluble antigen and transferrin internalization assay</title><p>Isolated B cells or Ramos cells taken from culture were incubated with a LIVE/DEAD marker in PBS for 20 min. They were then washed and incubated with fluorescently labeled, biotinylated surrogate antigens at 1 μg/ml in PBS with 1% BSA and 2 m EDTA for 30 min on ice. Alternatively, the cells were incubated with fluorescently-labeled, biotinylated transferrin (Rockland). Cells were washed and incubated with inhibitors for 20 min on ice. Samples were then split into three and incubated either on ice or at 37°C for 10 or 30 min before fixation with 2% PFA on ice for 20 min. After fixation, cells were washed and stained for 20 min on ice with fluorescently labeled streptavidin, to label the ligands remaining on the cell surface. Samples were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Internalization was quantified as the percentage of antigens remaining at the cell surfaces using FlowJo (TreeStar).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Plasmids, cloning, transfections and CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting</title><p>Human ARPC2-mRuby3 was constructed from pLVX-ARPC2-GFP and pOPINF2-WIPI2B-human-mRuby3 and cloned into pLVX for lentivirus-mediated transfection. To construct mRuby-DIAPH1, we cloned human DIAPH1 cDNA from Caco-2 cells using RNAeasy micro and QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kits (Quiagen) and inserted it into pVLX-mRuby3. For Lifeact-GFP transfection we used pLVX-LifeactGFP plasmid with the resistance gene switched to neomycin. Clathrin light chain A-mCherry was constructed from mouse Clta-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>) and inserted into pLentipuro. CRISPR sgRNA sequences were designed using the Broad Institute’s sgRNA Designer.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your work greatly advances the working model for how the actin cytoskeleton is organised to enable antigen extraction by B cells, which is critical to their function in antigen presentation. You have shown how the Arp2/3 branched actin and formin linear actin nucleation factors and myosin cooperate to generate a network of transient foci that overlie the extraction sites and are interconnected by the linear filaments that also incorporate myosin II based contractile units.

You use cutting edge imaging methods to show suggestive results that BCR signaling is associated with distinct actin structures (compared to the usual lamella and lamellipodia). Subsequently you assemble circumstantial evidence using imaging and CRISPR generated knockdowns that these structures may be implicated in antigen extraction. However, a number of key experiments and critical controls are required to establish your novel claims and the reviewers have consulted to suggest experiments that can be accomplished in 2 months.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Using foci and linear actin tracking in live cells, you should show that the Arp2/3-dependent foci and the Formin- dependent filaments are part of a crosslinked network. It will be crucial to include a membrane marker in this experiment to discern filopodia from formin-based linear filament population.</p><p>2) Using your previously published tension sensors, and Arp2/3 inhibition/knockdown, the authors should measure forces exerted by the foci during antigen endocytosis. Knowing the magnitude of the forces at the antigen site would bridge the missing connection between the localization of foci and antigen endocytosis.</p><p>3) By examining the endocytosis of a generic clathrin pathway marker such a transferrin, you need to substantiate the specific impact of Arp2/3 inhibition on antigen internalization.</p><p>4) You should provide a supplementary figure detailing the workflow utilized to extract foci, and how the Gaussian filter size for enhancing foci was determined/ chosen. The efficiency of this foci extraction method also needs to be shown.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;B cells extract antigens using Arp2/3-generated actin foci interspersed with linear filaments&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

To substantiate the physical connections between the actin foci and actin fibers within the synapse, we extended our analysis of Ramos cells co-expressing Lifeact-GFP and ARPC2-mRuby. We now show in a new part of Figure 3 that ARPC2-containing actin foci emanate fibers that often transiently connect to other actin structures including other foci (Figure 3C). We think that this finding illustrates the closely interconnected nature of the actin network in the synapse. This result is also consistent with the detectable presence of DIAPH1 in actin foci (Figure 3D, E, G, I), and with the reduction of interspersed fibers by the formin inhibitor SMIFH2 (Figure 2A). Nevertheless, given the transient nature of the network-like connections, we agree that it is more appropriate to think of the foci-fiber relationship as a mixed pattern with a cooperative function, rather than a “crosslinked network”. We therefore refer to this architecture as a “functional network” throughout the manuscript and toned down the statements on the importance of the physical interconnection of the foci by linear filaments.</p><p>To address the possibility that the fibers in the synapse represent filopodia, rather than filaments within the cell, we labeled the plasma membrane of the Lifeact-GFP/ARPC2-mRuby co-expressing Ramos cells with DiD and imaged their immune synapses. The results are summarized in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1. The DiD showed dynamic undulations of the plasma membrane in the synapse in pattern that partly corresponded to the Lifeact signal. This is consistent with the actin-dependent mechanical activity of plasma membrane of the cells. Filopodia at the cell edges were also visible in these experiments as thin, Lifeact-positive, DiD-positive protrusions. However, despite of the general correspondence of the Lifeact and DiD signals in the synapse, we could find many Lifeact-positive, ARPC2-negative filaments in the synapse that did not accumulate any extra DiD signal. An example is shown in the figure. We conclude that most of the filament dynamics relevant for this paper and for antigen extraction occurs within the cortical cytoskeleton rather than within filopodia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Using your previously published tension sensors, and Arp2/3 inhibition/knockdown, the authors should measure forces exerted by the foci during antigen endocytosis. Knowing the magnitude of the forces at the antigen site would bridge the missing connection between the localization of foci and antigen endocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the relationship of the actin architecture to the location of the pulling forces is important. We decided not to use the DNA sensors, however, as their force signal on PMSs is weak because the tension is buffered by movement of the PMS during pulling. Instead, we used our previous technique of directly analyzing the force-mediated PMS deformation using labeling with the lipid dye DiI (Natkanski et al., 2013). As cells pull on the PMS, DiI fluoresce locally increases as the deformed PMS accumulates at the sites of pulling. The DiI fluorescence appears either as spots, which we previously showed are vertically oriented membrane invaginations, or as ridges or tubules, depending on the direction of the pulling and range of the movement. Although the strength of the forces cannot be determined by this analysis, it allows us to robustly detect the sites of the pulling forces, their direction and also the overall vigor of the mechanical activity. We used Lifeact-expressing Ramos cells for these experiments to improve the spatial resolution due to the bigger size of the cells, but pilot experiments suggest that the results translate to primary cells as well. The data are presented in the new Figure 6, in Videos 13-16, and in the corresponding sections of the Results and Materials and methods.</p><p>We found that the sites of pulling associated with both actin foci and actin fibers (Figure 6 A, B, C, Video 13). Because fibers cover greater area than foci in the synapse, most of the pulling activity associated with fibers (Figure 6D). However, correcting for the difference in area, foci were the more efficient structure at pulling (Figure 6E). Although both actin structures pulled on the PMSs, there was a difference in the shape of the DiI structures indicating difference in the direction of pulling. While foci were typically associated with DiI spots, which grew inwards, fibers often produced elongated structures, tubules and ridges (Figure 6B, C), that moved laterally. This explains why foci were found to be associated with antigen movement into the cell, but fibers were not.</p><p>These results were corroborated by inhibitor treatment. We found that the overall pulling activity was not significantly reduced by either CK666 or SMIFH2 (Figure 6F). Since these drugs did inhibit antigen extraction, these results indicate that mechanical activity per se is not sufficient for antigen internalization. In addition, treatment of the Ramos cells with CK666 led to enhanced generation of tubules/ridges at the expense of spots, with a significant fraction of cells producing excessive tubulation within the synapse (Figure G, H, Video 15). This further confirms that fibers, which are enhanced in CK666-treated cells, are not sufficient for antigen internalization. Possibly, because of their orientation along the plasma membrane, the fibers generate lateral, instead of inward-oriented movement. Because of the length of the tubules generated by fibers, we speculate that the fibers are producing longer range of membrane movement than foci. Although the DiI imaging did not reveal this clearly, we believe that extension of the inward antigen movement by fibers associated with foci contributes to antigen extraction and is part of the reason why formin inhibition with SMIFH2 also blocks antigen uptake. Overall, we believe that these data add important information to the manuscript, namely that while either Arp2/3 or formin activity apply forces on the antigen, their concerted action is needed for pulling to proceed to antigen internalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) By examining the endocytosis of a generic clathrin pathway marker such a transferrin, you need to substantiate the specific impact of Arp2/3 inhibition on antigen internalization.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the effects of the inhibitors of on general clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we measured internalization of soluble transferrin. We show in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 that the inhibitors had a very modest effect, similar to the modest effect on internalization of the soluble surrogate antigen. We conclude that most of the effects that these drugs exert on the uptake of membrane antigen is specific to the immune synapse due to increased demands on the actin cytoskeleton.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) You should provide a supplementary figure detailing the workflow utilized to extract foci, and how the Gaussian filter size for enhancing foci was determined/ chosen. The efficiency of this foci extraction method also needs to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>To illustrate the image segmentation more clearly, we created a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), which shows the workflow of the algorithm, the shape and size of the filtering elements, and the intermediate results that are used to compute the final segmentation masks identifying foci and fibers. In addition to explanation in the figure legend, we also extended the description of the technique in the Materials and methods and we include the Matlab source code used for the segmentation and for foci counting.</p><p>We agree that understanding of the performance of the segmentation is important to interpret the results. We therefore compared the automated segmentation with manual segmentation by four human researchers who were knowledgeable of the actin structure (they were co-authors of the manuscript), but had no prior knowledge of the results of the computerized segmentation. We focused on foci segmentation in two Lifeact-GFP timelapses of primary B cells as fibers were found to be too laborious to segment manually even for such a limited number of images. We compared the results of the segmentation by the computer to that of the humans and also the humans to each other. The results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. We found that computerized segmentation detected more foci than manual segmentation, indicating that it was more sensitive. To evaluate the positions of the detected foci, we calculated “true positive rates” of the computerized segmentation as the percent of manually segmented foci that were also detected by the computer, and “false positive rates” as the percent of foci detected by the computer, but not detected manually. We calculated these rates for each computer-human pair and also for all human-human pairs. The results showed that the computer-human pairs could not be distinguished in their true and false positive rates from the human-human pairs. Thus, although not perfect, the automated segmentation performs just as well as any experienced researcher, while being consistent and higher throughput. It is also more sensitive, which is likely because human researchers are quickly fatigued by the process after a few image frames.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Please see the comments below.

We believe that these spots are pre-existing ruffles, bulges or tethered vesicles of the PMSs. For this reason, to analyze the mechanical activity within B cell synapses we used live cell imaging and tracked only DiI spots that newly appeared or moved during the recording time. Thus, the results in Figure 6 reflect only the pulling activity of the B cells and are not affected by the preexisting DiI spots on the PMSs unless the B cells pull on them as well. This is explained in “Materials and methods” under “Quantification of B cell mechanical activity”. Please note that some of the cells lost LifeAct-GFP expression and thus they are not visible, yet still pull on certain areas of the PMSs outside of the analyzed synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An article describing actin patches at the B cell immune synapse has been published during the time the present article was revised.
