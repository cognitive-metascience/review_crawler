biotrophic fungi. Previous studies suggested carbohydrates as the only form of carbon transferred to the fungi. However, <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid (FA) synthesis has not been observed in AM fungi in absence of the plant. In a forward genetic approach, we identified two <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> mutants defective in AM-specific paralogs of lipid biosynthesis genes (<italic>KASI</italic> and <italic>GPAT6</italic>). These mutants perturb fungal development and accumulation of emblematic fungal 16:1ω5 FAs. Using isotopolog profiling we demonstrate that <sup>13</sup>C patterns of fungal FAs recapitulate those of wild-type hosts, indicating cross-kingdom lipid transfer from plants to fungi. This transfer of labelled FAs was not observed for the AM-specific lipid biosynthesis mutants. Thus, growth and development of beneficial AM fungi is not only fueled by sugars but depends on lipid transfer from plant hosts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29107.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29107.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29107.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most land plants are able to form partnerships with certain fungi – known as arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi – that live in the soil. These fungi supply the plant with mineral nutrients, especially phosphate and nitrogen, in return for receiving carbon-based food from the plant. To exchange nutrients, the fungi grow into the roots of the plant and form highly branched structures known as arbuscules inside plant cells.</p><p>Due to the difficulties of studying this partnership, it has long been believed that plants only provide sugars to the fungus. However, it has recently been discovered that these fungi lack important genes required to make molecules known as fatty acids. Fatty acids are needed to make larger fat molecules that, among other things, store energy for the organism and form the membranes that surround each of its cells. Therefore, these results raise the possibility that the plant may provide the fungus with some of the fatty acids the fungus needs to grow.</p><p>Keymer, Pimprikar et al. studied how arbuscules form in a plant known as <italic>Lotus japonicus,</italic> a close relative of peas and beans. The experiments identified a set of mutant <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants that had problems forming arbuscules. These plants had mutations in several genes involved in fat production that are only active in plant cells containing arbuscules.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that certain fat molecules that are found in fungi, but not plants, were present at much lower levels in samples from mutant plants colonized with the fungus, compared to samples from normal plants colonized with the fungus. This suggests that the fungi colonizing the mutant plants may be starved of fat molecules. Using a technique called stable isotope labelling it was possible to show that fatty acids made in normal plants can move into the colonizing fungus.</p><p>The findings of Keymer, Pimprikar et al. provide evidence that the plant feeds the fungus not only with sugars but also with fat molecules. The next challenge will be to find out exactly how the fat molecules are transferred from the plant cell to the fungus. Many crop plants are able to form partnerships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of fat molecules in these relationships may help to breed crop plants that, by providing more support to their fungal partner, may grow better in the field.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29107.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29107.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Lotus japonicus</kwd><kwd>Rhizophagus irregularis</kwd><kwd>arbuscular mycorrhiza</kwd><kwd>root symbiosis</kwd><kwd>lipids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB924 B03 Function of the GRAS protein RAM1 in arbuscule development</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutjahr</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether program GU1423/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gutjahr</surname><given-names>Caroline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PA493/7-1 Plant genes required for arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB924 B03 Genetic dissection of arbuscular mycorrhiza development</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dörmann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Group GRK 2064 Do520/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dörmann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hans Fischer Gesellschaft e.

The fungi provide mineral nutrients to the plant. These nutrients are taken up from the soil and released inside root cortex cells at highly branched hyphal structures, the arbuscules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Javot et al., 2007</xref>). For efficient soil exploration, arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) develop extended extraradical hyphal networks. Their growth requires a large amount of energy and carbon building blocks, which are transported mostly as lipid droplets and glycogen to the growing hyphal tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bago et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2003</xref>). AMF are obligate biotrophs, as they depend on carbon supply by their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith and Read, 2008</xref>). In the past, detailed <sup>13</sup>C-labeled tracer-based NMR studies demonstrated that hexose sugars are a major vehicle for carbon transfer from plants to fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shachar-Hill et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, a fungal hexose transporter, with high transport activity for glucose is required for arbuscule development and quantitative root colonization as shown by host induced gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helber et al., 2011</xref>), indicating the importance of hexose transfer for intra-radical fungal development.</p><p>AMF store carbon mainly in the form of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>). The predominant storage form is triacylglycerol (TAG) and the major proportion of FAs found in AMF is composed of 16:0 (palmitic acid), and of 16:1ω5 (palmitvaccenic acid). The latter is specific to AM fungi and certain bacteria and is frequently used as marker for the detection of AM fungi in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentivenga and Morton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>). Fungus-specific 16:1ω5 FAs are not exclusive to glycerolipids but also incorporated into membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Aarle and Olsson, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, 18:1ω7 and 20:1∂11 are considered specific for AMF but do not occur in all AMF species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stumpe et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It has long been assumed that AMF use sugars as precursors for lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeffer et al., 1999</xref>). However, <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of fungal fatty acids (FAs) was only observed inside colonized roots and not in extraradical mycelia or spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeffer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>). The authors concluded that AM fungi can produce FAs only inside the host. The hypothesis that plants directly provide lipids to the fungus could not be supported at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>), due to experimental limitations and the lack of appropriate plant mutants. However, recently available whole genome sequences of AMF have revealed that genes encoding multi-domain cytosolic FA synthase subunits, typically responsible for most of the <italic>de novo</italic> 16:0 FA synthesis in animals and fungi, are absent from the genomes of the model fungi <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>, <italic>Gigaspora margarita</italic> and <italic>Gigaspora rosea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wewer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salvioli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, AMF appear to be unable to synthesize sufficient amounts of 16:0 FAs, but their genomes do encode the enzymatic machinery for 16:0 FA elongation to higher chain length and for FA desaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wewer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Development of fungal arbuscules is accompanied by activation of a cohort of lipid biosynthesis genes in arbuscocytes (arbuscule-containing plant cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaude et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2012b</xref>). Furthermore, lipid producing plastids increase in numbers and together with other organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum change their position and gather in the vicinity of the arbuscule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lohse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ivanov and Harrison, 2014</xref>), symptomatic of high metabolic activity to satisfy the high demands of arbscocytes for metabolites including lipids. The importance of plant lipid biosynthesis for arbuscule development has been demonstrated by <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> mutants in AM-specific paralogs of two lipid biosynthesis genes <italic>FatM</italic> and <italic>REDUCED ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA2</italic> (<italic>RAM2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>FatM</italic> encodes an ACP-thioesterase, which terminates fatty acid chain elongation in the plastid by cleaving the ACP off the acyl group releasing free FAs and soluble ACP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>RAM2</italic> encodes a glycerol 3-phosphate acyl transferase (GPAT) and is most similar to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GPAT6. In <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> GPAT6 acetylates the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of glycerol-3-phosphate with an FA and cleaves the phosphate from lysophosphatidic acid, thereby producing <italic>sn</italic>-2-monoacylglycerol (ßMAG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in both <italic>FatM</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> impair arbuscule branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, arbuscule branching requires a complex of two half ABC transporters STR and STR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutjahr et al., 2012</xref>). The substrate of STR/STR2 is unknown but other members of the ABCG transporter family are implicated in lipid transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wittenburg and Carey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, and due to its localization in the peri-arbuscular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) it was speculated that the STR/STR2 complex may transport lipids towards arbuscules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutjahr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>).

Plants contain an additional <italic>GPAT6</italic> paralog, which likely fulfills the housekeeping function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaux et al., 2015</xref>). To understand whether the same applies to <italic>DIS</italic> we searched the <italic>L. japonicus</italic> genome for additional <italic>KASI</italic> genes. We detected three paralogs <italic>KASI</italic>, <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>DIS-LIKE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), of which only <italic>DIS</italic> was transcriptionally activated in AM roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed a split of seed plant KASI proteins into two different clades, called KASI and DIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Members of the KASI clade, are presumably involved in housekeeping functions as this clade contains the product of the <italic>KASI</italic> single copy gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu and Xue, 2010</xref>). Members of the <italic>DIS</italic> clade are found specifically in AM-host dicotyledons and in a gymnosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As confirmed by synteny analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), <italic>DIS</italic> is absent from all eight analyzed non-host dicotyledon genomes, a phylogenetic pattern similar to other symbiosis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Favre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo et al., 2016</xref>). The occurrence of <italic>DIS</italic> in <italic>Lupinus</italic> species, which lost AM competence but still form root nodule symbiosis, may be a relic from the AM competent ancestor. An apparently, <italic>Lotus</italic>-specific, and thus recent duplication of the <italic>DIS</italic> gene resulted in an 87% identical copy (<italic>DIS-LIKE</italic>) located directly adjacent to <italic>DIS</italic> in a tail-to-tail orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). <italic>DIS-LIKE</italic> was expressed at very low levels and not induced upon AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, because of its sequence similarity to <italic>DIS</italic>, we examined whether <italic>DIS-LIKE</italic> is also required for arbuscule formation using the <italic>dis-like-5</italic> mutant, which suffers from a glycine replacement at position 180 at the border of a highly conserved β-sheet that likely affects protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in roots of <italic>dis-like-5</italic> AM and arbuscule development was indistinguishable from wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Therefore, we directly compared their impact on the AM-specific root lipid profile and measured galactolipids, phospholipids, TAGs and also total and free fatty acids in colonized roots of <italic>ram1</italic>, <italic>dis</italic>, <italic>ram2</italic>, <italic>str</italic> mutants and wild-type in parallel. Consistent with our previous observation in <italic>dis-1</italic>, galactolipid accumulation was similar in colonized roots of wild-type and all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). In contrast, total 16:0 FAs (FAMEs) as well as 16:1 and 18:1 (likely 18:1ω7 FA of fungal origin) FAs were strongly reduced in all colonized mutants compared to the corresponding wild-type. Free FAs showed a similar pattern except for 18:1 FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Also for TAGs and phospholipids, AMF-specific molecular species and 16:0 FA containing molecular species were strongly reduced in all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s11">11</xref>). However, the two allelic <italic>ram2</italic> mutants formed an exception. They specifically over-accumulated 16:0-16:0 FA-containing phospholipids in particular 32:0 PA and 32:0-PC but also to a smaller extend 32:0-PE and 32:0-PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s10">10</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for tri-16:0 TAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggests that RAM2 acts downstream of DIS in a biosynthetic pathway and uses the 16:0 FAs synthesized by DIS in arbuscocytes as substrates. In the absence of functional RAM2 the FA products of DIS, are probably redirected into phospholipid biosynthesis and storage lipid biosynthesis <italic>via</italic> PA and PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li-Beisson et al., 2010</xref>) leading to the observed higher accumulation of 16:0 FA containing lipid species in <italic>ram2</italic> mutants. This higher accumulation of specific lipids did not correlate with colonization levels in <italic>ram2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>) confirming that reduced colonization levels are not the primary cause for altered lipid profiles in the colonized mutant roots. Instead, defective AM-specific lipid biosynthesis in the mutants more likely impairs fungal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The abundance of 16:0 ß-monoacyl-glycerol is reduced in all mutants</title><p>The first step in TAG and phospholipid production after FA biosynthesis is the esterification of FAs with glycerol by GPATs in the plastid or endoplasmic reticulum to produce α-MAGs (sn1/3-MAGs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li-Beisson et al., 2010</xref>).

To examine the role of RAM2 in MAG biosynthesis, we quantified α-MAG and ß-MAG species in colonized roots of wild-type and all mutants. The abundance of ß-MAGs was generally lower than that of α-MAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The amount of most α-MAG species did not differ among the genotypes. Only the fungus-specific 16:1 and 18:1ω7 α-MAGs were reduced in all mutants reflecting the lower fungal biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Fungus-specific ß-MAGs with 16:1 and 18:1ω7 acyl groups were not detected and most ß-MAG molecular species accumulated to similar levels in all genotypes. Exclusively the levels of 16:0 ß-MAGs were significantly lower in all mutants as compared to the corresponding wild-type roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

For their use in membrane or storage lipid biosynthesis they first need to be isomerized to α-MAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li-Beisson et al., 2010</xref>). The recruitment of a GPAT6 (RAM2) instead of a α-MAG-producing GPAT for AM-specific lipid synthesis supports the idea that RAM2-products are destined for something else than membrane biosynthesis of the host cell. Since AM fungal genomes lack genes encoding cytosolic FA synthase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wewer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) we hypothesized that 16:0 ß-MAGs synthesized by DIS- and RAM2 are predominantly delivered to the fungus. To test this hypothesis, we examined lipid transfer by FA isotopolog profiling. Isotopologs are molecules that differ only in their isotopic composition. For isotopolog profiling an organism is fed with a heavy isotope labelled precursor metabolite. Subsequently the labelled isotopolog composition of metabolic products is analyzed. The resulting characteristic isotopolog pattern yields information about metabolic pathways and fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We could not detect fungus-specific 16:1ω5 ß-MAGs in colonized roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that either a downstream metabolite of ß-MAG is transported to the fungus, or alternatively, ß-MAG is rapidly metabolized in the fungus prior to desaturation of the 16:0 acyl residue. Since the transported FA groups can be used by the fungus for synthesizing a number of different lipids, we focused on total 16:0 FA methyl esters (FAMEs, subsequently called FAs for simplicity) and 16:1ω1 FAMEs as markers for lipid transfer. We fed <italic>L. japonicus</italic> wild-type, <italic>dis-1</italic>, <italic>ram2-1</italic> and <italic>str</italic> with [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and then measured the isotopolog composition of 16:0 FAs and 16:1ω5 FAs in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> roots and in associated extraradical fungal mycelium with spores. To generate sufficient hyphal material for our measurements the fungus was pre-grown on split Petri dishes in presence of a carrot hairy root system as nurse plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Once the fungal mycelium had covered the plate, <italic>L. japonicus</italic> seedlings were added to the plate on the side opposing the carrot root.

Both enzymes have a substrate preference for 16:0 FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salas and Ohlrogge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>) and, consistent with this, we and others observed that colonized <italic>ram2</italic> mutant roots over-accumulate 16:0 FA containing phospholipids and TAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>]), indicating re-channeling of superfluous 16:0 FAs in the absence of RAM2 function and placing RAM2 downstream of FatM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of <italic>DIS,</italic> a novel and AM-specific <italic>KASI</italic> gene, now provides evidence for the enzyme which synthesizes these 16:0 FAs in arbuscocytes. The arbuscule phenotype, as well as the lipid profile of colonized <italic>dis</italic> mutants is very similar to <italic>fatm</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> mutants except for the accumulation of 16:0 FA-containing lipids in <italic>ram2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and all figure supplements), consistent with the predicted function. Together, this strongly suggests that DIS, FatM and RAM2 act in the same lipid biosynthesis pathway, which is specifically and cell-autonomously induced when a resting root cortex cell differentiates into an arbuscocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>]). Interestingly, <italic>DIS</italic> was exclusively found in genomes of AM-competent dicotyledons and a gymnosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This implies that <italic>DIS</italic> has been lost at the split of the mono- from dicotyledons. Despite the phylogenetic divergence, <italic>DIS</italic> and the single copy housekeeping <italic>KASI</italic> gene of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are interchangeable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the specificity of <italic>DIS</italic> to function in AM symbiosis is probably encoded in its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In monocotyledons, the promoter of the housekeeping <italic>KASI</italic> gene may have acquired additional regulatory elements, sufficient for arbuscocyte-specific activation, thus making <italic>DIS</italic> dispensable.</p><p>We provide several pieces of complementary evidence that lipids synthesized by DIS and RAM2 in the arbuscocyte are transferred from plants to AMF and are required for fungal development. We fed host plants with [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose and subsequently determined the isotopolog profile of freshly synthetized 16:0 and 16:1ω5 FAs in roots and associated fungal extraradical mycelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This showed that: (1) AMF were unable to incorporate <sup>13</sup>C into FAs when fed with [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]glucose in absence of the host plant. (2) When associated with a wild-type host, the fungal extraradical mycelium accumulated <sup>13</sup>C labelled 16:0 FAs and the isotopolog profile of these 16:0 FAs was almost identical with the host profile. (3) The 16:0 FA isotopolog fingerprint differed strongly between two different wild-type plant systems (<italic>Lotus</italic> seedling and carrot hairy root) but for each of them the fungal mycelium recapitulated the isotopolog profile. Therefore clearly, the plant dominates the profile of the fungus, because it is impossible that the fungus by itself generates the same FA isotopolog pattern as the plant – especially in the absence of cytosolic FA synthase. Therefore, this result provides compelling evidence for interkingdom transfer of 16:0 FAs from plants to AMF. (4) In agreement, the isotopolog profile of fungus-specific 16:1 ω5 FAs inside and outside the root also resembled the plant 16:0 FA profile. (5) Colonized <italic>dis</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> mutant roots resembled the 16:0 FA isotopolog profile of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> wild-type roots. However, the 16:0 FA profile of the fungal extraradical mycelium and the 16:1ω5 FA profile inside the roots showed a very different pattern, consistent with very low transport of labelled FAs to the fungus when associated with the mutants. (6) DIS and RAM2 are specifically required for the synthesis of 16:0 ß-MAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and the predominant FA chain length found in AM fungi is precisely 16. (7) <italic>dis</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> roots do not allow the formation of lipid-containing fungal vesicles and accumulate very low levels of fungal signature lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and figure supplements). Together this strongly supports the idea that DIS and RAM2 are required to provide lipids for transfer to the fungus. Consequently, in the mutants, the fungus is deprived of lipids.</p><p>The <italic>L. japonicus</italic> mutants were originally identified due to their defective arbuscule branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groth et al., 2013</xref>). The promoters of <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> are active in arbusocytes and already during PPA formation, the earliest visible stage of arbuscocyte development. Together with the stunted arbuscule phenotype of <italic>dis</italic>, <italic>ram2</italic> and <italic>fatm</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>]) this suggests that plant lipids are needed for arbuscule growth, probably to provide material for the extensive plasma-membrane of the highly branched fungal structure. It also indicates that the arbuscule dictates development of the AMF as a whole, since lipid uptake at the arbuscule is required for vesicle formation, full exploration of the root and development of extraradical mycelia and spores. Defective arbuscule development was also observed for the different and phylogenetically distantly related AMF <italic>Gigaspora rosea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groth et al., 2013</xref>), which similar to <italic>R. irregularis</italic> lacks genes encoding cytosolic FA synthase from their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wewer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Hence the dependence on plant lipids delivered at the arbuscule is likely a common phenomenon among AMF and a hallmark of AMF obligate biotrophy.</p><p>Despite the obvious central importance of lipid uptake by the arbuscule, the fungus can initially colonize the mutant roots with a low amount of intraradical hyphae and stunted arbuscules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The construction of membranes for this initial colonization may be supported by the large amounts of lipids stored in AMF spores. This would be consistent with the frequent observation that in wild-type roots, at initial stages of root colonization, AMF form arbuscules immediately after reaching the inner cortex and before colonizing longer distances, possibly as a strategy to accquire lipids quickly after the reserves in the spore have been depleted. Alternatively, it is possible that plant housekeeping enzymes provide lipids to intraradical hyphae before arbuscule formation. Activity of the housekeeping KASI may also be responsible for slightly higher colonization levels observed for <italic>dis</italic> in some experiments as compared to other mutants.</p><p>It has recently been reported that photosynthetic wild-type nurse plants can restore arbuscule-branching in <italic>Medicago ram2</italic> and <italic>str</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luginbuehl et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that lipids can be supplied to arbuscules via the extraradical hyphal network and intraradical hyphae through this route support arbuscule fine-branching. Based on four observations, we favor an alternative szenario, in which lipids need to be provided cell-autonomously by the arbuscocyte to support arbuscule fine-branching. However, we cannot exclude that our observations differ from the reported observations due to growth conditions or plant species. (1) Presence of nurse carrot hairy roots did not restore arbuscule branching in <italic>dis</italic>, <italic>ram2</italic> and <italic>str</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). (2) <italic>dis</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> were found in a forward genetics screen based on their stunted arbuscule phenotype. In this screen, the fungal inoculum was provided <italic>via</italic> chive nurse plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groth et al., 2013</xref>). (3) Map-based cloning of <italic>Lotus dis</italic>, <italic>ram2</italic> and <italic>str</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>) was performed with segregating mutant populations grown in the same pot, in which the wild-type and heterozygeous siblings acted as nurse plants on the homozygeous mutants. In this system, the stunted arbuscule phenotype was easily observable. (4) Arbuscule branching in a rice <italic>str</italic> mutant was not restored by wild type nurse plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutjahr et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It still remains to be shown, which types of lipids are transported from the plant arbuscocyte to the fungal arbuscule and how. RAM2 is the most downstream acting enzyme in arbuscocyte-specific lipid biosynthesis known to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is predicted to synthesize ß-MAG and we and others have shown that 16:0 ß-MAGs are indeed reduced in colonized roots of <italic>dis</italic>, <italic>fatm</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> mutants, providing evidence that this is likely the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2017</xref>]). Although, we cannot exclude that a downstream metabolite of 16:0 ß-MAG is transported to the fungus, 16:0 ß-MAG as transport vehicle for 16:0 FAs to the fungus is a good candidate because conceptually this molecule may bear certain advantages. It has been shown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that ß-MAGs are not used for plant storage or membrane lipid biosynthesis but rather as pre-cursors for cuticle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2007</xref>). The production of ß-MAGs could therefore, be a way, to withdraw FAs from the plants own metabolism to make them available to the fungus. In addition, ß-MAGs are small and amphiphilic and could diffuse across the short distance of the hydrophilic apoplastic space between plant and fungal membrane. At the newly growing arbuscule branches the distance between the plant and fungal membrane is indeed very small and has been measured to be 80–100 nm on TEM images of high-pressure freeze-substituted samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfante, 2001</xref>). However, we could not detect fungus-specific 16:1ω5 ß-MAGs in colonized roots. This could mean that the fungus metabolizes them before desaturation of the 16:0 FAs to synthesize membrane and storage lipids. Alternatively, ß-MAGs may not be taken up by the fungus. ß-MAGs are known to isomerize to α-MAGs in acid or basic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iqbal and Hussain, 2009</xref>). It is therefore, possible that they isomerize in the acidic periarbuscular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guttenberger, 2000</xref>) before being taken up by the arbuscule.</p><p>How are MAGs transported across the peri-arbuscular membrane? Good candidates for MAG transporters are the ABCG half transporters STR and STR2. Similar ABCG transporters have been implicated genetically in cuticle formation, which also requires ß-MAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pighin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panikashvili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yeats et al., 2012</xref>). The half ABCG transporters STR and STR2 are both independently required for arbuscule branching and they need to interact to form a full transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We found that colonized roots of a <italic>L. japonicus str</italic> mutant, did not allow the formation of fungal vesicles and had the same lipid profile as <italic>dis</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and figure supplements). Furthermore, our <sup>13</sup>C labelling experiment demonstrated that <italic>str</italic> mutants do not transfer lipids to the fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although these are encouraging indications, strong evidence for the role of STR in lipid transport across the periarbuscular membrane is still lacking and the substrate of STR remains to be determined. Therefore, currently, it cannot be excluded that mutation of <italic>str</italic> has an indirect effect on lipid transport and alternative mechanisms for example lipid translocation <italic>via</italic> vesicle fission and fusion are possible. Nevertheless, also in AMF, several ABC transporter genes are expressed <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tisserant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). They are not characterized, but if lipid transport via ABC transporters instead of other mechanisms would play a role, some of them could be involved in uptake of lipids into the fungal cytoplasm.</p><p>We found that mutants in the GRAS gene <italic>RAM1</italic> are impaired in AM-specific lipid accumulation in colonized roots and in AM-mediated activation of <italic>DIS</italic> and the single copy gene <italic>KASIII</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), in addition to <italic>FatM</italic>, <italic>RAM2</italic> and <italic>STR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pimprikar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luginbuehl et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that plants have evolved an AM-specific regulatory module for lipid production in arbuscocytes and delivery to the fungus. It remains to be shown, whether RAM1 regulates lipid biosynthesis genes directly and how this occurs mechanistically.</p><p>Our finding that plants transfer lipids to AMF completely changes the previous view that the fungus receives only sugars from the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeffer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trépanier et al., 2005</xref>). It will now be interesting to determine the relative contributions of sugar and lipid transfer to AMF, and whether this may be a determinant of variation in root length colonization and extraradical mycelium formation depending on the plant-fungal genotype combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sawers et al., 2017</xref>). An interesting question refers to why AMF have lost the genes encoding cytosolic FA synthase to depend on the lipid biosynthesis machinery of the host. FA biosynthesis consumes more energy than biosynthesis of carbohydrates and organic carbon provided by the plant needs to be transported in fungal hyphae over long distances from the inside of the root to the extremities of the extraradical mycelium. Therefore, it is conceivable that supply of plant lipids to the fungus plus fungal lipid transport is more energy efficient for the symbiosis as a whole than fungal carbohydrate transport plus fungal lipid biosynthesis. Hence, inter-organismic lipid transfer followed by loss of fungal FA biosynthesis genes may have been selected for during evolution because it likely optimized the symbiosis for most rapid proliferation of extraradical mycelium, thus ensuring efficient mineral nutrient acquisition from the soil for supporting the plant host. Lipid transfer across kingdoms has also been observed in human parasites or symbiotic bacteria of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caffaro and Boothroyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herren et al., 2014</xref>). It will be interesting to learn whether this is a more widespread phenomenon among biotrophic inter-organismic interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and inoculation with AM fungi</title><p><italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> ecotype Gifu wild-type, <italic>ram1-3, ram1-4, dis-1</italic>, <italic>dis-4, dis-like-5, ram2-1, ram2-2</italic> and ecotype MG-20 wild-type and <italic>str</italic> mutant (kindly provided by Tomoko Kojima (NARO, Tochigi, Japan) seeds were scarified and surface sterilized with 1% NaClO.

To identify SL0154-specific mutations linked to the <italic>dis</italic> locus, we employed a genome re-sequencing strategy. Nuclear DNA of Gifu wild-type and the SL0154 mutant was subjected to paired end sequencing (2 × 100 bp) of a 300–500 bp insert library, on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 instrument resulting in between 16.7 and 19.5 Gigabases per sample, equivalent to roughly 35–41 fold coverage assuming a genome size of 470 Megabases.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Lipid transfer from plants to arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the current manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Please note that we were in principle enthusiastic about the topic of the work. However, the agreement was that extensive revision with significant additional experimentation would be required to address each of the reviewers' comments. Because of our policy to only ask for revision when additional experiments can be accomplished within a reasonable amount of time, we cannot invite revision directly, but would have to consider a seriously revised manuscript as new submission, and thus would not be able to extend our scoop protection, although we would try to provide for an expedited review.</p><p>We know that this is not the decision you were hoping for and we fully appreciate that you are in a competitive situation, as you indicated in your communications. Hence, this was a difficult decision. As you know, <italic>eLife</italic> has a consultative evaluation procedure and each of the reviewers took their role very seriously. Unfortunately, as explained above, <italic>eLife</italic> does not have the option of &quot;major revision&quot;, which might have been applicable in your case, and therefore a rejection was the only option available to us.</p><p>The reviewers' comments are listed verbatim below. However, the major issues raised were primarily:</p><p>1) An opinion that the data presented were not compelling with regard to supporting direct lipid transfer from the plant to the fungus, especially with regard to other possible explanations that were not addressed.</p><p>2) An opinion that the paper failed to address other important issues of the system, especially regarding published reports dealing with sugar uptake by the fungus (see reviews).</p><p>3) An opinion that the paper also failed to discuss other relevant literature related to the genes being examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper reports on the phenotypes of a <italic>dis-1</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> mutant of <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and implicates these genes in providing lipids directly to the AM fungus.</p><p>There is nothing particularly unique about the <italic>dis-1</italic> mutant, although it appears to be a new gene involved in the AM symbiosis. <italic>Ram2</italic> had been reported previously by a number of labs and the AM phenotype reported, although clearly not related directly to the notion of lipid transfer. Hence, the key novelty of the current paper rests on whether the authors have presented a solid case to support the notion of direct lipid transfer. The evidence for this appears to be the following:</p><p>1) The available genome sequences of AM fungi appear to lack key genes for lipid synthesis;</p><p>2) The <italic>dis-1</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> gene products appear to be involved in lipid biosynthesis and show reduce colonization by the AM fungus and a lack of vesicles, consistent with a defect in lipid biosynthesis;</p><p>3) Labeling of both <italic>M. truncatula</italic> and carrot cultures with 13C-glucose results in a lipid profile in the fungus similar to that of the host plant.</p><p>If we take these in order, evidence 1 is interesting but, of course, was previously reported, although without explanation. Evidence 2, although consistent with the lack of lipid biosynthesis, could also be explained by the reduced colonization and lack of vesicle formation. Therefore, perhaps the most compelling evidence is the 13C labeling experiments, especially using the two hosts. I admit that this evidence is strong but I am not sure it could be considered compelling. Unfortunately, I am not an expert in lipid biosynthesis and, hence, can't properly evaluate this. Clearly, feeding of glucose could lead to additional metabolism resulting in the uptake of 13C by the fungus in a variety of forms. Therefore, it is the similarity of the lipid profiles that provides the strongest evidence. The question is whether the authors could provide any further evidence to strengthen their story. For example, using a <italic>M. truncatula</italic> mutant that produced a unique lipid profile and demonstration that this uniqueness was reflected in the AM fungus would be very supportive.</p><p>A few other thoughts:</p><p>1) I found the discussion in the subsection “The KASI family comprises three members in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) related to the phylogenetic relationships of <italic>dis-1</italic> to be distracting from the important aspects of the paper. At a minimum, these aspects could be reduced to a few lines in the paper.</p><p>2) I was a bit bothered by the use of only colored bar graphs, made very small, to support the important aspects related to relative lipid composition. I would ask the author present comparative tables with actual numbers reflecting the composition of each lipid, including standard error. As a reviewer, we need this type of detail to support the authors’ claims that the plant and fungal lipid profiles are indeed identical.</p><p>3) When the <italic>ram2</italic> mutant was first isolated, its phenotype was attributed to defects in cutin biosynthesis. This idea was repeated in several papers but is not mentioned in the current paper. I admit that I do not follow this field closely but the authors should address these previous theories concerning <italic>ram2</italic> and show how they have now come to other conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This potentially is a very important piece of work. Although I am not familiar with all the techniques and analysis used, the work does seem to have been carried out to an appropriate standard. However, where I thought the manuscript fell down somewhat is in the actual writing. I would encourage the authors to review their manuscript and try and improve its readability making it more accessible to the reader who is not necessarily expert in all the different techniques used. In addition, in several sections the writing becomes quite dense and the authors could do more to improve the general flow of text and to make it more engaging. I do urge the authors to take this point seriously as it will hopefully increase the impact of their results both within the scientific community and beyond.</p><p>With this in mind the layout of the figures and the figure legends was quite difficult to follow and didn't always appear to support the statements made in the Results text.</p><p>Perhaps the actual figure appearing under several supplementary figure legend headings – and for the figure to appear on a separate page (not having either page numbers or line numbers) – also doesn't help but I assume this is to comply with the journals instructions).</p><p>More specific comments:</p><p>Introduction.

Based on two mutants impaired in two steps of lipid biosynthesis, previously shown to be defective in arbuscule formation, the authors established the hypothesis that lipid transfer is key for fungal growth and maintenance of the symbiosis. To substantiate this hypothesis, the lipid profile of colonized plants (WT and mutants), as well as the lipid profile of fungal mycelium colonizing such plants were investigated. The topicality of the article is that while sugar transfer to the fungus has been demonstrated by biochemical experiments, and sugar uptake into the fungus molecularly shown, the possibility that in addition lipid transfer might be also crucial has been less explored. However, here is where the novelty of the paper is compromised because similar findings (even one of the mutants is the same but in another model legume) has been just accepted for publication and will appear online soon. Furthermore, two of the coauthors of that article also are co-authors here, and thus it is surprising that no more coordination has been attempted. But besides that, my main criticism is the overinterpretation of the results, shown with two biosynthesis mutants and not transport mutants, that lipid transfer is what essentially fuels fungal growth. In my opinion, lipid transfer is not convincingly demonstrated here, and thus the argumentation leads to overstatements (see below).</p><p>1) Both mutants displayed a reduced fungal colonization, still the fungus was able to develop intraradical hyphae, and the main phenotype was distorted by arbuscules. Because the fungus is unable to feed until its in planta phase, how is the fungus nourished up to the point of arbuscule formation? Their results rather indicate that plant lipids (if transferred) could be critical for fungal plasma membrane development at arbuscules where the fungus rapidly and profusely grows by dichotomous branching. This would be in line with their results showing complementation when using the arbuscule-specific promoter PT4. Furthermore, they argue that lipid transfer might take place during arbuscule degeneration, which is inconsistent with the involvement of the other players such as the STR transporters, putative exporters of plant lipids, shown to localize in fully functional arbuscules.</p><p>2) The originality of their work lies on the transfer of the lipids from the plant to the fungus. And while I have little doubt that this is likely the case, in my opinion the authors failed to demonstrate that convincingly. In the key <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, the isotopolog profile of extraradical mycelium from mutant plants shows a reduced amount of 16:1w5 (the typical mycorrhizal FA) as compared to WT plants. This is not surprising giving that a much lower colonization is observed in those plants and results are given as enrichment and not per amount of mycelium, and its synthesis has been shown to happen within colonized roots. But if this lipid can be only synthesized after transfer of monoacylglycerols to the fungus, why is there at all in the roots of mutants and in the connected extraradical hyphae? And furthermore, why its concentration is even significantly higher than in hyphae grown in the absence of a labelled plant? If no lipid transfer was taking place, there should be no labelled 16:1w5 in the hyphal samples from mutant plants at all.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lipid transfer from plants to arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Alga Zuccaro (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the surprising discovery that not only sugars, but also lipids are transferred from plants to symbiotic fungi. We found the isotope labeling experiment very impressive, convincing us that in <italic>dis, ram2</italic> and <italic>str</italic> mutants the fungal profiles do not align with the host profile, in contrast to the wild type, were both align very well. This strongly supports the hypothesis that fatty acids synthesized in the plants through this pathway are transferred to the fungus. In absence of a protein that has been directly shown to transport fatty acids from plant to fungus (although <italic>STR</italic> is a good candidate), this is the strongest evidence pointing to transfer of lipids that are generated through <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic>. We would, however, ask the authors to add a sentence that they cannot exclude at this point that <italic>STR</italic> effects on lipid transport are indirect (although we agree that the common regulation of <italic>RAM2</italic> and <italic>STR</italic> by <italic>RAM1</italic> make for an exciting hypothesis in this direction, direct regulation of <italic>STR</italic> by <italic>RAM1</italic> does not seem to have been shown).</p><p>We have read the previous reviewers' comments and the authors' replies and felt that they were sufficiently addressed. The new Figure panels 8D and 9 surely help to follow the rationale behind the experiments and are welcome in this new version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>An attractive genetic experiment for the future would be to constitutively express <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> in an <italic>str</italic> background, in order to assess a tissue that is full of the right lipids but presumably would still be unable to feed the fungi. If data from such an experiment are already at hand, please include them.</p><p>One question relates to a point raised by previous reviewer 3 and the authors' reply that membrane formation during initial colonization is supported by vesicles. Would a photosynthetic nurse plant be able to provide the lipids for vesicle formation and thus lipids that could be sourced to form new arbuscules (as pointed out before)? Please discuss.</p><p>We also were not comfortable with the conclusion that the transcript accumulation of KASIII and DIS &quot;depends&quot; on RAM1. This could also be a rather indirect effect, of reduced fungal mass in <italic>ram1</italic> mutants. Please change the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to something like &quot;Loss of <italic>RAM1</italic> affects AM-specific induction of <italic>KASIII</italic> and <italic>DIS</italic>&quot;, and in 6A e.g. &quot;<italic>RAM1</italic> effects on AM-specific induction of <italic>KASIII</italic> and <italic>DIS</italic> and 16:0 FA biosynthesis, and absence of effects on <italic>KASII</italic>&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29107.051</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The paper reports on the phenotypes of a dis-1 and ram2 mutant of M. truncatula and implicates these genes in providing lipids directly to the AM fungus.</italic> </p><p>Our work has been performed in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> and not in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>.

This publication describes a reduction in fungal hyphopodia as main <italic>ram2</italic> phenotype. In addition, a defect in arbuscule branching was mentioned. The authors proposed that the hyphopodia phenotype was due to a lack of cutin monomers at the root surface. However, a very recent publication from Maria Harrison’s lab (Bravo et al. 2017) could not confirm the hyphopodia phenotype with the identical <italic>Medicago</italic> mutant. Similar to us, they found that <italic>ram2</italic> mutants are perturbed in arbuscule formation only. We have shown that <italic>ram2</italic> mutants can be transgenically complemented when RAM2 is driven by an arbuscule-cell-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, it is very unlikely that RAM2 functions in promoting hyphopodium formation – at least under the growth conditions of our lab and Maria Harrison’s lab (Bravo et al. 2017).</p><p><italic>Hence, the key novelty of the current paper rests on whether the authors have presented a solid case to support the notion of direct lipid transfer.

Carrot hairy roots produce a different isotopolog profile than <italic>Lotus</italic>. Also the carrot profile is mirrored in the extraradical fungal mycelium. This is compelling evidence, that the plant dominates the FA profile of the fungus. The result can only be explained by transfer of 16:0 FA from the plant to the fungus.</p><p>To make this more understandable we have now better explained the isotopolog profiling experiment in the manuscript text. We also added a figure, which schematically illustrates the carbon flow in the experimental setup.</p><p>Furthermore, we have performed the transfer experiment with an additional mutant, which is defective in the ABCG transporter STR. The results are the same as for the <italic>dis</italic> and <italic>ram2</italic> mutant. This transporter is a good hypothetical candidate for transferring lipids across the periarbuscular membrane towards the arbuscule.</p><p><italic>A few other thoughts:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I found the discussion in the subsection “The KASI family comprises three members in L. japonicus” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) related to the phylogenetic relationships of dis-1 to be distracting from the important aspects of the paper. At a minimum, these aspects could be reduced to a few lines in the paper.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have reduced this part.</p><p><italic>2) I was a bit bothered by the use of only colored bar graphs, made very small, to support the important aspects related to relative lipid composition. I would ask the author present comparative tables with actual numbers reflecting the composition of each lipid, including standard error. As a reviewer, we need this type of detail to support the authors’ claims that the plant and fungal lipid profiles are indeed identical.</italic></p><p>In the previous full submission we had uploaded an excel file with the raw data. Was this not available to the reviewer?</p><p>The isotopolog pattern is in our view more easily understandable if displayed as colored graphs instead of tables. This way of displaying the data is standard practice in metabolic flux studies.</p><p>We presented biological replicates separately instead of calculating means, to display the similarity of the isotopologue pattern between root and extraradical mycelium for every single sample. Independent of the similarity, we consider it more transparent, when results for each sample are displayed and we agree with the advice of Weissgerber et al. 2015, Plos Biol. We only used bar charts for the very complex lipidomics data because with a display of single sample data points it would be too hard “to see the forest for the trees”.</p><p><italic>3) When the ram2 mutant was first isolated, its phenotype was attributed to defects in cutin biosynthesis. This idea was repeated in several papers but is not mentioned in the current paper. I admit that I do not follow this field closely but the authors should address these previous theories concerning ram2 and show how they have now come to other conclusions.</italic> </p><p>In <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> we cannot reproduce the <italic>ram2</italic> phenotype described in Wang et al. 2012, Current Biology. In the meantime it has been published (Bravo et al. 2017) that there is no hyphopodia phenotype in the same <italic>Medicago ram2</italic> mutant used in Wang et al. 2012. Therefore, we do not see the necessity anymore to discuss this discrepancy in detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This potentially is a very important piece of work. Although I am not familiar with all the techniques and analysis used, the work does seem to have been carried out to an appropriate standard. However, where I thought the manuscript fell down somewhat is in the actual writing. I would encourage the authors to review their manuscript and try and improve its readability making it more accessible to the reader who is not necessarily expert in all the different techniques used. In addition, in several sections the writing becomes quite dense and the authors could do more to improve the general flow of text and to make it more engaging. I do urge the authors to take this point seriously as it will hopefully increase the impact of their results both within the scientific community and beyond.</italic> </p><p><italic>With this in mind the layout of the figures and the figure legends was quite difficult to follow and didn't always appear to support the statements made in the Results text.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have re-written the manuscript substantially to make it more accessible.

However, here is where the novelty of the paper is compromised because similar findings (even one of the mutants is the same but in another model legume) has been just accepted for publication and will appear online soon. Furthermore, two of the coauthors of that article also are co-authors here, and thus it is surprising that no more coordination has been attempted.</italic> </p><p>In our article we describe the identification of the mutations in two mutants that were found in a forward genetics screen. This lead to the discovery of the novel gene <italic>DIS,</italic> and the identification of a <italic>ram2</italic> mutant in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>. Furthermore, we provide strong experimental evidence for lipid transfer from plants to fungi by feeding plants with stable isotope labelled glucose followed by isotopolog profiling of fatty acid profiles in plant and fungus.</p><p>At the time of submission, there was no published article with similar findings (full submission 30.01.2017) and the corresponding author of this manuscript had no information about the status of other manuscripts or articles. We suspect that the reviewer means the article by Bravo et al. 2017, which has in the meantime been published in New Phytologist (acceptance date: 16.02.2017, first published 05.04.2017). This article contains an improved and detailed side-by-side phenotypic description and lipid quantification of previously published <italic>fatm, ram2</italic> and <italic>str</italic> mutants of <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>. However, the article does not contain any experiment, which examines lipid transfer from plants to AM fungi. Furthermore, it does not report on a novel gene. We have cited the article in the new version of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>But besides that, my main criticism is the overinterpretation of the results, shown with two biosynthesis mutants and not transport mutants, that lipid transfer is what essentially fuels fungal growth. In my opinion, lipid transfer is not convincingly demonstrated here, and thus the argumentation leads to overstatements (see below).</italic> </p><p>In the new version of the manuscript we have included lipid transfer measurement (by isotopolog profiling) also for the <italic>str</italic> mutant. This mutant is defective in an ABC transporter gene. STR localizes to the periarbuscular membrane and is hypothesized to transport lipids out of the plant cell towards the arbuscule.</p><p><italic>1) Both mutants displayed a reduced fungal colonization, still the fungus was able to develop intraradical hyphae, and the main phenotype was distorted by arbuscules. Because the fungus is unable to feed until its in planta phase, how is the fungus nourished up to the point of arbuscule formation?</italic> </p><p>To clarify this point we have now added a new section to the Discussion: “Despite the obvious central importance of lipid uptake by the arbuscule, the fungus can initially colonize the mutant roots with a low amount of intraradical hyphae and stunted arbuscules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). […]. Alternatively, it is possible that plant housekeeping enzymes provide lipids to intraradical hyphae before arbuscule formation.”</p><p><italic>Their results rather indicate that plant lipids (if transferred) could be critical for fungal plasma membrane development at arbuscules where the fungus rapidly and profusely grows by dichotomous branching. This would be in line with their results showing complementation when using the arbuscule-specific promoter PT4.</italic> </p><p>A function in PAM synthesis is not indicated by our current results. We agree that lipids produced in arbuscule-containing cells may be used for several purposes including PAM construction and have added a sentence explaining this to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, they argue that lipid transfer might take place during arbuscule degeneration, which is inconsistent with the involvement of the other players such as the STR transporters, putative exporters of plant lipids, shown to localize in fully functional arbuscules.</italic> </p><p>Although, arbuscule collapse would act at a later and thus different stage of lipid transfer than <italic>STR</italic>, we have deleted this argument from the Discussion. Instead, we now provide data that FAs are not transferred from <italic>str</italic> mutants to AM fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also added a paragraph on the hypothetical role of <italic>STR</italic> to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The originality of their work lies on the transfer of the lipids from the plant to the fungus. And while I have little doubt that this is likely the case, in my opinion the authors failed to demonstrate that convincingly. In the key <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, the isotopolog profile of extraradical mycelium from mutant plants shows a reduced amount of 16:1w5 (the typical mycorrhizal FA) as compared to WT plants. This is not surprising giving that a much lower colonization is observed in those plants and results are given as enrichment and not per amount of mycelium, and its synthesis has been shown to happen within colonized roots. But if this lipid can be only synthesized after transfer of monoacylglycerols to the fungus, why is there at all in the roots of mutants and in the connected extraradical hyphae? And furthermore, why its concentration is even significantly higher than in hyphae grown in the absence of a labelled plant? If no lipid transfer was taking place, there should be no labelled 16:1w5 in the hyphal samples from mutant plants at all.</italic> </p><p>Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) is very important, we disagree that it is the key figure. The key figure is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) showing an extreme similarity of FA isotopolog profiles between WT roots (<italic>Lotus</italic> and carrot) and the fungal extraradical mycelium. This can only be explained by direct FA transfer (in whichever lipid form) from plant to fungus. It is possible that ß-monoacylglycerols are the transferred lipid and we have discussed this in detail in the Discussion section. However, we would like to point out that it has not been clearly shown. Nevertheless, we have now quantified MAGs in all mutants and wild-type roots and added the data to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We think that the extremely low amount of <sup>13</sup>C labelled FAs appearing in the fungus when it is connected with <italic>dis, ram2</italic> or <italic>str</italic> mutants has most likely been synthesized by housekeeping KASI and GPAT6.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript reports the surprising discovery that not only sugars, but also lipids are transferred from plants to symbiotic fungi. We found the isotope labeling experiment very impressive, convincing us that in dis, ram2 and str mutants the fungal profiles do not align with the host profile, in contrast to the wild type, were both align very well. This strongly supports the hypothesis that fatty acids synthesized in the plants through this pathway are transferred to the fungus. In absence of a protein that has been directly shown to transport fatty acids from plant to fungus (although STR is a good candidate), this is the strongest evidence pointing to transfer of lipids that are generated through DIS and RAM2. We would, however, ask the authors to add a sentence that they cannot exclude at this point that STR effects on lipid transport are indirect (although we agree that the common regulation of RAM2 and STR by RAM1 make for an exciting hypothesis in this direction, direct regulation of STR by RAM1 does not seem to have been shown).</italic> </p><p>We agree and added a sentence to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>We have read the previous reviewers' comments and the authors' replies and felt that they were sufficiently addressed. The new Figure panels 8D and 9 surely help to follow the rationale behind the experiments and are welcome in this new version.</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>An attractive genetic experiment for the future would be to constitutively express DIS and RAM2 in an str background, in order to assess a tissue that is full of the right lipids but presumably would still be unable to feed the fungi. If data from such an experiment are already at hand, please include them.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the proposed experiment would be very interesting. We did not yet attempt to constitutively express <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> in the <italic>str</italic> background. However, we tried whether constitutive expression of <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> and a combination of both under the control of a strong ubiquitin promoter in the wild-type could enhance root colonization. In two independent experiments, we could neither detect enhanced transcript accumulation of <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> (normalized to Ubiquitin10 transcript accumulation) nor enhanced root length colonization. Therefore, we suspect that increased transcript accumulation of <italic>DIS</italic> and <italic>RAM2</italic> may be difficult to achieve in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> hairy roots. The approach works <italic>per se</italic> because in a previous study we observed that <italic>RAM1</italic> transcript accumulation was strongly increased in colonized wild-type roots, when the roots were transformed with a <italic>RAM1</italic> fused to the very same ubiquitin promoter (see Pimprikar et al. 2016, Figure S3).</p><p>Please see the results from one of the two experiments below.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29107.049</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.29107.049">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29107.049</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29107-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>One question relates to a point raised by previous reviewer 3 and the authors' reply that membrane formation during initial colonization is supported by vesicles. Would a photosynthetic nurse plant be able to provide the lipids for vesicle formation and thus lipids that could be sourced to form new arbuscules (as pointed out before)? Please discuss.</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting question and we discussed this in the new version of our manuscript. In the reviewers request there may be a small misunderstanding/typo. We wrote that membrane formation during initial colonization is supported by the large amounts of lipids present in “spores”. It has very recently been reported that arbuscule branching in <italic>ram2</italic> mutants can be supported by photosynthetic nurse plants (Luginbuehl et al. 2017, Jiang et al. 2017). For three reasons, we favour the alternative scenario, in which cell-autonomous provision of lipids is required for the formation of <italic>fine</italic> arbuscule branches, which are indicative of a fully developed arbuscule:</p><p>1) Our <italic>dis-1</italic> and <italic>ram2-1</italic> mutants have been found based on their stunted arbuscule phenotype in a forward genetic screen in which the inoculum was provided by photosynthetic chive nurse plants (Groth et al. 2013).</p><p>2) We performed co-segregation analyses for mapping the mutations with segregating populations grown in the same pot, therefore, the wild-type and heterozygeous siblings acted as photosynthetic nurse plants on the mutants. In these conditions the stunted arbuscule phenotype was very easily detectable.</p><p>3) Arbuscule branching was not restored in a rice <italic>str</italic> mutant when grown in the presence of wild-type nurse plants (Gutjahr et al. 2012).</p><p>However, we agree that photosynthetic nurse plants support a higher level of colonization in the lipid biosynthesis and <italic>str</italic> mutants (see also Gutjahr et al. 2012) and that nurse plants can also support the formation of low amounts of lipid-containing vesicles (see <italic>ram2</italic> mutant in our new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>We also were not comfortable with the conclusion that the transcript accumulation of KASIII and DIS &quot;depends&quot; on RAM1. This could also be a rather indirect effect, of reduced fungal mass in ram1 mutants. Please change the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to something like &quot;Loss of RAM1 affects AM-specific induction of KASIII and DIS&quot;, and in 6A e.g. &quot;RAM1 effects on AM-specific induction of KASIII and DIS and 16:0 FA biosynthesis, and absence of effects on KASII&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend according to the reviewer’s suggestions and also adjusted the corresponding Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
