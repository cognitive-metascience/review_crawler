In cells with a radial microtubule system, a pivotal role in setting up asymmetry is attributed to the relative positioning of the centrosome and the nucleus. Here, we show that centrosome loss had no effect on the ability of endothelial cells to polarize and move in 2D and 3D environments. In contrast, non-centrosomal microtubules stabilized by the microtubule minus-end-binding protein CAMSAP2 were required for directional migration on 2D substrates and for the establishment of polarized cell morphology in soft 3D matrices. CAMSAP2 was also important for persistent endothelial cell sprouting during in vivo zebrafish vessel development. In the absence of CAMSAP2, cell polarization in 3D could be partly rescued by centrosome depletion, indicating that in these conditions the centrosome inhibited cell polarity. We propose that CAMSAP2-protected non-centrosomal microtubules are needed for establishing cell asymmetry by enabling microtubule enrichment in a single-cell protrusion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33864.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Networks of blood vessels grow like trees. Sprouts appear on existing vessels, stretching out to form new branches in a process called angiogenesis. The cells responsible are the same cells that line the finished vessels. These “endothelial cells” start the process by reorganizing themselves to face the direction of the new sprout, changing shape to become asymmetrical, and then they begin to migrate.</p><p>Beneath the surface, a network of protein scaffolding supports each migrating cell. The scaffolding includes tube-like fibers called microtubules that extend towards the cell membrane and organize the inside of the cell. Destroying microtubules damages blood vessel formation, but their exact role remains unclear.</p><p>A structure called the centrosome can organize microtubules within cells. The centrosome was generally believed to act like a compass, pointing in the direction that the cell will move. Microtubules can anchor to the centrosome, and this structure is thought to play an important role in cell migration. Yet, many microtubules organize without it; these microtubules instead are organized by a compartment of the cell called the Golgi apparatus and are stabilized by a protein named CAMSAP2.</p><p>Martin et al. now report that removing the cells’ centrosomes did not affect cell migration, but getting rid of CAMSAP2 did. Analysis of cell shape and movement in cells grown in the laboratory and in living animals revealed that cells cannot become asymmetrical, or “polarize”, and migrate without CAMSAP2.</p><p>In a two-dimensional wound-healing assay, a sheet of cells originally grown from the vessels of a human umbilical cord was scratched, and a microscope was then used to record the cell’s movement as they repaired the injury. Normally, the cells on either side move in a straight line using their microtubules, and though the process was not affected in cells without centrosomes, it was in those without CAMSAP2.</p><p>Even more striking results were seen in three-dimensional assays. When the same blood vessel cells from human umbilical cords are grown as spheres inside collagen gels, they form sprouts as they would in the body. Without CAMSAP2, the cells could not organize their microtubules and they were unable to elongate in one direction and form stable sprouts. Lastly, depleting CAMSAP2 also prevented the normal formation of blood vessels in zebrafish embryos.</p><p>Taken together, these findings change our understanding of how microtubules affect cell movement and how important the centrosome is for this process. Further work could have an impact on human health, not least in cancer research. Tumors need a good blood supply to grow, so understanding how to block blood vessel formation could lead to new treatments. Microtubules are already a target for cancer therapy, so future work could help to optimize the use of existing drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Centrosome</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>CAMSAP</kwd><kwd>Golgi apparatus</kwd><kwd>endothelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synergy 609822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALW Open Program grant 824.15.017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IEF fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Maud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Jingchao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRIA fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veloso</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-centrosomal microtubules are required for endothelial polarization and sprouting, while centrosomally anchored microtubule arrays are both dispensable and insufficient for these processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell polarization is a prerequisite for virtually every specialized cellular process. By analogy with the compass on a ship navigating to its destination, the centrosome has been assumed to play a central role in governing cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bornens, 2012</xref>), including two-dimensional (2D) mesenchymal migration, in which cells are organized into an extending leading edge and a contractile cell rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang and Marshall, 2012</xref>). The widely accepted dogma connecting the centrosome and the direction of cell movement originated from the observation that during migration, the centrosome is typically positioned at the front of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gotlieb et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koonce et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kupfer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malech et al., 1977</xref>). Such centrosome positioning is observed in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elric and Etienne-Manneville, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luxton and Gundersen, 2011</xref>), although it does not apply to certain specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luxton and Gundersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yvon et al., 2002</xref>) or in the presence of environmental constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doyle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pouthas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schütze et al., 1991</xref>). Despite the scarcity of direct experimental evidence, currently based on laser ablation of the pericentrosomal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koonce et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wakida et al., 2010</xref>) or indirect interference with centrosome localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dujardin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy and Holzbaur, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmoranzer et al., 2009</xref>), the orientation of the nucleo-centrosomal axis is commonly regarded as a major cell polarity determinant.</p><p>Microtubules (MTs) are thought to support cell polarity by forming an asymmetrical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville, 2013</xref>). This asymmetry can potentially be generated by specific positioning of the centrosomal anchor of a radial MT network relative to other cell structures, such as the nucleus, but also by MTs that do not originate from the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alieva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vinogradova et al., 2009</xref>). The minus ends of centrosome-independent MTs can associate with the members of the calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP)/Patronin/Nezha family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). In mammalian cells, CAMSAP2, together with CAMSAP3 in certain cell types, binds to free, non-centrosomal MT minus ends and promotes their stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, CAMSAP2 has recently been shown to participate in MT stabilization at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), a site that can function as an alternative MT-organizing centre (MTOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu and Kaverina, 2013</xref>). In mammalian cells, the Golgi is often positioned close to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rios, 2014</xref>), and thus locates in front of the nucleus during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koonce et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kupfer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malech et al., 1977</xref>). As the central organizer of the secretory pathway, an anteriorly positioned Golgi is thought to support polarized transport needed to sustain directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). Consistently, Golgi disorganization without MT disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurtado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yadav et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the loss of Golgi-associated MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurtado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2009</xref>) prevent proper polarized Golgi trafficking without affecting global secretory properties but lead to defects in directional cell movement. Notably, investigation of the contributions of centrosomal and Golgi-originating MT populations to Golgi organization indicated that the role of the centrosome was restricted to facilitating assembly of an integral Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinogradova et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>During angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel development, endothelial cells (ECs) respond to external cues by coordinating numerous activities, including proliferation, sprouting, migration, lumen formation and anastomosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geudens and Gerhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potente et al., 2011</xref>). The first step of vessel formation, outward cell sprouting, requires that the tip cell, which will guide growth of a new vessel, breaks symmetry by extending protrusions toward guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geudens and Gerhardt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Bautch, 2011</xref>). MT growth dynamics has been shown to be required for the formation and maintenance of angiogenic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayless and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers et al., 2011</xref>), whereas its regional regulation has been implicated in directional EC migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2014</xref>). Vascular sprouting and repolarization are also affected by supernumerary centrosomes, a hallmark of tumor ECs that impacts on MT nucleation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kushner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kushner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The ability of ECs to polarize can be explored in 2D, where cells respond to a monolayer wound by developing a mesenchymal motile phenotype typified by a front-rear asymmetry and anterior centrosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gotlieb et al., 1981</xref>). When cultured in 3D collagen gels, ECs form branched tubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koh et al., 2008</xref>), and when spheroids of ECs are embedded in a 3D matrix, they develop sprouts that closely reproduce the first step of formation of capillaries from pre-existing vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfisterer and Korff, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a combination of 2D and 3D endothelial models to investigate the role of MT organization in cell polarization. Challenging the prevailing view, our data showed that the centrosomal MT population is dispensable and insufficient for EC migration and sprouting. In contrast, silencing of CAMSAP2, which results in disappearance of non-centrosomal MTs, profoundly perturbed the ability of ECs to form vascular sprouts in vitro as well as in vivo, in zebrafish embryos. Detailed analysis showed that non-centrosomal MTs are required to allow MT redistribution in a single-cell protrusion and thus enable polarized trafficking, directional stabilization of protrusions and persistent migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The centrosome is not essential for endothelial migration and sprouting</title><p>Using 2D monolayer wound healing assay, we confirmed the anterior position of the centrosome and the Golgi apparatus in migrating ECs and also extended this observation to tip ECs sprouting from a spheroid in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To assess the impact of centrosome removal on these processes, we took advantage of the Plk4 inhibitor centrinone, which prevents centriole duplication and leads to centrosome depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Efficient centrosome elimination was confirmed by staining with different markers of centrioles or pericentriolar material (PCM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Loss of centrosomes as focal points of MT organization was also visible by super-resolution imaging of the MT networks in fixed cells and by tracing growing EB3-GFP-positive MTs in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Importantly, the centrosomal arrangement of MTs in control cells was more obvious in EB3-GFP tracings than in MT images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), suggesting that the centrosome plays a more important role in nucleating new MTs than in anchoring their minus ends, and that even in control cells, a significant MT population is non-centrosomal. The perinuclear MT density was partly associated with the Golgi apparatus, which was mildly enlarged and less compact in centrinone-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Nocodazole washout assays showed that the centrosome was the major nucleation site during MT reassembly in control cells, while this function was taken over by the Golgi membranes in centrinone-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In spite of these differences, MT density, the density of growing, EB3-positive MT plus ends, parameters of MT plus end growth and the levels of different tubulin post-translational modifications were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), and in contrast to a centrosome excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>), the distribution and intensity of cell-cell adhesion markers was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref> ) (). The abundance of MT minus-end stabilizing protein CAMSAP2 was mildly but not significantly increased, and the area occupied by CAMSAP2 stretches was enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>). This is consistent with the enlarged Golgi, to which many CAMSAP2 stretches attach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), and possibly with an increased stabilization of non-centrosomal MTs that compensate for the loss of the centrosomal ones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33864.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The centrosome is not essential for angiogenic migration and sprouting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Imaging of control or centrinone-treated HUVECs stained for MT (α-tubulin, cyan hot) using STED microscopy.

ECs in the migrating front still showed proper polarized organization with their Golgi positioned toward the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In a more physiological 3D context, centrosome removal did not affect the emergence of EC sprouts out of spheroids grown in collagen matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To confirm these results, we depleted centrosomes by knocking down CPAP, a factor essential for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tang et al., 2009</xref>).

This redistribution had remarkably similar consequences for 2D migration compared to CAMSAP2 silencing: ECs that had lost their Golgi-attached CAMSAP2 were unable to maintain directionality and to orient their Golgi, resulting in migration deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Interestingly, the situation differed when ECs were placed in a 3D context: whereas displacing non-centrosomal CAMSAP2-bound MT ends from Golgi by depleting AKAP450 or MMG had a negative impact on endothelial sprouting abilities, its effect was significantly milder than that of CAMSAP2 depletion, when most MTs were attached to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggests that in 3D sprouting, non-centrosomal MTs might have a role independent of their direct Golgi association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33864.029</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Loss of non-centrosomal MTs has a more severe impact than their detachment from the Golgi in 3D but not in 2D.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Staining for CAMSAP2 (white, green) and Golgi (GM130, red) in HUVECs transfected with the indicated siRNA.

We next focused on CAMSAP2b, because among CAMSAP2 orthologs, it showed the highest expression in the zebrafish endothelium and was associated with more severe vascular defects. In zebrafish, two waves of dorsal sprouting angiogenesis take place successively during vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellertsdóttir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isogai et al., 2003</xref>). The first one occurs at around 22 hr post fertilization (hpf) from the dorsal aorta and forms arterial intersegmental vessels. Another one takes place between 32 and 48 hpf from the cardinal vein and gives rise to venous intersegmental vessels and to parachordal lymphangioblasts, precursors of lymphangiogenic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). After CAMSAP2b inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>), arterial intersegmental vessel formation was hardly altered, but the secondary EC sprouting was perturbed, giving rise to abnormal tortuous venous intersegmental vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In CAMSAP2b morphants, we observed fewer secondary sprouts emerging from the cardinal vein at 34 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, the fraction of venous sprouts that had fused with the neighboring arterial intersegmental vessel at 41 hpf was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting a defect in directional migration. Venous intersegmental vessels form after cardinal vein-derived secondary sprouts connect to primary arterial intersegmental vessels. Because secondary sprouts had difficulties to fuse with primary intersegmental vessels, we also found that the proportion of venous intersegmental vessels at 48hpf was reduced in CAMSAP2b morphants: whereas control embryos displayed a typical 50–50 arterial/venous intersegmental vessel ratio, fewer intersegmental vessels were connected to the cardinal veinand scored as venous intersegmental vessels in CAMSAP2b morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>).

Control ECs contain three distinct populations of MT, the centrosomal MTs (grey), the non-centrosomal, Golgi-anchored MTs (burgundy) and the non-centrosomal non-Golgi-anchored MTs (dark green). The two non-centrosomal MT populations are stabilized by the presence of CAMSAP2 stretches at their minus-ends (light green rectangle). During 2D migration, the presence of Golgi-originating MTs, which are lost after CAMSAP2, MMG or AKAP450 depletion, ensures proper Golgi polarization and directional migration. In the context of 3D sprouting, both non-centrosomal populations are enriched in a single protrusion, which becomes larger and more stable than the rest. Centrosomal MTs are dispensable for both processes.

In control conditions, venous ECs migrated in a highly directed manner to either fuse to the neighboring arterial intersegmental vessel or start assembling horizontal parachordal lymphangioblasts (Supplemental <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).

These observations were quantitatively validated by tracking the length and orientation of venous sprouts over time. In contrast to their regular extension in control animals, venous sprouts depleted of CAMSAP2b displayed a more erratic and less efficient growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). This aberrant behavior is also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, where CAMSAP2b silencing is shown to be associated with a lot of shortening episodes (negative change in length) and a more variable sprout orientation (higher change in angle), resulting in a significantly lower growth and directional persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>).

Altogether, these observations suggest a defect in guided migration during venous sprouting in CAMSAP2b-silenced zebrafish embryos, in agreement with our in vitro findings and supporting the idea that CAMSAP2 is involved in directional angiogenic sprouting in vivo.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-33864-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33864.045</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of directional venous sprouting in control <italic>Tg(Fli1ep:Lifeact-EGFP)</italic> embryos.</title><p>Time is hr: min post-fertilization.

One current model explaining the generation of an asymmetric MT array involves forward positioning of its center, the centrosome, assumed to represent the main MTOC, together with the local regulation of MT plus end stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vinogradova et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we showed that although these regulatory processes could contribute to the asymmetry of the system, a centrosomal radial MT network was both completely dispensable and insufficient for the establishment of polarized cell morphology in soft 3D matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>).</p><p>Previous work showed that the MT minus-end binding protein CAMSAP2 is a key player in the regulation of non-centrosomal MT minus ends in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we uncovered the crucial role of CAMSAP2 in regulating cell polarity during endothelial sprout formation in 3D and persistent directional migration in 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). We think that this demonstrates the important role of non-centrosomal MTs in these processes, because, although we cannot exclude that this protein has alternative functions, for example in controlling motor-based transport or signaling, we did not find any direct evidence supporting such functions in our experiments. Furthermore, although MTs are known to regulate actin organization, and MT destabilization promotes myosin II-dependent contractility, which affects protrusion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville, 2013</xref>), the protrusions formed in the absence of CAMSAP2 exhibited unchanged F-actin network. This was in line with our observation that the loss of CAMSAP2 had no impact on the overall microtubule density, plus end dynamics or modifications. Our observation that pharmacological inhibition of contractility failed to rescue the persistency and polarized organization of cell protrusions after CAMSAP2 depletion further supports the view that the observed cell morphology and migration defects were not caused by changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Importantly, CAMSAP2-depleted ECs could still form lamellipodia and retracting cell rear on 2D surfaces and initiated protrusions when cultured in 3D. Whether this reflects a sufficient degree of asymmetry supported by the centrosomal MT network, or a lack of MT involvement in these actin-based processes, as it has been suggested in 2D models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegrist and Doe, 2007</xref>), deserves additional investigation. However, both in 2D and 3D, loss of non-centrosomal MTs interfered with persistence of lamellipodia and elongation of cell protrusions, explaining migration defects.</p><p>CAMSAP2 played a much more prominent role in 3D than in 2D environment and even displayed different phenotypes in the two distinct 3D settings we used: the absence of CAMSAP2 severely reduced sprouting from spheroids, while the protrusive activity of single isolated ECs in collagen matrix was unaffected. It is likely that the distinct degree of polarity required in these assays could explain this difference. The inability of spheroids to maintain and extend long sprouting structures will culminate in their collapse (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas isolated ECs could form protrusions in any direction. However, also in the latter case, the radial MT network in CAMSAP2-silenced ECs could not support polarized elongated morphology characteristic for control cells. In our recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouchet et al., 2016</xref>), we showed that in mesenchymal cells, the initial formation of protrusions is MT-independent, but the extension and stabilization of long protrusions occurs only if they are filled with MTs. The data presented in the current study indicate that in order to acquire an elongated polarized morphology, 3D-cultured ECs need to be able to concentrate their MTs in one protrusion. If the intrinsic centrosome-driven symmetry of the MT network dominates, it inhibits this process, forcing the cells to acquire a non-polarized ‘starfish’-like shape, which is incompatible with efficient cell elongation and translocation in 3D matrix, as observed in the spheroid sprouting assay. While our results focus on one the very first steps of sprouting angiogenesis, that is the extension and stabilization of a protrusion that is required for effective outward migration, other important angiogenic behaviors involving polarity, as multicellular sprout growth and vessel lumenization were not addressed in this study and deserve further investigation.</p><p>Non-centrosomal MTs can form intrinsically asymmetric networks through their attachment to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vinogradova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu and Kaverina, 2013</xref>). Indeed, confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roubin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu and Kaverina, 2013</xref>), we showed that the depletion of Golgi-originating MTs dependent on AKAP450 and MMG fully recapitulated CAMSAP2 inactivation-related defects in 2D assays. This suggests that the Golgi-anchored MT population, required for the proper Golgi positioning and polarized trafficking, is an important determinant of directional 2D migration. However, in the 3D spheroid assays, the impact of AKAP450 or MMG knockdown was far less severe than that of CAMSAP2 depletion. In fact, an elongated morphology in isolated ECs in 3D could be established when MMG was depleted and Golgi-attached MTs were absent. This suggests that non-centrosomal MTs can function independently of the Golgi anchoring. This idea is supported by the observation that the phenotype caused by the loss of CAMSAP2 could be partially rescued by suppressing formation of a symmetric centrosome-associated MT aster and thus reverting to a non-centrosomal MT array, albeit one lacking Golgi-MT attachments. In fact, the remarkable similarity between the phenotypes associated with CAMSAP2 and MMG depletion after centrinone treatment, leading to similar MT organization, strengthens the idea that the presence of non-centrosomal MTs per se, rather than their Golgi attachment might be crucial to support at least some degree of 3D sprout formation. The redistribution of MT nucleating and anchoring PCM complexes to the Golgi and cytoplasm likely contributes to the generation of such arrays in centrinone-treated cells. It is possible that asymmetrical cortical stabilization of MTs, regulated by extrinsic signals, can be sufficient to polarize the MT network independently of Golgi anchoring, if this polarity is not perturbed by the presence of a potent symmetric MT-anchoring structure such as the centrosome.</p><p>We recently showed that a single Golgi apparatus can assemble in the absence of centrosomal and Golgi-derived MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that non-centrosomal MTs that are detached from the Golgi membranes can still regulate Golgi organization. It is therefore possible that non-centrosomal MTs that are not anchored at the Golgi can still control Golgi positioning and ensure polarized secretion, as the Golgi is typically oriented toward the main protrusion in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In this situation, the Golgi apparatus and non-centrosomal MTs, although not permanently connected, likely exert a positive feedback on each other. The Golgi, which in the absence of the centrosome concentrates γ-tubulin and some other PCM components, serves as the major MT nucleation site, albeit a one which cannot tether the MTs it nucleates. MTs, in turn, serve as directional tracks for localizing Golgi membranes, and increasing MT density in one protrusion will help to maintain the Golgi at the base of this protrusion.</p><p>The mechanism of MT minus end stabilization in the absence of both the centrosome and CAMSAP2 is still an open question. An interesting candidate is ninein, a protein involved in MT minus-end organization in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moss et al., 2007</xref>), whose worm homolog can act on the same pathway as CAMSAP homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, ninein has been described to relocalize from the centrosome to the cytoplasm upon triggering angiogenesis and to participate in endothelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsumoto et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In line with our in vitro results, CAMSAP2 inactivation in zebrafish perturbed the directional and persistent migration of ECs sprouting dorsally from the cardinal vein. Interestingly, loss of CAMSAP2 had no effect on EC sprouting form the dorsal aorta, thus suggesting that venous sprouting might be more sensitive to the lack of CAMSAP2. Recent evidence suggests that ECs from different vascular beds are differentially regulated and use different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha and Adams, 2009</xref>). It is possible that the secondary wave of sprouting from the cardinal vein is more dependent on intrinsic polarity mechanisms than the arterial sprouting, for instance, due to differential participation of supportive cells and therefore different need for cytoskeleton-based processes.</p><p>One of the most surprising findings of this study is the lack of importance of the centrosome in endothelial polarization. Although we do not exclude that centrosomal MTs are participating in polarity establishment in control cells, where the centrosome is in fact the major nucleating factor, we provide evidence that its MT anchoring activity is dispensable, not sufficient and should be counterbalanced by a non-centrosomal MT population. As it was already described for other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bornens, 2012</xref>), our results support the view that the centrosome has no crucial function in many types of animal tissues. Whereas the role of centrosome localization in determining neuronal polarity in vivo has been heavily debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011</xref>), an inhibitory role for a radial centrosomal MT organization has recently been suggested in epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>). Altogether, our findings support the concept that polarity induction requires a switch to an asymmetric MT network, which might involve participation of centrosome-independent MT minus end stabilizing factors and centrosome inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Dario rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(fli1a:eGFP)y1</td><td valign="top">Zebrafish facility GIGA institute, Liege University</td><td valign="top">ID_Zfin:ZDB-TGCONSTRCT-070117–94</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(Fli1ep:Lifeact-EGFP)</td><td valign="top">Zebrafish facility GIGA institute, Liege University;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phng et al.

Radial local orientation angle was calculated as a difference between the local orientation angle and the angle of vector drawn from the new origin of coordinates to the current pixel position. A radial map image was calculated then as an absolute value of the cosine of the radial local orientation angle at each pixel providing values between zero and one. A non-radial map image was calculated as one minus radial map.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor and Pekka Lappalainen as the Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript focuses on the roles of different types of microtubule anchoring/stabilization mechanisms (centrosomally anchored versus Golgi-anchored CAMSAP2-stabilized versus CAMPSAP2-stabilized not Golgi-anchored) in the polarization and movement of endothelial cells in 2D and 3D environments. The major finding is that, especially in soft 3D environments, centrosomal microtubules are not essential for establishment of polarity, whereas CAMSAP2-stabilized, non-centrosomal microtubules are required for persistent elongation of the cell body. Moreover, the authors show that CAMSAP2 plays a role in sprouting angiogenesis in vivo.</p><p>These findings are interesting, and the analysis and quantification methods are well designed and state of the art. The topic of the interplay between centrosomal, Golgi-anchored, and non-centrosomal microtubules and the role of the CAMSAPs in the dynamics of non-centrosomal arrays is also of high current interest. However, there are few points that should be addressed to further strengthen the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should examine at which level the cell morphology is affected in the absence of CAMSAPs (i.e. do CAMSAP-dependent microtubules generate and stabilize protrusions in ECs or do they stabilize protrusions indirectly by regulating the actin cytoskeleton). The authors should thus more thoroughly examine the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in control vs. CAMSAP knockdown cells. Because CAMSAP knockdown cells appear to have more stress fibers compared to control cells (based on the images presented in Figures 4B and C), the authors could also use e.g. blebbistatin to examine whether the differences in the number and persistence of protrusions between control and CAMSAP knockdown cells could result from their different contractility.</p><p>2) Unlike stated in the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors cannot conclude from their data that CAMSAP2 depletion completely blocks sprouting from spheroids. There are plenty of short sprouts (in line with protrusive activity of isolated ECs, which can make protrusions), but not very long, single ones.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33864.053</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should examine at which level the cell morphology is affected in the absence of CAMSAPs (i.e. do CAMSAP-dependent microtubules generate and stabilize protrusions in ECs or do they stabilize protrusions indirectly by regulating the actin cytoskeleton).

In particular, the effect of microtubule signaling on Rho GTPase-mediated control of cell protrusion and contractility is often thought to represent the most important microtubule function during cell migration.</p><p>In order to find out whether the role of CAMSAP2-stabilised non-centrosomal microtubules was mediated by the regulation of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton, we performed a new set of 2D and 3D experiments to:</p><p>- assess the impact of CAMSAP2 depletion on the actin cytoskeleton</p><p>- examine whether a potential change in contractility could explain CAMSAP2-associated defects.</p><p>The entire new Figure 4 (complemented with two supplement figures) now addresses this question in detail. We found that whereas CAMSAP2-knockdown cells exhibited a small increase in the abundance of stress fibers in 2D (Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), this change was not associated with alterations in Rho and Rac1 activation pattern, the arrangement of cell-cell junctions or formation of myosin IIb-enriched retracting rear (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C, already included the first version of the manuscript). More importantly, when looking in the context of a 3D environment, we now found that within the protrusions, the actin cytoskeleton that is mainly cortical was unaltered following CAMSAP2 depletion (Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>In agreement with previous 3D observations showing that cortical contractility counteracts protrusion formation (Sanz-Moreno et al., 2008, Fischer et al., 2009, Bouchet et al., 2016), we observed longer and more persistent protrusions, as well as more and longer spheroid sprouts after treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (Figure 4E, F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-F). Nevertheless, even in a background with reduced contractility, CAMSAP2 silencing still severely affected protrusion persistence, cell elongation and sprout formation (Figure 4D, E, F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-F). Taken together, these data show that CAMSAP2-stabilised microtubules are controlling protrusion persistence and organization without significantly affecting acto-myosin cytoskeleton and contractility, and we added this consideration to the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Unlike stated in the third paragraph of the Discussion, the authors cannot conclude from their data that CAMSAP2 depletion completely blocks sprouting from spheroids. There are plenty of short sprouts (in line with protrusive activity of isolated ECs, which can make protrusions), but not very long, single ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that CAMSAP2-depleted spheroids could still form short sprouts and that saying that CAMSAP2 silencing almost completely blocked sprouting is a too strong statement. In total agreement with the reviewers’ comment, we think that the “protrusive activity” of CAMSAP2depleted ECs, important for protrusion initiation, is not affected, explaining the presence of short sprouts. Nevertheless, whereas the lack of protrusion persistence in isolated ECs “only” impaired their organization, the inability of CAMSAP2-silenced spheroids to mature larger sprouts caused their regression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). This ultimately led to a difference in the severity of the phenotypes that we do find striking (for example, if we compare Figure 2G with Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>We rephrased our statement to more accurately reflect these considerations (subsection “CAMSAP2 is required for maintaining non-centrosomal MTs and cell migration in ECs”, last paragraph; subsection “CAMSAP2 is required for stabilization of one major cell protrusion”, first paragraph; subsection “Centrosome removal promotes cell polarization in the absence of CAMSAP2”, last paragraph; Discussion, second and third paragraphs).</p></body></sub-article></article>
