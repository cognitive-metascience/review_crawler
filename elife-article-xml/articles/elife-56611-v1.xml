mitotic chromosome segregation is thought to involve the co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings. Although cohesin can load onto chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, it only builds cohesion during S phase. A key question is whether cohesion is generated by conversion of cohesin complexes associated with un-replicated DNAs ahead of replication forks into cohesive structures behind them, or from nucleoplasmic cohesin that is loaded de novo onto nascent DNAs associated with forks, a process that would be dependent on cohesin’s Scc2 subunit. We show here that in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, both mechanisms exist and that each requires a different set of replisome-associated proteins. Cohesion produced by cohesin conversion requires Tof1/Csm3, Ctf4 and Chl1 but not Scc2 while that created by Scc2-dependent de novo loading at replication forks requires the Ctf18-RFC complex. The association of specific replisome proteins with different types of cohesion establishment opens the way to a mechanistic understanding of an aspect of DNA replication unique to eukaryotic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>shister chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>SMC</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>replisome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107935/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nasmyth</surname><given-names>Kim A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nasmyth</surname><given-names>Kim A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sister chromatid cohesion is established during replication by two independent pathways operating in parallel, one converts chromosomal cohesin into cohesive structures while the other loads cohesin onto nascent DNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The error-free duplication and segregation of chromosomal DNAs is fundamental to cell proliferation. Sister DNAs generated during DNA replication must be held together from S phase until anaphase, when they finally disjoin to opposite poles of the cell. While there are similarities in the way bacteria and eukaryotes replicate their genomes, the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase and its destruction during anaphase are aspects of chromosome biology unique to eukaryotic cells. Cohesion is mediated by cohesin, which belongs to one of three classes of eukaryotic SMC-kleisin protein containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although initially identified as being necessary for sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), cohesin also has a major role in organizing the topology of individual interphase chromatin fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rao et al., 2017</xref>), a function thought to stem from its ability to trap and processively enlarge DNA loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The notion that most cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA is engaged in extruding loops raises an important conundrum, namely what alteration in its enzymatic activity is required to establish cohesion between nascent sister DNAs during S phase. Elucidating this problem will require a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in both processes. Like all other SMC protein complexes, cohesin contains a pair of rod-shaped SMC proteins (Smc1 and 3), whose association via their hinge domains creates V-shaped heterodimers with ATPase domains at their vertices that are interconnected by a kleisin subunit (Scc1) to form trimeric rings. These trimers have little or no ATPase or loop extrusion activity in vitro nor do they possess any biological function in vivo and require an additional set of proteins, namely a set of hook-shaped proteins composed of HEAT repeats known as HAWKs (HEAT repeat proteins Associated With Kleisins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Cohesin has three HAWKs: Scc3 is permanently bound while Scc2/Nipbl and Pds5 appear interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petela et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Along with the finding that cleavage of Scc1 by separase triggers cohesin’s dissociation from chromosomes as well as sister chromatid disjunction at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>), the discovery that cohesin forms a tripartite ring raised the possibility that it holds DNAs together using a topological principle, by co-entrapment of sister DNAs within Smc-kleisin rings, a notion known as the ring model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>). Testing this has been made possible through elucidation of the molecular structures of the Smc1/Smc3, Smc3/Scc1, and Scc1/Smc1 interfaces, which has permitted the insertion of cysteine pairs that can be chemically crosslinked in vivo as well as in vitro using bi-functional thiol-specific reagents. As predicted by the ring model, crosslinking all three interfaces in living cells creates circular Smc1-Smc3-Scc1 polypeptides within which circular mini-chromosome DNAs would be entrapped in a manner resistant to SDS treatment. Catenation by cohesin of individual DNAs in this manner modestly retards their electrophoretic migration (creating catenated monomers or CMs) while co-entrapment of sister DNAs causes them to migrate as dimers (catenated dimers or CDs) even when they are not otherwise intertwined through DNA-DNA catenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haering et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Strict topological entrapment of DNAs within cohesin rings, as measured in the above manner, is not essential either for cohesin’s association with yeast chromosomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>) or for loop extrusion by mammalian cohesin rings in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, cohesin is capable of entrapping individual DNAs prior to DNA replication and also does so when expressed in post-replicative cells, where it is known to load onto chromosomes without forming sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, CD formation accompanies the establishment of cohesion in all cases hitherto analysed, suggesting that co-entrapment within cohesin’s Smc-kleisin ring may indeed be the mechanism by which cohesin holds sister DNAs together.</p><p>Throughout most of the cell cycle, apart from anaphase when kleisin cleavage causes rapid dissociation, the fraction of cohesin associated with chromatin is determined by its rate of association and its rate of dissociation. The former depends on Scc2, Scc3, and Scc4, which binds to Scc2’s N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinshaw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kikuchi et al., 2016</xref>), while the latter depends on a regulatory subunit called Wapl, which binds to both Scc3 and Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Scc2 is not merely a loading factor as it is also necessary for maintaining loop extrusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>) as well as cohesin’s association with chromatin in vivo during G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). In the latter case, it does so by preventing dissociation of the Smc3/Scc1 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). How Wapl overrides this inhibition and thereby triggers release is not understood. What is clear is that the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion, once established during S phase, depends on abrogation of Wapl-induced release through modification of K112 and K113 on Smc3 by the Eco1 acetyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivanov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Unal et al., 2008</xref>). In yeast, acetylation only takes place during S phase and appears to be sufficient to block release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2010</xref>). In mammalian cells, Smc3 acetylation, though necessary, is insufficient and the continual association of another factor named sororin is necessary to protect cohesive structures over the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Because it is required to build cohesion during S phase but not to maintain it during G2 or indeed for cohesin’s association with chromatin in the first place, Eco1 was initially thought to be intimately involved in the process by which cohesion is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toth et al., 1999</xref>). It is now appreciated that these acetyl transferases are merely needed to counteract Wapl-mediated release and as a consequence they are largely dispensable for building and maintaining sister chromatid cohesion in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feytout et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>), mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>) or even plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2014</xref>) lacking Wapl.</p><p>Although it is not known whether cohesive structures throughout the genome involve co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin’s Smc-kleisin ring as observed with mini-chromosomes (i.e. CD formation), this possibility is entirely plausible. Even if not, co-entrapment may be created by a similar if not identical process to actual cohesion and is therefore an excellent surrogate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). Crucially, it is currently the only simple physical measure of cohesion. How these structures are created remains poorly understood. An important finding is that cohesin which loads onto chromosomes in post-replicative cells does not tether sister DNAs together, even though it is capable of entrapping individual DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). The process of establishing cohesion appears therefore to be confined to S phase. A key question is whether cohesive structures or CDs are derived from complexes previously associated with un-replicated DNA or created de novo by ones that load during the passage of replication forks. We will henceforth refer to these two scenarios as conversion and de novo loading, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Possible mechanisms of cohesion establishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cohesin complexes previously associated with un-replicated DNA converted into cohesive ones behind the replication fork (Cohesin conversion) or cohesion built by de novo loading of cohesin molecules onto nascent DNAs at the replication forks (de novo loading).(<bold>B</bold>) The replisome-associated proteins that affect cohesion establishment belong to two epistasis groups, one containing Chl1, Ctf4, Csm3 and Tof1 and a second containing Mrc1 as well as the Ctf18-RFC. Combining two mutants from the same group has little or no additional effect on viability and causes no greater cohesion defect than the single mutants, while combining mutants from different groups either causes lethality or synthetic sickness and, when measured using conditional alleles, greatly increased defects in sister chromatid cohesion.

(<bold>C</bold>) The approximate positions of the Tof1/Csm3, Ctf4, Chl1, Mrc1 and the Ctf18-RFC within the replisome is shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grabarczyk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villa et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56611-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The first indication that chromosomal cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA can be ‘converted’ into cohesive structures was the observation that replication fork passage in mammalian cells does not cause dissociation of chromosomal cohesin, at least in the absence of Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhodes et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, however, chromosomal cohesin was merely observed optically and it was not established whether it was turned into cohesive structures during the passage from G1 to G2. More recently, we have shown that separase resistant cohesin complexes loaded onto yeast mini-chromosomes during G2 remain associated with chromatin and are converted into cohesive structures upon a round of re-replication induced by the transient inhibition of Cdk1. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). Crucially, this occurs even when Scc2 has been inactivated after the initial loading during G2, suggesting that cohesin is converted into cohesive structures without any further participation of Scc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). However, these experiments did not exclude the possibility that cohesion might also be generated through Scc2-dependent de novo loading during S phase, a possibility raised by in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The notion that cohesion might be established during S phase by two different pathways is consistent with the finding that numerous proteins associated with replisomes, namely Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2001</xref>), Chl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petronczki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skibbens, 2004</xref>), the Csm3/Tof1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayer et al., 2004</xref>), Mrc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2004</xref>), and the Ctf18-RFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayer et al., 2001</xref> have important albeit non-essential roles in cohesion establishment. A comprehensive analysis of the viability of double mutant strains as well as their sister chromatid cohesion implied that these genes/proteins belong to two epistasis groups, one containing Chl1, Ctf4, Csm3 and Tof1 and a second containing Mrc1 as well as Ctf8, Ctf18, and Dcc1, which are all subunits of the Ctf18-RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, combining two mutants from the first group or from the second group has little or no additional effect on viability and causes no greater cohesion defect than the single mutants, while combining mutants from different groups either causes lethality or synthetic sickness and, when measured using conditional alleles, greatly increased defects in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although none of these proteins are necessary for DNA replication, all are associated with the replisome, suggesting that their role is to establish cohesion during S phase. Accordingly, inactivation of conditional alleles during G2/M has no effect on the maintenance of cohesion once established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, expression of Chl1 during G2/M cannot rescue the cohesion defects caused by replication in its absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petronczki et al., 2004</xref>). Though not essential, all of these replisome proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes and aid cohesion establishment in human as well as yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Structural studies have located with great precision the position of several of these proteins within replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but how they contribute to cohesion establishment is currently unclear.</p><p>We show here that Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1 are essential for converting cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA into cohesive structures holding together sister DNAs, whereas Mrc1 and Ctf18-RFC are not. Crucially, cohesin conversion mediated by Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1 is independent of Scc2. We present evidence that Ctf18-RFC is instead required for cohesion established through de novo loading at forks and show that this Scc2-dependent process (but not cohesin conversion) is enhanced by modest over-expression of Scc2/4. Our data are fully congruent with the previous suggestion that Mrc1 and Ctf18-RFC are involved in a separate pathway to that of Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the discovery of two physiologically as well as genetically distinct cohesion establishment pathways explains why neither pathway is essential and finally opens the way toward a mechanistic understanding of an aspect of S phase that is unique to eukaryotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cohesin associated with un-replicated chromosomes is converted to cohesive structures in the absence of Scc2 activity</title><p>Addressing whether cohesin rings that entrap sister DNAs after replication are derived from those associated with un-replicated chromosomes is complicated by the fact that chromosomal cohesin is turned over rapidly during G1 by Wapl and for this reason we conducted all experiments in cells in which Wapl-dependent release has been abrogated. To exclude any possibility of cohesion being generated from cohesin loaded during the process of DNA replication, we needed to test its dependence on Scc2, which is essential for de novo loading. However, doing this with endogenous wild type cohesin is not in fact possible because Scc2 is also necessary for maintaining cohesin’s stable DNA association during G1, even in cells lacking Wapl-dependent release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, inactivation of Scc2 during G1 causes cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes, which is incompatible with observing its conversion into cohesive structures. Two previous observations have been crucial to overcoming this problem. First, cohesin expressed in post-replicative G2 cells can load onto chromosomes and entrap individual DNAs (CMs) but cannot form cohesion or entrap sister DNAs (CDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). Second, unlike cohesin loaded during G1, cohesin loaded during G2/M does not require Scc2 to prevent its release from chromosomes and remarkably this property is maintained when cells exit mitosis and enter a new G1 phase, as long as the kleisin subunits of the cohesin in question are refractory to separase-mediated cleavage, which would otherwise induce its destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These findings enabled us to measure the establishment of cohesion generated exclusively by cohesin previously associated with un-replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our assay relies on the covalent circularization using the homo-bifunctional crosslinker BMOE of ‘6C’ cohesin complexes that contain cysteine pairs at all three of the ring’s interfaces (2CScc1 2CSmc1 2CSmc3) and entrapment within these rings of individual or co-entrapment of circular sister mini-chromosome DNAs, producing catenated monomers (CMs) or dimers (CDs) respectively, whose electrophoretic migration following SDS treatment at 65°C is modestly (CM) or greatly (CD) retarded compared to naked mini-chromosome DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chromosomal cohesin is converted into cohesive structures in the absence of Scc2 activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic depiction of the cohesin conversion assay, see the results and Materials and methods sections for detailed description of the assay. Green rings denote endogenous cohesin and red rings denote non-cleavable 6C cohesin.

Thus, only 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> expressed from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter can form 6C cohesin capable of producing CMs or CDs. It is also important to point out that the measurement of CMs and CDs using gel electrophoresis is performed on DNAs precipitated using PK-specific antibodies. Thus, DNAs migrating as supercoiled monomers were also bound by 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> but had failed to be entrapped in a fashion resistant to SDS, either because they were not entrapped or because covalent circularization of 6C cohesin is incomplete (only 20–25% are crosslinked at all three interfaces).</p><p>Wild type (<italic>SCC2</italic>) and <italic>scc2-45</italic> (temperature sensitive) mutant cells were first arrested in G2/M by treatment with the spindle poison nocodazole at 25°C. 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> was induced by galactose transiently (for 45 min) and further expression subsequently repressed (by replacing galactose by glucose) for the remaining course of the experiment. The level of CMs produced in the G2/M <italic>SCC2</italic> and <italic>scc2-45</italic> cells was very similar as was the level of naked supercoiled DNAs associated with 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> (but not covalently entrapped) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and, as expected, no CDs were produced. Both cultures were then allowed to complete mitosis, by removing the nocodazole, and subsequently blocked in G1 by incubation in the presence of the mating pheromone α-factor. Because it is not cleaved by separase, the 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> cohesin loaded onto the mini-chromosomes during G2/M remained associated with them during this transition, an appreciable fraction of it as CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, calibrated ChIP sequencing showed that although there were variations in cohesin occupancy along the chromosomes, presumably due to cohesin re-localization, the median level of association along the entire genome of this pool of cohesin did not alter while cells remained blocked for an extended period in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Because Wapl-mediated release is abrogated in these cells and because there is no further synthesis from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter, the constant level of chromosomal 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> cohesin during the arrest implies that the G1 cells inherit little or no free nucleoplasmic 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> cohesin that could load onto DNA during this period.</p><p>To measure the fate of this 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> cohesin pool during DNA replication in the presence (<italic>SCC2</italic>) or absence (<italic>scc2-45</italic>) of Scc2 activity, both cultures were transferred to pheromone-free medium at 37°C, whereupon both sets of cells duplicated their genomes and produced CDs in similar amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the <italic>scc2-45</italic> cells, this was accompanied by a reduction in the fraction of DNAs that formed CMs, raising the possibility that the CMs associated with un-replicated DNAs were converted to CDs upon replication. Higher levels of CMs were observed in the <italic>SCC2</italic> wild-type cells, suggesting that some de novo loading may occur, either during S phase or during the subsequent G2. These data imply that cohesin associated with un-replicated DNAs is converted to cohesive structures (as measured by CD formation) in a fully Scc2-independent fashion. Because not all un-replicated mini-chromosome DNAs associated with 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> are present as CMs, we cannot exclude the possibility that some the CDs are produced by chromosomal cohesin rings that had not in fact previously entrapped DNAs. We conclude that cohesin associated with un-replicated mini-chromosome DNAs is converted into cohesive structures during S phase in the absence of Scc2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1 are essential to establish cohesion from cohesin associated with un-replicated chromosomes</title><p>We next addressed if any of the non-essential replisome proteins previously implicated in cohesion establishment, namely Mrc1, Chl1, Ctf4, Csm3/Tof1 and Ctf18, are required for cohesin conversion. Before doing so, we first measured whether loss of these proteins has any appreciable effect on CD formation in otherwise wild-type cells; that is, when cohesion can in principle be generated by de novo cohesin loading as well as conversion.

These data suggest that Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1 (but not Ctf18-RFC) are essential for converting cohesin associated with un-replicated mini-chromosomes into cohesive structures as measured by CDs. Equally surprising, these replisome proteins are also necessary for preventing cohesin’s dissociation from chromosomes during the passage from G1 to G2. It is remarkable that their division into a group (containing Chl1, Ctf4, and Csm3/Tof1) required for conversion and one (containing Mrc1 and Ctf18-RFC) that is not, corresponds precisely with the two epistasis groups defined by the effects of double mutations on cohesion and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Our data suggest that Chl1, Ctf4, Csm3/Tof1 form a single epistasis group because they are all concerned with a very specific physiological function, namely conversion of pre-existing chromosomal cohesin into cohesive structures. An important corollary of our finding that Chl1, Ctf4, Csm3/Tof1 are essential for conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but not for building cohesion per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or for cell proliferation, is that conversion is not the sole mechanism by which cohesion is established during S phase. As implied by the synthetic lethality caused by combining mutants from different epistasis groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>) and as will become more apparent below, a second mechanism involving Mrc1 and Ctf18-RFC is capable of generating cohesion in the complete absence of conversion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA is evicted from mini-chromosomes during S phase in the absence of the conversion pathway</title><p>Although no CDs are formed and few CMs retained when <italic>chl1Δ</italic>, <italic>ctf4Δ</italic>, <italic>csm3Δ</italic>, and <italic>tof1Δ</italic> mutants undergo S phase, a low but significant level of CMs can nevertheless be detected in the mutant cells once they reach G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These could either represent rare chromosomal cohesin complexes that survive replication in the absence of conversion proteins or complexes that reload onto chromosomes following their eviction during DNA replication.

However, this did not prevent us from performing experiments with the double mutant strain.

To address this, <italic>chl1Δ</italic> and <italic>chl1Δ scc2-45</italic> cells were synchronised in G1 at 25°C and then allowed to undergo replication at 37°C in the presence of galactose to ensure continuous synthesis of 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> from the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter throughout S phase. As expected, <italic>chl1Δ</italic> cells produced both CMs and CDs. In contrast, neither CDs nor CMs nor any other form of interaction between 2CScc1<sup>NC</sup> cohesin and DNA was observed in <italic>chl1Δ scc2-45</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, this absence was not due to reduced Scc1 accumulation or due to disappearance of the mini-chromosome DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We conclude that the de novo pathway requires Scc2, which is not particularly surprising as it has long been known that Scc2 is required for endogenous nucleoplasmic cohesin to load onto chromosomes when G1 cells undergo S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The de novo pathway requires RFC-Ctf18</title><p>Though <italic>ctf18Δ</italic> and <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> mutant cells form CDs by converting cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA with an efficiency comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), both mutations cause significant cohesion defects when measured using a cytological assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borges et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).

Crucially, it cannot load cohesin onto nascent DNAs in a manner that entraps them inside the same cohesin ring. We conclude that establishment of cohesion by the de novo pathway depends not only on Scc2 but also on the Ctf18-RFC complex. A corollary is that there are only two pathways capable of creating CDs during S phase and inactivation of both causes a loss of cohesion so complete that it causes lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Over-expression of <italic>CHL1</italic> suppresses cohesion defects caused by the de novo pathway <italic>ctf8Δ</italic> mutation</title><p>Although not lethal in mitotic cells, <italic>ctf8Δ</italic> causes spore inviability due to massive chromosome non-disjunction during the second meiotic division, as do mutations of conversion pathway proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petronczki et al., 2004</xref>).

The difference in fitness is measured by competing cells lacking Ctf4 with a reference, wild-type, strain and measuring their relative abundance over several generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumasoni and Murray, 2020</xref>). It was recently reported that the reduced fitness of <italic>ctf4</italic>Δ relative to the wildtype cells is partially suppressed by duplication of two different portions of the genome that contain the <italic>SCC2</italic> and <italic>SCC4</italic> genes. Indeed, an extra copy merely of <italic>SCC2</italic> partially ameliorates their cohesion defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fumasoni and Murray, 2020</xref>). This finding implies not only that the cohesion defect contributes to the reduced fitness but also that increased Scc2/4 activity enhances establishment of cohesion by a Ctf4-independent pathway, presumably the de novo loading pathway dependent on Ctf18-RFC. Unlike the conversion pathway, which can use cohesin molecules previously loaded onto chromosomes, cohesion created by the de novo pathway may have only a very narrow time window within which cohesin must be loaded. If loaded significantly before replication, then the cohesin is presumably converted but if loaded too late after replication, it may be unable to generate cohesion. For example, cohesin loaded during G2 produces CMs but not CDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). If de novo loading cohesion establishment takes place at replication forks and involves the creation of cohesive structures between double-stranded leading strands and single-stranded lagging strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>), then the window of opportunity may be very short indeed. Because conversion does not require Scc2 (except to load cohesin in the first place at any stage preceding replication) while the de novo pathway does and has a narrow window of opportunity, the latter may be particularly sensitive to the levels of Scc2/4 at replication forks. According to this logic, the modest overexpression of Scc2 that appears to enhance cohesion establishment by Ctf18-RFC (in <italic>ctf4</italic>Δ cells) should have less or even no effect on cohesion established by the conversion pathway (in <italic>ctf18</italic>Δ cells). If on the other hand, there were no major mechanistic difference between cohesion created by Ctf4 and Ctf18, then <italic>SCC2</italic> duplication might suppress the cohesion defects of <italic>ctf4</italic>Δ cells merely because it increases the amount of cohesin on chromosomes. In which case, <italic>SCC2</italic> duplication should ameliorate the reduced fitness of <italic>ctf18</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as <italic>ctf4</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) mutants.</p><p>To test this, we competed strains carrying deletion of either <italic>CTF4</italic> or <italic>CTF18</italic> with respective <italic>ctf4</italic>Δ and <italic>ctf18</italic>Δ strains that carry an additional copy of <italic>SCC2</italic> expressed under its native promoter and integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus.

It is self-evident that if sister DNAs were to disjoin fully, as eventually happens in cohesin mutants, then it would be difficult if not impossible to ensure that sister DNAs were joined together in register. Even if sequence-specific pairing were possible, how would cells distinguish sisters from homologous non-sister DNAs? At first sight, it might therefore appear obvious that cohesion must be established as early as possible after sisters are created. However, due largely to rotation of the replisome during fork progression, nascent sister DNAs become entwined around each other as well as being held together by cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farcas et al., 2011</xref>). Much of this entanglement is rapidly removed by Topoisomerase II but some persists, albeit in a manner partially dependent on cohesin, until mitosis. Because of this DNA-DNA catenation, sister DNAs could in principle remain close enough to each other even during G2 for cohesin to recognize them as such and thereby generate cohesion long after the passage of replication forks. In fact, this does not occur because expression of Scc1 exclusively after S phase cannot generate sister chromatid cohesion, at least in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>). There are two explanations for this finding. Either sister DNAs are insufficiently close together under these conditions or the cohesion establishment mechanism simply cannot function once cells enter G2, possibly because the process requires replisome proteins or DNA features specific to nascent DNA, like one sister needing to be single stranded. This raises the question whether cohesin can build new cohesive structures during G2 even when sisters are already held together by cohesin. The fact that this also does not take place even though cohesin can be loaded onto chromosomes during this stage of the cell cycle implies that cohesion establishment activity is confined to S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>If confined to S phase, does cohesion establishment involve proteins associated with replisomes? The problem with addressing such a question is that most replisome proteins are essential for DNA replication, without which no cohesion is possible. As it happens, the collection of known replisome proteins includes numerous members that are not in fact necessary either for replication or even for proliferation. Amongst these are a subset whose abrogation causes significant defects in sister chromatid cohesion, albeit more modest than that caused by cohesin’s inactivation. Examples include Mrc1, Chl1, the Tof1/Csm3 complex, and Ctf4, which are associated with replication forks, and a variant RFC in which Rfc1 is replaced by Ctf18 bound by Ctf8 and Dcc1 (Ctf18-RFC). An extensive analysis of double mutants led to the suggestion that their genes fall into two epistasis groups, one containing <italic>TOF1</italic>/<italic>CSM3</italic>, <italic>CHL1</italic>, and <italic>CTF4</italic> while the other <italic>MRC1</italic> and <italic>CTF18</italic>.</p><p>The involvement of replisome-associated proteins implied that cohesion is indeed established at replication forks. Moreover, the existence of two different epistasis groups explained why none of these proteins are essential. If the two groups were involved in different mechanisms, each capable of establishing sufficient cohesion for cell proliferation, then lethality would only arise if both mechanisms were abrogated. However, hitherto there has been no rationale for why two mechanisms exist or what physiological differences distinguish them. In this paper, we describe a fresh approach to this conundrum. We started with a very different type of question, namely whether or not cohesion is established from cohesin previously associated with un-replicated DNAs, in a process that converts the latter directly into cohesive structures without dissociating from DNA.</p><p>Having developed a method to follow the fate of chromosomal cohesin, we show that it is indeed converted into cohesive structures during S phase, that this process does not require Scc2 (except to load cohesin in the first place), but that it is strictly dependent on Tof1, Csm3, Chl1, and Ctf4 (the TCCC pathway) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) but independent of Mrc1 or Ctf18-RFC. These observations suggest that cohesin associated with un-replicated DNA is converted into cohesion through the agency of a very specific subset of proteins associated with the replisome. Further experiments will be required to establish whether this set includes other replication proteins previously implicated in cohesion such as Rmi1, Sgs1 and Top3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). It is not unlikely that essential replisome proteins are also directly involved but addressing this question will require the generation of specific alleles that are defective in cohesion but not replication itself.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Two parallel pathways for cohesion establishment at the replication fork: chromosome associated cohesin is converted into cohesive structures during S phase.</title><p>This process does not require Scc2 (except to load cohesin in the first place), but is strictly dependent on Tof1, Csm3, Chl1, and Ctf4 (the TCCC pathway). A second pathway that operates in parallel is concerned exclusively with de novo loading of cohesin onto nascent DNAs, in a Ctf18-RFC and Scc2-dependent manner (de novo pathway). See Discussion for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56611-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>At present, the assay used to measure the conversion pathway requires the loading of non-cleavable cohesin not during the G1 immediately preceding replication but during the previous G2/M period. The reason for this admittedly baroque scheme is that Scc2 is normally required to maintain cohesin on chromosomes in G1 as well as to load it in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>), a feature that would preclude investigating its role during conversion. It was the chance discovery that chromosomal cohesin that had been loaded during G2/M does not require Scc2 to remain on chromosomes during the subsequent G1 period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>), that allowed us to circumvent this limitation and to develop a rigorous assay for conversion. It is however conceivable that ‘G2/M phase loaded’ cohesin behaves differently to normal cohesin when cells undergo replication and that our discovery that conversion depends on the TCCC pathway only applies to cohesin that has inherited some modification generated exclusively during G2. We suggest that this is unlikely because the TCCC pathway also contributes to the establishment of cohesion by cohesin synthesised during G1 and presumably does so by converting chromosomal cohesin into cohesive structures. Another potential limitation of our assay is that it merely assays the fate of cohesin associated with a small <italic>CEN</italic>-based mini-chromosome. However, our observation that the TCCC pathway is required not only to generate mini-chromsome CDs but also to maintain cohesin’s association with the entire genome when cells undergo S phase suggests that conversion acts genome wide.</p><p>Despite completely abrogating the conversion pathway, TCCC mutations are not lethal, have little adverse effect on mini-chromosome CD formation, and cause only modest, albeit highly significant, cohesion defects on real chromosomes. Not all cohesion is therefore generated by conversion. There must be some other process by which cohesion is established. Our results together with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref> demonstrate that cohesion established in TCCC mutant cells depends on Ctf18-RFC. This form of cohesion is established from cohesin expressed during G1 or S phase. Cohesin loaded in G1 could have two fates: it could be a substrate for the TCCC pathway or be removed by Wapl-mediated releasing activity, neither of which are consistent with processing by the Ctf18 pathway. We therefore suggest that the latter is concerned exclusively with de novo loading of cohesin onto nascent DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), in which case there will be only a very narrow window of opportunity, a scenario consistent with the unexpected discovery that modest over-expression of Scc2/4 augments the Ctf18-RFC but not the TCCC pathway.</p><p>Our findings shed little insight into the molecular mechanisms of the two different pathways. In the case of conversion, CDs could in principle be created merely by passage of the replication fork through CMs that pre-exist ahead of the fork. Whether there is sufficient room for such passage is unclear. If not, then CDs must be created from CMs or from other forms of chromosomal cohesin rings that transiently open up to permit co-entrapment of sister DNAs. In the case of the de novo pathway, co-entrapment might involve entrapment of single stranded DNA associated with lagging strands by rings previously associated with double stranded leading strand DNA, a scenario consistent with the finding that Ctf18-RFC associates with the leading strand Pol ε polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grabarczyk et al., 2018</xref>). An Scc2-dependent reaction of this nature has recently been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>). Because Eco1 is essential for Smc3 acetylation and thereby for maintaining all cohesion and because Ctf18-RFC or TCCC mutations merely reduce Smc3 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borges et al., 2013</xref>), cohesion established by both pathways must be accompanied by Smc3 acetylation or in the case of vertebrate cells by Sororin binding. The nature of this linkage remains mysterious.</p><p>Because Ctf18-RFC and TCCC mutants have similarly severe cohesion defects both in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2007</xref>) and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petronczki et al., 2004</xref>), it appears that the de novo and conversion pathways make rather equal contributions to the establishment of cohesion. If true, this is either a remarkable coincidence or is instead a feature determined by properties intrinsic to the mechanism of DNA replication. Because Ctf18-RFC interacts with Pol ε while Ctf4 with Polα primase, it is tempting to speculate that the two reactions involve different intermediates. For example, during conversion cohesin might first be transferred to the lagging strand and only subsequently entrap the leading strand while during the de novo process cohesin might first load onto leading strand and only subsequently entrap the lagging strand, or vice versa. The equal contributions might therefore arise because there are equal opportunities to create the two different intermediates and they do not normally compete with each other. Ctf18-RFC and TCCC mutations also cause cohesion defects in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that both conversion and de novo pathways are conserved features of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.</p><p>There are obvious parallels between the TCCC conversion pathway described here and the process by which histones associated with un-replicated DNAs are transferred to nascent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Both types of process involve replisome components, some of which are shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is a fundamental difference, H3/H4 tetramers are transferred either to the leading or to the lagging strand whereas the cohesin conversion pathway connects leading and lagging strands. Whether cohesin is initially transferred asymmetrically to one strand before entrapping the second, as speculated above, remains to be established.</p><p>The fact that Ctf18-RFC and TCCC components are associated with replisomes does not exclude the possibility that either one or other pathway could in principle also act after replication has been completed. The fact that cohesin loaded during G2/M cannot form cohesion implies that this normally does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>). However, it has been reported that cohesion can be established genome wide in cells that have sustained DNA damage arising from a single unrepaired double strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ström and Sjögren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Unal et al., 2007</xref>). It will be interesting to know whether this G2 cohesion pathway involves Ctf18-RFC, TCCC, or both. If in fact neither are required, then there must exist a third pathway involving yet another mechanism to generate cohesion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

For measuring the relative fitness, 10 ml of YPD were inoculated in individual glass tubes with either the frozen reference or test strains.

Similarly, this process was done with the order of genomes reversed to produce alignments of reads that uniquely align to <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Visualisation of ChIP-seq profiles</title><p>The resulting BigWigs were visualized using the IGB browser. To normalize the data to show quantitative ChIP signal the track was multiplied by the samples’ occupancy ratio (OR) and normalized to 1 million reads using the graph multiply function. In order to calculate the average occupancy at each base pair up to 60 kb around all 16 centromeres, the BAM file that contains reads uniquely aligning to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was separated into files for each chromosome using ‘Filter SAM or BAM’ (Galaxy tool version 1.1.0). A pileup of each chromosome was then obtained using samtools mpileup (Galaxy tool version 0.0.1) (source for reference list: locally cached, reference genome: SacCer3, genotype likelihood computation: false, advanced options: basic). These files were then amended using our own script (chr_position.py) to assign all unrepresented genome positions a value of 0. Each pileup was then filtered using another in-house script (filter.py) to obtain the number of reads at each base pair within up to 60 kb intervals either side of the centromeric CDEIII elements of each chromosome. The number of reads covering each site as one successively moves away from these CDEIII elements could then be averaged across all 16 chromosomes and calibrated by multiplying by the samples’ OR and normalizing to 1 million reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data and software availability</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Scripts</title><p>All scripts written for this analysis method are available to download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/naomipetela/nasmythlab-ngs">https://github.com/naomipetela/nasmythlab-ngs</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petela, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/nasmythlab-ngs">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/nasmythlab-ngs</ext-link>).</p><p><italic>Chr_position.py</italic> takes mpileups for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosomes and fills in gaps, with each position in the chromosome added given a read depth of 0.</p><p><italic>Filter60.py</italic> reads the files produced by Chr_position.py and takes the read depth for all positions 60 kb either side of the CDEIII for all chromosomes, produces an average for each position and multiples it by the OR.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Paul Javerzat (Reviewer #2); Ana Losada (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In recognition of the fact that revisions may take longer than the two months we typically allow, until the research enterprise restarts in full, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>This is a foundational study for our understanding of how sister chromatid cohesion is established during DNA replication. The data lead to a model that two pathways coexist in yeast cells: one that requires de novo loading of cohesin by Scc2 in the wake of the replication fork and a second, Scc2-independent, pathway that converts cohesin complexes loaded onto unreplicated DNA ahead of the fork into cohesive structures behind it. This work addresses a long-standing question that has been very difficult to address and a clear strength of this work is the use of many elegant genetic tricks.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sister chromatid cohesion is thought to be generated at the replisome during S-phase. Meanwhile, cohesin binding to chromosomes is dependent on the Scc2/Scc4 loading complex, which is active before, during, and after DNA replication. This manuscript addresses the longstanding and important question of whether cohesion is built from G1-loaded cohesin, requires de novo loaded cohesin at the replisome, or both. A previous study suggested two independent and partially redundant pathways for generating cohesion. Here the authors show convincing evidence that both pathways generate sister-chromatid cohesion: the TCCC pathway converts G1-loaded cohesin into cohesive cohesin, while Ctf18-RFC is required for Scc2-dependent cohesion establishment reaction within the replisome. To do this, the authors use an assay to monitor cohesion establishment in minichromosomes and an elegant experimental design that allows them to load tagged cohesin complexes in G2 that remain on chromatin until the next round of DNA replication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All experiments were performed in cells in which Wapl-dependent release has been abrogated. A previous study showed that inactivating Wapl results in the permanent activation of the DNA Damage Induced (DI) cohesion pathway (Mol Cell. 2009 May 15;34(3):311-21). This raises the possibility that the phenomena described here include some aspect of the DI-pathway, i.e., the authors actually observed a mixture of S-phase and DI pathways for generating cohesive cohesin. The authors should discuss this point. Related to this, in some experiments it would be important to remind readers that what is being monitored is the behavior of the separase-insensitive, Wapl-insensitive cohesin loaded in previous G2. For instance: &quot;half or more chromosomal cohesin disappeared from all parts of genome when <italic>chl1Δ</italic> cells underwent S phase (Figure 4B)&quot;. One possibility is to use a superscript to refer to this cohesin, same as a different color (red) is used for it in the figures. Did the authors check by ChIP whether the presence of &quot;regular&quot; cohesin (loaded in G1) is affected after passage of the replication fork in <italic>chl1Δ</italic> mutants?</p><p>2) The experiments presented in Figure 6 address the importance of the two described pathways in cohesion. That these two pathways existed was proposed before, and cohesion had been tested in mutants for the different components of both pathways as well as combinations. What is new and striking is that one of the pathways does not depend on Scc2. In a previous publication by Fumasoni and Murray, these authors show the effect of adding extra copies of Scc2 to <italic>ctf4Δ</italic> mutants in cohesion and fitness. Part of the experiment (fitness) is repeated here, presumably testing in parallel the fitness of <italic>ctf4Δ</italic> and <italic>ctf18Δ</italic> mutants. It is expected that extra copies of Scc2 improve cohesion in <italic>ctf4Δ</italic> but not in <italic>ctf18Δ</italic>. Why was cohesion not tested in this experiment as well?</p><p>3) The relative fitness experiments are methodologically sound. However, this approach is still uncommon in the field (despite its advantages over comparative methods). Therefore, the concept of fitness and how the experiment is done should be briefly described in main text.</p><p>The authors should also provide the raw data for these experiments either in a supplement or on Mendeley. This will help other to follow this approach as well as check the calculations.</p><p>4) The turn-over of G2-loaded, NC-6C cohesin. Figure 2 uses 6C non cleavable cohesin loaded during the previous cell cycle (2C SMC1 2C SMC3 and GALp-2C SCC1NC induced in G2/M) to show that Scc2 is not required for CDs generation in the next S-phase. The authors used calibrated ChIP sequencing to check that cohesin remained bound during the G1 arrest (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The data are shown as a ratio (T=0 / T=60min). Therefore, we expect to see a ratio of 100% if no changes occurred. However, this is not what is observed on the graph. The median is around 100%, consistent with cohesin remaining bound, but there are great variations along the chromosome, suggesting cohesin sliding or, unloading and reloading cycles. Although it does not invalidate the main conclusion that Scc2 is dispensable for CDs generation, it casts doubt about the absence of 6C cohesin turnover. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>Also, in previous publications, the authors have supplemented this ratio with the actual ChIP enrichment of each condition across the chromosome (Srinivasan et al., 2019), please provide this in the current manuscript.</p><p>5) The importance of DNA replication for the observed effects. The authors propose that cohesion can be established by de novo cohesin loading at the replisome, but as presented, the data do not provide direct evidence that DNA replication is required. A cohesin / BrdU ChIP-seq (or several loci analysed by q-PCR) in the experiment scheme shown Figure 5C may provide evidence that cohesin binding to replicated domain is Ctf8-dependent. Similarly, based on the data shown in Figure 4, it is suggested that cohesin might be released by the replisome when the conversion pathway is not functional. The experiment shows that cohesin is not DNA-bound after S-phase but does not provide evidence that release is due to replication. A Cdc6-degron experiment might tell whether DNA replication per se is required. To argue that cohesin release takes place at the replisome, a cohesin / BrdU ChIP-seq (or several loci analysed by q-PCR) from S-phase cells may provide evidence that cohesin is still bound to unreplicated DNA but reduced/absent from replicated domains. While such experiments might be out of the scope of the current manuscript, the authors should ensure that their conclusions take this point into consideration throughout the manuscript and they should also consider changing the title.</p><p>6) In Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, the authors use a Southern blot for TRP1 sequence to show that the plasmid is present in equal amounts in each of the genetic conditions. They only show a set of four bands cropped in each case. Each of these lanes should have at least two types of DNA species. There should be signal from the endogenous trp1-1 locus and signal from the plasmid. Please show the full lane with markers to differentiate between the different DNAs recognized by the probe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56611.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All experiments were performed in cells in which Wapl-dependent release has been abrogated.

However, we would like to point out that there is no evidence that loss of Wapl actually activates a DI cohesion pathway. It is more likely that the DI pathway inactivates Wapl-mediated release which would otherwise remove cohesin that had formed cohesion during G2. Crucially, we show that inactivation of Wapl-mediated release does not in fact permit cohesion establishment as measured by CD formation. In other words, we do not detect significant CD formation when 6C cohesin is expressed in G2 arrested cells defective in Wapl-mediated release. The whole issue may therefore be irrelevant to our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, in some experiments it would be important to remind readers that what is being monitored is the behavior of the separase-insensitive, Wapl-insensitive cohesin loaded in previous G2.

It will be impossible to distinguish cohesin that is loaded onto individual DNAs (that happens throughout the cell cycle, including S phase) from cohesive cohesin that holds sister DNAs. The prediction will be that in a cohesin / BrdU ChIP-seq experiment one should detect cohesin on nascent DNA irrespective of the presence of active de novo pathway due to Scc2 dependent loading onto individual nascent DNAs. We have however considered permanently modifying chromosome associated cohesin (biotinlylation) and following the fate of the modified cohesin upon DNA replication in order to study the conversion pathway (PNAS October 8, 2019 116 (41) 20605-20611).
