order brain structures. Increasing evidence implicates the gut microbiota as a key regulator of brain and behavior, yet it remains to be determined if gut bacteria play a role in visceral sensitivity. We used germ-free mice (GF) to assess visceral sensitivity, spinal cord gene expression and pain-related brain structures. GF mice displayed visceral hypersensitivity accompanied by increases in Toll-like receptor and cytokine gene expression in the spinal cord, which were normalized by postnatal colonization with microbiota from conventionally colonized (CC). In GF mice, the volumes of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and periaqueductal grey, areas involved in pain processing, were decreased and enlarged, respectively, and dendritic changes in the ACC were evident. These findings indicate that the gut microbiota is required for the normal visceral pain sensation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25887.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25887.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25887.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human gut is home to over 100 trillion microbes collectively known as the gut microbiota. These microbes help us to digest food and absorb the nutrients effectively. A diverse and stable community of gut microbes is believed to be important for good health. Recently, it has also become clear that the microbiota can also influence the brain and how we behave. For example, many studies suggest that gut microbiota can alter how an individual perceives pain, but it is not clear how this works.</p><p>Rodents are often used in experiments as models of human biology. One of the most frequently used rodent models in studies of gut microbes is the “germ-free” mouse. These mice grow up in laboratory environments that are completely free of microbes, making it possible to study how having no gut microbes affects the health and behaviour of the mice. Luczynski, Tramullas et al. used germ-free mice to study how the gut microbiota influences an animal’s sensitivity to pain.</p><p>The experiments show that, compared to mice with normal gut microbiota, the germ-free mice were more sensitive to pain from internal organs especially the gut. These mice also produced larger amounts of specific proteins involved in immune responses, which contributed to the animal’s increased sensitivity to pain. Allowing the germ-free mice to be colonised with gut microbes could reverse these changes.</p><p>The experiments also show that the germ-free mice had changes in the size of two areas of the brain involved in sensing pain: an area called the anterior cingulate cortex was smaller, while the periaqueductal grey region was enlarged. There were also differences in individual nerve cells within the anterior cingulate cortex compared to normal mice.</p><p>The findings of Luczynski, Tramullas et al. reinforce the idea that the gut microbiota is involved in the sensation of pain from internal organs, and show that hypersensitivity to this form of pain can be reversed later in life by colonising the gut with microbes. Continuing to study the impact of microbes on this type of pain could aid the development of new therapies for the treatment of pain disorders in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25887.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25887.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>microbiota-gut-brain axis</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>periaqueductal gray</kwd><kwd>toll-like receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFI/12/RC/2273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shanahan</surname><given-names>Fergus</given-names></name><name><surname>Dinan</surname><given-names>Timothy G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EU GRANT 613979 (MYNEWGUT FP7-KBBE-2013-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinan</surname><given-names>Timothy G</given-names></name><name><surname>Cryan</surname><given-names>John F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Determining that microbiota-deficient mice have increased visceral pain, which can be reversed by restoring microbiota, may lead to novel microbial-based strategies for disorders associated with visceral pain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) in a bidirectional manner thereby influencing brain function and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sampson and Mazmanian, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinan and Cryan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer, 2011</xref>). Although the majority of studies investigating the effects of the microbiota on brain function involve animal models of anxiety, depression, and cognitive dysfunction, it is now becoming clear that the gut microbiota may also have a role in other CNS-related conditions, such as visceral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Mahony et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gareau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKernan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Abdominal pain, often characterized by visceral hypersensitivity, is a common, and at times, dominant symptom of several gastrointestinal disorders, including functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enck et al., 2016</xref>). There is also a high comorbidity among visceral pain and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Felice et al., 2015</xref>). These painful events are often recurring and unpredictable, which can have a debilitating impact on a person’s daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quigley, 2006</xref>). Moreover, many gastrointestinal disorders with visceral pain as a component lack an identifiable pathology and can be difficult to treat with current pharmaceuticals, many of which are associated with undesirable side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wood, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moloney et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The perception of visceral pain is a complex process involving peripheral sensory nerves, and, in the CNS, spinal and cortical pathways as well as areas associated with integration of the experience of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apkarian et al., 2005</xref>). Pathological pain states have been associated with altered neuroimmune signaling and glial activation in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grace et al., 2014</xref>). In the brain, there is a significant overlap in areas regulating the affective component of visceral pain and those mediating psychological stress, a major predisposing factor for visceral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larauche et al., 2012</xref>). Imaging studies in humans with IBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tillisch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mertz et al., 2000</xref>) and in animal models of visceral hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>) have revealed increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in response to both viscerally painful and stressful stimuli.</p><p>Numerous studies now indicate that the perception of visceral pain can by influenced by the intestinal microbiota. In rodent studies, specific bacterial strains (probiotics) have been shown to ameliorate visceral pain induced by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gareau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKernan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2006</xref>) or antibiotic administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verdú et al., 2006</xref>), and many probiotics have been shown to benefit humans with abdominal pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, visceral hypersensitivity can be transferred via the microbiota of IBS patients to animals previously lacking microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crouzet et al., 2013</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of the microbiota on visceral pain perception remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Integrating these observations, this study is based on the hypothesis that the microbiota is required for the normal processing of visceral pain stimuli. To this end, we used germ-free mice (GF; mice raised without any exposure to microorganisms) to study pain-related behavior, genes, and brain structures. We first studied visceral sensitivity, expression of cytokines, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and glial markers in the spinal cord, and mPFC morphology in these animals. Secondly, we determined if postnatal microbial colonization could normalize visceral hypersensitivity and immune status within the spinal cord of GF mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Four cohorts of animals were used to perform the experiments in this paper.

In addition, we found that these animals had increased ACC and decreased PAG volumes as well as dendritic hypertrophy of single pyramidal neurons in the ACC.

We have previously shown that exposure to stressors or antibiotic treatment in early life can have enduring effects on visceral pain in rodents, and these effects are accompanied by a change in microbial composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Mahony et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2009</xref>). Moreover, in rodents, probiotics can ameliorate visceral pain induced by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gareau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKernan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2006</xref>) or antibiotic administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verdú et al., 2006</xref>), and even exert an inhibitory influence on visceral sensitivity in healthy rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamiya et al., 2006</xref>). Clinical studies have repeatedly found that the composition of the gut microbiota is altered in patients with IBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeffery et al., 2012</xref>) and that patients suffering from abdominal pain can benefit from probiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2012</xref>). Although these studies report an association between altered microbial composition and visceral pain processing, the impact of the microbiota cannot be separated from other factors, such as stress or antibiotic side effects. In this set of experiments, we use GF as a tool to show that visceral sensitivity is heightened in mice in the absence of any microbiota.</p><p>Although it is now clear that the gut microbiota plays a role in visceral nociception, the exact mechanism by which the microbiota exerts its influence on the CNS remains unknown. It is likely that many systems simultaneously contribute to the altered nociception in GF mice, including immune, neural, endocrine, and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sampson and Mazmanian, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinan and Cryan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luczynski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>).

Enteric sensory neurons synapse with vagal nerve endings in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perez-Burgos et al., 2014</xref>), providing a direct route whereby the intestinal bacterial status can be communicated to the brain. Growing up germ-free heightens hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity, which is thought to occur via a neuronal mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sudo et al., 2004</xref>). GF rodents also have a reduced production of short chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">den Besten et al., 2013</xref>), which are metabolites produced by gut bacteria thought to be key mediators of gut-brain signaling. Moving forward, it would be interesting to determine if is it the cell surface proteins on intact bacteria or their metabolites and other products that are involved in changes along the brain-gut axis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spinal cord signaling of visceral pain</title><p>Within the gastrointestinal tract, nociceptors respond to many stimuli including stretch, pH, bacterial products, immune signaling molecules, and neurotransmitters released from the ENS or from the bacteria themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sengupta, 2009</xref>). From the gut, nociceptive signals are transmitted to the spinal cord, and subsequently the brain. Recent evidence has implicated neuroimmune and spinal microglial mechanisms in chronic visceral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grace et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradesi, 2010</xref>). TLR receptor signaling is also involved in visceral nociception and IBS pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tramullas et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tramullas et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, microglial structure and homeostasis are disrupted in both GF and antibiotic-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erny et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the microbiota is required for normal microglial function in the CNS. Microglia can be activated through TLR signaling, and once activated, increase the secretion of various cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradesi, 2010</xref>). In the present study, we report that glial activation, TLR expression, and cytokine signaling are all increased in the lumbosacral spinal cord of GF mice, an area associated with signals from the colon. Indeed, microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saab et al., 2006</xref>), reduced glutamate-reuptake by astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gosselin et al., 2010</xref>), and increased TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tramullas et al., 2014</xref>) in the spinal cord have been previously shown in rodent models with visceral hypersensitivity.</p><p>TRPV1 receptors are broadly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and many areas of the CNS, including the spinal cord and is well-recognized as a transducer of noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagy et al., 2004</xref>). We found no changes in the mRNA expression of the TRPV1 receptor in the GF spinal cord. This result is in line with previous data from our group showing that the colon of GF mice exhibits the same responsiveness to capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) relative to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lomasney et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting no change in the expression of the TRPV1 receptor. In contrast, rats exposed to vancomycin in early in life resulting in an altered gut microbiome, show enhanced visceral pain perception and a decrease in spinal cord TRPV1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Mahony et al., 2014</xref>). In the gut, TRPV1 receptors play a key role in pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holzer, 2011</xref>); however, TRPV1 signaling does not appear to be responsible for the visceral hypersensitivity observed in GF mice. Further studies are required to confirm changes in the expression of TRPV1 receptor in other areas of the CNS involved in visceral pain perception. With regard to what influences the changes in cytokines and TLRs in the spinal cord of GF mice we can speculate that lack of certain metabolites and or short chain fatty acids which reduce visceral pain or exaggerated sensation in a conventional mouse are not present to gate the pain signals which can lead to altered signaling in the spinal cord. Moreover, GF are known to have an altered immune system and hence changes in spinal cord immune players fits well with the literature.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Prefrontal cortical structural changes and visceral pain</title><p>The affective or emotional component of pain is mediated by the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apkarian et al., 2005</xref>). Studies in humans with IBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tillisch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mertz et al., 2000</xref>) and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Felice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss et al., 2016</xref>) have revealed increased activation in the mPFC in response to visceral pain. In addition, imaging studies have consistently observed reduced cortical grey matter in patients with IBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2008</xref>). Although cortical structure has yet to be investigated in animal models of visceral pain, rodents with long-lasting neuropathic pain show a reduction of ACC volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seminowicz et al., 2009</xref>) and basilar dendritic hypertrophy of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Metz et al., 2009</xref>). We report a remarkably similar reduction in ACC volume in GF mice as well as elongation of single ACC pyramidal neurons. Importantly, GF mice showed no difference in mushroom spines, which represent mature, long-lasting postsynaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>). Instead, the density of ‘immature’ thin and stubby spines was higher in these animals. These results can be interpreted as a microbiota-induced deficit in synaptic pruning resulting in the hyperactivity of ACC neurons. Such changes in ACC signaling would likely impact visceral sensitivity, as this area receives and sends projections to many pain-relevant brain areas including the limbic system, ventral tegmental area and the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The neurons in the PAG, once activated are involved in an endogenous pain inhibitory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apkarian et al., 2011</xref>). It is currently unclear what the relative contribution of the altered PAG volume is to the visceral hypersensitivity behavior observed in GF mice. The PAG receives signals from cortical areas such as the ACC where this connection is thought to mediate expectation and placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petrovic et al., 2002</xref>). Hence, input changes from the ACC may have a reciprocal effect on the PAG. What is evident, however, is that both cortical and subcortical pain pathways are altered in GF mice. Taken together, our results suggest that gross morphological and ultrastructural changes in the ACC and PAG could underlie the visceral hypersensitivity observed in GF mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that the gut microbiota dramatically impacts visceral sensitivity and affects signaling in key structures involved in the processing and integration of painful stimuli. These results further reinforce the idea that the microbial composition of mice in conventional facilities may affect the responsiveness to CRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verdú et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, this maladaptive pain responsivity is amenable to microbial-based interventions in later life. This is noteworthy as numerous postnatal colonization experiments have been performed in GF mice, with certain behavioral and physiological changes proving reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sudo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011</xref>) and others irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stilling et al., 2015</xref>). Hence the addition of colonization experiments with regard to morphological measures would be of interest in future studies. Moreover, we find across a number of different domains that the effects of the microbiome on brain and behavioural are much more robust in males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desbonnet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoban et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, future analysis of visceral sensitivity in female animals is indeed worthy of investigation. Improving our understanding of the impact of microbiota on visceral pain sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Mahony et al., 2017</xref>) may ultimately inform novel therapies for the treatment of gastrointestinal pain disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Swiss Webster breeding pairs for both GF and CC mice were supplied by Taconic (Germantown, New York, USA) and first-generation male offspring were studied in all experiments. In the University College Cork GF Unit, GF mice were group housed in flexible film gnotobiotic isolators maintained at 21 ± 1°C, with 55–60% relative humidity, under a 12 hr light/dark cycle. A group of GF mice were colonized (GFC) on postnatal day 21 with microbiota obtained from CC mice. Briefly, GF mice were removed from the GF facility and allowed to grow to adulthood in the conventional animal facility in cages with bedding and fecal matter from CC mice, a method which has previously been shown to effectively restore a normal microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Connell Motherway et al., 2011</xref>). CC and GFC mice were group housed in the standard animal facility which was held at the same controlled conditions and light/dark cycle as the GF mice. GF, CC, and GFC mice were age-matc and fed the same autoclaved pelleted diet (Special Diets Services, product code 801010) and were housed 2–5 per cage (only one group of CC mice was housed two per cage). Animals were tested or euthanized at 5–10 weeks of age. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of European Directive 86/609/EEC and the Recommendation 2007/526/65/EC and were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College Cork.</p><p>Four cohorts of animals were used to perform the experiments in this paper. Animals in the first cohort (CC = 10, GF = 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) underwent CRD and then were euthanized. No samples were collected from this cohort. Animals in the second cohort (CC and GF = 9–10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were sacrificed without anesthesia and spinal cord tissue was collected to perform gene expression analyses. These mice were not exposed to CRD. After data analysis, we decided that it would be of interest to determine if bacterial colonization could rescue the visceral hypersensitivity and associated changes noted in GF mice from the first and second cohorts. With the third cohort of mice (CC = 20, GF = 20, GFC = 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7)</xref>), we repeated the CRD and collected the spinal cord tissue. Due to the limited number of GFC mice available, most GFC animals used in the spinal cord analysis had been exposed to CRD. However, we verified that there was no statistical difference between those animals that underwent CRD and those that did not in the CC and GF groups. Animals in the fourth cohort (CC = 17, GF = 18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and 4 supplement 1) were euthanized without undergoing any procedures.

The CRD-system was composed of a barostat (Distender Series II, G and J Electronics, Toronto, ON, Canada) and a transducer amplifier (LabTrax 4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). A custom-made balloon (2 cm length x 1 cm inflated diameter) prepared from a polyurethane plastic bag (GMC Medical, Denmark) was tied over a PE60 catheter with silk 4.0. Before securing the balloon to the catheter, several holes were punched in the distal 20 mm of the tubing with a 27-gauge needle to allow the balloon to inflate.</p><p>On the experimental day, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2% vapor in oxygen; IsoFlo, Abbott, UK) and a lubricated balloon with a connecting catheter was inserted into the colon, 0.5 cm proximal to the anus. The catheter was fixed to the base of the tail with tape to avoid any displacement. Unrestrained mice were allowed to recover for 10 min before starting the CRD procedure. The balloon was connected to the barostat system and subsequent pressure changes within the distending balloon, observed in response to a distension paradigm, were monitored and recorded using Data Trax two software (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The ascending phasic distension (from 10 to 80 mmHg) paradigm, consisting of three 20 s pulses at each pressure and 5-min inter-pulse intervals, was used. The visceromotor responses (VMR) were quantified as pressure changes observed within the colonic distending balloon during the colorectal distension procedure. VMR were calculated as the average of the three consecutive pulses for each pressure. Additionally, for each animal, pain threshold was defined as the pressure which exceeded the mean baseline activity plus three times the standard deviation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-supplement 1A 4 for phasic stages).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jack Gilbert (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>This is a simple but important study that appears to show a heightened sensitivity to colorectal dissension in GF mice which is reversed when the mice are exposed to control mice feces as adults. There are a number of molecular accompaniments observed in spinal Toll receptors and IL expression and also anatomical correlates in the ACC of the PFC and in the PAG. This is an interesting result suggesting that the microbiome has protective effects on visceral somatosensory pathways.</p><p>There are a number of methodological but serious concerns. Simply expanding the Methods section would be helpful. <italic>eLife</italic> is an online journal and thus space is not an issue. Please do not refer to the reader to another article for methodological details. Give the reader everything they need to understand what was done in the manuscript.</p><p>Beyond methodological details, the number of animals and cohorts used was unclear to all reviewers. It would appear that the same animals used in the CC vs GF comparison as in the CC vs GF vs GF-exposed comparison. Using the same data in 2 figures gives the false impression of more experiments having been done than were done.</p><p>The reviewers' ultimate evaluation of this manuscript will depend on their assessment of the missing methodological details and thus this request for a revision is not a pro forma antecedent to ultimate acceptance of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to colorectal dissension in GF mice which is reversed when the mice are exposed to control mice feces as adults.

We repeated the CRD and collected the spinal cord tissue from the CC vs. GF vs. GFC cohort. Due to the limited number of GFC mice available, most GFC animals used in the spinal cord analysis had been exposed CRD. However, we verified that there was no statistical difference between those animals that underwent CRD and those that did not in the CC and GF groups. Please see the table below for a breakdown of the total animals in the 3<sup>rd</sup> cohort.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cohort 3</td><td valign="top">CC</td><td valign="top">GF</td><td valign="top">CGF</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">CRD</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">9</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">No CRD</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">12</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">SC Tissue (All animals)</td><td valign="top">20</td><td valign="top">20</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>4<sup>th</sup> cohort (CC = 17, GF= 18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>): All animals were euthanized without undergoing any procedures. Brain tissue from 10 animals from each group was processed for Golgi-Cox staining and the remainder of the brains were processed as per the stereology protocol.</p><p><italic>The CC group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> appear to be the same.

Although the CRD protocol is reliable, comparing data from GFC animals to the existing CC vs. GF data would have been methodologically unsound. To clarify this point, we now describe the cohorts of animals used in each experiment in the Materials and methods (subsection “Animals”, second paragraph) and the Results (subsection “Animals”).</p><p><italic>It is unclear why the authors jumped to the spinal cord and pfc. Isn't the simplest explanation for the finding that there is a difference in the colon itself? Why was the periphery not examined? The authors make clear that changes happen in the spinal cord and PFC but are these changes primary or secondary to changes in the periphery? Why study II/III ACC pyramidal neurons in particular?</italic> </p><p>Our group’s primary focus is the interplay between the gut and the brain. Therefore, when we discovered that GF mice had heightened visceral pain sensitivity, we hypothesized this could be due to altered processing of visceral pain stimuli at the level of the central nervous system (CNS). We chose to study gene/protein expression and morphology in three key regions in the pain processing pathway: the spinal cord, periaqueductal grey, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In particular, we studied layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the ACC because this neuronal population has been shown to undergo dendritic remodelling and changes in signalling in a rodent model of chronic neuropathic pain (Metz et al., 2009).</p><p>The reviewer raises the important point that the visceral hypersensitivity in GF mice could be a result of changes to the colon itself. Indeed, GF mice have abnormal gut function and structure as well as metabolic and digestive functions (see Luczynski et al., 2016 for a review on the GF mouse model). Moreover, enteric nervous system structure and signalling is also altered in these animals (Collins et al., 2014; McVey Neufeld et al., 2013). We chose not to focus on the periphery, as it has been extensively studied by experts in gastrointestinal research. Instead, we focused on pain-relevant brain areas which have not yet been studied in GF mice. The exact mechanism by which the microbiota is influencing TLR signalling, cytokine levels, and neuronal morphology at the level of the CNS remains to determined. However, multiple primary and secondary pathways have been proposed to exist through which the gut can modulate the brain. These include endocrine (cortisol), immune (cytokines), neural (vagus and enteric nervous system), and short chain fatty acids (Cryan &amp; Dinan, 2012). We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion addressing how the gut microbiota may be influencing and communicating with the CNS (subsection “The microbiota and visceral pain”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Why is the number of animals within Figures in one group not constant? For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the number varies by one. Did some animals not go through the whole protocol? This is surprising given that the protocol is straightforward and relatively short.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out – In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the varying sample size reported was an error and has now been corrected. All animals completed the protocol.</p><p>For the CRD and spinal cord analyses, the Grubbs test was used to test for outliers (see Materials and methods subsection “Statistical analysis”). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, outliers were removed for some genes studied, which explains the variation in sample size.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This report examines the role of the intestinal microbiota on visceral pain sensitivity. Using several different measures at multiple sites in the CNS, the development of visceral nociceptive processing in germfree mice is examined. The effects of transplanting normal mouse microbiota to the germfree mice on visceral pain, spinal cord TLR and cytokine expression are examined. Overall, it is an interesting and well written paper.

The literature supports greater visceral sensitivity in women and female animals, suggesting females are a better model system to study. Either include experiments demonstrating no sex differences or at a minimum, explain why only males were used. What is the advantage?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in the clinical setting there is a higher percentage of females reporting exaggerated visceral sensitivity. Also, some preclinical studies indicate that female rodents are more sensitive to visceral pain. These differences are often related to cyclical changes in sex hormones. This cannot explain differences that clearly also exist in the male populations with some men displaying heightened visceral pain compared to others. In these set of experiments, we aimed to assess other players, namely the gut microbiota, in determining visceral sensitivity per se. Moreover, we find across a number of different domains that the effects of the microbiome on brain and behavioural are much more robust in males than females (e.g. Clarke et al., Mol Psychiat 2013; Desbonnet et al., Brain Behav Immun 2015; Hoban et al. Trans Psychiat. 2016). We now state this clearly in the manuscript and also state that future analysis of visceral sensitivity in female animals is indeed worthy. We are quite interested in sex differences and visceral pain (e.g. Sajjad et al. Neuroscience 2016; Moloney et al., Biol Sex Differ. 2016) and have started to embark on studies investigating the interactions between sex hormones and microbiome in shaping behaviour.</p><p><italic>Second, include some methods to explain how the fecal transplant was done. There is no information about age, duration, amount, how much transplantation is enough, how long after transplantation experiments were done.</italic> </p><p>We did not carry out fecal transplantation per se but rather allowed the bacteria in the conventional animal room to colonise the GF mice. We have now expanded the Materials and methods to describe in detail how GF mice were colonized with bacteria:</p><p>“A group of GF mice were colonized (GFC) on postnatal day 21 with microbiota obtained from CC mice. Briefly, GF mice were removed from the GF facility and allowed to grow to adulthood in the conventional animal facility in cages with bedding and fecal matter from CC mice, a method which has previously been shown to effectively restore a normal microbiota (Clark et al., 2013; Desbonnet et al., 2014; O’Connell Motherway et al., 2011).”</p><p><italic>Third, how does the transplantation affect the morphological measures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. The morphological data are very interesting, but not knowing how the transplanted microbiota affect these measures, do they normalize cortical volume, makes interpretation difficult.</italic> </p><p>For the fourth cohort, we received only 18 GF mice from the GF Unit. We made the decision to perform both experiments of brain volume and dendritic morphology analyses instead of colonizing half of the GF animals and performing only one experiment. We agree that the colonization experiment would be interesting; however numerous postnatal colonization experiments have been performed in GF mice, with certain behavioral and physiological changes proving reversible (Clarke et al., 2013; Sudo et al., 2004; Heijtz et al., 2011; Hoban et al., 2016) and others irreversible (Desbonnet et al., 2014; Stilling et al., 2015; Hoban et al., 2016). With such limited availability of GF mice, we wanted to maximize the amount of pertinent information we could glean from the animals we had. We now state that the addition of colonization experiments would be of interest in future studies (subsection “Conclusions”).</p><p><italic>Fourth, perhaps there should be some discussion indicating other effects of lack of gut microbiota during development that might contribute to pain hypersensitivity.</italic> </p><p>We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion indicating how other effects of lack of gut microbiota could contribute to visceral hypersensitivity in GF mice:</p><p>“Although it is now clear that the gut microbiota plays a role in visceral nociception, the exact mechanism by which the microbiota exerts its influence on the CNS remains unknown. […] Moving forward, it would be interesting to determine if is it the cell surface proteins on intact bacteria or their metabolites and other products that are involved in changes along the brain-gut axis.”</p><p><italic>Finally, the end of the subsection “Spinal cord signaling of visceral pain” suggests no change in TRPV1 in the GF spinal cord. This could imply that colonic nociceptor function is normal. If this is the case, it is not clear what signals the changes in spinal cord cytokine and TLRs that contribute to visceral pain. This should be further elucidated in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have now included a more detailed analysis of our TRPV1 results in the GF spinal cord in the Discussion:</p><p>“TRPV1 receptors are broadly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and many areas of the CNS, including the spinal cord and is well-recognized as a transducer of noxious stimuli (Nagy et al. 2004). […] Moreover, GF are known to have an altered immune system and hence changes in spinal cord immune players fits well with the literature.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
