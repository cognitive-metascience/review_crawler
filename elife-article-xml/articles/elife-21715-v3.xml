Following spinal transection, functional activity can be regained, to a degree, following motor training. To identify microcircuits involved in this recovery, we studied a population of mouse spinal interneurons known to receive direct afferent inputs and project to intermediate and ventral regions of the spinal cord. We demonstrate that while dI3 interneurons are not necessary for normal locomotor activity, locomotor circuits rhythmically inhibit them and dI3 interneurons can activate these circuits. Removing dI3 interneurons from spinal microcircuits by eliminating their synaptic transmission left locomotion more or less unchanged, but abolished functional recovery, indicating that dI3 interneurons are a necessary cellular substrate for motor system plasticity following transection. We suggest that dI3 interneurons compare inputs from locomotor circuits with sensory afferent inputs to compute sensory prediction errors that then modify locomotor circuits to effect motor recovery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21715.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21715.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21715.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Circuits of nerve cells, or neurons, in the spinal cord control movement. After an injury to the spinal cord, the connections between the brain and spinal neurons may be severed, meaning that the spinal circuits can no longer work properly. This loss of communication between the brain and the spinal cord often leads to paralysis below the level of the injury.</p><p>There are currently no effective treatments for individuals who have lost the ability to walk following spinal cord injury. However, the spinal cord retains circuits that are sufficient to restore walking and these circuits can be activated with training. That is, rehabilitative training can lead to improvements in movement by promoting spinal cord plasticity – the ability of other neurons in the spinal cord to take over the roles of the severed neurons. By understanding how rehabilitation leads to these improvements following injury, new strategies could be developed to optimize the recovery process.</p><p>Previous research showed that spinal neurons called dI3 interneurons are involved in short term adjustments of movement. Could these interneurons also be involved in longer term adaptations?</p><p>Bui, Stifani et al. compared normal mice with genetically engineered mice that had dI3 interneurons “removed” from their circuits. This revealed that although dI3 interneurons in mice are integrated with spinal circuits that are involved in walking, they are not necessary for normal walking. Following the severing of the spinal cord, the experimental mice, unlike the normal mice, did not recover the ability to step. Thus, circuits comprising dI3 interneurons are necessary for recovering the ability to move after an injury.</p><p>Now that Bui, Stifani et al. have identified this essential circuit, the next step is to investigate how dI3 interneurons promote spinal cord plasticity. Understanding these mechanisms could help to develop therapies that enhance rehabilitation-assisted improvement of movement following spinal cord injury.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21715.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21715.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sensory prediction error</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>comparator neurons</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>treadmill training</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grant, FRN 79413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brownstone</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000194</institution-id><institution>Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Tuan V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery grant, RGPIN-2015-06403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Tuan V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brownstone</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bui</surname><given-names>Tuan V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetically-defined population of spinal interneurons is reciprocally connected with spinal locomotor circuits and mediates recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord transection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like other regions of the central nervous system, the spinal cord is remarkably plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wolpaw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grau, 2014</xref>). Such plasticity has been demonstrated, for example, following spinal cord injury, when training can lead to a degree of recovery of spinal locomotor circuits such that stepping movements are restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbeau et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harkema et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hubli and Dietz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>). After complete spinal transection in cats and rodents, a treadmill-training regimen that provides rhythmic sensory input to the spinal cord leads to the re-acquisition of the complex sequence of muscle activation that produces stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbeau and Rossignol, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sławińska et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple modalities of sensory input are likely required to promote these sustained changes in spinal circuits, as removing cutaneous inputs degrades the quality of recovery in both cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouyer and Rossignol, 2003</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sławińska et al., 2012</xref>), and eliminating muscle proprioceptive afferents impairs recovery in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>). But in addition to determining the afferent inputs involved, it is necessary to identify the spinal circuits involved in this plasticity in order to understand how the nervous system acquires new motor skills in health and injury.</p><p>One approach towards understanding these circuits would be to study neurons that are interposed between sensory inputs and spinal locomotor circuits. Furthermore, since there is a relationship between short-term adaptation and longer-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian, 2008</xref>), it might be useful to focus on interposed neurons that are known to be involved in adaptive responses. We previously showed that dI3 interneurons (INs), a population defined by expression of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor <italic>Isl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liem et al., 1997</xref>), receive multimodal monosynaptic sensory afferent inputs and project to spinal motoneurons. Eliminating glutamatergic output by these neurons led to deficits in motor responses to sensory perturbation: while the mice could place their paws on wire rungs, they were unable to adjust their grasp in response to sensory stimulation provided by increasing the inclination of the rungs. This indicates that a microcircuit involving dI3 INs mediates adaptive changes in motor behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). We thus focussed on this population to determine if they have a role in locomotor recovery.</p><p>Here, we have considered the position of dI3 INs in spinal microcircuits, and show that they are indeed interposed between sensory inputs and locomotor circuits. We demonstrate that while dI3 INs are not required for normal locomotor function, they are necessary for stable recovery of locomotor activity following spinal cord transection. Specifically, we demonstrate that eliminating glutamatergic output from dI3 INs precludes locomotor recovery after spinal cord transection. Thus, dI3 INs are involved in spinal microcircuits that mediate motor system plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dI3 interneurons are not necessary for locomotor function</title><p>We first determined whether dI3 INs are an essential component of spinal locomotor circuits and thus necessary for locomotion. To do so, we genetically eliminated glutamatergic neurotransmission from dI3 INs using dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (<italic>Isl1</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup>;<italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Within their cages, dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice did not reveal obvious locomotor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). There was no difference between the weights of control (19.8 ± 2.3 g; n = 14) and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice (19.0 ± 2.7 g; n = 9, p&gt;0.44). Footprint and inter-limb coordination analysis revealed subtle alterations in locomotion in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hind paws, but not the forepaws, of dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice were more widely spaced than those of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had a greater propensity to make coincident contact with the ground with three or four paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), however inter-limb coordination was similar in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). During treadmill locomotion (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice had longer stance times on average, and a steeper relationship between stance duration and cycle period than seen in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Collectively, the shorter swing phases, increased time with more paws in contact with the treadmill, and more widely spaced hind paws in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice could result from a reduction in extensor activity and/or compensation for a reduction in stability. Taken together, these results show that while dI3 INs sculpt hind limb movement, they are not critical for the fundamental rhythm and/or pattern of locomotion.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21715.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>dI3 INs are subtly involved in locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Footprint snapshots in control (cyan) and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (magenta) littermates at 30 ms intervals starting from the onset of the stance of right hindlimb (top) running at 30 cm/s.

Considering that sensory stimulation can trigger locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lundberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hultborn et al., 1998</xref>) and that dI3 INs can be monosynaptically activated by stimulation of low-threshold sensory afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>), we asked whether dI3 INs could activate spinal locomotor circuits. To do so, we studied sensory-evoked locomotion in control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, stimulating a sensory (sural) rather than a mixed (tibial) nerve to avoid stimulating motor axons. Furthermore, as sensory afferents may have multiple routes to spinal locomotor circuits, we stimulated the sural nerve, which we previously showed both anatomically and physiologically project directly to dI3 INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>), rather than a dorsal root. We thus studied sensory-evoked locomotor activity in neonatal (P1-P3) mice by isolating their spinal cords with the sensory sural nerve in continuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Raster and polar plots of up to 50 randomly selected action potentials from each of the 27 rhythmically active dI3 INs showed that the majority (22 of 27, 81%) of neurons were active primarily during the extensor phase of the step cycle (cf. 5/27 in flexor phase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Peak activity of those active during extension was at the midpoint of that phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). The dominant extensor phase activity may explain the differences in locomotion between control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice, as elimination of dI3 IN output could result in reduced plantar flexion (physiological extension) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>) during paw ground contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engberg, 1964</xref>), resulting in reduced weight support and rear track widening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donelan et al., 2004</xref>).

Experiments in animal models such as rodents and cats have demonstrated that sensory inputs have access to spinal locomotor circuits, are phasically gated during the step cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forssberg et al., 1977</xref>), and their stimulation can lead to alterations in the timing and coordination of ongoing locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duysens and Pearson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loeb et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gossard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stecina et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, stimulation of sensory afferents in in vitro isolated spinal cords can be sufficient to activate spinal locomotor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cherniak et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, spinal locomotor circuits remain accessible through sensory afferents following the loss of descending inputs.</p><p>Activation of sensory afferents by treadmill training is a guiding principle of locomotor rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harkema, 2008</xref>). This strategy has shown that activation of sensory afferents during imposed walking movements retrains spinal locomotor circuits to generate the rhythmic, patterned activation of hindlimb muscles required for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgerton and Roy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossignol and Frigon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harkema et al., 2012</xref>). In spinal-transected cats, at least one source of cutaneous afferents from the hindlimb is required to ensure full recovery of treadmill locomotion with plantar foot placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouyer and Rossignol, 2003</xref>). And following spinal transection in rodents, recovery of hindlimb movements became highly disorganized following pharmacological block of paw cutaneous afferents, indicating the important role of these afferents in functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sławińska et al., 2012</xref>). Proprioceptive afferents also play an important role in recovery following incomplete spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Thus, target neurons responsible for spinal mechanisms involved in sensory-mediated plasticity of locomotor circuits would be expected to receive sensory inputs from a variety of afferent types and project to spinal locomotor circuits. We have shown previously that dI3 INs receive different modalities of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>), and here we show that they can activate spinal locomotor circuits. Furthermore, we now show that they are necessary for sensory-mediated recovery of function following spinal transection. That dI3 INs receive multimodal sensory inputs could explain why different sensory modalities contribute to locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury and would suggest, perhaps, that the combined inputs from different modalities, through temporal and spatial summation, may be beneficial to training strategies.</p><p>The identity of the locomotor neurons excited by dI3 INs remains elusive: in addition to their outputs to motoneurons, dI3 INs also project to as yet unidentified neurons in the intermediate laminae of the cervical and lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, although we increasingly understand locomotor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kiehn, 2016</xref>), knowledge of the neuronal substrate for activation of these circuits either by descending commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bretzner and Brownstone, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>), or by sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whelan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marchetti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cherniak et al., 2014</xref>) is lacking. Understanding dI3 IN target neurons in the intermediate laminae of the spinal cord may shed light on these questions, and would be a key next step in the determination of the cellular mechanisms of plasticity induced by dI3 INs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN-mediated plasticity</title><p>We have shown that dI3 INs are necessary for training-induced recovery of locomotor activity following spinal transection. It is unlikely that this recovery results simply from a loss of afferent input to locomotor circuits, as sensory stimulation – either by increasing stimulation intensity or by number of fibres (by dorsal root stimulation) – can still evoke locomotor activity in dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mouse spinal cords. We thus suggest that dI3 INs are mediating plastic changes in these circuits. In other words, the re-acquisition of locomotion can be considered to be a low level form of motor learning, in which repeated activity leads to sustained changes in the central nervous system such that spinal circuits below the site of a lesion can produce locomotor activity in the absence of descending motor commands. In this light, it is therefore instructive to consider that circuits that mediate short-term adaptation are those that lead to long-term learning through various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hirano et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that dI3 INs mediate short-term adaptation in regulating paw grasp in response to changing sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Long-term changes, however, must be accompanied by homeostatic plastic mechanisms that prevent instability induced by positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turrigiano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quartarone and Hallett, 2013</xref>). These mechanisms could include, for example, changes in connectivity, synaptic strength, and/or morphology of spinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brownstone et al., 2015</xref>). Such changes have been proposed to underlie spontaneous or training-induced changes in motor output in spinal cord injury patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harkema, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knikou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dietz, 2012</xref>) and in animal models of spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Côté and Gossard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frigon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tillakaratne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van den Brand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houle and Côté, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takeoka et al., 2014</xref>). Similar mechanisms of plasticity may also occur during learning in intact developing and mature spinal cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tahayori and Koceja, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grau, 2014</xref>). Studying such changes at synapses between dI3 INs and their target locomotor circuit neurons may reveal specific mechanisms underlying this plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications</title><p>From a circuit perspective, we know from cerebellar studies that motor learning relies on comparator neurons – neurons that compare actual sensory inputs (what did happen, or instructive inputs) with the sensory input predicted by the motor command (what should have happened) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cullen and Brooks, 2015</xref>). Predictive inputs arise from forward models derived from a copy of the motor command – an efference copy. By comparing these two inputs, comparator neurons calculate the ‘sensory prediction error,’ which is then used to modify circuit function, either for corrective responses or sustained learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Requarth and Sawtell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brownstone et al., 2015</xref>). Most dI3 INs receive excitatory instructive inputs from a variety of sensory afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>), as well as inhibitory rhythmic input from locomotor circuits. We suggest that this inhibitory input, which mirrors the motor output, is the manifestation of a forward model and is suggestive of a negative image of the expected excitatory sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Requarth and Sawtell, 2014</xref>). That is, in addition to instructive inputs, dI3 INs receive inputs indicative of a predictive forward model. These two classes of inputs position dI3 INs as comparators between actual and predicted movement, and thus calculators of sensory prediction error. We suggest that this error signal leads to plastic changes in locomotor circuits, mediating long-term learning such as that necessary for locomotor recovery after spinal cord transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Within this framework, sensory information provided by training would lead to activation of locomotor circuits, which would then produce a forward model to predict the sensory consequences of the movement. Through training, the sensory prediction error is iteratively calculated by dI3 INs, and would lead to synaptic and/or cellular changes in locomotor circuits, leading to sustained recovery of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brownstone et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, functional removal of dI3 INs from the circuits results in the loss of sensory prediction error signals, and thus prevents the benefit of locomotor training following spinal transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Motor learning is distributed across hierarchical control structures, with different levels of the hierarchy functioning together to ensure adaptation and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawato et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon and Ahissar, 2012</xref>). We show that dI3 INs form an intra-spinal closed loop circuit, in which the microcircuits that route sensory information to locomotor circuits are themselves under the influence of the locomotor circuits that they modulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These closed loops would be nested within other control loops, such as peripheral sensorimotor loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimitriou and Edin, 2010</xref>) and those situated between spinal motor circuits and descending motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arshavsky et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hantman and Jessell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azim et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these nested loops create a hierarchical control system that would optimise motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawato et al., 1987</xref>). That one of these loops may exist in the spinal cord would be important for rehabilitative techniques: targeting intraspinal learning circuits such as those formed by dI3 INs could lead to new strategies to facilitate spinal circuit function in order to improve motor behaviour affected by a number of neurological diseases and injuries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University Committee on Laboratory Animals of Dalhousie University (protocol 13–143) and conform to the guidelines put forth by the Canadian Council for Animal Care.</p><p>Expression of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the promoter for the homeodomain transcription factor <italic>Isl1</italic> was obtained by crossing <italic>Isl1</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:024242">IMSR_JAX:024242</ext-link>) and <italic>Thy1</italic>-fs-YFP mice to yield <italic>Isl1</italic>-YFP mice.

No differences were observed between these two control genotypes and animals were thus pooled into a single control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Treadmill locomotion</title><p>Limb movement during locomotor behaviour was described by using motion analysis techniques combined with high-speed video recordings of the behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of footprints during treadmill locomotion (10 cm/s to 50 cm/s) was performed using an Exer Gait XL treadmill (Columbus Instruments) and analyzed with Treadscan Analysis System v4.0 (Clever Sys). Analysis was performed on segments in which the mice maintained their position on the treadmill. For kinematic analysis, mice walked on a treadmill (either custom made by the workshop of Zoological Institute, University of Cologne or an Exer Gait XL from Columbus Instruments) at speeds ranging from 3 to 72 cm/s and recorded with a high-speed camera (Photron PCL R2, Photron; or IL3-100, Fastec Imaging) at a capture rate of 250 frames per second (Fps). The animals were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and custom-made three-dimensional reflective markers (~2 mm diameters) were glued onto the shaved skin at the level of the anterior iliac crest, hip, knee (in some cases), ankle, metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, and the tip of the fourth digit (toe) of one or both hindlimbs. Joint coordinates were automatically tracked by Vicon Motus software or by custom scripts for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>) and R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Core Team, 2013</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link>). These coordinates were used to compute hip, knee, ankle, and paw angles. For the knee joint, in consideration of movement of the skin over the knee, the actual knee coordinates and angles were calculated geometrically using the length of the femur and tibia. Stance onset was determined by using local maxima of the position of the toe marker in the horizontal plane. Several step cycles were averaged from portion of recordings when animals were producing a steady locomotor output.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Extracellular ventral and dorsal root recordings via suction electrodes were amplified 10,000 X in differential mode, bandpass-filtered (10 Hz to 3 KHz) using a custom-built extracellular amplifier, and acquired at 10 kHz (Digidata 1322A, pClamp nine software, Molecular Devices RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>). Whole-cell patch-clamp signals were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To study sensory-evoked locomotor activity, in-vitro preparations with the sural nerve in continuity with the spinal cord were prepared from <italic>Isl1-</italic>YFP or dI3<sup>OFF</sup> postnatal (P1-P3) mice. Surgical procedures to isolate the spinal cord were similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al. (2013)</xref> except that the skin of the right hindlimb was dissected and muscles removed to expose and dissect the sciatic and sural nerves. The sural, common peroneal, and tibial nerves were then transected distally. The spinal cords were left to recover for 1–2 hr before recording. Locomotion was induced by dorsal root or sural nerve stimulation using a 10 s long train of 250 µs pulses at 3 Hz using a Grass Technologies S88 square pulse stimulator (Natus Neurology Inc.). The presence of more than four successive rhythmic bursts within the stimulation train in at least one ventral root was used to indicate the presence of locomotor-like activity.</p><p>To record rhythmic inputs to dI3 INs during fictive locomotion, hemisected spinal cords were prepared from <italic>Isl1</italic>-YFP postnatal (P1-P6) mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Following anaesthesia with xylazine and ketamine, mice were decapitated. Their spinal cords were isolated by vertebrectomy in room temperature recording ACSF (in mM: NaCl, 127; KCl, 3; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; D-glucose, 10). Ventral and dorsal roots were dissected as distally as possible, and spinal cords were pinned with the ventral side up. A surgical blade was used to make a longitudinal incision down the midline (in a rostro-caudal direction). The hemicords were then allowed to equilibrate in room temperature recording ACSF for at least one hour, then pinned, medial-side up to a base of clear Sylgard (Dow Corning) in a recording chamber and perfused with circulating room temperature recording ACSF. Ventral roots were placed in suction electrodes (A-M Systems Inc.). In a subset of experiments examining the activity of dI3 INs during drug-evoked locomotion, bilateral dorsal cords were removed from segments L1 to L3 or from segments L4 to L6. Spinal cords were pinned on their sides and insect pins were used to trace a line followed by a surgical blade to section the spinal cord.</p><p>Fictive locomotion was elicited by application of NMDA (5 µM), serotonin (10 µM) and dopamine (50 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>). Data from spinal cords in which synchronous activity was produced in flexor- and extensor-dominant ventral roots were excluded. Circular statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zar, 1996</xref>) using 50 randomly selected spikes for each dI3 IN were used to determine the phasic relationships between dI3 IN spiking and ventral root bursting during drug-induced locomotion.</p><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM: K-methane-sulphonate, 140; NaCl, 10; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1; HEPES, 10; EGTA, 1; ATP-Mg, 3; GTP0.4; pH 7.2–7.3 adjusted with KOH; osmolarity adjusted to ~295 mOsm with sucrose). In the hemisected cords, care was taken to record from cells that were in the middle of the ventral-dorsal axis of the hemicord to avoid motoneurons. In order to avoid recording from neurons close to the central canal (possibly sympathetic preganglionic neurons), neurons that were near the surface were also avoided.</p><p>Most dI3 INs exhibited rhythmic, alternating phases of membrane depolarization, which in some cases were accompanied by firing of action potentials, and quiescent hyperpolarization. In the cells where cyclical change of membrane potential was not accompanied by firing of action potentials, application of a bias depolarizing current led to phasic firing of action potentials during periods of membrane depolarization.</p><p>The locomotor cycle was double-normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kwan et al., 2009</xref>) such that each cycle was divided into extensor and flexor phases, with 0 to 0.5 spanning the onset to the termination of the extensor phase and 0.5 to 1 spanning the flexor phase of each cycle. Polar plots of rhythmic activity were used for analysis of the rhythmic activity of each cell. The angle represents the mean phase (Φ) whereas the distance from origin is a measure of concentration around the mean phase, which we refer to here as <italic>r</italic>. After calculating the cosine and sine of the phase of each spike, Φ was calculated as the average cosine and sine of the spikes and the angular concentration, <italic>r</italic>, was calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of the average cosine and average sine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zar, 1996</xref>). Thus if the neuron fires once per cycle at precisely the same phase, then <italic>r</italic> = 1. Conversely, if there were a random distribution of firing across the step cycle, then the average sine and cosine would both be 0, and <italic>r</italic> = 0 (i.e. all spikes are uniformly dispersed across the step cycle). The inner circle represents an <italic>r</italic> value of 0.24, as for 50 randomly-selected spikes, values above this threshold indicate that cells were rhythmically active (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>To determine the rhythmicity of inputs to dI3 INs, unitary PSCs were extracted from voltage-clamp recordings at −40 mV. Outward IPSCs and inward EPSCs were detected in Clampfit using a template. The phase of each IPSC and EPSC was calculated and circular statistics were applied as above to determine whether dI3 INs received rhythmic inputs. The proportion of IPSCs that occurred within a certain phase of the step cycle was determined by calculating the proportion of IPSCs within each of 50 equal bins across the step cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Spinal cord transection</title><p>Complete transections were performed at T9-T10 under isoflurane anaesthesia. Animals were individually housed, given analgesics for 3 days, and allowed to recover for at least one week prior to further testing. Animals were monitored twice daily and bladders expressed manually. Humane endpoints were defined as self-mutilation, improper feeding, decreased grooming, ataxia, or a loss of body weight &gt;20%. Completeness of spinal transections was confirmed by a second surgery as described below.</p><p>Locomotor training was provided at least once per week (average twice per week). Animals were allowed to habituate to the treadmill environment before recordings ranging from 20 to 40 s at speeds between 3 and 7 cm/s. When required to ensure the completion of the task, animal support was provided by holding the animal in a horizontal position while maintaining permanent contact with the treadmill belt. 5 to 10 recordings were performed per sessions.</p><p>Animals showing regular locomotor performance were selected for spinal transection. In sterile conditions, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane to the point of loss of hindlimb reflexes, then shaved and disinfected using Chlorexidine, 70% isopropyl alcohol and 10% betadine from the neck to the lumbar region, and placed on a heating pad. A Tegaderm film (Ref 70200749300, 3M) was placed for stability and to ensure sterile conditions throughout the procedure. An incision was made, paraspinal muscles were incised and spread to expose the T9-T10 laminae, and laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal cord. Double incisions were performed on the rostral and caudal portions of the exposed cord. A Pasteur pipet melted into a custom hook was used to insert underneath the cord and remove the sectioned segment. A piece of sterile Absorbable Hemostat Surgifoam (Ref 63713-0019-75, Ethicon) was placed into the created spinal space. Deep and superficial muscles were sutured with Chromic Gut 6–0 sutures (Ref 796G; Ethicon), and skin with 6–0 Ethilon nylon monofilament suture (Ref 1856G; Ethicon). Tissue was kept moist at all times using sterile saline solution.</p><p>Animals, individually housed until suture removal about 10 days later, were allowed to recover for at least one week prior to further testing. They were monitored twice per day and bladders were expressed manually as necessary. Animal weight was monitored daily. Analgesics were administered sub-cutaneously for 3 days after the surgery (buprenorphine: 0.05 mg/kg working solution, 3 µg/ml twice daily; and ketoprofen: 5 mg/kg working solution, 1 mg/ml once a day). Antibiotic (enrofloxacin: 5 mg/kg, working solution 0.25 mg/ml) was administered sub-cutaneously at the time of surgery then provided in drinking water (400 mg/l) until complete healing. Animals were provided with accessible food, water, and soft bedding.</p><p>We confirmed complete transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) by proceeding with a second transection at least 40 days after the first in 11 control and 6 dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice (7 and 5 survived, respectively). Animals were excluded (4 control and 2 dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice) from the analysis if the second surgery induced a locomotor deficit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating incomplete initial transection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Step ratio analysis</title><p>In order to assess locomotor function recovery, we quantified the ratio of hindlimb to forelimb steps. A hindlimb step was counted when there was any forward movement of the toes. Ventral treadmill video recordings were analyzed using the ImageJ Cell counter plugin. An average of 40 forelimb steps were counted per recording. The number of rear steps was averaged between both hindlimbs. The ratio was calculated as the average number of hindlimb steps divided by the number of forelimb steps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Kinematic recording analysis</title><p>For kinematic analysis, were analyzed using a custom script in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nstifani">https://github.com/nstifani</ext-link>).

Data recorded from intact control (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 6) animals running at 10 to 60 cm/s. Left and right hind limbs were recorded separately and processed in parallel. A total of 382 control and 172 dI3<sup>OFF</sup> step cycles were analyzed. Subsequently, step cycles (swing and stance) were normalized to durations of 100 data points (equivalent to a normalised step cycle duration of 400 ms). Measured variables were averaged per animal and across recordings. Following transection and recovery, data recorded from spinalized controls (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 3) animals at speeds between 3 and 7 cm/s were added to the recorded data from intact animals. Steps cycles (control: <italic>n</italic> = 46; dI3<sup>OFF</sup>: <italic>n</italic> = 16) were normalized as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Larry Jordan, Tom Jessell, and Marco Beato for helpful comments, Angelita Alcos and Nadia Farbstein for technical assistance, Tom Hnasko for the <italic>Slc17a6</italic> (vGluT2) conditional knockout mice, Frederic Bretzner, Pratip Mitra, Philippe Magown, and Izabela Panek for discussion and comments, Meggie Reardon for assistance in developing the sural nerve attached spinal cord preparation, Amrit Sampalli and Islay Wright for technical support and mathematical input.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ole Kiehn (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Serge Rossignol (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and there is general enthusiasm about the work; however, there are issues that need to be addressed in a revision. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Included are also the individual reviews.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Bui et al. reports the functional role of a selected group of interneurons (dI3) in mouse normal locomotion and recovery after spinal cord transection. This work is based on elegant mouse genetic experiments to visualize these neurons through their specific transcription factor expression and on the results of genetic ablation of dI3 cells. Using kinematic analysis of locomotion, motor behavioral tests and electrophysiological measurements, Bui et al. show that dI3 cells receive a direct sensory input from hindlimbs and play a moderate role in normal locomotion. The function of dI3 cells becomes much more prominent after complete transection of the spinal cord: thus, despite regular treadmill training, dI3OFF mice show gross impairment in regaining motor behavior. The authors explain their findings by assigning a key role of the dI3 INs in a learning spinal circuit suggesting that dI3 neurons are important during the critical phase of network plasticity that ensures the quality and extent of recovery after injury. This work is of general interest. The results have translational value to the human condition and deal with the thorny issue of recovery after injury and the relative contribution of neurorehabilitation. While the authors' work is of high quality, innovative and well illustrated there are points that should be resolved to improve the presentation and discuss alternative explanations for the rehabilitation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not so clear if the authors believe that it is only mechanoreceptors in the skin that are acting on the dI3 neurons or if other sensory modalities e.g. from muscle spindles or tendon organs also can reach the dI3 neurons. Muscle proprioception may be involved in the reconfiguration that happens after spinal cord injury. Some justification for the entire focus on the sural nerve stimulation in the study is needed. This issue becomes particularly important when the authors start to talk about the possibility to evoke locomotion with dorsal root stimulation in the absence of transmission in the dI3 neurons. The authors should somehow clarify these issues when they introduce the sural nerve stimulation.</p><p>Also locomotion is induced in the control at 1.7th which clearly evokes a C wave as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The conclusion really hinges on the fact that in dI3<sup>OFF</sup>, stimulation below 2.5Th does not generally evoke locomotion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that the distinction is somewhat marginal. It is unfortunate that there is no data shown for stimulation of locomotion at 1Th since already C waves are evoked at 1.7Th, the lowest level of stimulation evoking locomotion in the control. Please discuss this also in relationship to stimulation of other afferents.</p><p>2) Subsection “dI3 interneurons are not necessary for locomotor function”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that indeed the interlimb distance is different between control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice. However, it is quite apparent that the two mice have different sizes and that the interlimb distance may be more related to the facts that the mice are simply bigger. Has this been considered? Is the average weight of the control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice similar? Please provide data that consider this issue.</p><p>3) The whole-cell recordings during fictive locomotion are of particular interest in showing alternation of excitation and inhibition in dI3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is clear from the panel in A that there is an alternating rhythmic excitation and inhibition, which is seen when the membrane potential is held at +30 mV. There is no mention of this in the text; instead it is said consistently that these neurons only receive a rhythmic inhibition. The authors need to clarify or at least mention this in the text and rectify the description; maybe also describe this in relation to the so-called &quot;balanced network&quot; theory (Berg &amp; Hounsgaard).</p><p>4) It is not clear what the authors imply by the word learning. It was shown long time ago that after an acute spinalization, cats can express spinal locomotion without having to relearn the locomotor pattern. So, the circuits are present; evident from the pharmacological stimulation. If no pharmacological stimulant is given, the recovery process of spinal locomotion depends on re-establishing a proper synaptic excitation/inhibition through sensory stimulation as well as intrinsic neuronal changes to progressively reactivate the circuitry. So is the locomotor deficit in spinal dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice a deficit in learning capability or a shutting down of important sensory feedback through dI3 INs on the CPG?. In the end, what the authors provide is the evidence that inputs through a class of IN is important for the expression of spinal locomotion. Learning through training implies that the approximate movements can be somewhat spontaneously generated. If there is no movement, training will be of little use. This issue should be discussed.</p><p>5) The Discussion is too long and contains a large amount of speculative arguments which may not be totally relevant to the reader. Thus, to interpret their results the authors claim to adopt &quot;cerebellar models of motor learning&quot; (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN -mediated plasticity”, first paragraph) that are then expanded to &quot;comparator neurons calculate the sensory prediction error&quot; and to electric organ discharge of mormyrid fish (second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The Discussion should be cut down substantially and avoid excessive speculations that are not close to the actual data. When implementing these changes the authors should address the alternative explanations to the learning (see above).</p><p>6) It is not clear if dI3<sup>OFF</sup> spinal cords show any change in structure and cell composition? While the authors have done a lot of electrophysiological measurements, it is not clear if there are any discernible alterations in neuronal/glial composition of the genetic model. This information is not apparent even in the earlier publication (Neuron 2013) by the same group. Of course, while reflexes and network activities may rely on the actual operation of a limited number of circuit components, after transection even an apparently modest histological change may have profound consequences on function. Some discussion of this issue is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21715.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is not so clear if the authors believe that it is only mechanoreceptors in the skin that are acting on the dI3 neurons or if other sensory modalities e.g. from muscle spindles or tendon organs also can reach the dI3 neurons.

Interestingly – and possibly importantly – dI3 INs receive multimodal sensory inputs (Bui et al., 2013). That is, they integrate information that arises from different afferent types. One type includes low threshold cutaneous mechanoreceptors. We have now stressed this point (subsection “dI3 IN microcircuits and locomotion”, third paragraph), and hope that this is now clear in the manuscript.</p><p>There is no doubt that primary afferents have many synaptic targets in the cord. In our 2013 paper, we showed reduction of disynaptic reflex responses in adult mice when stimulating the sural (primarily cutaneous) nerve. Stimulation of the tibial nerve, a mixed nerve, led to less clear-cut results because of obscuration by monosynaptic reflexes. That is, sural nerve stimulation resulted in clearer responses, likely because of the reduced number of pathways between these afferents and the motoneurons.</p><p>In parallel to this, it is plausible that we would have had similar results in this study regardless of which afferents we stimulated. The reason for choosing the sural nerve is one of signal to noise, because the quantity of afferents stimulated would be lower – and yet effective in eliciting activity in controls – and so we would be more likely to get a “cleaner” result (which we did). So we don’t think there is anything necessarily magical about either the sural nerve or cutaneous afferents in this sense, but this paradigm was useful to demonstrate that dI3 INs can activate locomotor circuits. We have clarified the text surrounding our choice to use the sural nerve (subsection “dI3 interneurons activate locomotor circuits”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Also locomotion is induced in the control at 1.7th which clearly evokes a C wave as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The conclusion really hinges on the fact that in dI3<sup>OFF</sup>, stimulation below 2.5Th does not generally evoke locomotion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> shows that the distinction is somewhat marginal. It is unfortunate that there is no data shown for stimulation of locomotion at 1Th since already C waves are evoked at 1.7Th, the lowest level of stimulation evoking locomotion in the control. Please discuss this also in relationship to stimulation of other afferents.</italic> </p><p>We apologise for the confusion induced by the assumption that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref> are from the same preparation. We don’t think the difference is marginal as illustrated in 2F andsupported by statistical analysis. The C-wave threshold differs between animals, and hence in that figure we plotted locomotor threshold vs. c-wave threshold for each animal. None of the mutants had rhythmic activity when stimulation was below the line of unity, whereas only one control was above the line of unity. We have now marked the points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> that correspond to the preparations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and D</xref>, and trust that this clarifies the issue.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “dI3 interneurons are not necessary for locomotor function”, first paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that indeed the interlimb distance is different between control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice.

Is the average weight of the control and dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice similar? Please provide data that consider this issue.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important point. While we previously showed that adult dI3<sup>OFF</sup> mice are similar in weights to controls, we have now included this in this manuscript as well (subsection “dI3 interneurons are not necessary for locomotor function”).</p><p><italic>3) The whole-cell recordings during fictive locomotion are of particular interest in showing alternation of excitation and inhibition in dI3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

This indicates that these are inhibitory PSCs. Excitatory PSCs would be expected to be inward at -40 mV, and if there are any of these, they are essentially indistinguishable from noise. We do mention in the text that a few cells received excitation (subsection “dI3 interneurons receive rhythmic inputs from spinal locomotor circuits”, second paragraph) but have no clear-cut evidence of a Berg and Hounsgaard “balanced” network. We trust that the revised text is clearer.</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear what the authors imply by the word learning.

This issue should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. We have revised the text to raise this important point (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN-mediated plasticity”).</p><p>Regarding the issue of the use of the word “learning,” which we use late in the Discussion, we think this is partly an issue of semantics. Rossignol, for example, has provided evidence of locomotor circuit plasticity (“learning”) following hemisection. Learning involves the acquisition of a skill (for example) by training, and we would argue that this is what is happening following spinalisation, whether in the cat or the mouse or any other animal. We don’t know the mechanism by which training leads to “re-emergence” (?) of the activity of locomotor circuits. (Is it LTP? synaptic scaling? Etc.), but raise possibilities.</p><p>We trust that our changes are satisfactory.</p><p><italic>5) The Discussion is too long and contains a large amount of speculative arguments which may not be totally relevant to the reader. Thus, to interpret their results the authors claim to adopt &quot;cerebellar models of motor learning&quot; (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN -mediated plasticity”, first paragraph) that are then expanded to &quot;comparator neurons calculate the sensory prediction error&quot; and to electric organ discharge of mormyrid fish (second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The Discussion should be cut down substantially and avoid excessive speculations that are not close to the actual data. When implementing these changes the authors should address the alternative explanations to the learning (see above).</italic> </p><p>We have shortened the Discussion. We would argue that the crux of this paper is the evidence that dI3 INs are positioned as comparator neurons based upon theoretical frameworks established for other areas of motor learning in the nervous system, most notably the cerebellum. Therefore, while we have substantially reduced the amount of text devoted to this discussion, we think it still of value to bring up this concept.</p><p><italic>6) It is not clear if dI3<sup>OFF</sup> spinal cords show any change in structure and cell composition?

Some discussion of this issue is needed.</italic> </p><p>We have not experimentally addressed the morphological and anatomical changes in this study, but focused on identifying circuits involved in recovery of function. We discuss possible changes in connectivity, synaptic strength, and morphology in spinal neurons that could lead to recovery (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying dI3 IN-mediated plasticity”). However, given that the reviewers would like us to shorten our Discussion, we have decided not to delve into neuronal-glial compositions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
