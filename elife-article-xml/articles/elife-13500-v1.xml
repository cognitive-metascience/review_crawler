Here we report a genetic screen that highlighted H2B deubiquitylation and the RSC remodeling complex as activators of <italic>ste11</italic> expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed more complex, opposite roles of H2Bubi at the promoter where it represses expression, and over the transcribed region where it sustains it. By promoting H3K4 methylation at the promoter, H2Bubi initiates the deacetylation process, which decreases chromatin remodeling by RSC. Upon induction, this process is reversed and efficient NDR (<underline>n</underline>ucleosome <underline>d</underline>epleted <underline>r</underline>egion) formation leads to high expression. Therefore, H2Bubi represses gametogenesis by opposing the recruitment of RSC at the promoter of the master regulator <italic>ste11</italic> gene.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13500.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13500.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Chromatin</kwd><kwd>Transcription</kwd><kwd>Fission yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-52143-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antequera</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR T.0012.14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermand</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Materne et al., 2015), it is shown that the ubiquitylation of histone H2B represses cell differentiation by opposing chromatin remodeling at the promoter of the master regulator of gametogenesis, ste11</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The RNA polymerase II (PolII) subunit Rpb1 C-terminal Domain shows a stereotypical pattern of CTD phosphorylation with phospho-S5 (S5P) peaking near the transcription start site (TSS) and phospho-S2 (S2P) accumulating towards the 3’-end of the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drogat and Hermand, 2012</xref>). The distribution of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) mirrors S5P due to the direct recruitment of the H3 methyltransferase Set1-COMPASS by the S5P of PolII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al., 2003</xref>). In budding yeast, Set1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase and plays a repressive role on <italic>PHO5, PHO84</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> expression, suggesting that H3K4me creates a repressive chromatin configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvin and Kladde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Most genes are also upregulated in fission yeast when Set1 is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz et al., 2014</xref>). The PHD finger protein Set3, which is part of the SET3C HDAC complex, binds H3K4me2 to mediate deacetylation of histones in the 5’ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the PHD domain of the HDAC-associated ING2 protein mediates its binding to the di- and trimethylated H3K4 at the promoters of proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pena et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Histone H2B is monoubiquitylated (H2Bubi) on the conserved lysine 119 in fission yeast. In yeast, Rad6 and Bre1 function as conjugating enzyme (E2) or ligase (E3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robzyk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wood et al., 2003</xref>). The pathway is conserved in fission yeast with the Rhp6 E2 and two Bre1 homologues, Brl1 and Brl2, a situation closer to higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zofall and Grewal, 2007</xref>). The presence of the Ubp8 deubiquitylase, which is part of the SAGA co-activator complex, underlies the dynamic nature of H2Bubi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henry et al., 2003</xref>). A second deubiquitylase, Ubp10, modulates the pool of H2Bubi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>). H2Bubi functions in a trans-tail regulation of H3K4 and H3K79 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dover et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun and Allis, 2002</xref>). The Set1-COMPASS subunit Swd2 is required for the crosstalk by mechanisms implying its direct ubiquitylation by Rad6-Bre1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vitaliano-Prunier et al., 2008</xref>) or its recruitment by H2B-ub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). H2Bubi is spread uniformly across transcribed units and at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2009</xref>). Ubp8 acts at the 5’ region where H3K4me3 is also high while Ubp10 targets the H3K79me3 decorated nucleosomes more typical of 3’ regions, which suggests different, maybe opposite, roles of H2Bubi over the length of genes and spatial regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulze et al., 2011</xref>). Nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batta et al., 2011</xref>) in a strain lacking H2Bubi revealed a role in promoting nucleosome assembly leading to repression at promoters and a positive role during elongation by facilitating the eviction of the H2A-H2B dimer and nucleosome reassembly following the passage of the polymerase. However, how H2Bubi represses transcription at the promoter is not clear.</p><p>From the SWI/SNF-class remodeling complexes, RSC is ten-fold more abundant and is essential for viability, in contrast the SWI/SNF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>).

RSC recognizes acetylated nucleosomes through tandem bromodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>), which links its recruitment to acetylation of histone H3 lysine 14.</p><p>Here we show that promoter H2B ubiquitylation represses the expression of the master regulator of gametogenesis <italic>Ste11</italic> in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anandhakumar et al., 2013</xref>) by promoting Set1/H3K4me dependent deacetylation, which impedes the recruitment of the RSC complex. A H2B K119R mutant results in decreased nucleosome occupancy at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter and derepression of the gene, while the absence of RSC has the opposite effect. Therefore, the opposing role of promoter histone H2B ubiquitylation and RSC-dependent chromatin remodeling controls gametogenesis in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The abolition of histone H2B ubiquitylation suppresses the <italic>lsk1</italic> deletion mutant</title><p>In fission yeast, the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 (<underline>l</underline>atrunculin <underline>s</underline>ensitive <underline>k</underline>inase - Cdk12 in higher eukaryotes) is required for the completion of cytokinesis in response to perturbation of the actomyosin ring by latrunculin A (LatA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karagiannis et al., 2005</xref>), and the deletion of <italic>lsk1</italic> results in sensitivity to LatA. It is therefore likely that the efficient transcription of one or several genes controlling cytokinesis requires S2P. Testing the LatA sensitivity of the genes we have previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coudreuse et al., 2010</xref>) as downregulated in a S2A mutant identified the essential SIN (Septation Initiation Network) component encoding gene <italic>cdc14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fankhauser and Simanis, 1993</xref>) as a potential transcriptional target of Lsk1. The overexpression of <italic>cdc14</italic> significantly suppresses the LatA sensitivity of a strain deleted for <italic>lsk1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), supporting that the LatA sensitivity of the <italic>lsk1</italic> mutant relates to the downregulation of <italic>cdc14</italic>.</p><p>We reasoned that the easily tested LatA sensitivity phenotype should allow us to identify additional gene products acting together with S2P to control gene expression. We therefore screened the entire <italic>S. pombe</italic> deletion library for sensitivity to the presence of 0.5 μM LatA. The screen is not expected to be very specific as many regulators of the actomyosin ring and cytokinesis were already shown to be sensitive to LatA but transcriptional regulators should easily be extracted from that group based on annotation. The sensitivity of the S2A mutation within the CTD is specific as an S7A mutant behaves as wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The screening appeared to be consistent as the three kinases (Pmk1, Pek1 and Mkh1) forming the MAPK cell integrity transduction pathway were isolated. In addition, we identified the SAGA-associated Ubp8 H2B ubiquitin protease and several components of the RSC and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes.

We tested the specificity of a new monoclonal antibody in fission yeast to avoid the caveats of using a tagged version. Despite two amino acid changes in the predicted epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the antibody specifically recognized the ubiquitylated version of H2B as no signal was observed in a K119R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Humanizing the fission yeast gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) in order to generate the exact epitope did not improve recognition, indicating that the antibody could be used on a wild type strain. The H2Bubi signal appeared increased in the <italic>ubp8</italic> deletion strain but not in the absence of <italic>ubp16</italic> that encodes the closest fission yeast orthologue to <italic>ScUBP10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kouranti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadeghi et al., 2014</xref>). The double <italic>ubp8 ubp16</italic> mutant had similar level of H2Bubi to the single <italic>ubp8</italic> mutant, suggesting that Ubp8 is the genuine H2B deubiquitylase in fission yeast as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadeghi et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>In order to decipher the complex genetic interactions between S2P and H2Bubi, we followed the spatial distribution of H2B ubiquitylation over the <italic>ste11</italic> locus during induction. A reverse pattern was observed at the promoter and 3’-distal region with H2Bubi occupancy decreasing at the promoter and increasing along the transcribed unit during gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). Considering the dependency of H3K4me to H2Bubi, we also followed the trimethyl mark (H3K4me3) that behaved similarly to H2Bubi at the promoter but was very low in the 3’ region of <italic>ste11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). Therefore, the use of the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> mutant confirmed that the deposition of H3K4me3 requires previous H2B ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). We reasoned that the opposite dynamic of H2Bubi at the promoter and 3’ region could reflect that the ubiquitylation represses transcription at the promoter while it promotes it during elongation, which could explain why both the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> and the <italic>ubp8</italic> deletion mutant lead to increased expression of <italic>ste11</italic>. In addition, our recent work indicated that H3K4me3 represses <italic>ste11</italic> expression by recruiting the SET3C HDAC, which is counteracted by Lsk1-dependent S2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Materne et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> strain where H3K4me3 is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel), Lsk1 and S2P would not be required, which is what we observe both genetically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and by RT-Q-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further tested this model by measuring the level of H3 at the promoter of various strains. Confirming our previous data, the deletion of <italic>lsk1</italic> or the mutation of H3 lysine 14 to arginine (Htt2 K14R) led to an elevated level of H3 onto the promoter region while the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> mutant, or a strain lacking <italic>hos2</italic> (encoding the catalytic subunit of the SET3C HDAC) had a reduction of histone occupancy at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

A meta-gene analysis of the nucleosome occupancy signal for all protein-coding genes revealed higher occupancy upstream of the TSS in the <italic>rsc1</italic> mutant, and an average 13 bp shift of the −1 nucleosome toward the TSS was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) when selecting the 10% protein-coding genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of Rsc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel). The <italic>ste11</italic> gene belonged to that category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), confirming the previous single gene analyses performed above. We next analysed how of the previously established list of genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the S2A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Materne et al., 2015</xref>) behaved when <italic>rsc1</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Remarkably, these genes also showed higher nucleosome occupancy close to their TSS in the absence of Rsc1, indicating a mechanistic connection between the abolition of CTD S2P and the absence of Rsc1. Comparing the subset of genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of either Rsc1 or in the absence of S2P revealed a significant overlap (p<italic>=3.416e-06</italic>). These data support a genome-wide mechanistic connection between CTD phosphorylation on serine 2 and remodeling by the RSC complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the fact that the phosphorylation of the CTD S2 is not essential in yeast, the master regulator of gametogenesis, <italic>ste11</italic>, requires an unusual requirement of S2P nearby its promoter for proper induction to counteract the repressed state imposed by the Set1-H3K4me3-HDAC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Materne et al., 2015</xref>). A recent study proposed that Set1 represses the transcriptome independently of H3K4 methylation and is recruited by the Atf1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz et al., 2014</xref>). However, three previous studies have shown that Atf1 functions as an activator, rather than a repressor at the <italic>ste11</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanoh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shiozaki and Russell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takeda et al., 1995</xref>) and a H3K4R mutant also derepresses <italic>ste11</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Materne et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, while we do not exclude that Set1 also represses <italic>ste11</italic> independently of its H3K4 methylase activity, this pathway is not predominant.</p><p>Both the deletion of <italic>ubp8</italic> (and therefore increased ubiquitylation) and the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> mutant (and therefore absence of ubiquitylation) resulted in derepression of <italic>ste11</italic>. This is at first sight hard to explain as removal of histone modifications are expected to oppose the effect of their addition, such as in the acetylation/deacetylation process. However, a similar case was reported at the <italic>GAL1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henry et al., 2003</xref>), already underlying the complex dynamic of H2Bubi where the sequential addition and removal of the mark is required for proper induction. Although the <italic>ubp8</italic> and <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> both result in elevated <italic>ste11</italic> expression, only the <italic>htb1 K119R</italic> suppresses the requirement of the S2 kinase Lsk1, which indicates that the positive effects of the addition and removal of the mark may operate through unrelated mechanisms. This is backed up by the spatially opposite behaviour of the H2Bubi mark over the <italic>ste11</italic> locus. The fact that the double <italic>lsk1 ubp8</italic> mutant behaves as the single <italic>lsk1</italic> mutant suggests that the function of <italic>lsk1</italic> is required upstream of <italic>ubp8</italic>. Indeed if Ubp8 positively affects elongation by facilitating the eviction of the H2A-H2B dimer and nucleosome reassembly in the wake of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pavri et al., 2006</xref>), it is expected that this effect will be masked by the strong defect in polymerase occupancy at the promoter observed when <italic>lsk1</italic> is absent. The positive effect of <italic>ubp8</italic> on elongation is likely to occur independently of H3K4 methylation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanny et al., 2007</xref>) and maybe related to the positive role of H2Bubi in non-coding transcription at heterochromatic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadeghi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zofall and Grewal, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The emerging model, complementing the recently propose role of S2P in <italic>ste11</italic> induction is that promoter nucleosome H2Bubi positively regulates the Set1 deposition of H3K4 methylation and therefore is the primary signal of HDAC-dependent repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Upon transcriptional induction, the recruitment of SAGA-associated Ubp8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helmlinger et al., 2008</xref>) removes the ubiquitin mark, and concomitantly, the MAP kinase-dependent recruitment of Lsk1 deposits higher level of S2P. These two unrelated processes impede the Set1-dependent recruitment and/or activation of the SET3C HDAC, which provides access of the transcription machinery to the larger NDR that is formed. From the genetic analyses, as <italic>ste11</italic> is highly transcribed in the <italic>ubp8</italic> mutant, it appears that the S2P-dependent induction of transcription can bypass the requirement of de-ubiquitylation dependent on Ubp8.</p><p>Considering that H2B ubiquitylation was reported to act as a barrier to Ctk1 (the Lsk1 orthologue of budding yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wyce et al., 2007</xref>), we speculate that this additional layer of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) may also participate in the negative role of H2B-ub1 on <italic>ste11</italic> induction. Supporting this possibility, the level of Lsk1 was increased at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter when histone H2B ubiquitylation was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of nucleosome occupancy indicates that RSC affects the NDR of <italic>ste11</italic> very similarly to S2P and indeed both S2P and histone acetylation are required for high occupancy of RSC at this locus. Considering that RSC recognizes acetylated nucleosomes through its bromodomains-containing subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>), we propose that RSC functions as the ultimate player required to induce <italic>ste11</italic> transcription upon induction. Comparing the genome-wide nucleosome occupancy in the absence of either CTD S2P or <italic>rsc1</italic> reveals a significant overlap in the subset of genes whose NDR shrinks most, which constitutes an evidence for a mechanistic link between the phosphorylation of CTD serine 2 and the RSC complex.</p><p>Our data provide a mechanism by which promoter H2Bubi represses gene expression by opposing the recruitment of RSC. More specifically at the <italic>ste11</italic> locus, the balance between the negative effect of H2Bubi and the positive effect of RSC is critical for the timely induction of gametogenesis, which highlights the major role of chromatin regulation in cell fate. An important remaining issue is to understand why the H2Bubi-dependent H3K4 methylation only represses a subset of genes while this mark is a hallmark of most, if not all transcribed regions. Further work is in progress to address this point.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Fission yeast growth, gene targeting and mating were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamps et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Hermand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drogat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fersht et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers liked that this work is beginning to answer some of the questions left open in your original <italic>eLife</italic> paper. However, they also felt that you needed to go beyond investigating <italic>ste11</italic> as a model locus to broaden the general appeal of the work, by incorporating new MNase and ChIP-seq data sets. There are other examples where the H3K4me3 has been shown to be repressive because it recruits a complex containing HDAC activity and a PHD-containing subunit that reads the histone mark. For example, at PHO5, H3K4me3 is both positive during activation in S/G2/M and repressive during mitotic exit when the Rpd3L HDAC is recruited via two PHD-containing subunits. The step forward in your paper is the identification of RSC in the genetic screen and its placement at the end of the pathway identified in the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper. It could be argued, though, that reduced acetylation would be expected to impair recruitment of RSC. Given that one could question how big a step the present manuscript is, I would also support requesting the genome-wide datasets to broaden general appeal beyond <italic>ste11</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper by the Hermand lab uses LatA sensitivity screen to identify potential factors controlling gene expression together with RNAPol II Ser2 phosphorylation (S2P). H2B ubiquitin protease Ubp8 and some components of RSC and SWI/SNF complex were identified, which suggests potential link between H2B-ub1/chromatin remodeling and S2P pathway. In fission yeast gametogenesis, <italic>ste11</italic> is a key transcriptional master regulator. The authors focus on <italic>ste11</italic> transcription, as their previous recent paper showed that <italic>ste11</italic> is regulated by S2P and by Set1 K4me-repression. Here they show that <italic>ste11</italic> is repressed by H2Bub and activated by RSC. It is proposed that, via Set1-H3K4me3-HDAC pathway, H2Bub lowers RSC recruitment to ste11 promoter and regulates local nucleosomal occupancy and therefore transcription. These results may explain how H2B-ub at the promoter represses <italic>ste11</italic> transcription.</p><p>The overall findings are interesting with respect to the master regulatory <italic>ste11</italic> in fission yeast. Most interesting is that the typically activating chromatin modification, H3K4me3, is thought to be repressive via recruitment of HDAC complex and, in the new data here, resisting Rsc remodeling of promoter. In light of the previous paper, which made the basic observation of this pathway regulating <italic>ste11</italic>, there are two key questions for this to increase broad interest:</p><p>1) Are there general mechanisms to control gene expression in fission yeast, which can be addressed by genome wide studies in addition to specific analyses of <italic>ste11</italic>?</p><p>2) Is there an effect on gametogenesis itself, not only on expression of <italic>ste11</italic>?</p><p>Additional specific technical questions:</p><p>1) Since H2Bub and RSC are both regulating <italic>ste11</italic> expression in fission yeast, do RSC mutants affect H2Bub levels at <italic>ste11</italic> promoter?</p><p>2) KR mutagenesis is not perfect to mimic non-ubiquitylated lysine, which may cause side effects. Authors should test the rhp6 deletion strain in at least one key experiment, e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>3) Results: 'We conclude that H2B ubiquitylation at the promoter of <italic>ste11</italic> represses transcription by increasing H3K4-3me', There is no evidence to support &quot;by increasing H3K4-3me&quot;.</p><p>4) Authors conclude that H2Bub opposes RSC to remodel chromatin at <italic>ste11</italic> promoter via Set1-H3K4me3-SET3C HDAC pathway. So does KR mutant and rhp6 deletion affect H3K14ac at <italic>ste11</italic> promoter.</p><p>5) Quantification: no p-values – need to be added. How many biological repeats were performed for each experiment? I could not find this in Figure Legends.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and elsewhere, the ChIP signals should be normalized to histones, rather than input, since the authors are arguing that levels of histones are changing.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>: To make the statement that H2Bub is increased in ubp8 deleted strains, the blots should be quantified and the level of H2Bub needs to be normalized to H2B.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Since viability is low at 3 days (D), it is important to show viability test at timing of the transcription experiment in E.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>: Since nucleosome occupancy is increasing everywhere in the promoter with the mutations in Rsc, the question is how specific is this? What about the gene body? What about other genes and promoters?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript follows up on studies published earlier in <italic>eLife</italic> by the authors. In that study, they presented genome-wide nucleosome mapping data in fission yeast, <italic>S. pombe</italic>, showing that the absence of phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on serine 2 (S2) led to increased nucleosome occupancy and repositioning in the promoters of a subset of yeast genes. The affected promoters generally had a larger nucleosome depleted region (NDR) than the majority of genes, and included the <italic>ste11</italic> gene, which the authors previously found had a peak of S2 phosporylation (S2P) near the promoter during its activation. They showed that the peak of S2P at <italic>ste11</italic> and a second promoter reduced nucleosome occupancy and increased histone acetylation during gene activation. The take home message from these and other studies in this first manuscript was that during activation S2P counteracts repressive histone deacetylation by SET3C, which is targeted to promoters via its interaction with RNAP II-S5P/Set1-mediated H3K4 methylated histones. The dual presence of S2P and S5P was also found to block Set1 interaction with the CTD.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors focused on the <italic>ste11</italic> gene to investigate the role of other regulators in this pathway of promoter repression. Their examination was restricted to H2B monoubiquitylation (H2B-ub1) and the RSC nucleosome-remodeling complex, which were identified in a screen for mutants that relieved the drug sensitivity of lsk1, the fission yeast S2 CTD kinase. By analyzing loss of function mutations coupled with RNA analysis and ChIP, the authors report that an htb1KR mutation suppressed the transcription defect of a lsk1 deletion and that H2B-ub1 was localized to the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter under basal (repressed) conditions. As expected, its promoter occupancy positively correlated with the occupancy of H3K4me3. Consistent with a role in promoter repression through its trans-regulation of H3K4me3, an htb1-KR mutant showed reduced nucleosome occupancy in the ste11 promoter. In contrast, mutations that decreased RSC expression had the opposite phenotype – <italic>ste11</italic> transcription was reduced and nucleosome occupancy was increased in the promoter. The authors propose that H2B-ub1 represses transcription of <italic>ste11</italic> by opposing RSC-dependent nucleosome remodeling.</p><p>The phenocopying of S2A and H3K4me3 mutants with rsc and htb-K119R mutants, respectively, supports the placement of Rsc and H2B-ub1 in the pathway leading to <italic>ste11</italic> activation, thus extending the author's initial definition of this pathway and adding some interesting new information about the interplay between RNAP II phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling at promoters. However, gaps in the analysis remain and should be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>1) It is unclear why RSC mutants were identified in the screen for suppression of drug sensitivity of Lsk1. The authors should examine the effects of a rsc1∆ lsk1∆ double mutation on <italic>ste11</italic> transcription as they did for an htb-K119R lsk1∆ double mutation.</p><p>2) The authors used Arp9-TAP to perform ChIP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Because Arp9 is present in both RSC and SWI/SNF complexes, they should confirm that the results were due only to the recruitment of RSC. Similarly, the authors should show the effect of rsc1∆ as well as arp9∆ on H3 levels in the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter.</p><p>3) Nucleosome scanning should be included in the analysis of the phenotypes of the htb-K119R mutant.</p><p>4) An important missing gap in the pathway is the relationship of H2B-ub1 to S2-P; for example, does H2B-ub1 affect Lsk1 recruitment to the promoter and subsequent S2-P? Along the same lines, what is responsible for the deposition of H2B-ub1 at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter, for example what is the role of S5-P, and what is the status of Bre1 occupancy at the promoter?</p><p>5) Present evidence confirming that the htb1-KR mutant does not show HDAC recruitment to the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter and that H3ac levels remain high, consistent with H2Bub1 being upstream of H3K4me3 in the pathway.</p><p>6) This study would be significantly enhanced if the authors extended their MNase mapping experiments genome wide in rsc∆ mutants, and then comparing the results to those reported for an S2A mutant. This would broaden the authors' conclusions and complement their in-depth analysis of a single gene.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Previously, Materne et al. reported (<italic>eLife</italic>. 2015. 4:e09008) that phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD on Ser2 (S2P) controlled nucleosome dynamics in <italic>S. pombe</italic> at the promoters of 324 genes, including <italic>ste11</italic> that encodes a regulator of mating and gametogenesis. The authors also found that MAP kinase activation of latrunculin-sensitive kinase 1 (Lsk1) mediated the S2P modification. Mechanistically, the authors established that CTD S2P by Lsk1 counters CTD S5P-dependent recruitment of Set1-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which, in turn, recruits the SET3C histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex.</p><p>In the present submission, Materne et al. identified additional regulators of <italic>ste11</italic> expression, and cdc14 to a lesser extent, using a genetic screen for genes required to complete cytokinesis in the presence of lantruculin A (LatA), a disruptor of the actinomyosin ring. The screen identified SAGA-associated Ubp8, a ubiquitin (ub) protease that removes monoubiquitin from H2B, as well as shared and non-shared subunits of the chromatin remodelers RSC and SWI/SNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The identification of Ubp8 is not unexpected as it is well documented that H2Bub is required for trans-modification of H3 and promoter accumulation of H3K4me3, which recruits SET3C HDAC activity to <italic>ste11</italic>. Nevertheless, using ChIP (using a newly available monoclonal antibody) the authors convincingly show that the level of H2Bub1 at the <italic>ste11</italic> correlates with the presence of H3K4me3, and both histone marks decrease on activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with this, a H2BK119R mutation, which abolishes H2Bub1 and hence H3K4me3 at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), decreased H3 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and increased both basal and induced levels of ste11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Loss of SWI/SNF and RSC subunits demonstrated that RSC, but not SWI/SNF, is required for nucleosome depletion of the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>) and its activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-F</xref>). As shown by ChIP, RSC is recruited specifically to the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter as opposed to the gene body, and this recruitment increases when H2Bub1 is abolished by H2BK119R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). Conversely, RSC recruitment is decreased in the absence of H3K14ac (H3K14R mutant) and lsk1∆ cells, which lack S2P that is needed to inhibit H2B ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Genetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and RT-Q-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, evidence is also presented indicating that Cdc14 is a downstream target of Lsk1 and thus requires S2P as well as the remodelers Rsc and SWI/SNF for activation.</p><p>The manuscript is written very well and understandably. In addition, all of the experiments are executed well and the data support the authors' conclusions and model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereby H2Bub1, by increasing H3K4me3, recruits the SET3C HDAC and thus antagonizes recruitment of RSC and activation of <italic>ste11</italic>. The manuscript clearly builds on their previous paper and is suitable for publication in as an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>: The conclusion that &quot;high promoter occupancy of Rsc1-TAP required both H3 K14 acetylation and the S2 kinase Lsk1&quot; is unsupported. ChIP only reports relative occupancy and there is a two-fold decrease in RSC occupancy in the H3K14R and isk1delta strains. The wording should be changed to something to the effect of the mutants halved the occupancy of RSC or significantly decreased occupancy. The latter raises the point of whether the reduction in occupancy in both panels is statistically significant.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: &quot;However, in the absence of Set1, most genes are upregulated, suggesting a predominant role in repression.&quot; To the best of my knowledge, this is incorrect. In budding yeast, Boa et al. (Yeast. 2003. 20, 827) reported that transcript levels of most genes (80%) were downregulated in the absence of Set1 and H3K4 methylation. In contrast, Set1 and H3K4 methylation does silence the rDNA (Briggs et al. 2001 Gene Dev 15, 3286). The statement should be justified or corrected and referenced appropriately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13500.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) Are there general mechanisms to control gene expression in fission yeast, which can be addressed by genome wide studies in addition to specific analyses of ste11?</p><p>We have addressed the question by analysing the genome wide effect of the deletion of rsc1, a non-essential subunit of RSC, on nucleosome positioning, and by comparing it with the CTD S2A mutant. We decided to perform an MNase-Seq experiment, which is time consuming but provides a high resolution map of nucleosome. A new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) with 5 panels is now presented and the corresponding text reads as follows:</p><p>“In order to test if the proposed connection between the phosphorylation of serine 2 within the CTD and the RSC remodeling complex could be expanded to more genes, we performed genome-wide mapping of nucleosome position by MNase-Seq in the rsc1 deletion mutant. […] These data support a genome-wide mechanistic connection between CTD phosphorylation on serine 2 and remodeling by the RSC complex.”</p><p>To answer the question of the referee, we can therefore conclude that the mechanism we describe in details in the case of <italic>ste11</italic> can likely be extended to a subset of genes (82 when considering the most stringent analyses) in the conditions we have tested (growth in standard conditions).</p><p><italic>2) Is there an effect on gametogenesis itself, not only on expression of ste11?</italic> The referee asks the important question of the biological relevance of our analyses. We have added a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> showing that similarly to the CTD S2A mutant, an rsc1 mutant also displays a prominent defect during gametogenesis while a snf22 mutant (encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex) does not. Considering that the deletion of rsc1 affects <italic>ste11</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) while the deletion of snf22 does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the molecular data are nicely supported by the physiological data. The text was modified as follows:</p><p>“The absence of either rsc1 or arp9 clearly affected the expression of <italic>ste11</italic> while snf22 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), pointing to a more prominent role of RSC for <italic>ste11</italic> expression, which was confirmed by a gametogenesis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p><p>Additional specific technical questions:</p><p>1) Since H2Bub and RSC are both regulating ste11 expression in fission yeast, do RSC mutants affect H2Bub levels at ste11 promoter?</p><p>In order to answer that question, we have performed a ChIP experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We have chipped H2Bubi (normalized on a H2B ChIP) in a wild type and a rsc1 deleted strain. The absence of rsc1 does not seem to affect the level of ubiquitylation at the promoter of <italic>ste11</italic> but leads to a strong decrease of ubiquitylation in the 3’ region. This is not surprising considering that <italic>ste11</italic> transcription is strongly impeded in the absence of Rsc1 as judged by Q-RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The text was modified as follows:</p><p>“The deletion of rsc1 did not affect the level of H2B ubiquitylation nearby the ste11 promoter but led to a decrease of the level of this modification in the transcribed region, most likely as a consequence of decreased transcription when Rsc1 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).”</p><p>2) KR mutagenesis is not perfect to mimic non-ubiquitylated lysine, which may cause side effect. Authors should test the rhp6 deletion strain in at least one key experiment, e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>We agree with the referee that the KR is not a perfect mimic of the non-ubiquitylated lysine. The referee may have missed that we had already performed the experiment he requested as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> where the effect of the KR mutant was compared to a deletion of rhp6. We have also added a new experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> where the level an acetylation on histone H3 lysine 14 is compared in a wild type strain, the KR mutant and the rhp6 deletion. In both experiments, the deletion of rhp6 and the KR mutant resulted in similar defects. We are therefore confident that in the case we are studying, the KR mutant behaves as a good mimic of the non-ubiquitylated state (see also point 4 below).</p><p>3) Results: 'We conclude that H2B ubiquitylation at the promoter of ste11 represses transcription by increasing H3K4-3me', There is no evidence to support &quot;by increasing H3K4-3me&quot;.</p><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> show a clear dependency of H3K4 methylation to H2B ubiquitylation, confirming the model generally admitted in the literature. However, we agree that the sentence stated by the referee is overstating the data. We have therefore changed it to:</p><p>“We conclude that H2B ubiquitylation at the promoter of <italic>ste11</italic> correlates with repressed transcription and high level of H3K4me3, which in turn may favour histone deactetylation by the SET3C complex.”</p><p>4) Authors conclude that H2Bub opposes RSC to remodel chromatin at ste11 promoter via Set1-H3K4me3-SET3C HDAC pathway. So does KR mutant and rhp6 deletion affect H3K14ac at ste11 promoter.</p><p>As mentioned above (point 2), we have tested the issue raised by the referee by chipping the K14 acetylated histone H3 (normalized on total H3) in the strains lacking H2B ubiquitylation, which results an elevated acetylation at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter. The text was modified as follows:</p><p>“Moreover, histone H3 acetylation was increased at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter when H2B ubiquitylation was abolished in either the htb1-K119R or the rhp6 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).”</p><p>5) Quantification: no p-values – need to be added. How many biological repeats were performed for each experiment? I could not find this in Figure Legends.</p><p>The number of replicates that was previously indicated in the Materials and methods is now mentioned for each experiment in the figures legend, as requested by the referee.</p><p>When a statistical analysis was performed as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> (right panel), the test used is indicated in the figure legend with the corresponding p-value.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and elsewhere, the ChIP signals should be normalized to histones, rather than input, since the authors are arguing that levels of histones are changing.</p><p>In all experiments where the occupancy of modified histones was assessed, the signal was indeed normalized to the total corresponding histone. This is now more clearly indicated in the y-axis of the corresponding graphs.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>: to make the statement that H2Bub is increased in ubp8 deleted strains, the blots should be quantified and the level of H2Bub needs to be normalized to H2B.</p><p>We agree with the referee. The scanned blots were quantified in ImageJ and the level of H2Bubi was normalized to H2B with the wild type set as 1.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Since viability is low at 3 days (D), it is important to show viability test at timing of the transcription experiment in E.</p><p>The timing of these experiments is very different. As the snf21 gene is essential, it was important to show that the switch-off system we used is sufficiently efficient to ultimately mimic a deletion. Indeed, the strain does not sustain growth when the promoter is turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>In the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref>, the timing is very short (three hours) in order to avoid as much as possible secondary effects. Within this time scale, corresponding to roughly one cell cycle, we have not noticed any effect on cell number. To us, this is not surprising as the depletion of snf21 is not yet complete and effect of cellular growth likely take longer to be apparent. We decided to use this time scale to ensure that the effects we observed are likely not a secondary consequence of a global misregulation of nucleosome positioning.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>: Since nucleosome occupancy is increasing everywhere in the promoter with the mutations in Rsc, the question is how specific is this? What about the gene body? What about other genes and promoters?</p><p>The nucleosome scanning experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> indeed focuses on the promoter region of <italic>ste11</italic>. It is difficult to extend it further as the data presented already required more than 30 primers. However, the ChIP experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> covers the entire locus (at a lower resolution) and clearly demonstrates that the occupancy effect occurs at the promoter and not on the gene body. Regarding other genes and promoters, we have now performed a genome-wide analysis of occupancy as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We hope that these comments answer the issues raised by this referee and we thank him for his deep analysis of our work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) It is unclear why RSC mutants were identified in the screen for suppression of drug sensitivity of Lsk1. The authors should examine the effects of a rsc1∆ lsk1∆ double mutation on ste11 transcription as they did for an htb-K119R lsk1∆ double mutation.</p><p>The referee is surprised that subunits of RSC were identified in the latA screen presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. We would like to highlight that, contrary to what the referee wrote, this is not a screen for suppression of drug sensitivity but rather a screen for sensitivity to latA. The logic of the screen is that the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 (<underline>l</underline>atrunculin <underline>s</underline>ensitive <underline>k</underline>inase) was shown to be sensitive to latA, most likely because the expression of one or several genes required for survival in the presence of the drug are affected. Our data support that the cdc14 gene encodes such a target gene. If Lsk1 and RSC are required in the same pathway to enforce cdc14 expression, it is not surprising to us that subunits of RSC were identified in the screen, as their deletion results in lower gene transcription. In the case of cdc14, contrary to <italic>ste11</italic>, both RSC and SWI-SNF seem to be required for proper expression.</p><p>Regarding the experiment proposed by the referee, namely to examine the effect of a double rsc1 lsk1 mutant, the combined deletion of these two genes is synthetic lethal as reported in our previous work (Materne et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). Therefore, the experiment cannot be performed.</p><p>2) The authors used Arp9-TAP to perform ChIP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Because Arp9 is present in both RSC and SWI/SNF complexes, they should confirm that the results were due only to the recruitment of RSC. Similarly, the authors should show the effect of rsc1∆ as well as arp9∆ on H3 levels in the ste11 promoter.</p><p>While the work was in progress, we noticed that the Rsc1 protein was difficult to Chip, resulting in less reproducible results. We therefore had to increase the timing of crosslinking as indicated in the Materials and methods. The Arp9 protein was easier to work with. As pointed by the referee, this raised the question of the specificity. Below is a list of the evidences supporting a specific role of RSC at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: the effect of the deletion mutants of rsc1, snf22 and arp9 on <italic>ste11</italic> expression are presented, which points to a specificity of RSC</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: the transcriptional repression of the expression which snf21, which encodes the catalytic subunit of RSC, is sufficient to decrease <italic>ste11</italic> expression.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>: the deletion of rsc1, but not snf22 leads to a gametogenesis defect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>: the SWI-SNF specific subunit, Snf22, does not Chip at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter, while Rsc1 and Arp9 does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C-D</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we have performed a new experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), showing that depletion of Snf21rapidly results in higher H3 level at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter.</p><p>We hope that, taken together, these data convince the referee of a specific role of RSC at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter.</p><p>3) Nucleosome scanning should be included in the analysis of the phenotypes of the htb-K119R mutant.</p><p>We have performed the requested experiment, which is difficult in this case due to the slow growth of the mutant. This has technical implications as the time required to digest the cell with zymolyase is critical and affected by many parameters, including the physiological state of the cell. The result is presented below and shows that the H2B K119R mutant behaves very similarly to a wild type, or could even have lower occupancy.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13500.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13500.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13500.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13500-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>4) An important missing gap in the pathway is the relationship of H2B-ub1 to S2-P; for example, does H2B-ub1 affect Lsk1 recruitment to the promoter and subsequent S2-P? Along the same lines, what is responsible for the deposition of H2B-ub1 at the ste11 promoter, for example what is the role of S5-P, and what is the status of Bre1 occupancy at the promoter?</p><p>The referee points to an important issue, namely the relationship of H2Bubi to S2P. Indeed, previous work from the Berger lab has revealed that H2Bubi acts as a barrier to the S2 kinase nucleosomal recruitment, which we have mentioned in the Discussion. In order to test the effect of H2Bubi on Lsk1 recruitment, we have performed a ChIP experiment of Lsk1 in a wild type and a H2B K119R strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The result indicates that the absence of ubiquitylation on H2B correlates with higher level of Lsk1 at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter, which supports the model previously reported. The text was modified as follows:</p><p>“Considering that H2B ubiquitylation was reported to act as a barrier to Ctk1 (the Lsk1 orthologue of budding yeast) (Wyce et al., 2007), we speculate that this additional layer of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) may also participate in the negative role of H2B-ub1 on <italic>ste11</italic> induction.Supporting this possibility, the level of Lsk1 was increased at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter when histone H2B ubiquitylation was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).”</p><p>The referee then asks additional questions regarding the regulation (deposition, status of Bre1) of H2Bubi. Some aspects have been largely covered over the years by previous studies from the Tanny, Gould, Ekwall, Grewal, Winston and Allis laboratories, leading to a pretty good description of the pathway leading the H2B ubiquitylation in fission yeast. In addition, we believe that these experiments are beyond the scope of the current work and message. Moreover, they would require several months of work. For example, we have no experience with Bre1 ChIP and preliminary set up for these type of experiments is always time consuming.</p><p>5) Present evidence confirming that the htb1-KR mutant does not show HDAC recruitment to the ste11 promoter and that H3ac levels remain high, consistent with H2Bub1 being upstream of H3K4me3 in the pathway.</p><p>We present a new experiment where we have tested the issue raised by the referee by chipping the acetylated K14 histone H3 (normalized on total H3) in the strains lacking H2B ubiquitylation, which results an elevated acetylation at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter. This constitutes an evidence that H2B-ubi is upstream of the repressive deacetylation occurring at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter. The text was modified as follows:</p><p>“Moreover, histone H3 acetylation was increased at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter when H2B ubiquitylation was abolished in either the htb1-K119R or the rhp6 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) This study would be significantly enhanced if the authors extended their MNase mapping experiments genome wide in rsc∆ mutants, and then comparing the results to those reported for an S2A mutant. This would broaden the authors' conclusions and complement their in-depth analysis of a single gene.</italic> We have responded to this request by analysing the genome wide effect of the deletion of Rsc1, a non essential subunit of RSC, on nucleosome positioning, and by comparing it with the CTD S2A mutant. A new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) with 5 panels is now presented and the corresponding text reads as follows:</p><p>“In order to test if the proposed connection between the phosphorylation of serine 2 within the CTD and the RSC remodeling complex could be expanded to more genes, we performed genome-wide mapping of nucleosome position by MNase-Seq in the rsc1 deletion mutant. […] These data support a genome-wide mechanistic connection between CTD phosphorylation on serine 2 and remodeling by the RSC complex.”</p><p>This new large-scale analysis constitutes an evidence that the mechanism we describe in details in the case of <italic>ste11</italic> can be extended to a subset of genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>: The conclusion that &quot;high promoter occupancy of Rsc1-TAP required both H3 K14 acetylation and the S2 kinase Lsk1&quot; is unsupported. ChIP only reports relative occupancy and there is a two-fold decrease in RSC occupancy in the H3K14R and isk1</italic>∆ <italic>strains. The wording should be changed to something to the effect of the mutants halved the occupancy of RSC or significantly decreased occupancy. The latter raises the point of whether the reduction in occupancy in both panels is statistically significant.</italic> </p><p>The sentence has been changed to:</p><p>“Supportive of this possibility, the abolition of either H3K14 acetylation or Lsk1 halved the occupancy of Rsc1-TAP at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter.”</p><p>To determine whether the decreased Rsc1-TAP enrichment was statistically significant, the difference in the means of enrichment between the ChIP peak in the wild type and the tested strains was estimated using t-test, assuming unequal variances between samples (Welch's t- test). p-value &lt; 0.05 indicated by *, n.s.: non-significant. This is added to the legend.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph: &quot;However, in the absence of Set1, most genes are upregulated, suggesting a predominant role in repression.&quot; To the best of my knowledge, this is incorrect. In budding yeast, Boa et al. (Yeast. 2003. 20, 827) reported that transcript levels of most genes (80%) were downregulated in the absence of Set1 and H3K4 methylation. In contrast, Set1 and H3K4 methylation does silence the rDNA (Briggs et al. 2001 Gene Dev 15, 3286). The statement should be justified or corrected and referenced appropriately.</p><p>The referee cites works done in budding yeast. In fission yeast, to our knowledge, two studies have analysed the effect of set1 deletion on gene expression genome-wide (Tanny et al. Genes Dev. 2007 Apr 1;21(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>):835-47) and Lorenz et al. <italic>eLife</italic>. 2014 Dec 15;3:e04506). They both revealed a predominantly repressive role of Set1.</p><p>In order to avoid any ambiguity, we have added “in fission yeast” in the sentence and also added the proper reference.</p><p>In addition, we now mention two works done in budding yeast that supports a gene-specific repressive role of Set1.</p><p>In budding yeast, Set1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase and plays a repressive role on PHO5, PHO84 and GAL1 expression, suggesting that H3K4me creates a repressive chromatin configuration (Carvin and Kladde, 2004; Wang et al., 2011)</p></body></sub-article></article>
