important roles in normal physiology and the pathogenesis of multiple disease states including cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and release remain unknown. We designed artificially barcoded, exosomal microRNAs (bEXOmiRs) to monitor extracellular vesicle release quantitatively using deep sequencing. We then expressed distinct pairs of CRISPR guide RNAs and bEXOmiRs, enabling identification of genes influencing bEXOmiR secretion from Cas9-edited cells. This approach uncovered genes with unrecognized roles in multivesicular endosome exocytosis, including critical roles for Wnt signaling in extracellular vesicle release regulation. Coupling bEXOmiR reporter analysis with CRISPR-Cas9 screening provides a powerful and unbiased means to study extracellular vesicle biology and for the first time, to associate a nucleic acid tag with individual membrane vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>genome wide screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIDDK 37332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HD084069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassik</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HG000044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgens</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A screen using artificially barcoded, exosomal microRNAs, paired with CRISPR guide RNAs, helped identify new players in multivesicular endosome exocytosis and a role for Wnt signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intercellular communication mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) has recently attracted significant attention, and may contribute to diverse physiological processes including immune regulation and cancer metastasis. EVs are comprised of two major classes based upon their mechanism of biogenesis: microvesicles are shed directly from the plasma membrane, while exosomes are formed by intra-lumenal budding during multi-vesicular endosome (MVE) biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). EVs contain a wide range of molecules, including antigens, signaling proteins, lipids, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that appear to induce significant biological changes in recipient cells. EV miRNAs released by both tumor and mesenchymal cells are of particular interest, as they may play important roles in metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2016</xref>). EV miRNAs secreted by hypothalamic stem cells may regulate aging in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, EVs have attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential use in diagnostics and therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2016</xref>). Despite their importance, how miRNAs are specifically packaged and released via the EV pathway is poorly understood. The biological significance of EVs also remains controversial, in part due to a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate their formation and release. Here we describe the development of a novel CRISPR screening platform using artificially barcoded miRNAs (bEXOmiRs) that we applied systematically to identify genes involved in EV biology. We show that EV release is regulated tightly by Glycogen Synthase Kinase three and Wnt signaling, and report new players in MVE exocytosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41460.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development and assessment of bEXOmiRs as high-throughput reporters of EV release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, Generic structure of bEXOmiRs before and after processing. bEXOmiRs contain a random 15 nucleotide (nt) (base-paired) sequence followed by a constant exosome-targeting motif (GGAGGAG, âEXO motifâ).

Barcode sequences were designed to retain the base pairing characteristics of endogenous miRNA stem regions. After intracellular processing, mature bEXOmiRs would be expected to contain the 15 nt barcode followed by GGAGGAG (22 nt total).</p><p>Upon expression of a few trial lentiviruses encoding a bEXOmiR downstream of a GFP open-reading frame in HEK293T cells, bEXOmiR RNAs were detected in EV fractions by RT-PCR, together with established EV protein markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>). The EV-associated, amplified bEXOmiR sequences were derived from an RNA source since control reactions lacking either the first-strand cDNA synthesis primer or reverse transcriptase failed to yield a product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>). bEXOmiRs in isolated EVs were protected significantly from RNase digestion only in the absence of nonionic detergent, and they floated in a sucrose density gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>), consistent with their being membrane-enclosed. The remaining, RNase-resistant bEXOmiRs are likely to be protected by RNA binding proteins. Moreover, treatment with Bafilomycin A1, which enhances EV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miao et al., 2015</xref>), greatly increased the abundance of both total EV protein markers and bEXOmiR reporters in isolated EV fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F,G</xref>). bEXOmiR expression did not change the number or size of CD63-positive structures in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostrowski et al., 2010</xref>), Rab27A depletion resulted in aÂ ~Â 50% reduction of a bEXOmiR reporter in these fractions from HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and see below for K562 cells). Thus, bEXOmiRs can be expressed, processed and exported from cells in EVs using previously characterized pathways.</p><p>Next, we designed an initial test library comprised of 5000 different bEXOmiRs. The original bEXOmiR design included miR-30 context sequences flanking the hairpin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Processing of these sequences in miR-30 relies on a structural bulge created by a single base pair mismatch at the base of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). Although our original design did not include this feature, no significant differences were observed in the EV representation of bEXOmiRs with or without the A-C mismatch; we nevertheless retained this motif to be consistent with previous artificial shRNA designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Comparison of bEXOmiR abundance in two replicate EV analyses showed excellent concordance (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); this was also true when comparing two independent or replicate screens as described below (see below Figure 3A, B).</p><p>The overall representation of bEXOmiRs in EV fractions suggested that intrinsic differences in barcode sequences to some extent, influenced exosomal targeting, as seen for other miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Treiber et al., 2017</xref>). Some bEXOmiRs were very efficiently detected in EVs while others were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This does not reflect differences in synthesis, because a comparison of EV and cellular bEXOmiR levels showed very poor correlation with probability of release (see Figure 3 C below). An initial search for sorting motifs within barcode sequences using the MEME algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>) was unsuccessful. Despite the limitation of some preferential targeting of individual barcodes, these data demonstrate that bEXOmiRs are suitable reporters for high-throughput monitoring of EV release in a pooled format. In addition, certain RNA sequences dominated the sequencing analyses, compromising sequencing depth. Such bEXOmiR outliers were excluded from subsequent screens, and we also size fractionated RNAs and introduced a hairpin oligonucleotide in our sequencing library preparation to remove a major contaminant that dominated sequencing runs. These measures improved the overall sequencing depth significantly enough to permit us to complete a genome-wide screen using suspension grown cell cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A CRISPR/Cas9 screen using bEXOmiRs</title><p>We next used bEXOmiRs in a pooled, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated screening protocol to monitor EV release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Briefly, unique CRISPR single guide (sg)RNAs linked by synthesis with distinct bEXOmiRs were co-expressed; we then determined how knockout of every gene influenced EV release by comparing bEXOmiR barcode abundance in EV fractions isolated from wild type compared with Cas9-edited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our hope was that the use of 10 CRISPR sgRNAs per gene, coupled with 10 different barcodes (one per sgRNA) would overcome any limitation of any individual bEXOmiR barcode EV packaging bias, relative efficiencies of different sgRNAs at disrupting gene function, or the real possibility that an sgRNA would decrease a particular bEXOmiRâs abundance. In this scenario, gene deletions that decrease extracellular bEXOmiR abundance are considered activators of EV production in WT conditions; in contrast, deletions that increase extracellular bEXOmiR abundance are considered as suppressors of this process.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41460.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen using bEXOmiRs enables systematic interrogation of EV biology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting key steps of the screen performed in this study. Oligonucleotides encoding sgRNA-bEXOmiR pairs were designed computationally and then synthesized using solid-phase technology. Next, oligonucleotides were pool-cloned (1) into a Lentivirus vector that drives expression of both sgRNA and bEXOmiR under U6 and EF1Î± promoters, respectively. WT and Cas9-positive K562 cells were then infected at low MOI (2), such that after infection and selection, each cell expresses only a single sgRNA-bEXOmiR pair (3). This approach enables identification and quantification of both EVs and their respective cell of origin via unique molecular identifiers: barcodes and sgRNAs respectively. sgRNA-bEXOmiR-expressing cells were then grown for 48 hr before collection of culture supernatants from which EVs were purified (4). Finally, barcode abundance was measured, comparing WT and Cas9-expressing cells, by deep sequencing from EV-extracted RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, knockout of any ESCRT-related component consistently increased bEXOmiR abundance in EVs, while knockout of SMPD3 had the opposite phenotype, as previously reported in assays monitoring release of endogenous miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kosaka et al., 2010</xref>). This may reflect distinct EV release pathways. It is also critical to note that knockout of key components specific to one route may artificially increase flux through the other pathway.</p><p>Altogether, this analysis (nine duplicated sub-library screens) requiredÂ &gt;100 liters of cell culture supernatants forÂ EV preparations and associated, large-scale miRNA sequencing runs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> shows a comparison of total bEXOmiR abundance in EV analyses from two replicate screens that similar to our test bEXOmiR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), also showed excellent concordance (R<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.95).

To explore the impact of such heterogeneity on overall screen outcomes, we tested the ability of different bEXOmiRs to function when paired with the same individual sgRNAs used to target the 100 top hits identified in our initial MMM screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although some differences were observed in terms of our ability to detect various players in screens run with different bEXOmiRs/gRNA pairs, we were nevertheless able to re-confirm the findings obtained in the initial screen. Unexpectedly, YKT6, which appeared as a suppressor in the initial screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), was uncovered as a slight activator instead; this may be related to differences in the bEXOmiRs associated with this gene in the two separate analyses. Indeed, YKT6 appears to be required for EV-dependent Wnt release along with STX1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 2012</xref>), a close homologue of STX1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is important to note that the phenotype observed relies on the efficiencies of both sgRNAs and their paired, bEXOmiRs: some guides work better than others, and the same applies for bEXOmiRs. This limitation highlights the importance of orthogonal hit-validation experiments. Usually 2â3 guide-bEXOmiR associations supported each hit, and in most cases more than 90% of bEXOmiRs were recovered upon EV fraction sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hit validation</title><p>The importance of ARHGEF18 in EV biogenesis was confirmed using an orthogonal, Nanostring method to profile the presence of 74 endogenous miRNAs in EVs produced by polyclonal human K562 cell lines subjected to CRISPR knockout of either SMPD3 or ARHGEF18 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Canonical Wnt signaling requires binding to the seven transmembrane spanning, Frizzled receptor and LRP co-receptors, to trigger a pathway that leads to the translocation of Î²-Catenin to the nucleus where it serves as a transcriptional co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). A number of Wnt-signaling modulators appeared among the hits as EV biogenesis regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Knockout of these components decreased EV recovery, suggesting that Wnt signaling enhances EV release under the conditions of cell growth used in our screen.

According to this scenario, stabilization of these transcriptional regulators upon GSK3 inhibition would be expected to upregulate RAB27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ploper and De Robertis, 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, we observedÂ ~50% reduction of RAB27A mRNA levels upon GSK3 inhibition in K562 cells under the conditions employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); this was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in RAB27A protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data likely explain the reduction of EV release observed upon CHIR99021 treatment, and suggest that in K562 cells, GSK3 influences RAB27 transcription in an unexpected way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that in our hands, melanosome-producing RPE cells behaved differently than K562 cells upon CHIR99021 treatment: they displayed increased EV production and did not show a decrease in RAB27A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that cell type-specific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>) contribute to differences in GSK3-mediated EV generation and highlight the complexity of Wnt-mediated signaling and GSK3 regulation in cells.</p><p>Why did our screen indicate that Wnt is an activator rather than a suppressor of EV release? The validation experiments were done under starvation conditions to maximize the signalâthis will have additional impacts on endo-lysosomal gene regulation by TFEB and MITF regulators.Â How RAB27 gene expression is regulated upon GSK3 inhibition will be interesting to investigate in the future.</p><p>Although K562 cells have been reported to express both Wnts and Frizzled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sercan et al., 2010</xref>), we did not see a significant change in EV levels upon blocking Wnt secretion with the Wnt palmitoylation inhibitor (C59) in our parental cell cultures. This suggests that under the conditions of the screen (but not the conditions of the validation testing), knockout of various components reflected protein roles that areÂ independent of Wnt signaling processes. Most importantly, when we tested EV release in wild type parental cells, we detected a very strong role for the GSK3 kinase in EV release regulation. Indeed, Bafilomycin A1 treatment, that activates EV release, actually inhibits Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruciat et al., 2010</xref>).Â It is very satisfying that the very EV pathway that may generate functional Wnt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>) is in fact directly regulated by Wnt signaling via an important and yet to be characterized feedback mechanism. Altogether, complex crosstalk between signaling pathways may influence EV secretion in ways that will be important to define in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite recent advances in EV research, how EV generation is regulated at the molecular level is poorly understood. We have used artificially barcoded miRNAs as surrogate reporters of EV release to enable genome-wide dissection of EV biology. We validated a number of previously reported players and discovered many new ones, including a gene cluster devoted to cortical actin dynamics and a role for ARHGEF18 in MVE exocytosis of EV-associated miRNAs. Wnt signaling- and trafficking-related genes were also prominently represented in the functional network analysis; we found that Wnt-mediated inactivation of GSK3 tightly regulates EV release by down-regulating RAB27 mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, EV biogenesis and release appear to be part of a complex feedback mechanism that regulates Wnt signaling in cells. Finally, our screen also uncovered genes involved in intracellular trafficking and processing of miRNAs. Indeed, bEXOmiR technology can also be leveraged to study miRNA biogenesis, processing and binding to RNA-binding proteins. This genome-wide screen has provided significant leads to aid in our understanding of the molecular basis of EV generation and regulation in cells and tissues.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562</td><td valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0004">CVCL_0004</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 Cas9+</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 27018887</td><td valign="bottom"/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 ARHGEF18 KO #5</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 ARHGEF18 KO #7</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 BAIAP3 KO #8</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 NKD2 KO #3</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 PPP1R1C KO #4</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 PPP1R14D KO #1</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 RAB27A KO #1</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 RHOV KO #10</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 SMPD3 KO #9</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>K562 TREM1 KO #9</td><td valign="bottom">this paper</td><td/><td>Progenitor: K562 Cas9+</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk/">https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk/</ext-link></td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">mouse monoclonal anti-a-Tubulin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>T5168</td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">rabbit polyclonal anti-ARHGEF18</td><td valign="bottom">GeneTex</td><td>GTX102223;

After centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min, protein concentrations were measured in the cleared lysates. Equal amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. EV final pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading dye (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 6% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue), heated briefly at 95Â°C and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose and antibody incubation, blots were detected with ECL western blotting detection substrate or visualized using LI-COR Odyssey Imaging System. Isolation of cytosolic fractions from cell post-nuclear supernatants was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu and Pfeffer, 2013</xref>). For optimal detection of EV fraction markers (such as CD81), no reducing agent was added to the SDS-PAGE loading dye.

After final ultracentrifugation, pelleted EVs were resuspended in PBS and analyzed on a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical) using a sCMOS camera. Three, 60 s 25 Hz movies were taken per sample. Data were analyzed using NTA 3.1 software (Malvern Panalytical).</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis of LAMP1--K562 cells were treated with either DMSO or CHIR99021. After 24 h cells were harvested and washed before fixation in 2%Â paraformaldehyde, permeabilization and staining with anti-LAMP1 and Alexa Fluor 488 goat antiâmouse antibodies (Invitrogen).

After 24 hr, cells containing fluorescent siRNAs were imaged on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti) equipped with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera (ANDOR iXon<sup>EM</sup>+), an Apo TIRF 100X/1.49 oil DIC objective, and Nikon Perfect Focus System. Time lapse videos were acquired at 3 Hz with Nikon NIS Elements software. All imaging experiments were performed at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Fusion events for each cell were detected and quantified as sudden increases in fluorescence above the plasma membrane background as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verweij et al., 2018</xref>). At least 20 cells were imaged per condition in two independent experiments.</p><p>bEXOmiR design--Initial development of bEXOmiRs was based on previous artificial shRNAs designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) incorporating endogenous sequences derived from the putative exosomal microRNA hsa-miR-601. Specifically, a seven nt motif (GGAGGAG, âEXO motifâ) together with a contiguous loop sequence (both derived from hsa-miR-601) were placed adjacent to a 15 nt random sequence (barcode) with perfect base complementarity, positioned at the base of the miRNA stem region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The resulting precursor hairpin was flanked by hsa-miR-30a context sequences. For the initial bEXOmiR test library, a custom C-script was written to design barcode sequences based upon specific rules: 40â60% GC content, minimum Hamming distance of 4 or more between any two barcodes, and absence of homopolymers (AAAA, UUUU, CCCC, etc.) and restriction enzyme cut sites used for cloning purposes. With this strategy, 2500 bEXOmiRs were designed, and two versions of each were used, one with an additional A-C mismatch added to ensure proper primary-miR processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) for a total of 5000 bEXOmiRs.</p><p>To generateÂ ~25,000 bEXOmiRs used in the MMM screen sublibrary, 15 base-pair barcodes were similarly generated with a minimum Hamming distance of four, moderate GC content (40â60%), and absence of homopolyers (GGGG, AAAA etc) and restriction sites. The first base-pair was altered to create a mismatch at the base of the hairpin to ensure proper processing (either A-C, T-C, G-A, or C-A). For subsequent sublibraries, thisÂ ~25,000 bEXOmiR set was filtered for either bEXOmiRs that failed to be detected in WT exosome samples (counts less than 10) or were detected at such high representation in WT exosomes as to interfere with sequencing depth (countÂ &gt;10,000). Additional barcodes were randomly generated as above for larger libraries.</p><p>Stem-loop RT-PCR and qRT-PCR--For bEXOmiR and endogenous miRNA detection in cellular or EV fractions, RNA was extracted from intact HEK293T or K562 cells, or isolated EVs using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer. EV RNAs (200â500 ng) were reverse transcribed into cDNA using Stem-Loop primers and SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) according to a pulsed RT protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Varkonyi-Gasic and Hellens, 2011</xref>). Stem-loop RT primers are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. qRT-PCR experiments used a qPCR mix recipe: 1X Phusion HF buffer (NEB), 200 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X SYBR green I (Invitrogen), HighFidelity DNA Polymerase (M0530S, NEB), and 100 nM each primer. The following programs were used: (98Â°C, 3â, then 40X cycles of 98Â°C 15 s, 60Â°C 20 s, 72Â°C 3 s). A synthetic spike-in RT RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was added to each EV sample to control for variability in the starting material and the downstream RNA isolation step. The sequences of PCR primers are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. qPCR was run in a BioRad CFX96 Real-Time System. PCR amplification products were analyzed on 4% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. For qPCR experiments related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, total cell RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT)20 primers and SuperScript III FirstStrand Synthesis System (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad) using gene-specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and run in a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transcript levels relative to HPRT1 were calculated using the âCt method.</p><p>RNase protection assay--K562 cells expressing bEXOmiRs were grown for 24 hr in RPMI and EVs were isolated from conditioned media. EVs were then treated with RNase A (10 Âµg/ml in PBS)Â±Triton X-100 (0.25%), or with PBS alone, for 30 min at room temperature. RNase inhibitor (150 U/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was then added and EV-RNA isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies).</p><p>Construction of sgRNA-bEXOmiR plasmid libraries--Oligonucleotides encoding sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgens et al., 2017</xref>) coupled to individual bEXOmiRs were synthesized as pooled libraries (Agilent). BlpI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced between sgRNA and bEXOmiR sequences. Focused sublibraries were PCR-amplified with primer sequences common to each sublibrary, digested with BstXI and MfeI enzymes, ligated into BstXI/EcoRI-digested pMCB306 vector, and transformed into electro-competent cells (Lucigen). Plasmid DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN kit. Pooled plasmids were then digested with BlpI and EcoRI, and an expression cassette encoding a puromycin-resistance gene and a GFP-ORF separated by a T2A sequence under EF-1 alpha promoter, cut with the same restriction enzyme pair, was inserted between sgRNA and bEXOmiR sequences. This generated nine focused sublibraries (<italic>48,</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which together containedÂ ~210,000 elements targetingÂ ~20,000 genes withÂ ~13,000 non-targeting and safe-targeting controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgens et al., 2017</xref>); 10 sgRNA per gene, each sgRNA associated to a unique bEXOmiR).</p><p>Lentivirus production and cell infection--Lentivirus production and infection were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kampmann et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with bEXOmiR libraries or individual sgRNA vectors and third generation packaging plasmids (pVSV-G, pMDL, pRSV) using polyethylenimine. Lentivirus was harvested after 48 h-72 h and filtered through a 0.45 Î¼m filter (Millipore). A Spinfection method was used to deliver sgRNA-bEXOmiR lentiviral plasmid sublibraries into K562 cells. Briefly, K562 cells were re-suspended in lentiviral supernatant supplemented with 8 Âµg/ml polybrene, distributed into 6-well plates, and centrifuged for 2 hr at 1000Â ÃÂ <italic>g</italic>, 33Â°C. Lentiviral supernatant was removed and cells were grown in fresh RPMI. After 48 hr recovery, 1.75 Âµg/ml of puromycin was added to select the cells for stable integration of the virus. Selection was monitored by flow cytometry and puromycin was removed from the media onceÂ &gt;95% of the cells were GFP-positive.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9-bEXOmiR screens in K562 cells--For genome-wide coverage, a total of nine, focused CRISPR/Cas9 deletion screens using nine different sublibraries of sgRNA-bEXOmiR associations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) were performed. WT and Cas9-expressing K562 cells were infected at low MOI (&lt;1). Transduced cells were selected and expanded in puromycin-supplemented media over 5â7 days before conducting experiments at 8â10 days post-infection. Initially, we performed two independent pilot screens focused on membrane trafficking, mitochondrial and motility genes (MMM screen). Subsequent screens were conducted in duplicate to further minimize technical variation observed in previous screens. Screens were started at 10,000â15,000 fold sublibrary coverage (elements per ml of cell culture) to ensure maximal bEXOmiR representation in EVs but also to minimize variability due to downstream loss of barcodes during RNA isolation and fractionation. Isolation of EVs was performed 48 hr later using protocol P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Cellular fractions with at least 1000-fold sublibrary coverage were collected at the start (0 hr) and end (48 hr) of each screen.</p><p>bEXOmiR isolation and purification from screen EV RNA--Total RNA was extracted from each EV sample using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LÃ¤sser, 2013</xref>). The resulting RNA pellet was re-suspended in nuclease-free water and equal amount of 2x RNA loading dye was added (90% formamide, 50 mM HEPES, bromophenol blue, xylene cyanide). Fractionation of total RNA was carried out on denaturating polyacrylamide gels containing 7% urea/15% acrylamide in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE). Custom 21 and 24 bp single-stranded RNA markers were used to indicate approximate miRNA migration on a gel from which gel band excision was monitored by UV shadowing. miRNAs were then gel-purified, reconstituted in nuclease-free water, and stored in â80 ËC.</p><p>Small RNA library preparation and deep sequencing--bEXOmiR sequencing libraries from isolated EV miRNA was prepared using a modified protocol from TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). For each library,~1 Âµg of fractionated small RNA was ligated first to a 3â-adapter and then to 5â-adapter, followed by reverse transcription with custom primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) containing a fragment complementary to the EXO motif in bEXOmiRs (to specifically enrich for bEXOmiRs in the final sequencing library). Resulting cDNA was then uniquely indexed by PCR to generate the final sequencing library. Initial sequencing trials showed some rRNA contaminant fragments (specially 45S5) that were predominant in our sequencing data, which compromised sequencing depth. To remove rRNA 45S5, a specific hairpin oligo blocker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) containing a sequence complementary to the predominant rRNA fragment was incubated after ligation of the 3â adapter to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>). This oligo blocked subsequent ligation of the 5â adapter to the contaminant rRNA fragment, thus excluding it from later steps. After PCR amplification, indexed samples were separated on a 4.5% low melting point agarose gel and products corresponding to 140 bp were purified using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined by Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pooled libraries were denatured with NaOH and diluted to 2.3 pM according to the Illumina protocol, and sequenced using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit on NextSeq 500 system (Illumina).</p><p>Sequencing data analysis--Sequencing of sgRNAs from DNA was trimmed and aligned using Bowtie version 1.1.2 with zero mismatches tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). All counts from multi-mapping reads were used. For sequencing of barcodes from RNA, reads were trimmed to 14 base-pairs and aligned to the libraries using Bowtie version 1.1.2 with two mismatches tolerated and all multi-mapping reads used. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref> contain bEXOmiR and sgRNA sequencing counts derived from each duplicated screen. Gene-level effects and an associated log-likelihood ratio (confidence score) were then calculated with casTLE as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). For each gene, casTLE combines measurements from 10 different bEXOmiRs (associated with the sgRNAs targeting each gene) and gives an effect size estimate for the gene perturbation (gene K.O.) as well as a p-value associated with that effect. casTLE estimates the maximum possible phenotype such that targeting elements are most likely to be found between this phenotype and zero. Additionally, casTLE allows data from multiple screen types or from replicates of the same screen type to be compared and combined by finding a single effect size consistent with all data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, low count (&lt;10) bEXOmiRs were filtered, and a median-normalized log count ratio was calculated for each barcode. Distributions of barcode enrichments corresponding to each gene were compared to the distribution of nontargeting and safe-targeting sgRNAs. P-values were then calculated by permuting bEXOmiRs corresponding to targeting sgRNAs.Â Code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/dmorgens/castle">https://bitbucket.org/dmorgens/castle</ext-link> (Copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/dmorgens-castle">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/dmorgens-castle</ext-link>).</p><p>Nanostring profiling was performed with the nCounter Human v3 microRNA expression assay. Control, SMPD3 and ARHGEF18 CRISPR-KO K562 polyclonal cell lines were seeded at 2.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in EV-free RPMI medium and grown for 48 hr before EV isolation. RNA from cellular and exosomal fractions was extracted using Trizol as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LÃ¤sser, 2013</xref>). EV RNA was resuspended in 4 ÂµL H<sub>2</sub>O and 3 ÂµL (~300 ng) from each sample were used in the assay; 200 ng cellular RNA was used. RNA integrity was confirmed by Bioanalyzer before conducting the assay. Around 20 amol of synthetic spike-in RNA oligo (ath-miR-159a, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was added to each EV sample prior to RNA extraction and used as a normalization factor in downstream EV miRNA data analysis. Raw read data from the nCounter microRNA assay were analyzed as described in the nCounter Expression Data Analysis Guide (NanoString Technologies). Data normalization for cellular miRs was perfomed using the geometric mean of the top 100 expressed miRNAs. Only miRs that passed signal-to-noise cut-off values and that were consistently detected in either cellular or EV fractions (274 and 74 miRNAs, respectively) throughout all samples, were included in the analysis and plotted using R software. Normalized miRNA counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) from SMPD3 KO or ARHGEF18 KO samples were divided by control miRNA counts from independent experiments (nÂ =Â 2) and plotted as percent of control miRNA abundance.</p><p>Generation of CRISPR-KO cell lines for validation experiments--Polyclonal, CRISPR-KO cell lines were generated by transducing K562 stably expressing SFFV-Cas9-BFP with Lentiviral vectors encoding hit-targeting sgRNAs; at least two different sgRNAs per hit were tested. Cultures were incubated for at least 7â10 d with the sgRNAs to ensure adequate depletion of target-protein levels before conducting experiments. TIDE analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tide.nki.nl/">https://tide.nki.nl/</ext-link>) was performed to assess CRISPR deletions. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from cells using a QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). A 500â700 bp region containing the sgRNA cut site was amplified by PCR using GoTaq Polymerase (Promega). PCR amplification products were separated on a 0.75% TAE-agarose gel, from which amplicon bands were excised, and DNA was purified from the gel slice using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Sanger sequencing of PCR products followed by trace decomposition analysis with TIDE software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tide.nki.nl/">https://tide.nki.nl/</ext-link>) was used to determine indel frequency in CRISPR-KO cell lines compared with control cells expressing a control sgRNA (targeting a genomic safe-harbor region). For validation experiments, sgRNA-expressing cell lines that showed higher degree of knockout efficiency as determined by either TIDE and/or immunoblot analysis were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Wnt signaling--For Wnt3a stimulation, K562 cells were starved overnight in serum-free conditions. The next day, the medium was replaced with fresh EV-free RPMI supplemented with 100 ng/ml recombinant Wnt3a protein (R and D Systems), or Wnt3a combined with 200 ng/ml recombinant DKK1 protein (R and D Systems) and EVs were collected 24 hr later. The GSK3 specific inhibitor, CHIR99021 (Selleckchem) and LiCl were used at 10 ÂµM and 10 mM, respectively for 24 hr before collection of EVs from the medium. Quantitation of immunoblots from each of these conditions was normalized to account for cell viability, as measured by flow cytometry (BD Accuri). C59 Porcupine inhibitor was the generous gift of Dr. Roel Nusse, Stanford University.</p><p>Functional Network analysis--Top hits were collectively queried in STRING (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>) to search for gene interactions according to co-expression, experimental or curated database sources. The resulting STRING file reporting pair-wise gene interactions was imported into Cytoscape software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>) to create a visually comprehensive functional interactome. Interactions were represented as edges whose thickness was proportional to a calculated combined score derived from STRING analysis. The final Cytoscape map was further manually curated to include additional screen hits (nodes) that despite not being reported to interact, could still be clustered in a common functional category revealed in the screen.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Data and materials availability</title><p>All data is available in the main text or the supplementary files.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Genome-wide interrogation of extracellular vesicle release using barcoded miRNAs reveals a role for Wnt signaling&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews, the reviewers' opinions of your study were mixed. All reviewers feel that the bEXOmiR experimental approach is clever and may hold promise for identifying EV biogenesis pathway components. However, while the reviewers acknowledge the potential trove of new information regarding EV biogenesis, they found the breadth and diversity of the 'hits' a matter of some concern, because for most cases it is not possible to distinguish &quot;fundamental&quot; versus &quot;peripheral&quot; hits in EV biogenesis pathways. It is a fair assumption that many of the hits impact EV biogenesis and release due to general perturbations to organelle function (that is, they do not directly participate in some aspect of EV biology). The consensus view is that additional experimentation is necessary to sufficiently validate the bEXOmiR approach and the screening data, and the reviewers request that you outline additional experimentation to address this. The reviewers would be especially encouraged by experimental data regarding mechanism: what aspect of EV biogenesis is affected by loss of ARHGEF18 and/or is regulated by Wnt signaling? The reviewers felt that the Wnt signaling and ARHGEF18 follow-up work was largely confirmatory of the original screen hits but did not provide strong additional evidence for a fundamental role of these factors in EV biogenesis or regulation. The reviewers would also have liked to see some additional data that would provide insight into the origin of the bEXOmiR-containing EV vesicle (plasma membrane? endosome? another organelle?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes the construction and validation of a genetic screening method that links specific sgRNA sequences with synthetic miRNAs that are secreted via extra-cellular vesicles (EVs). The method allows one to use deep sequencing to gauge the effects of targeted gene knockouts on EV-mediated release of miRNAs on a whole genome scale. The method was applied in replicate screens, and its effectiveness is suggested by the identification of a handful of gene products previously implicated in EV biogenesis and/or release. In addition, at least one gene, ARHGEF18, was shown to be required for EV-mediated release of endogenous miRNAs.</p><p>I find the method to be a clever implementation of miRNA and sgRNA processing pathways to link genetics with phenotype. The most important question is, does it work? The identification of gene products previously identified as required for EV release suggests that it does. The approach did, however, require the authors to tackle a few technical bugs (e.g., DNA sequencing, effects of different sgRNA-barcode combinations, etc.) and it is not clear if further, unknown biases (if any) impact the utility of the method as a general method for evaluating the genetics of EV biogenesis. A large number of genes not previously implicated in EV biology are asserted to play roles in EV biogenesis. At this stage, it is unclear if any of the 'new' hits play a direct role in EV cargo sorting, EV biogenesis, or EV release. As with most screens, the ultimate utility of the data will require substantial amount of follow-up work and will not be known for years to come.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Lu and colleagues perform a genome wide screen to get insights into the biogenesis and regulation of Extracellular Vesicle release.</p><p>For this purpose, the authors set up an elegant system based on the generation of barcoded miRNAs that depict a sequence that has been previously shown to target miRNAs to multivesicular endosomes of T lymphocytes and in particular to their intralumenal vesicles (called exosomes once they are secreted). These findings from the group of Sanchez Madrid are largely exploited here (and would deserve better acknowledgement).</p><p>The barcoded miRNAs are then used as reporters of EV release which is followed by a genome wide screen coupled with CRISPR/Cas9.</p><p>The authors have performed an incredible amount of work, that certainly is a very interesting set up.</p><p>There are several concerns with the manuscript, interpretation of results and the claims. Finally, one is a little left with the question on how such approach can really answer fundamental questions and pinpoint general or particular/specific machineries required for EV biogenesis and release.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) EVs comprise very different types of vesicles that are either endosome derived (so called exosomes) and plasma membrane derived. One important issue in the field is the possibility in the future to ascribe functions to the different subpopulations. Several studies have described and reported distinct machineries for the biogenesis and release of exosomes and microvesicles that can be cell type and cargo specific (summarized in different recent reviews from different authors). Therefore, it is unclear what is the approach that is here developed bringing to the complexity that has been observed and described for the very different systems.</p><p>2) It is unclear from the claims in the manuscript and from the experiments done if one is trying to get hints on the biogenesis and release of endosome-derived exosomes or plasma membrane derived vesicles. It would certainly be important for the general audience to be clearer on this issue that is a real concern.</p><p>With this in mind, the characterization made, that is far from being very extensive, would seem to indicate that the authors maybe rather focus on endosome derived exosomes.</p><p>This point should be consolidated better with additional proteins tested by Western blot, CD63, Tsg101. For example, CD63 should rather be used for the immunofluorescence experiments presented. Lamp1, if present in late endosomes, is much more enriched in lysosomes. The experiments presented in Figure 1 and Figure 6 are difficult then to interpret.</p><p>Lamp1 is far from being the best &quot;exosome&quot; marker as in most cells Lamp1 is on the limiting membrane of the organelle and it is Lamp2 that is rather on the intraluminal vesicles. Therefore, it would be important to control whether in the cells under study Lamp1 is targeted to the intraluminal vesicles (or even if this is a consequence of the barcoded miRNAs?)</p><p>3) Following point 2, electron microscopy combined with extra immunofluorescence imaging would be more then appropriate and required to be sure, even to set background for the all findings, that the barcoded miRNAs, once expressed are not impacting in cell/organelle morphology and/or if they are targeted to the right place. This could also help understanding the effects of Rab27A which in most cells where it is expressed (not all cells express the &quot;a&quot; isoform) is present in Golgi TGN. Rab27a is localized to Lysosome Related organelles only in specialized cells. Therefore, is Rab27a in these manipulated cells recruited to multivesicular endosomes that may specialize after introduction of the barcoded miRs? For example, this is the case in HeLa cells expressing MHC Class II and all associated molecules for antigen presentation (Ostrowski et al., 2010). The sequence used has been described to my knowledge only in T cells, is it really driving the miRs to the right place in very different cells? In conclusion extra controls would support part of the claims. This would then help understanding what subpopulation of EVs is targeted in the study.</p><p>4) I would be more careful generalizing the concept based on the two cell lines used in this study although both express wnt.</p><p>5) The manuscript describes the involvement of Wnt signaling in the regulation of Â« EV biogenesis Â». For me it is unclear what is really the mechanism of Wnt action: is it on the biogenesis per se or on the release/secretion step which are different parts of the pathway? It could be only on the release but whether there are biogenetic functions remains unclear. Are vesicles still formed? Is the cargo still loaded on vesicles? One has pretty much the tendency to put together biogenesis/release but the mechanisms involved in the generation and then in the release are very distinct. The manuscript should be clear on this point.</p><p>6) In subsection âWnt signaling in EV biologyâ the authors test the effect of Wnt3a on EV release and show a decrease (is it on biogenesis or the release? by which mechanism?). This appears different from what was previously described in other cells such as microglia (Hooper et al., 2012), where Wnt3a induces exosome release, and inhibition of GSK3 does not altered exosome secretion, indicating that exosome release occurs through a GSK3-independent mechanism. Such discrepancy is not described, and the paper not quoted if I am not wrong.</p><p>7) In concern to the effects of YKT6 that has been described by the group of Boutros as required for exosome-dependent Wnt release in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc and cells and Hela cells, the paper of Gross et al., 2012 is not quoted.</p><p>8) In Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and in the legend there is a discrepancy: in the figure it is 12.200g and in the legend 10.000 g and the time of not indicated in the figure.</p><p>9) Figure 5B in the text there is a reference to cells versus EVs (subsection âA CRISPR/Cas9 screen using bEXOmiRsâ) though unclear in the Figure.</p><p>In conclusion, it is an elegant set up that deserves attention but certainly additional controls. At this point in my opinion it is more the set-up of a new method that maybe will set the stage for more meaningful experiments in the future. This may help to better target potential mechanisms and therefore understand the crosstalks and pathways influencing EV (rather subpopulations of EVs) biogenesis and release which should be separated as this are very different processes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Albert Lu and colleagues, have designed a screen to identify regulators of the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EV). They have used a clever design by combining bar-coding of the EV with a single guide RNA to target genes using the Cas9 enzyme. Bar-coding is achieved using custom-designed miRNAs, the bEXOmiR.</p><p>The authors used a pool screen format where an excess of cells is transfected with a complex library of viruses. Next generation sequencing then quantifies the abundance of specific miRNA in the supernatant of the pool of cells. Because each gene-specific guide RNA is combined with a specific bEXOmiR, inference can be drawn from the levels of a bEXOmiR in the supernatant.</p><p>This is an elegant study that provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in EV. It also provides a proof of concept that such bar-coding of EV is feasible. Finally, it demonstrates elegantly that Wnt signaling is involved in regulating EV secretion.</p><p>In such pooled screens, the normalisation steps are really key to avoid mis-interpreting the data. In this case, Lu and colleagues have normalised first the bEXOmiR count to a cell line devoid of the nuclease Cas9. This should exclude any effect that the bEXOmiR barcode could have on packaging into EV or the effect the miRNAs could have on gene expression. The authors show convincingly that this is the case.</p><p>The next concern would be that the CRISPR targeted gene would affect the synthesis of the bar-coded miRNA instead of packaging and export in EV. These are admittedly two very different processes and it would be advantageous to distinguish them.</p><p>As far as I could see, the authors did not use the comparison extra/intra cellular levels of bEXOmiR to sort their hits. It would be interesting to sort the hits based on whether there is an individual correlation between intracellular and extracellular amount of bEXOmiR upon gene knockout. This should be the case for the hits proposed to be involved in &quot;miRNA processing and trafficking&quot; (proposal based on previous annotations) (Figure 4). In theory it could help sort the other hits between miRNA processing and EV biosynthesis, especially for RNA binding proteins.</p><p>The final concern with screen design would be whether some genes could affect the uptake and degradation of EV. Indeed, as this is a suspension culture, cells have in theory the capacity to affect the extracellular levels of EV also through endocytosis and degradation. A hit that would affect the membrane surface of EV and thus affect EV binding to neighbouring cells after secretion could, in theory affect the overall levels of EV without affecting their synthesis and release. I wonder if this could be an explanation for the effect of some of the extracellular proteins identified (Figure 4). I wonder if the authors can exclude this effect or control for it?</p><p>&quot; Unexpectedly, YKT6, which appeared as a suppressor in the initial screen (Figure 2B), was uncovered as a slight activator instead; this may be related to differences in the bEXOmiRs associated with this gene in the two separate analyses..â¦ This discrepancy highlights the importance of orthogonal hit validation experiments.&quot;</p><p>It also highlights the difficulty in interpreting the significance score (-Log10(P-value) to evaluate reproducibility. I have trouble evaluating how many pairs of bEXOmiRs-sgRNA gave similar results with this metric.</p><p>It would be surprising that the YKT6 case would occur if the result found in the main screen is attributable to 3 or 4 pairs of bEXOmiR+sgRNA. I think it would help clarify the data if the authors provided a table with the result for each gene: with how many constructs gave a result and what score.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41460.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see from the reviews, the reviewers' opinions of your study were mixed.

In theory it could help sort the other hits between miRNA processing and EV biosynthesis, especially for RNA binding proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not sorted our hits according to packaging efficiency and note this in the revised text. We did address this in Figure 5 for the Nanostring experiment where specific miRNA levels only change in the EV but not cellular fractions. Orthogonal validation is thus important to ensure it was not a bEXOmiR synthesis issue - monitoring the release of endogenous miRNAs instead of bEXOmiRs and creating CRISPR cell lines that show the same phenotype for specific hits without any bEXOmiRs. By using 10 different bEXOmiRs for every gene, we tried to minimize any biosynthesis bias. In addition, we now more clearly explain Figure 3 where we show no correlation between abundance of total bEXOmiRs in cells compared with EVs. We also validated the roles of the hits using TIRF, confirming the use of these reporters to good end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final concern with screen design would be whether some genes could affect the uptake and degradation of EV. Indeed, as this is a suspension culture, cells have in theory the capacity to affect the extracellular levels of EV also through endocytosis and degradation. A hit that would affect the membrane surface of EV and thus affect EV binding to neighbouring cells after secretion could, in theory affect the overall levels of EV without affecting their synthesis and release. I wonder if this could be an explanation for the effect of some of the extracellular proteins identified (Figure 4). I wonder if the authors can exclude this effect or control for it?</p></disp-quote><p>Although endocytosis of EVs by surface proteins might lead to a decrease in EV bEXOmiR abundance, we did not detect a large cluster of endocytosis genes in our screen and state this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot; Unexpectedly, YKT6, which appeared as a suppressor in the initial screen (Figure 2B), was uncovered as a slight activator instead; this may be related to differences in the bEXOmiRs associated with this gene in the two separate analyses..â¦ This discrepancy highlights the importance of orthogonal hit validation experiments.&quot;</p><p>It also highlights the difficulty in interpreting the significance score (-Log10(P-value) to evaluate reproducibility. I have trouble evaluating how many pairs of bEXOmiRs-sgRNA gave similar results with this metric.</p></disp-quote><p>Our screen has many limitations and the CASTLE score emphasizes the outliers. Again, different bEXOmiRs have variable efficiencies as do different guides, and one would need to redo the screen with a more limited, enhanced set to have better genome-wide coverage. We have added better data on recovery of each bEXOmiR for all the hits in a new Table 7 as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be surprising that the YKT6 case would occur if the result found in the main screen is attributable to 3 or 4 pairs of bEXOmiR+sgRNA. I think it would help clarify the data if the authors provided a table with the result for each gene: with how many constructs gave a result and what score.</p></disp-quote><p>Done as requested â usually 2-3 guide-bEXOmiR associations supported each hit.
