Genotoxic agents trigger a 'nuclear-to-cytoplasmic' NF-κB activation signaling pathway; however, the early nuclear signaling cascade linking DNA damage and NF-κB activation is poorly understood. Here we report that Src-associated-substrate-during-mitosis-of-68kDa/KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 (Sam68/KHDRBS1) is a key NF-κB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway. Sam68 deficiency abolishes DNA damage-stimulated polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR) production and the PAR-dependent NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. Sam68 deleted cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Upregulated Sam68 coincides with elevated PAR production and NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic transcription in human and mouse colon cancer. Knockdown of Sam68 sensitizes human colon cancer cells to genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and genetic deletion of Sam68 dampens colon tumor burden in mice. Together our data reveal a novel function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated nuclear signaling, which is crucial for colon tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15018.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15018.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use signaling pathways to detect and respond to harmful conditions by switching on genes that keep the cell healthy. One important pathway is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which is activated by many stimuli. These stimuli may come from infections from outside the cell or may originate inside the cell, as seen for DNA damage caused by irradiation, chemicals or rapid DNA replication in cancer cells.</p><p>Most of a cell’s DNA is located in the cell nucleus. However, NF-κB proteins are normally located outside the nucleus, in the cell’s cytoplasm. Damage to DNA triggers a signal from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This signal activates the NF-κB proteins, which move into the nucleus and turn on genes that help the cell to recover from the damage. These genes include those that prevent the cell from self-destructing. In one step of the NF-κB activation process, chain-like molecules called polymers are made from a compound called poly(ADP-ribose), or PAR for short. However, few other details are known about how the damaged DNA in the nucleus signals to the cytoplasm.</p><p>A protein called Sam68, which is found in the cell nucleus, has been linked to DNA damage signaling. Fu, Sun et al. now present evidence that suggests that if mouse cells lack Sam68, they do not produce PAR polymers in response to DNA damage. In addition, these cells could not trigger the PAR-dependent signaling cascade that is essential for activating NF-κB and for turning on the protective genes. Consequently, cells that lacked Sam68 were extremely sensitive to agents that cause DNA damage, such as chemicals and irradiation.</p><p>The NF-κB pathway is regulated incorrectly in some cancers, but is also activated by DNA damage caused by cancer treatments. Therefore, Fu, Sun et al. also explored the role of Sam68 in cancer. Reducing the levels of Sam68 made human colon cancer cells more likely to self-destruct when they were exposed to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, removing Sam68 from mice that spontaneously grow colon cancer caused their tumors to develop more slowly than mice that retained Sam68 in their cells.</p><p>Overall, the findings presented by Fu, Sun et al. suggest that Sam68 regulates the signal from the nucleus to the cytoplasm that activates NF-κB proteins in response to DNA damage. Sam68 also appears to be important for helping colon cancer cells grow and survive. Future challenges will be to understand how Sam68 regulates the production of the PAR polymer in this response and to explore whether Sam68 can be targeted for treating cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15018.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15018.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NF-kB</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>DNA damage responses</kwd><kwd>Sam68</kwd><kwd>KHDRBS1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wier</surname><given-names>Eric M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA151393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sears</surname><given-names>Cynthia L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Fengyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-13-052-01-MPC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Fengyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The nuclear protein Sam68 plays a role in the genotoxic stress-initiated &quot;nuclear to cytoplasmic&quot; activation of NF-κB and is involved in the development and survival of colon cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a crucial transcription factor in a variety of pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dietz and Bahr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grilli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harhaj and Dixit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Natoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smale, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan and Lenardo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wertz and Dixit, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wertz et al., 2004</xref>).

Besides ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and IKKγ, two known crucial regulators of the genotoxic stress-activated NF-κB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piret et al., 1999</xref>), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) was recently revealed to be indispensable for the signaling cascade that links nuclear DNA damage recognition to cytoplasmic IKK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Sequential post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation, of these signaling regulators are critical for NF-κB activation following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mabb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), in particular, PARP1-catalyzed poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) has emerged as a vital means for rapid assembly of the signaling complexes that are critical for DNA damage-initiated NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mabb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Although these studies have considerably advanced our understanding of the cellular response to DNA damage, the genotoxic stress-initiated ‘‘nuclear-to-cytoplasmic’’ NF-κB signaling pathway remains poorly understood, in particular the early signaling networks linking DNA lesion recognition in the nucleus to subsequent activation of IKK and liberation of NF-κB in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Sam68 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa, also named KH domain containing, RNA binding, signal transduction associated 1 [KHDRBS1], and encoded by <italic>KHDRBS1</italic> gene), an RNA-binding protein that preferentially resides in the nucleus, plays versatile functions in an increasing number of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bielli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glisovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henao-Mejia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukong and Richard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paronetto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajan et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramakrishnan and Baltimore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Through its KH (heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein particle K homology) domain, Sam68 is capable of binding single- and double-stranded DNA in addition to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukong and Richard, 2003</xref>). Of note, Sam68 was identified as a PAR-binding protein in alkylating agent treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gagne et al., 2008</xref>) and a putative substrate of ATM, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beli et al., 2012</xref>), which suggests that Sam68 could be an important molecule in the cellular response to DNA damage. Although emerging evidence suggests the involvement of Sam68 in multiple signaling pathways, it has not been extensively investigated yet whether Sam68, an almost strictly nuclear protein, participates in the signal communication network of nuclear-initiated signaling pathways. Moreover, aberrant expression of Sam68 has been acknowledged in multiple cancers and elevated Sam68 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Overexpression of Sam68 has been proposed as a prognostic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), however, the precise function of Sam68 in cancer development and survival remains obscure.</p><p>Here we report that Sam68 is an important regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated early signaling in the nucleus, which leads to NF-κB activation. Sam68 deletion diminishes DNA damage-stimulated PARP1 activation and PAR production, as well as the PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling and transactivation of an array of anti-apoptotic genes. As a consequence, Sam68 knockout cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by γ-irradiation and DNA damaging chemicals. Moreover, downregulation of Sam68 substantially sensitizes human colorectal cancer cells to spontaneous and genotoxic stress-induced cell death and retards colon tumor growth and survival in genetically susceptible <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice. Hence our data reveal a crucial function of Sam68 in the genotoxic stress-initiated 'nuclear to cytoplasmic' NF-κB transactivation and the involvement of Sam68 in the development and survival of colon cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sam68 is essential for DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation</title><p>To examine the potential role of Sam68 in nuclear-initiated NF-κB activation, we first compared the genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling in immortalized wild-type and Sam68 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As expected, Camptothecin (CPT), a DNA-damaging chemical that inhibits DNA topoisomerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>), stimulated a rapid degradation of IκBα, a prerequisite for NF-κB liberation and transactivation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner in wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, DNA damage-induced IκBα degradation was remarkably attenuated in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and MEFs without poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a recently identified key nuclear regulator of DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, CPT treatment triggered remarkable nuclear translocation of NF-κB in wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); additionally, the derived nuclear extracts formed high-affinity binding complexes with immunoglobin (Ig) κB double-stranded DNA, which was further confirmed by cold oligonucleotide competition and super shift assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In striking contrast, NF-κB nuclear accumulation and binding capacity to Ig κB DNA were almost abolished in the CPT-stimulated Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). To ascertain that Sam68 deficiency solely results in the impaired genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation in MEFs, we examined the NF-κB signaling in wild-type MEFs with Sam68 knockdown by small interference RNAs (siRNAs) and Sam68 KO MEFs supplemented with exogenous Sam68. CPT-triggered IκBα degradation was substantially reduced in Sam68-specific siRNA-expressing wild-type MEFs, compared to scrambled non-specific siRNA-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas ectopic expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged Sam68, but not GFP alone, markedly restored CPT-induced IκBα degradation in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Sam68 could execute an essential function in the nuclear-initiated NF-κB signaling pathway.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sam68 is required for the nuclear-initiated NF-κB signaling in response to DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Whole cell lysates from wild-type (WT) and Sam68 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with indicated concentrations of CPT for 2 hr (<bold>A</bold>) or 10 μM of CPT for indicated periods (<bold>B</bold>) were immunoblotted (IB) for IκBα and Sam68, with β-actin as a loading control. <italic>Right</italic>, the IκBα levels, normalized to β-actin and untreated controls, were quantified from three independent experiments.

Indeed, CPT treatment-induced SUMOylation of IKKγ, a pivotal post-translational modification on IKKγ in the nucleus that subsequently leads to activation of IKKβ and liberation of NF-κB in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mabb et al., 2006</xref>), was substantially attenuated in Sam68 KO MEFs in comparison to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In striking contrast, the CPT-induced PARP1-IKKγ interaction was abolished in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, strong inducible interactions among Sam68, PARP1, and IKKγ were observed in wild-type MEFs, at 20 min after CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Of note, immune-depletion of Sam68 using antibodies abolished the CPT-induced PARP1-IKKγ interaction in wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that PARP1 interacts with Sam68 and IKKγ simultaneously.

The inducible Sam68-PARP1 interaction following genotoxic stress led us to examine whether Sam68 impacts DNA break-stimulated PAR synthesis. As expected, CPT treatment induced a wide array of PARylated proteins peaking at 20 min post stimulation in wild-type MEFs, which were diminished by one-hour pretreatment with two independent PARP inhibitors, Olaparib and PJ-34, thus confirming the PAR specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, genotoxic stress-induced PAR synthesis was markedly dampened in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

PAR that is synthesized after DNA damage can be rapidly degraded by PAR glycohydrolase (PARG), therefore we examined the possibility that PARG is hyper-activated in the absence of Sam68, thus degrading the formed PAR chains immediately after genotoxic stress. However, down-regulation of PARG by siRNA in Sam68 KO MEFs failed to restore CPT-induced PAR production to a similar level to that in wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that the attenuated PAR formation in the absence of Sam68 is not caused by a rapid degradation of PAR chains.

Remarkably, Sam68 was enriched in chromatin fractions in MEFs following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and the kinetics of Sam68 enrichment was similar to that of PARP1 on damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which supports the inducible interaction between Sam68 and PARP1 in the early DNA damage signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Moreover, Sam68 and PARP1 were still substantially enriched in chromatin fractions in the PARP1-inhibited MEFs following γ-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating that genotoxic stress-induced Sam68 enrichment in chromatin is not dependent on PAR formation. We further examined whether ectopic expression of PARP1 could rescue the defect in DNA damage-induced PAR formation caused by Sam68 loss. As expected, supplementing exogenous GFP-Sam68, compared to the GFP control, largely restored γ-irradiation-stimulated PAR production in Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In contrast, PARP1 overexpression did not rescue the PAR chain formation in response to γ-irradiation under a Sam68 deleted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which suggests that Sam68 is required for DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and is consistent with Sam68 being an essential upstream activator of PARP1.</p><p>DNA-dependent PARP enzymes, <italic>i.e.</italic> PARP1 and PARP2, are activated during the cellular response to DNA damage, of which PARP1 is the most robust enzyme that catalyzes &gt;90% of PAR formation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krishnakumar and Kraus, 2010</xref>). In contrast to the genotoxic stress-induced Sam68-PARP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), no detectable interaction between Sam68 and PARP2 was observed under either unstimulated or damaged conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Provided the crucial funciton of PARP1 in DNA damage responses, we therefore examined whether Sam68 impacts PARP1-conferred PARylation following DNA damage. In line with the vigorous PAR production in the presence of genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), immunoprecipitated PARP1 was associated with Sam68 and various PARylated target proteins in CPT-treated wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the PARylated species were dramatically reduced despite an equal amount of PARP1 immunoprecipitated from Sam68 KO MEFs was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Conversely, supplementing with GFP-tagged Sam68, in comparison to a GFP control, markedly augmented the DNA damage-triggered PAR synthesis in CPT-treated Sam68 KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), further supporting the key function of Sam68 in controlling DNA damage-initiated PARylation. To assess the direct impact of Sam68 on PARP1-catalyzed PAR production, we utilized recombinant PARP1 and Sam68 proteins in in vitro PARylation assays. DNA damage-activated PARP1 auto-modified itself with the addition of PAR moieties in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) and DNA, as indicated by the formation of PARylated PARP1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and a corresponding reduction in unmodified PARP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, compare lane 4 with lane 3). Strikingly, incubation of recombinant Sam68 protein, but not GST control, with PARP1 dramatically boosted PAR production, which was paralleled by a sharp loss of unmodified PARP1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, compare lane 5 with lane 4). Of note, the amount of Sam68 protein from the boosted PARylation reaction remained at a comparable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, compare lane 5 with lane 7), thus ruling out the possibility that Sam68 is a substrate of PARP1 in vitro and indicating that Sam68 harbors a stimulatory function for DNA-dependent PARP1 activity. In the absence of PARP1, neither GST nor GST-Sam68 protein exhibited PARylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 10), indicating that Sam68 per se does not possess the enzymatic activity to transfer ADP-ribosyl polymers. Moreover, in the absence of damaged DNA, incubation of Sam68 and PARP1 failed to form detectable PAR chains from supplemented NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), which suggests that Sam68 stimulates DNA-dependent PARP1 activation and subsequent PAR production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Sam68-PARP1 interaction is critical for genotoxic stress-induced PARylation and NF-κB activation</title><p>Using various Sam68 truncates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we sought to understand the key domain(s) in Sam68 needed for its interaction with PARP1.

In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 1–102 (ΔN) of Sam68 almost abolished the association of Sam68 to PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminal residues are critical for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. Moreover, our pull-down assays using recombinant proteins demonstrated a direct Sam68-PARP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast to the strong association between PARP1 and full-length Sam68, ΔN truncated Sam68 protein barely interacted with PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which further supports the critical role of N-terminus of Sam68 for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. To examine the functional importance of the Sam68-PARP1 interaction, we compared DNA damage-stimulated NF-κB signaling in Sam68 KO MEFs supplemented with full-length or ΔN mutant Sam68. Transient transfection of full-length Sam68, but not GFP control, significantly restored genotoxic stress-induced PARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), assembly of the PARP1-IKKγ signaling complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), cytoplasmic degradation of IκBα, and nuclear translocation of p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). In contrast, despite full-length Sam68 and Sam68 (ΔN) truncate sharing strict nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), ectopic expression of Sam68 (ΔN) mutant failed to restore the DNA damage-triggered PARylation, PARP1-IKKγ signal complex assembly, IκBα degradation, and p65 nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Moreover, we carried out in vitro PARylation assays using recombinant Sam68 and Sam68 (ΔN) proteins, to examine the role of the Sam68-PARP1 interaction for Sam68-stimulated PARP1 activation. Consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), incubation of Sam68 with PARP1 substantially enhanced PAR formation in the presence of damaged DNA and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 7). However, the stimulatory effect of Sam68 on PARP1 activation and PARylation under the same condition was dramatically impeded by Sam68 (ΔN) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, compare lane 7 with lane 11), suggesting that the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is essential for Sam68 to stimulate PARP1 activation. Therefore our results demonstrate that the N-terminus of Sam68 is important for the association between Sam68 and PARP1 and the Sam68-PARP1 interaction is critical for DNA damage-induced PARylation and PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>N-terminus of Sam68 is crucial for the Sam68-PARP1 interaction and genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signalosome assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of Sam68 protein (residues 1–443), full-length or indicated mutants (ΔN lacks residues 1–102, ΔC lacks 347–443, and ΔKH lacks 165–224) fused with GFP.

Moreover, the enhanced Sam68 expression coincided with elevated levels of PAR production, phosphorylated p65 (phosphor-p65, indicative of NF-κB activation), and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic transcriptional target of NF-κB) in colon tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>).

Therefore, our results demonstrate the Sam68-PARP1-NF-κB-anti-apoptotic gene axis plays a crucial function for colon cancer survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The NF-κB signaling pathway remains a very attractive avenue for pharmacological intervention, given its crucial function in human health and disease, particularly inflammatory diseases and cancers. In spite of the widespread use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in current-day cancer treatments, the genotoxic stress-induced nuclear NF-κB signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB transactivation is still less defined, than NF-κB activation initiated from cell membrane stimuli (<italic>e.g.</italic> immune receptors). Herein, we report that Sam68 is a novel regulator participating in the early cellular responses to DNA damage; it does this by orchestrating the signaling cascade that links DNA lesion recognition in the nucleus to NF-κB liberation and activation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Following genotoxic stress, sophisticated cellular networks consisting of a variety of molecules and post-translational modifications, collectively termed as DNA damage responses (DDR), are crucial for cell-cycle checkpoint control, DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>). Among these, DNA damage-initiated NF-κB signaling and transactivation of an array of anti-apoptotic molecules are pivotal in facilitating cells to 'escape' from the lethal effects of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCool and Miyamoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyamoto, 2011</xref>). Our results demonstrate that Sam68 deletion impairs inducible IκBα degradation, NF-κB liberation, and subsequent anti-apoptotic gene expression in cells under genotoxic stress. Sam68 interacts with several established molecules including PARP1 and IKKγ in the nuclear-initiated NF-κB signaling pathway and facilitates assembly of the NF-κB activation signaling complex. More importantly, Sam68 plays an indispensable role in DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and PAR synthesis, thus controlling the PAR-dependent signaling complex assembly. This is distinct from leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16), a recently reported regulator of DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation, which binds to PARP1 and IKKγ in a PAR-dependent manner and therefore functions downstream of PARP1 and PAR production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Previously, PARP1 was proposed to be dispensable for ATM activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that Sam68 is important for the activation of PARP1, as well as, ATM in DDR. In addition to the currently illustrated major impact of Sam68 on the PARP1/PAR-dependent signaling pathway that leads to NF-κB activation, Sam68 may contribute to NF-κB activation via a direct or indirect effect on the ATM-involved signaling cascade during the cellular response to DNA damage. Our results underscore a previously unknown function of Sam68, a versatile protein that preferentially resides in the nucleus, in the early nuclear signaling cascade following DNA damage. Furthermore, we previously reported that Sam68 is important for the promoter selectivity and transcriptional specificity of NF-κB in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Sam68 could work at both initiating of NF-κB activation and controlling the NF-κB transactivation potential in the DNA damage-induced NF-κB signaling pathway; thus playing a critical role in the genotoxic stress-initiated “nuclear to cytoplasmic to nuclear” NF-κB activation. Of note, tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF/TNFR) signaling was revealed to be important for a feed-forward response to DNA damage, supported by DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of several well-known components of TNF/TNFR signaling pathway including TRAF2, p62, RIP1, and CYLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beli et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Sam68 has been proposed to be crucial for the recruitment of RIP1 to the TNF receptor in TNF-triggered NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramakrishnan and Baltimore, 2011</xref>). The involvement of Sam68 in both TNF/TNFR signaling and genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling indicates that it could be a crucial molecule conferring the crosstalk between TNF/TNFR signaling pathway and DNA damage responses.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model representation of Sam68 functioning as an early signaling molecule in genotoxic stress-initiated NF-κB signaling pathway.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15018.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15018.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15018-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>We demonstrated that, compared to <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells, <italic>Khdrbs1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> CECs are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress, since Sam68 deletion abolishes the DNA damage-initiated NF-κB signaling and attenuates the inducible expression of anti-apoptotic genes.

Aberrant NF-κB activation and elevated expression of NF-κB target genes, in particular those encoding anti-apoptotic molecules, have been acknowledged as key factors facilitating colon cancer survival and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Townson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zubair and Frieri, 2013</xref>). Here we report that the levels of Sam68, phospho-p65 (indicative of NF-κB activation), anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-XL and XIAP are all elevated in colon tumors in comparison to adjacent normal tissue derived from genetically susceptible <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice and human colon cancer patients. Of note, the positive correlation between Sam68 levels and PAR levels, as well as phospho-p65 levels in human colon cancers suggests that Sam68 could be essential for the development and survival of colon cancer, considering the pivotal function of Sam68 in orchestrating the intrinsic DNA damage-initiated NF-κB signaling and transactivation. In support of this notion, knockdown of Sam68, PARP1, and p65 in human colon cancer cells significantly reduces the basal and genotoxic stress-induced PAR production, NF-κB activation, and expression of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-XL and XIAP, thus leading to spontaneous and DNA damage-induced apoptosis in Sam68-downregulated colon cancer cells. Moreover, genetic deletion of Sam68 and inhibition of PARP1 markedly reduces the development and survival of colon tumors in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice, further supporting the pivotal role of Sam68-conferred PAR-dependent NF-κB activation in colon tumorigenesis.</p><p>In spite of the crucial role of PARP1 in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation, DNA repair, and other cellular responses, the precise mechanisms of the activation and regulation of PARP1 remains elusive. We show here that Sam68 deficiency significantly attenuates DNA damage-induced PARP1 activation and PAR production, which suggests that Sam68, as an early signaling regulator, governs the genotoxic stress-stimulated PARP1 activity. In particular, the PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling cascade is dampened in Sam68 deleted cells, as well as PARP1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the reduction in anti-apoptotic gene expression and increase in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis are observed in Sam68 knockout cells and PARP1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stilmann et al., 2009</xref>), in line with the impeded PAR-dependent NF-κB signaling in these cells. Furthermore, Sam68 knockout and PARP1 inhibition both attenuates colon tumor development in <italic>Apc</italic><sup>min716/+</sup> mice. Such similarity in the phenotypes of Sam68- and PARP1-deficient cells and animals in response to genotoxic stresses further supports the notion that Sam68 is a crucial regulator of PARP1 in cellular response to genotoxic stress. Elevated Sam68 levels correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis in multiple cancer patients and overexpression of Sam68 has been proposed as a prognostic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>); however, the significance of Sam68 in tumorigenesis is still obscure.

Importantly, we establish proof-of-concept showing that manipulation of Sam68 sensitizes colon cancer to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sam68 is an RNA-binding protein primarily localized in the nucleus that under particular circumstances can shuttle to the cytoplasm. Sam68 has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, from HIV replication to tumor progression. Although Sam68 has previously been shown to regulate tumor cell viability and carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which Sam68 regulates these process are poorly understood. Moreover, Sam68 regulates NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway in the cellular response to DNA damage, yet whether Sam68 regulates carcinogenesis through the regulation of NF-κB signaling is unknown.</p><p>In the submitted manuscript, Fu et al. showed that Sam68 regulates ADP ribose (PAR) polymer production and the PAR-dependent NF-κB transactivation of anti-apoptotic genes. As such, Sam68-deficient cells are hypersensitive to genotoxicity caused by DNA damaging agents. Importantly, this finding correlates with the high levels of Sam68 found in human colon cancer and with the results in which genetic deletion of Sam68 leads to decreased colon tumor burden in the Minapc mouse model.</p><p>Altogether, the paper is well written, the figures are clear and the organization is logical. Furthermore, the mechanistic results are relatively novel and strongly support their conclusions. Overall, this manuscript will be a strong contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that GFP-Sam68 expression in Sam68 KO cells reconstitutes CPT-induced IκBα degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The present data are not fully convincing. Further analyses, e.g. determination of p65 phosphorylation, NF-κB DNA binding activity or nuclear uptake are required to demonstrate that ectopic expression of Sam68 reconstitutes the PARP1/NF-κB axis in Sam68 KO cells.</p><p>2) In the first experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and D</xref>) cells were treated with 10 µM CPT, which is a typical concentration for cell culture experiments. However, later on the authors increase the CPT concentration to 100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,F,G</xref>), which might generate misleading results. Thus, these experiments have to be repeated with 10 µM CPT treatment.</p><p>3) The analysis of HCT116 cells indicates constitutive PARP1 and NF-κB activation. However, it has been shown previously by others that although HCT116 cells display a certain basal NF-κB activity, NF-κB can be significantly induced by genotoxic stress. Thus, it would be important to analyze if loss of Sam68 or PARP1 inhibitor olaparib treatment affects stimulus dependent NF-κB activation and subsequent Bcl-XL expression. Since ATM is the second crucial component of DNA damage induced NF-κB activation, the authors should also analyze if Sam68 affects ATM S1981 phosphorylation.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. The effective concentrations of PJ-34 for PAR inhibition (panel A) (2, 10 and 25 µM) and apoptosis induction (panel C) (25 and 50 µM) do not agree. The authors need to address this discrepancy.</p><p>5) Most of the conclusions are based on Western blots. Although some of them are quite clear, others are not. It will be important for the authors to quantify their results from the three independent repeats and show that their results are significant. Furthermore, it will be nice if some of the independent repeats are placed in the supplemental information. at least for the critical experiments. If the blots cannot be readily quantified (because they were developed on film and/or are overexposed), duplicates of all key experiments should be shown in the supplement. Also, blots should be cropped less closely.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors compare colon tumor tissue with adjacent normal colon tissue, both from mice and patient material and analyze different features of PARP1/NF-κB signaling. Although the observations fit with previous findings, these data are only correlative, which the authors should acknowledge.</p><p>2) Ramakrishnan and Baltimore (2011) showed that NF-κB activation induced by TNF but not IL-1 is greatly reduced in Sam68 knockout cells (via receptor proximal interaction, Sam68 was proposed to promote RIPK1 and cIAP1 recruitment). Could a similar mechanism play a role in the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade that is co-required for DNA damage induced NF-κB activation?</p><p>3) The effect of CPT treatment (10 µM, 2 h) on IκBα expression differs between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (lane 1 and 2) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (lane 1 and 4). It has to be clarified if 10 µM CPT is sufficient to induce IκBα.</p><p>4) The immunoblot analysis of IKKγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) indicates that IKKγ is preferentially located in the nucleus, which is quite unusual. Is this also true for IKKα and IKKβ? Most likely, the blots are mixed up.</p><p>5) The authors could discuss that LRP16 has been described as a crucial regulator of DNA damage induced NF-κB activation, by binding to PARP1 and IKK (Wu et al. 2015). Could LRP16, as well as the Ku antigens, be mechanistically linked to Sam68?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: The figure caption must have been switched (<italic>-/-</italic> versus <italic>+/-</italic> Sam68).</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: Why is the 'GFP only' signal around 27 kDa seen in all lanes?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>: Olaparib is normally used in concentrations between 1 and 10 µM. The authors should explain why they use 20 µM in their experiments.</p><p>9) The Introduction is quite convoluted. In particular the first paragraph. It will be important to write this section more clearly for readers that are not that familiar with the topic.</p><p>10) Why does the ΔC mutant interact with PARP1 if it is located in the cytoplasm?</p><p>11) The authors demonstrated that Sam68 is required for PARP1 activation and PAR production. Taking into account that Sam68 appears to have many functions and may be involved in a variety of cellular processes, it would be interesting to better understand how SAM68 contributes to PARP1 activation. Is Sam68 recruited to DNA lesions, together with PARP1? Does loss of Sam68 affect recruitment of PARP1 to DNA lesions? Although these revisions are not deemed essential, they would certainly flesh out the mechanism. The authors are therefore encouraged to add such data if they have them or if they are readily obtainable.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sam68/KHDRBS1 is critical for colon tumorigenesis by regulating genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The authors have performed a number of new analyses, satisfying most of the issues that were raised. However, new results that are now included raise problems that have to be solved in a second round of revision:</p><p>1) One control experiment that was asked for was to analyze ATM activation. They now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref> that knockdown of Sam68 in HCT116 cells causes a significant attenuation of ATM phosphorylation. If Sam68 is needed for ATM activation, then this alone, without considering PARP1, could explain that Sam68 deletion blunts NF-κB activation by DNA damage.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> they show that the PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib strongly reduces ATM phosphorylation in HCT116 cells. This observation is completely unexpected. The Stilmann et al. paper (cited in the manuscript) shows in Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that two different PARP1 inhibitors did not affect ATM phosphorylation and that ATM phosphorylation was not affected by PARP1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, input). If the authors wish to maintain their claim that PARP1 activity is needed for ATM activation, they have to include further experiments, including the analysis of additional cell types. How would PARP1 control ATM activation? Thus, either additional experiments have to be performed or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> should be removed. The clarification of these points is important, since Olaparib has been approved as cancer drug. To my knowledge, it is not known that Olaparib blocks ATM activation.</p><p>3) The authors have shown no data to support their claim that IKKβ is degraded in the absence of Sam68 after CPT treatment. All they show is that its expression goes down. The reviewers did not notice this important point in the first round of review.</p><p>4) Size marker positions and the SUMOylated IKKγ signal. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> this signal is slightly above 55 kDa (which is small considering the migration of unmodified IKKγ). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is at 70 kDa. Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the PARP1 signal in the nuclear fraction is extremely faint.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sam68/KHDRBS1 is critical for colon tumorigenesis by regulating genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter as the Senior editor and the Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is still one remaining issue. In the second round of review, point 1, it was noted: &quot;If Sam68 is needed for ATM activation, then this alone, without considering PARP1, could explain that Sam68 deletion blunts NF-κB activation by DNA damage.&quot; In other words, the authors had not formally addressed whether the effect of Sam68 on NF-κB goes via ATM or PARP1, and they did nothing in the revision to address this point experimentally. Given that PARP1 is required for NF-κB signaling and they show that Sam68 is upstream of PARP1, their interpretation is reasonable. However, they should discuss the possibility that alternatively, or in addition, Sam68 may also be operating via the ATM branch. This is particularly relevant given that the published literature (Stillman et al., 2009) reports that PARP1 activity is not required for ATM activation (see point 2 in re-review). Please add a few sentences to the Discussion to make readers aware of these issues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors claim that GFP-Sam68 expression in Sam68 KO cells reconstitutes CPT-induced IκBα degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Could a similar mechanism play a role in the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade that is co-required for DNA damage induced NF-κB activation?</italic></p><p>The reviewers’ interesting hypothesis stimulates more in-depth discussion about the distinct functions of Sam68 in multiple NF-κB activation signaling pathways. We showed that Sam68 interacts with PARP1 and IKKγ in the signaling complex after DNA damage; previous studies from the Miyamoto lab demonstrate that the translocation of IKKγ and ATM from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade leading to NF-κB activation (Wu et al. Science 2006). Therefore, Sam68 could complex with the cytoplasmically translocated IKKγ-ATM complex and execute additional important functions for NF-κB activation and signaling in the cytoplasm. Based on our results from the subcellular fractionation experiments, we <italic>did not</italic> observe an obvious translocation of Sam68 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during a 3-hour period following CPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, in our pilot experiments, we failed to detect the interaction between ATM and Sam68, when conducting the immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays using the cytoplasmic subcellular fraction derived from CPT-treated cells (see the Figure below). These results indicate that Sam68 might not execute an additional function in the cytoplasm via participating in the cytoplasmic ATM-dependent cascade for DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation. Instead, as supported by our presented results, Sam68 plays an important role in the early signaling cascade in the nucleus to facilitate the NF-κB-activating signaling complex assembly. The distinct roles of Sam68 in the different subcellular signaling cascades for NF-κB activation induced by DNA damage versus TNF receptor engagement could indicate the existence of stimulus-dependent post-translational modifications.

The reviewers were correct that the majority of IKKγ, as well as IKKα and IKKβ, are located in the cytoplasm in mouse primary colon epithelial cells (CECs), like other cell types. It is noteworthy that a substantial amount of IKKγ is located in the nucleus, albeit not profound as that in the cytoplasm. Slightly different distribution patterns of certain proteins in the subcellular localizations have been noticed in multiple cell types; therefore, we believe that the observed subcellular localization of IKKγ in mouse CECs is cell context-dependent. Consistently, our repeated experiments demonstrate that genotoxic stress induced IKKγ translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is profound in Sam68-sufficient CECs, in contrast to the significantly attenuated IKKγ cytoplasmic translocation in Sam68-deleted cells (the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), thus supporting the critical role of Sam68 in DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation signaling in the nucleus.</p><p><italic>5) The authors could discuss that LRP16 has been described as a crucial regulator of DNA damage induced NF-κB activation, by binding to PARP1 and IKK (Wu et al. 2015). Could LRP16, as well as the Ku antigens, be mechanistically linked to Sam68?</italic></p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, Wu and colleagues recently reported that leukemia related protein 16 (LRP16) is a crucial regulator of DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation by binding to PARP1 and IKKγ (Wu et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2015).

It is noteworthy that nuclear proteins (including PARP1) and cytoplasmic proteins (including Sam68 (ΔC) mutant) were lysed together and subjected to immunoprecipitation/immunoblot, when we carried out the structural functional analyses to map the essential domain(s) in Sam68 that confers the Sam68-PARP1 interaction. In the lysed cells without nuclear boundary, Sam68 (ΔC) mutant and PARP1 were therefore available to each other under this condition. Because Sam68 (ΔC) mutant contains the required domain(s) to bind PARP1, we observed the “apparent” Sam68 (ΔC)-PARP1 interaction in the immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays. Of note, similar to the pulldown assays using recombinant proteins, our immunoprecipitation/immunoblot assays only suggest that Sam68 (ΔC) mutant with the required domain(s) harbors the capability to interact with PARP1. However, in the truly intact cells, as pointed by the reviewers, Sam68 (ΔC) mutant and PARP1 are preferentially localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively, and they do not interact, therefore ectopic expression of Sam68 (ΔC) mutant fails to reconstitute DNA damage-induced IκBα degradation in Sam68 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>11) The authors demonstrated that Sam68 is required for PARP1 activation and PAR production. Taking into account that Sam68 appears to have many functions and may be involved in a variety of cellular processes, it would be interesting to better understand how SAM68 contributes to PARP1 activation. Is Sam68 recruited to DNA lesions, together with PARP1? Does loss of Sam68 affect recruitment of PARP1 to DNA lesions? Although these revisions are not deemed essential, they would certainly flesh out the mechanism. The authors are therefore encouraged to add such data if they have them or if they are readily obtainable.</italic></p><p>We appreciate that the reviewers have suggested several very insightful experiments to further address the interesting question on how Sam68 contributes to PARP1 activation. While we have some preliminary results that could answer some of these questions and are actively following these directions, we feel that to fully answer these questions is out of the scope of our current study to illustrate a novel role of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation and colon tumor survival. Once the essential role of Sam68 in early DNA damage signaling is established, we will be more than happy to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms on how Sam68 contributes to PARP1 activation, globally and locally, in our follow-up studies.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>The authors have performed a number of new analyses, satisfying most of the issues that were raised. However, new results that are now included raise problems that have to be solved in a second round of revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One control experiment that was asked for was to analyze ATM activation. They now show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref> that knockdown of Sam68 in HCT116 cells causes a significant attenuation of ATM phosphorylation. If Sam68 is needed for ATM activation, then this alone, without considering PARP1, could explain that Sam68 deletion blunts NF-κB activation by DNA damage.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have examined the impact of Sam68 knockout on DNA damage-induced ATM activation. Our results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref> demonstrate that Sam68 deletion substantially attenuates DNA damage-triggered ATM activation, as indicated by ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation, in MEFs and mouse primary thymocytes, which, together with our other data in the manuscript, further support the essential role of Sam68 in early DNA damage signaling. Of note, one previous study from the Poirier laboratory showed that ATM possesses PAR-binding motifs thus interacting with PARP1 in DNA damage response and that ATM activation depends on DNA damage-triggered PARP1 activation and subsequent PAR production (Haince et al. J Biol Chem. 2007 282: 16441-16453). We speculate that the attenuated ATM activation could result from the defective PARP1 activation and PAR synthesis in Sam68 knockout cells that we have demonstrated in our other results included in the manuscript, although we could not rule out the possibility that Sam68 may regulates ATM activation directly. Therefore these results also support our claim that Sam68 is a key NF-κB regulator in genotoxic stress-initiated signaling pathway and crucial for DNA damage-stimulated PAR production and the PAR-dependent NF-κB activation.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15018.026</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type (WT) and Sam68 knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were γ-irradiated (IR) at 4 Gy and whole cell lysates were derived at indicated time points post IR and immunoblotted (IB) for the indicated proteins, with β-actin as a loading control.

This observation is completely unexpected. The Stilmann et al. paper (cited in the manuscript) shows in Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that two different PARP1 inhibitors did not affect ATM phosphorylation and that ATM phosphorylation was not affected by PARP1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, input). If the authors wish to maintain their claim that PARP1 activity is needed for ATM activation, they have to include further experiments, including the analysis of additional cell types. How would PARP1 control ATM activation? Thus, either additional experiments have to be performed or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> should be removed. The clarification of these points is important, since Olaparib has been approved as cancer drug. To my knowledge, it is not known that Olaparib blocks ATM activation.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that since Olaparib has been approved as a cancer drug, it is important to examine the available data carefully and a substantial amount of future studies are needed to better understand the effect of Olaparib on DNA damage signaling, particularly in regards to ATM activation. However, the relationship between PARP1 and ATM activation is not the major claim of our current work, we have taken the reviewers’ and editors’ suggestion and removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> panel from the revised manuscript. While we may not fully agree with the reviewers’ interpretation of the data shown in Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 7 in the Stillmann paper (Stillmann et al. Mol Cell 2009 36: 365-378), the suggested removal of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> panel will not affect our major conclusions. The differences in our observations and the Stillmann paper could be caused by a variety of factors, such as exposure time of the western blot, the antibodies being used, and likely the difference in the dose of IR used. The 80 Gy dose used by the Stillmann paper is substantially higher than the dose we used (10 Gy), which may result in a saturated DNA damage signal (including the activation of ATM). This could account for the lack of observed difference in the phosphorylation of ATM in the WT versus PARP1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (as well as the untreated versus PARP1 inhibitor-treated cells). We feel these points, combined with the previously mentioned evidence in the Haince paper which suggests that ATM activation is dependent on PAR production, are sufficient to support our data regarding the decrease in ATM activation following Olaparib treatment; however as this is not our main point and does not affect our overall conclusions, we have respectfully removed this data from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The authors have shown no data to support their claim that IKKΒ is degraded in the absence of Sam68 after CPT treatment. All they show is that its expression goes down. The reviewers did not notice this important point in the first round of review.</italic></p><p>We assumed the concern is that we need to provide additional evidence further supporting our claim that IκBα is degraded in the presence of Sam68 after CPT treatment (as we do not currently show any data involving IKKΒ). Our additional experimental results show that CPT treatment induces significant decrease in the levels of IκBα in the DMSO vehicle control-pretreated WT MEFs, whereas the CPT-dependent reduction in IκBα levels is fully blocked by a pretreatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. These data, consistent with numerous previous studies, strengthen our claim that IκBα is degraded after CPT treatment.

Given that PARP1 is required for NF-κB signaling and they show that Sam68 is upstream of PARP1, their interpretation is reasonable. However, they should discuss the possibility that alternatively, or in addition, Sam68 may also be operating via the ATM branch.
