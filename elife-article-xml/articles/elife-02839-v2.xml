However, the functional role of Cdc42 in synaptic plasticity and in behaviors such as learning and memory are not well understood. Here we report that postnatal forebrain deletion of Cdc42 leads to deficits in synaptic plasticity and in remote memory recall using conditional knockout of Cdc42. We found that deletion of Cdc42 impaired LTP in the Schaffer collateral synapses and postsynaptic structural plasticity of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally, loss of Cdc42 did not affect memory acquisition, but instead significantly impaired remote memory recall. Together these results indicate that the postnatal functions of Cdc42 may be crucial for the synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, which contribute to the capacity for remote memory recall.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02839.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02839.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02839.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses, which are typically formed between the dendrite of one neuron and the axon terminus of another. The dendrites are protrusions coming out of the cell body that receive inputs from other cells; the axon is a cable-like structure that enables neurons to contact other cells. In excitatory neurons in part of the brain called the hippocampus, the dendrites are themselves covered in structures called spines, so most synapses are formed between an axon terminus (belonging to the presynaptic cell) and a dendritic spine (on the postsynaptic cell). The hippocampus is necessary for the formation of long-term memories.</p><p>The strength of a synapse can increase or decrease over time—a property that is called synaptic plasticity. Changes in the strength of synapses are thought to underlie learning and memory, and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength involve increases or decreases in the number and size of dendritic spines. Such changes are possible because spines have an internal skeleton that can be assembled and disassembled in a matter of minutes. This ‘remodeling’ process is regulated by a family of enzymes called small GTPases. One of these, known as Cdc42, has been shown to promote the formation and maintenance of spines in cell culture, but its role in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory remains unknown.</p><p>Now, Kim, Wang et al. have used genetically modified mice who have had Cdc42 deleted from excitatory neurons in their forebrain to examine the functions of this enzyme in living animals. These ‘knockout’ mice showed a small but statistically significant reduction in the number of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. They also showed smaller changes in spine volume and impaired long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.</p><p>When the mice performed long-term memory tests where they learnt to associate a specific set of visual cues with an impending electric shock, the knockout mice performed well for up to a few days. However, when tested again on the same task 45 days later, the knockout mice did not perform as well as normal mice. This is surprising, given the presumed role of long-term synaptic plasticity in learning and memory, and indicates that Cdc42 is required for ‘remote memory’, the form of memory lasting for many days. Similar results were obtained with another memory test using a water maze, where the animals have to remember the location of a hidden platform. Normal mice remember the location for more than 30 days. In contrast, the knockout mice could only remember the location for a few days.</p><p>As well as providing the first demonstration of the role of Cdc42 in synaptic plasticity in live animals, the work of Kim, Wang et al. has provided new insights into the functions of this enzyme in memory. Further work is required to determine how Cdc42 interacts with other proteins present at synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02839.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02839.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>small GTPase</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>structural plasticity</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS068410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH080047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS059957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soderling</surname><given-names>Scott H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH103374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soderling</surname><given-names>Scott H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH095090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditional knockout of the small GTPase Cdc42 in excitatory neurons of the mouse forebrain leads to impaired long-term synaptic plasticity and impaired retrieval of remote memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synapse is a highly dynamic structure exhibiting constant turn over and remodeling.

Previous studies using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM) have demonstrated continuous activation of Cdc42 for more than 30 min within single dendritic spines undergoing structural plasticity.

Little, however, is known about the postnatal roles of Cdc42 in dendritic spines under physiological conditions. Additionally, the effects of deletion of Cdc42 on behavioral characteristics such as learning and memory have not been examined.</p><p>In the present study, by using Cdc42 conditional KO mice, we evaluate how postnatal disruption of Cdc42 in excitatory neurons affects structural plasticity of dendritic spines and synaptic plasticity.

However, in neurons expressing EGFP-Cre, the volume change was significantly impaired (8 ± 5%, p&lt;0.05). In another set of experiments, we expressed mEGFP-Cdc42 together with mCherry and EGFP-Cre. We found that structural plasticity in these neurons was similar to those paired neurons in which EGFP and mEGFP were expressed instead of EGFP-Cre and mEGFP-Cdc42 (64 ± 20% vs 63 ± 23%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Thus, the impaired structural plasticity in neurons expressing EGFP-Cre was caused by removal of Cdc42 and exogenous Cdc42 can rescue the effect.

Together, both the fear conditioning and water maze tests indicate that postnatal deletion of Cdc42 in forebrain excitatory neurons does not cause defects in initial memory acquisition or long-term memory retention.

Cdc42 is one of the small GTPase proteins present in the dendritic spine, and is well known for its actin remodeling functions. Because our previous study demonstrated an intensive activation of Cdc42 specifically within the spine head following single spine glutamate uncaging stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>), we expected that Cdc42 cKO neurons may show specific defects in activity-dependent spine enlargement. In line with this hypothesis, glutamate uncaging-induced spine plasticity was markedly disrupted in both the transient and sustained phase of spine enlargement upon postnatal deletion of Cdc42. Electrophysiological LTP with <italic>Cdc42</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice also confirmed a plasticity deficit upon Cdc42 deletion, indicating that Cdc42 activation is pivotal for both activity-dependent morphogenesis of spines and in the functional synaptic plasticity.

However, in contrary to this hypothesis, the spine loss in cKO neurons was very mild: only 8% reduction in spine density was found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, there was no detectable change in spine density in medial prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex of the cKO mice. This stands in contrast to our prior findings in <italic>ArpC3</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice, which exhibit a loss of approximately 50% of spines in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Comparing these results suggest that although <italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic> drives the loss of floxed alleles in both regions, Cdc42 signaling is specifically involved in rapid time-scale spine morphing/maintaining processes during the neuronal activation but, unlike Arp2/3, it is not strongly involved in the long-term maintenance of spine morphology in mature neurons. This observation suggests functional characteristics of Cdc42 strongly dependent on the developmental status of neuron. During the early developmental stages, Cdc42 is reported to be essential for the morphogenesis and polarity establishment of neurons that leads to a permanent change of cell shapes and locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mueller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwamborn and Puschel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garvalov et al., 2007</xref>). However, during the postnatal period, Cdc42 activity may be functionally restricted to manage activity-dependent changes of actin dynamics that governs aspects of synaptic plasticity rather than gross maintenance of spines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Behavioral alterations by postnatal Cdc42 deletion</title><p>Even though the hippocampi of <italic>Cdc42</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice showed robust deficits in both structural and functional measurements of synaptic plasticity, the cKO mice surprisingly displayed normal performances in many behavioral tests, including those for working memory and memory acquisition. Remote memory as determined by both the fear conditioning and water maze tests, however, was significantly diminished in the Cdc42 cKO mice. How does the loss of Cdc42 lead to the deficit in the process of remote memory? Two explanations are possible to account for the remote memory defect of the cKO mice: a memory storage defect, or a remote memory retention and retrieval problem. Normal performances in learning and intact working memory of the cKO mice suggest that memory formation and storage processing appears not to be altered by Cdc42 deletion, although it should be noted we did observe a slight delay in long-term memory formation that was specific to the water maze reversal test. We speculate the retention or the retrieval capacities for the remote memory are most likely affected in <italic>Cdc42</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice.</p><p>Notably, a line of studies have found that hippocampal lesions impair recent memory such as short- and long-term memories, whereas the lesions do not affect remote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Squire and Alvarez, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knowlton and Fanselow, 1998</xref>). This ‘graded retrograde amnesia’ supports an idea that remote memory retrieval may be independent of hippocampal functions. This finding is opposite to the behavioral phenotype observed in <italic>Cdc42</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: Camk2a-Cre</italic> mice. However, other studies using human patients who have medial temporal lobe (MTL) damages find these patients exhibit a memory loss without any temporal gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosenbaum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moscovitch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Winocur et al., 2010</xref>), revealing that the retrograde amnesia is not always graded. Moreover, a recent study showed the hippocampus is tightly involved in the retrieval of remote memory. Remote memory recall was affected by a temporal and precise optogenetic inhibition of CA1 excitatory neurons in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goshen et al., 2011</xref>). If Cdc42 is critically involved in the neuronal activation during the process of remote memory retrieval, Cdc42 loss may result in a remote memory defect with normal learning and working memory.</p><p>Rac and Cdc42 share similar downstream pathways: both Rac and Cdc42 can remodel actin via the p21 Kinase (PAK) and LIMK pathway to inactivate cofilin-mediated actin severing or by stimulating the WAVE1/ N-WASP pathway to activate Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization. Both pathways are implicated in synaptic plasticity and are thought to be critical for processes important for learning and memory. Thus it has remained unclear as to whether Rac or Cdc42 can be distinguished from each other at the level of behavioral phenotypes in intact animals. It is of interest, therefore, to compare the results reported here with the analogous <italic>Rac1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup><italic>: CamKllα-Cre</italic> mice previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haditsch et al., 2009</xref>). Loss of Rac1 results in impaired hippocampal LTP similar to our findings in the Cdc42 cKO mice. Surprisingly, however, the behavioral impairments are quite different. Loss of Rac1 results in impaired working memory, but has no effect on long-term or remote memory. This is in stark contrast to the Cdc42 cKO mice which display normal working memory, but are impaired in remote memory. Together, these findings reveal that although the biochemical pathways that modulate actin remodeling evoked by synaptic activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 may overlap, their functions during learning and memory are clearly distinguishable from the other, with little overlap. Further work will be required to define how the physiologic relevance of Rac1 and Cdc42 are functionally segregated during these processes despite their similar biochemical pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Conditional Cdc42 knockout animals were generously provided by Dr Cord Brakebusch (University of Copenhagan).

Then, 350 µm slices were cut with a tissue chopper (Ted Pella, Inc.; Redding, CA) and transferred to the surface of membrane inserts (EMD Millipore; Darmstadt, Germany), and placed in culture media containing (mM): L-glutamine 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 2, D-glucose 12.9, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 5.2, Na-HEPES 30, insulin 0.001, Ascorbic acid 0.53, 20% heat-inactivated horse serum, 80% HEPES-based MEM 8.4 g/l (pH 7.35, 320 Osm). Slice-containing plates were maintained in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 5–10 days after incubation, cultures were transfected biolistically with a gene gun. To make bullets, 40–50 µg DNA were mixed with 8–12 mg 1.6 µm gold particles (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA). Amount of DNA used was: 20 µg EGFP + 20 µg mCherry (Control); 20 µg EGFP-Cre + 20 µg mCherry (Cdc42 knockout); 20 µg EGFP + 20 µg mCherry + 10 µg monomeric EGFP (mEGF) (Control for rescue); 20 µg EGFP-Cre + 20 µg mCherry + 10 µg mEGFP-Cdc42 (rescue).

The beads were collected by centrifugation (1500×g/1 min), and the supernatant was removed and the pellet was rinsed with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling the samples in SDS loading buffer (1 M Tris–HCl [pH 6.8], 10% [vol/vol] SDS, 50% [vol/vol] glycerol, 5% [vol/vol] 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1% [vol/vol] bromophenol blue).</p><p>For Western blotting, 10 μg of samples were electrophoresed through 12% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman; Pittsburgh, PA), and nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TRIS-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween-20. For detection, the membranes were probed with rabbit anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz; Dallas, TX) and mouse anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (BD; San Jose, CA) for 24 hr at 4°C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Pittsburgh, PA) for 2 hr, washed, and then developed using the ECL system (Thermo Scientific; Waltham, MA).

Med-Associates mouse fear conditioning chambers were used for conditioning and testing. The tests consist of three sessions: conditioning (day 1), long-term fear memory tests (day 2-day 5), and remote fear memory test (day 45). Following a 2 min acclimation in the conditioning chamber, mice received a 0.4 mA scrambled foot shock for 2 s. Each mouse remained in the chamber for an additional 30 s before being placed into its home cage. Fear memory testing was conducted daily for 4 days by placing the mice in the conditioning chamber for 5 min in the absence of foot shock. The remote memory was tested at 45 days after the conditioning. Freezing rate was analyzed by trained observers who were blind to the genotypes of mice using Noldus Observer (Noldus Information Technology; Wageningen, Netherlands) software. Freezing was defined by criteria previously described for mice as the absence of all visible movement except that required for respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostaras et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>Morris water maze task was conducted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Porton et al., 2010</xref>). A 120 cm diameter water tank was used. Opaque water in the tank was maintained at 25°C. The water pool was divided into four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, and SW). A 12 cm diameter round platform was submerged 1 cm below the water surface and 20 cm apart from the wall of the water tank at the NE quadrant. Testing consisted of three sessions: acquisition and probe trials (day 1-day 8), reversal acquisition and reversal probe trials (day 9-day 16), and remote probe trials (day 37). 1 week prior to testing, all mice were handled daily for 5 min and then were placed in a pan of shallow water (1 cm) for 30 s to acclimate them to water. On the seventh day after handling, each mouse was placed onto the hidden platform in the NE quadrant for 20 s and then allowed to swim freely for 60 s before being returned to the platform for 15 s. Acquisition testing consisted of 32 trials given across 8 days with four trials administered per day. Trials were run in pairs, with each pair separated by 60 min. Probe trials were conducted without platform at the end of days 2, 4, 6 and 8. Reversal acquisition and reversal probe tests were conducted same way as the acquisition/probe tests described above, but the platform location was moved from NE to SW. Remote test was conducted at day 37. For each trial, the release point for the animals was randomized across seven equally spaced points along the perimeter of the maze. All test trials were 1 min in duration. The swim distance, swim time were determined by Noldus Ethovision (Noldus Information Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Y-maze</title><p>Y-maze test was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze was conducted under indirect illumination (80–90 lux) in a 3-arm Y-maze. The mouse was placed into the center arm of the maze and permitted free exploration for 5 min. Entry into an arm was defined as the mouse being more than 1 body length into that arm, with both hind-paws past the entrance to that arm. An arm alternation was defined as three successive entries into each of the different arms. Alternation, calculated as the total number of alternations divided by the total number of arm entries minus 2, was expressed as a percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Open field test (OFT)</title><p>OFT was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Kim and colleagues examined the role of Cdc42 in synaptic plasticity in mature neurons and in behaviors such as learning and memory in adult animals. Consistent with previous results using RNAi, the authors show that postnatal loss of Cdc42 interferes with LTP-induced spine structural enlargements in juvenile animals. Using field recordings, they further show that these structural deficits are accompanied by functional deficits – a complete loss of LTP in Schaffer collateral pathway. Surprisingly, despite these dramatic changes in plasticity in juvenile animals, they found only a small, but significant, decrease in spine density in the hippocampus in adults and no change in spine density in the PFC. Remarkably, adult animals show a dramatic and selective impairment of remote memory following postnatal loss of Cdc42, despite that locomotor activity, memory acquisition, anxiety level and working/long-term memories are preserved.</p><p>This is a well-written written and carefully executed study that addresses an interesting and important question on the role of Cdc42 once neurons have matured. Overall, the data are convincing, and the experiments are well-planned. A specific deficit in remote memory is fascinating and future studies with these animals could significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of remote memory retention/retrieval.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors show selective decrease in hippocampal spine density following Cdc42 depletion in the forebrain. They further show that structural plasticity in spines is impaired after cdc42 deletion. This is interesting however major questions remain open: are these changes in structural plasticity in spines underlie the impairments in functional synaptic plasticity (LTP) and behavior? If so is the permanent decrease in dendritic spine density or the lack in spine plasticity responsible for such impairments?</p><p>An experiment that will considerably contribute to answering these questions will be to examine whether stimulation leading to LTP or behavioral training lead to changes in spine structure and density. If so whether there is a different between the cdc42 depleted mice and wt mice and whether over expression of the cdc42 in cdc42 KO mice can rescue LTP and behavior and the impairments in changes in spine morphology? Alternatively, although less ideally, the abstract and conclusions should be revised to better match the data (i.e. suggesting at most a 'possible' or 'plausible' link).</p><p>2) It is not clear why the authors concentrate only on hippocampal LTP and spine morphology and density. They show in their behavioral results that remote memory, but not short- and long-term memories, is impaired in cdc42 depleted mice. However, whereas recent memories depend on the hippocampus remote memory storage and retrieval are mediated by the cortex. Specific cortical sites are activated by remote memory processes and such activation is absent in mice with remote memory deficits (e.g. Frankland et al., 2004).

They further show that structural plasticity in spines is impaired after cdc42 deletion</italic>. <italic>This is interesting however major questions remain open: are these changes in structural plasticity in spines underlie the impairments in functional synaptic plasticity (LTP) and behavior? If so is the permanent decrease in dendritic spine density or the lack in spine plasticity responsible for such impairments?</italic></p><p>We agree that the link between LTP, structural plasticity, and an animal’s learning and memory is not directly addressed in this paper. These are the questions that have been asked in the field for the past decades and we believe that this paper significantly improves our knowledge about these questions.</p><p><italic>An experiment that will considerably contribute to answering these questions will be to examine whether stimulation leading to LTP or behavioral training lead to changes in spine structure and density. If so whether there is a different between the cdc42 depleted mice and wt mice and whether over expression of the cdc42 in cdc42 KO mice can rescue LTP and behavior and the impairments in changes in spine morphology? Alternatively, although less ideally, the abstract and conclusions should be revised to better match the data (i.e. suggesting at most a 'possible' or 'plausible' link)</italic>.</p><p>It has been known that LTP-inducing stimulus can cause spine volume increase and new spine formation. However, imaging spines in the hippocampus of live animals before and after learning are still challenging without removing a significant portion of the cortex. Also, it is believed that only a small fraction of spines contributed to learning of one specific context in the hippocampus. Thus, with currently available techniques, it is extremely difficult to answer these questions. Also, rescuing synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in Cdc42 KO by re-expressing exogenous Cdc42 via virus is a great idea but technically challenging for large structures such as the hippocampus and negative results will not add any insights.</p><p>Therefore, following an alternative suggestion that was kindly provided by the referees, we addressed these issues by removing the claim of the causality link between impaired synaptic plasticity and loss of remote memory in the abstract and conclusions as follows:</p><p>“… We found that deletion of Cdc42 impaired LTP in the Schaffer collateral synapses and postsynaptic structural plasticity of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. Additionally, loss of Cdc42 did not affect memory acquisition, but instead significantly impaired remote memory recall. Together these results indicate that the postnatal functions of Cdc42 may be crucial for the synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, which contribute to the capacity for remote memory recall.” (Abstract)</p><p>“In the present study, we analyzed Cdc42 conditional knockout mice using physiological, morphological, and behavioral approaches, and demonstrated that the postnatal disruption of Cdc42 in excitatory neurons of the forebrain leads to a disruption of structural plasticity of dendritic spines, impaired synaptic plasticity, a reduction of the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus, and a pronounced deficit of remote memory performances in the cKO mice.” (Discussion)</p><p><italic>2) It is not clear why the authors concentrate only on hippocampal LTP and spine morphology and density. They show in their behavioral results that remote memory, but not short- and long-term memories, is impaired in cdc42 depleted mice. However, whereas recent memories depend on the hippocampus remote memory storage and retrieval are mediated by the cortex. Specific cortical sites are activated by remote memory processes and such activation is absent in mice with remote memory deficits (e.g. Frankland et al., 2004). Furthermore, inactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex disrupt contextual fear memory at remote, but not recent time points showing that this cortical site is required for remote memory</italic>.</p><p><italic>Since short- and long-term memories are intact in the cdc42 depleted mice but in contrast remote memory is impaired it would be important to examine the effects of the absence of cdc42 on synaptic and structural plasticity in cortex in addition to the hippocampus since the behavioral impairments indicate also on cortical functional impairments.

We performed additional experiments to test the expression pattern of Cre recombinase in our <italic>CamKIIα</italic>-Cre line in the hippocampus and neocortex by crossing <italic>CamKIIα</italic>-Cre mice with the <italic>Rosa26-loxP-tdTomato-loxP</italic> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We indeed found that some neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) show significant expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We further performed Golgi staining in ACC to measure spine density. However, we found no difference in spine density between wildtype and Cdc42 KO in the ACC, suggesting that the role of Cdc42 in spine morphology of the ACC is minimal. In the revised manuscript, we described these findings in the text as:</p><p>“To analyze the expression pattern of Cre recombinase at the adult stage (p60), the CamKllα-Cre mouse was crossed with the <italic>Rosa26-lox-stop-lox-tdTomato</italic> reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The cre-induced tdTomato expression was detected in cortical areas including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and CA1 region of hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).”</p><p>“No differences in spine density were found in either the mPFC or the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H-I and 2K-L</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, the authors show Cdc42 deletion leads to a reduction in the number of dendritic spines in the hippocampus but not in the medial prefrontal cortex.

However, at least in our hands, detecting 8% reduction of change in the number of synapses with mEPSCs frequency is not possible (for example, please see error bars of Szatmari et al., 2013, <italic>J. Neurosci</italic>). Also, as we discussed above, we found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also express Cre, but did not find any difference in spine density between control mice and Cdc42 KO mice.</p><p><italic>4) The description of the results in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>is confusing.
