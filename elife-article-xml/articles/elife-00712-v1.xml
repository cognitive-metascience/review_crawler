potentially attractive therapeutic targets for neglected parasitic diseases, including African trypanosomiasis caused by the protozoan, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. How to prioritize <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinases and quantify their intracellular engagement by small-molecule inhibitors remain unsolved problems. Here, we combine chemoproteomics and RNA interference to interrogate trypanosome kinases bearing a Cys-Asp-Xaa-Gly motif (CDXG kinases). We discovered that hypothemycin, a fungal polyketide previously shown to covalently inactivate a subset of human CDXG kinases, kills <italic>T. brucei</italic> in culture and in infected mice. Quantitative chemoproteomic analysis with a hypothemycin-based probe revealed the relative sensitivity of endogenous CDXG kinases, including <italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short and a previously uncharacterized kinase, <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1. RNAi-mediated knockdown demonstrated that both kinases are essential, but only <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1 is fully engaged by cytotoxic concentrations of hypothemycin in intact cells. Our study identifies <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1 as a therapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis and establishes a new chemoproteomic tool for interrogating CDXG kinases in their native context.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00712.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00712.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00712.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human African trypanosomiasis—commonly known as sleeping sickness—is a debilitating and potentially fatal tropical disease that is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by the single-celled parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of the tsetse fly. The infection takes its name from the disruption of the circadian clock that occurs early on in the disorder and leads to sleep disturbances. If left untreated, <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection leads to coma, organ failure and death.</p><p>Most of the existing pharmaceutical treatments for sleeping sickness were developed more than 50 years ago. However, they are only weakly absorbed into the bloodstream—meaning that high doses must be used—and they lead to unpleasant side effects. Moreover, the <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasite is developing resistance to existing drugs, so further research is needed to identify new therapeutic targets.</p><p>One promising option could be the parasite’s protein kinases. These enzymes, which add phosphate-based chemical groups to proteins, have a key role in regulating protein function and many of them are already being investigated as therapeutic targets for cancers and autoimmune diseases. <italic>T. brucei</italic> has 182 different kinases, suggesting a wealth of potential new targets. However, many of these are similar to human enzymes, and inhibiting the latter could lead to harmful side effects.</p><p>Now, Nishino et al. have produced a synthetic version of a microbially derived kinase inhibitor, called hypothemycin, and have shown that it kills <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells grown in culture. Hypothemycin also killed <italic>T. brucei</italic> in infected mice, completely curing the infection in one third of animals, although high doses of the drug led to side effects. Using a chemical biology approach and quantitative mass spectrometry, Nishino et al. found that the main target of hypothemycin was a previously unknown kinase that is essential for <italic>T. brucei</italic> survival. Although hypothemycin itself is probably unsuitable as a treatment due to its lack of specificity, the work of Nishino et al. suggests that its kinase targets deserve further investigation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00712.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00712.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>T. brucei</italic></kwd><kwd>chemoproteomics</kwd><kwd>hypothemycin</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taunton</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM071434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taunton</surname><given-names>Jack</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gushwa</surname><given-names>Nathan N</given-names></name><name><surname>Renslo</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name><name><surname>McKerrow</surname><given-names>James H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishino</surname><given-names>Mari</given-names></name><name><surname>Koupparis</surname><given-names>Kyriacos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Achievement Rewards for College Students Wells Fargo Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choy</surname><given-names>Jonathan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Genentech Predoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choy</surname><given-names>Jonathan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS 8P41 GM103481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingame</surname><given-names>Alma L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypothemycin, which inhibits a number of protein kinases, kills the <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites that cause sleeping sickness and reveals new therapeutic targets for the disorder.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a debilitating and fatal parasitic disease endemic to sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fevre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simarro et al., 2008</xref>). Caused by two subspecies of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the disease begins in the hemolymphatic system and later crosses the blood–brain barrier, resulting in sleep disturbances that deteriorate to coma and death. During the course of infection, the parasites evade the host immune system through periodic switching of the variable surface glycoprotein coat, making vaccination-based approaches unlikely to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor and Rudenko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</xref>). Currently, only four chemotherapeutics are approved for sleeping sickness. These therapies suffer from poor oral bioavailability, severe toxicity, and/or emerging resistance. Eflornithine, the only drug with a known mechanism of action, is also the only therapeutic for sleeping sickness approved in the last 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fairlamb, 2003</xref>). Although a combination of eflornithine and nifurtimox, a drug for American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease, caused by <italic>T. cruzi</italic>), was introduced in 2009 for <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection, no new drugs are near the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Priotto et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Protein kinases have been intensely pursued as therapeutic targets for cancer and autoimmune disease, and more than 15 kinase inhibitors have received FDA approval during the past decade. As in humans, protein phosphorylation in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is an essential regulatory mechanism and plays critical but poorly understood roles in its unique life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parsons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nett et al., 2009</xref>). The vast majority of the 182 protein kinases in <italic>T. brucei</italic> remain poorly characterized, and few have been interrogated in their native cellular context with small-molecule inhibitors. High-throughput screening and medicinal chemistry recently led to the discovery of SCYX-5070, the first reported protein kinase inhibitor with efficacy in a murine model of <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>). Affinity chromatography with an immobilized derivative suggested that SCYX-5070 binds at least six trypanosome kinases related to human mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cyclin-dependent kinases, although the extent to which SCYX-5070 engages these kinases in vivo is not known. Genetic studies in <italic>T. brucei</italic> have established essential roles for orthologs of several human kinases, including cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tu and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gourguechon and Wang, 2009</xref>), Aurora kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tu et al., 2006</xref>), polo-like kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2010</xref>), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ojo et al., 2008</xref>), casein kinase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Urbaniak, 2009</xref>), and DBF-2-related kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). High-throughput RNAi studies have implicated additional kinases in <italic>T. brucei</italic> proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mackey et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the knowledge gained from these studies, it is not clear which <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinases make the best therapeutic targets. Achieving sufficient potency to inhibit essential <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinases, while avoiding related human kinases, poses a significant challenge. Moreover, quantifying intracellular kinase engagement by small-molecule inhibitors in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is an unsolved problem. Pharmacological and chemoproteomic approaches are therefore needed to complement genetic studies in the search for new therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moellering and Cravatt, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Hypothemycin (<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a polyketide natural product that covalently inhibits a diverse subset of human kinases, including MEK, ERK, PDGFR, VEGFR2, and FLT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schirmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Winssinger and Barluenga, 2007</xref>). Hypothemycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>) and related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barluenga et al., 2010</xref>) have antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models, and one variant has entered clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). All hypothemycin-sensitive kinases have a common cysteine immediately preceding the catalytic DXG motif (where X is usually Phe or Leu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schirmer et al., 2006</xref>). A homologous CDXG motif is present in 48 of 518 human protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leproult et al., 2011</xref>). CDXG kinases are functionally diverse, encompassing Tyr, Ser/Thr, and dual-specificity kinases distributed throughout the kinome phylogenetic tree. The nucleophilic thiol of hypothemycin-sensitive CDXG kinases undergoes conjugate addition to the <italic>cis</italic>-enone, as revealed by a crystal structure of the ERK2/hypothemycin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rastelli et al., 2008</xref>). While the CDXG motif is necessary for potent inhibition by hypothemycin, it does not appear to be sufficient. One-third of human CDXG kinases were unaffected by hypothemycin variants screened at a concentration of 1 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barluenga et al., 2010</xref>). The selectivity of hypothemycin toward endogenous kinases in living cells remains unknown.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00712.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Potent trypanocidal activity of hypothemycin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hypothemycin (<bold>1</bold>) inhibits CDXG kinases via conjugate addition to the <italic>cis</italic>-enone.

Hypothemycin’s selectivity toward CDXG kinases prompted us to test its effects on <italic>T. brucei</italic> grown in culture. We reasoned that hypothemycin would enable pharmacological interrogation of a focused subset of kinases that are distributed throughout the kinome. Treatment of bloodstream form (BSF) parasites with increasing concentrations of hypothemycin for 24 hr caused a sharp reduction in cell density (EC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 170 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), principally resulting from cell death. Visual inspection revealed that cells treated for 5 hr with 500 nM hypothemycin were round and swollen, with the flagellum detached from the cell body. They died within 2 hr and did not recover even when transferred to media lacking hypothemycin (data not shown).</p><p>Previous studies with hypothemycin demonstrated activity in murine tumor xenograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>). We therefore tested hypothemycin in mice infected with <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Infected mice showed a dose-dependent reduction in parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and a 10 mg/kg dose administered once daily for 7 days prolonged survival of infected mice over 30 days, with a cure rate of 33% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). At a dose of 10 mg/kg or higher, signs of toxicity were evident in infected animals (weight loss, lethargy), precluding more aggressive dosing regimens. Although hypothemycin’s therapeutic window is narrow, likely due to inhibition of essential mammalian CDXG kinases (e.g., VEGFR2, MEK1/2), its potent trypanocidal activity in vitro and in vivo motivated us to search for trypanosomal hypothemycin-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Design and validation of a hypothemycin-based affinity probe</title><p>We hypothesized that hypothemycin’s trypanocidal effects were mediated by covalent inhibition of one or more <italic>T. brucei</italic> CDXG kinases and sought to identify its targets in an unbiased manner. In the crystal structure of hypothemycin bound to ERK2, the C4 methyl ether is solvent exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rastelli et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that this and other kinases would accommodate a larger group at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Moreover, once a kinase target has been validated genetically and subjected to high-throughput biochemical screens, demonstrating that a given inhibitor engages the endogenous kinase in intact cells is difficult or impossible; to our knowledge, this has not been accomplished for any <italic>T. brucei</italic> kinase inhibitor. To begin to address these challenges, we have applied a combination of pharmacology, quantitative chemoproteomics, and reverse genetics to the CDXG kinases, a focused yet phylogenetically diverse subset of all eukaryotic kinomes.</p><p>We initially discovered that hypothemycin and the propargyl ether derivative <bold>2</bold> are potently trypanocidal. Although hypothemycin reduced parasitemia and cured one-third of infected mice, it was toxic at higher doses, and we do not consider it to be a drug lead. Hypothemycin-mediated toxicity may be caused by inactivation of MEK and VEGFR2, as previous studies have found toxic effects associated with selective inhibitors of these kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rugo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adjei et al., 2008</xref>). Trypanosomes lack orthologs of most hypothemycin-sensitive mammalian kinases, including MEK and VEGFR2.

Mass spectrometry-based quantification revealed the extent of CDXG kinase occupancy as a function of hypothemycin concentration. We observed a wide spectrum of sensitivity, with most CDXG kinases requiring micromolar concentrations of hypothemycin to block labeling by probe <bold>2</bold>. Two of the kinases showing the greatest reduction in probe labeling after exposure to hypothemycin, <italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short and <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1, are also the only CDXG kinases whose knockdown by RNAi significantly reduced cell growth.</p><p><italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short was previously shown to be essential for proliferation and survival of BSF <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ojo et al., 2008</xref>).

Although many of these compounds block <italic>T. brucei</italic> proliferation, it is unclear whether they actually inhibit <italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short in cells. Indeed, hypothemycin was able to saturate <italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short at nanomolar concentrations in cell lysates, yet it had little effect on this kinase in intact cells, even after prolonged treatment at cytotoxic concentrations.

MS spectra were acquired for 1 sec in the m/z range between 350 and 1500. MS acquisitions were followed by 4 × 2.5 sec collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments in information-dependent acquisition mode. For each MS spectrum, the two most intense multiple charged peaks over a threshold of 25 counts were selected for generation of CID mass spectra. Two MS/MS spectra of each were acquired, first on the <italic>m/z</italic> range 119–1500, with Q1 resolution set at ‘low’, and then on the <italic>m/z</italic> range 112–119, with resolution set at ‘unit’.

A minimal ProteinProspector protein score of 15, a peptide score of 15, a maximum expectation value of 0.1, and a minimal discriminant score threshold of 0.0 were used for initial identification criteria. iTRAQ modification of the amino terminus or the epsilon-amino group of lysines, carbamidomethylation of cysteine; acetylation of the N-terminus of the protein and oxidation of methionine were allowed as variable modifications. Peptide tolerance in searches was 100 ppm for precursor and 0.2 Da for product ions, respectively. Peptides containing two miscleavages were allowed. The number of modifications was limited to two per peptide.</p><p>Quantification was based on the relative areas of the reporter ions (<italic>m/z</italic> =114, 115, 116 and 117) generated by the isobaric iTRAQ reagents during CID experiments. Abundance ratios of individual peptides between the different samples were calculated taking as reference the DMSO-treated sample, by dividing the areas of their respective iTRAQ reporter ions. Peptides with peak areas lower than 30 for the most intense reporter ion were discarded. For changes in relative abundance at the protein level, all MS/MS spectra for the different peptides belonging to a particular protein were used to calculate the average and SD of the abundance ratios.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Generation of transgenic <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines</title><p>Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was linearized (MfeI, <italic>Tb</italic>GSK3short-HA; Bsu36I, <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1-HA; NotI, pZJM constructs) and resuspended to 1 μg/μl in water.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Jon Clardy (Reviewing editor), Nathanael Gray (peer reviewer), and Barbara Burleigh (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper identifies a trypanosome kinase, <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1, as a therapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis, a protozoal infection with severely limited treatment options. The authors used a virtuosic combination of phenotypic assays, organic chemistry, several flavors of proteomics, and RNAi knockdowns in their identification.</p><p>The project began by exploring whether kinase inhibitors, which have become useful therapeutic agents for several human diseases, could play a similar role in treating trypanosomal infections. Trypanosomes and their human hosts have many kinases, and to focus their search the authors selected hypothemycin, a small molecule produced by some fungi, that was known to target a small subset of human kinases, and found that it killed trypanosomes in both cell culture and in vivo (mouse) assays. They then synthesized an affinity reagent and through proteomic analysis identified eleven potential targets, all of which were kinases with the signature motif characteristic of hypothemycin-sensitive kinases. More detailed analyses identified one of the kinases, <italic>Tb</italic>CLK1, as the therapeutically relevant target, and this conclusion was underscored with RNAi analyses.</p><p>All of the reviewers agreed that the manuscript described the identification of a potentially significant target and were in favor of publication. They also noted that the manuscript describes an unusually thorough set of experiments in a commendably frank manner. Their study will appeal to both the community interested in addressing protozoal diseases like trypanosomiasis as well as the much larger community of researchers seeking to discover useful therapeutic agents. There were two general issues that the reviewers felt could be improved.</p><p>1) The authors note in several places that the critical issue in their overall approach is likely to be specificity – the ability to find small molecules that selectively lead to parasite death. The lack of sufficient specificity is, for example, why the authors note that hypothemycin is not a drug candidate. It would be useful to consolidate and expand upon this notion in the Introduction so that the reader is aware of it from the beginning. For example, the Abstract states that “Protein kinases are attractive therapeutic…”, and changing “are” to “could be” would set up such a discussion. The authors do address this in the beginning of the Discussion section, but it might be more effective to move this into the Introduction.</p><p>2) The thoroughness of the approach makes it difficult for the majority of readers that are unfamiliar with this sort of analysis to follow the logic of the overall research plan. A road map of phenotypic screen of a mammalian kinase inhibitor -&gt; target ID by chemical proteomics in gel -&gt; chemical proteomics using ITRAQ -&gt; RNAi screen of candidate targets -&gt; target engagement studies -&gt; reconfirmation with recombinant enzymes, possibly as a figure, would help. It would serve both as an aid for readers and a handy guide for repurposing other kinase inhibitors for infectious disease applications. The current manuscript seems to follow the historical course of the research, which creates a meandering narrative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00712.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors note in several places that the critical issue in their overall approach is likely to be specificity – the ability to find small molecules that selectively lead to parasite death.

We have changed the Abstract to indicate that protein kinases are “potentially attractive” therapeutic targets. In addition, we have expanded the introductory paragraph on kinases to include a brief discussion on the challenges associated with developing selective kinase inhibitors and choosing specific kinases to pursue as therapeutic targets.</p><p><italic>2) The thoroughness of the approach makes it difficult for the majority of readers that are unfamiliar with this sort of analysis to follow the logic of the overall research plan.

We have changed the text to clarify our rationale for pursuing trypanosome targets. As mentioned in the main text, hypothemycin and derivatives have been previously used in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barluenga et al., 2010</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). We are unaware of any hemolytic activity of hypothemycin or its derivatives.</p></body></sub-article></article>
