pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48191.001</object-id><p>The vascular wall is a source of progenitor cells that are able to induce skeletal repair, primarily by paracrine mechanisms. Here, the paracrine role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in bone healing was investigated. First, purified human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) were observed to induce mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on osteoprogenitor cells while in non-contact co-culture via elaboration of EVs. PSC-derived EVs shared mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic properties of their parent cell. PSC-EV effects were dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins, as demonstrated by EV trypsinization, or neutralizing antibodies for CD9 or CD81. Moreover, shRNA knockdown in recipient cells demonstrated requirement for the CD9/CD81 binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN for EV bioactivity. Finally, PSC-EVs stimulated bone repair, and did so via stimulation of skeletal cell proliferation, migration, and osteodifferentiation. In sum, PSC-EVs mediate the same tissue repair effects of perivascular stem cells, and represent an âoff-the-shelfâ alternative for bone tissue regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48191.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Throughout our lives, our bodies need to heal after injury. Blood vessels are found throughout the bodyâs tissues and are a source of cells that guide the process of repair. These cells, called perivascular stem cells (PSCs), are a type of stem cell found in the lining of blood vessels. Stem cells are cells that can become one of several different types of mature cells, depending on what the body needs.</p><p>Extracellular vesicles are bundles of chemical signals that cells send into their external environment. Just like an address or a tag on a parcel, specific molecules mark the exterior surface of these bundles to deliver the message to the right recipient. Stem cells often use extracellular vesicles to communicate with surrounding cells.</p><p>One role of PSCs is repairing damage to bones. Unusually, they do not turn into new bone cells and so do not directly contribute to the re-growing tissue. Instead, PSCs act indirectly, by stimulating the cells around them. How PSCs send these ârepair instructionsâ has, however, remained unclear. Xu et al. wanted to determine if PSCs used extracellular vesicles to direct bone repair, and if so, what âtagsâ needed to be on the vesicles and on the receiving cells for this to happen.</p><p>Experiments using PSCs and immature bone cells grown in the laboratory allowed the PSCsâ effect on bone cells to be simulated in a Petri dish. The two types of cells were grown on either side of a barrier, which separated them physically but allowed chemical signals through. In response to the PSCs, the immature bone cells multiplied, started to move (which is something they need to do to heal damaged tissue), and began to resemble mature bone cells.</p><p>Analysis of the signals released by the PSCs revealed that these were indeed extracellular vesicles, and that they were tagged by specific proteins called tetraspanins. Genetic manipulation of the immature bone cells later showed that these cells needed specific âreceiverâ molecules to respond to the PSCs. Adding only extracellular vesicles to the bone cells, without any PSCs, confirmed that it was indeed the vesicles that triggered the healing response. Finally, giving the vesicles to mice with bone damage helped them to heal faster than untreated animals.</p><p>These results have uncovered a key mechanism by which stem cells control the repair of bone tissue. This could one day lead to better treatments for patients recovering from fractures or needing bone surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group

rid="bib34">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>). When purified based on expression of CD146 (Mel-CAM) and CD34, human perivascular stem cells (PSCs) from adipose tissue or other tissue compartments speed bone repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askarinam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">James et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">James et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016</xref>). Although direct incorporation of human PSCs into chondroblasts, osteoblasts and osteocytes occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 2012b</xref>), PSCs induce bone healing either primarily or exclusively via paracrine stimulation of the resident host cells within the defect niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tawonsawatruk et al., 2016</xref>). High expression and secretion of osteoinductive proteins has been observed among freshly sorted or culture-expanded PSCs, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">James et al., 2017b</xref>). However, the exact paracrine intermediaries of PSC-induced bone defect healing are not known.</p><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, carry a repertoire of bioactive molecules: proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cvjetkovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mateescu et al., 2017</xref>). The heterogenous nature of EVs is well described, with EVs of a diameterÂ &lt;100â150 nm and multivesicular body (MVB) origin termed exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gould and Raposo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mateescu et al., 2017</xref>). Stromal progenitor cells elaborate EVs, and EVs have been observed to harbor many of the regenerative properties of their parent cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lakhter and Sims, 2015</xref>). In bone repair, CD9 knockout mice, which have impaired EV elaboration, have delayed appendicular bone healing, that may be rescued by mesenchymal progenitor cell-derived EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2016</xref>). As well, induced pluripotent stemÂ cell-derived EVs have been shown to incite osteogenesis and vasculogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Todorova et al., 2017</xref>). The potential role of miRNA cargo in EVs has been implicated in these effects, however the mechanisms that underlie EV-mediated reparative effects in bone are essentially unknown.</p><p>Here, we observe that in similarity to their parent cell, PSC-derived EVs incite pleiotropic effects on skeletal progenitor cells, including mitogenic, pro-migratory, pro-osteogenic effects, and broad ranging changes in the cellular transcriptome of the recipient cell. These bioactive effects require EV tetraspanin activity, as well as expression of their binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN by the recipient progenitor cell. These cellular effects of PSC-EVs on skeletal progenitor cells converge to incite intramembranous bone repair in a mouse model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Perivascular stem cells induce paracrine effects on BMSCs via EV release</title><p>Perivascular stem/stromal cells (PSCs) were derived from human white adipose tissue using previously reported methods, by FACS selection of the related populations of CD34<sup>+</sup>CD146<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> adventitial progenitor cells and CD146<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>-</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corselli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crisan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">James et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyers et al., 2018a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyers et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyers et al., 2018b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

When a lipophilic dye (PKH26) was used to label the cell membrane of PSCs, this dye was incorporated into the BMSCs, suggesting the exchange of membrane from parent PSCs to recipient cells under non-contact culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As primary candidates for mediating non-contact dependent cell-cell communication, PSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâH</xref>). PSC-EVs were enriched by ultracentrifugation of serum-free supernatant of PSCs. Guidelines from the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) for EV characterization were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LÃ¶tvall et al., 2014</xref>). Spherical PSC-EV morphology was observed by transmission EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), with enrichment of tetraspanin molecule expression (CD9, CD63, and CD81), but without expression of the endoplasmic reticulum protein calnexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Size distribution of PSC-EVs was most commonlyÂ ~100 nm, as shown by either TEM quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) or nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). EV yield per cell per day as assessed by protein content was 1.11Â Â±Â 0.18 pg, as determined by the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thus, PSCs elaborate EVs in culture which then are received by stromal progenitor cells, representing a primary candidate for PSC-mediated paracrine activity.</p><p>EVs represent a mixture of protein, lipid, and RNA that may affect cellular processes of the recipient cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidarimath et al., 2017</xref>). To begin to examine this, total RNA sequencing was performed on three PSC-EV preparations and compared to the RNA content of their parent PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâK</xref>). To determine which genes were most expressed, transcripts were normalized by fragments per kilobasepair per million mapped (FPKM), and those with Log2 FPKMÂ &gt;â0.8 underwent further analysis. Among these, 10,256 annotated genes were expressed in all samples of 54,136 total RNA transcripts (19% of total, including 10,256 protein coding RNA; six non-coding RNA; and four pseudo RNA). Clear separation between gene expression profiles were observed when comparing PSC-EV RNA content to their parent cells, as observed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Putative gene markers of human perivascular MSC were cross-referenced within PSCs and PSC-EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2017</xref>). Higher expression of most transcripts were seen in each PSC isolate (such as <italic>CD44, NT5E, ENG, LEPR, PDGFRA</italic>, and <italic>PDGFRB</italic>), with comparatively less expression among PSC-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The highest expressing 100 genes within PSC-EVs are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. All 100 were protein coding genes, 57 encoded for ribosomal proteins (e.g. <italic>RPS18</italic>, <italic>RPL37A</italic>, and <italic>RPL41</italic>) and 68 were included within Gene Ontology term extracellular exosome (GO term: 0070062). Reflecting their adipose tissue origin, these highly expressed PSC-EV transcripts included several genes associated with adipocytes or adipogenesis, such as <italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>RACK1</italic>, and <italic>LGALS1</italic>. Highly expressed PSC-EV genes also included transcripts involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation (e.g. <italic>FTL</italic>, <italic>RAB13</italic>, <italic>MT2A</italic>, and <italic>TMSB10</italic>) or cellular migration (e.g. <italic>RAB13</italic>, <italic>TMSB10</italic>, <italic>S100A6</italic>, and <italic>EEF1A1</italic>). Next, PSC-EV RNA content was cross-referenced to a previously published RNA Seq dataset within unpurified adipose stromal cell-derived EVs from porcine tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eirin et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, some overlap existed in EV content between these two adipose stromal cell derivatives (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). For example, of 39 transcription factors previously found to be enriched in adipose tissue stem/stromal cell (ASC)-EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eirin et al., 2014</xref>), 14 genes (35.9%) were also enriched in human PSC-EVs. Of these, known positive regulators of cellular proliferation (e.g. <italic>JMJD1C</italic>, <italic>NRIP1</italic>, and <italic>TRPS1</italic>) and cellular migration (e.g. <italic>JMJD1C</italic>, <italic>TCF4</italic>, and <italic>KLF7</italic>) were identified. Of note, several transcriptional repressors were found within the previously published ASC-EVs (e.g. <italic>ZNF568</italic>, <italic>ZHX1</italic>, <italic>ZBTB1</italic>, and <italic>RUNX1T1</italic>), which were not found at high levels in human PSC-EVs. Thus, PSC-EVs demonstrate both commonalities and distinct differences in RNA content when compared to their either parent cells, as well as to known expression profiles among unpurified adipose stromal EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PSC-EVs promote BMSC proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation</title><p>The direct effects of PSC-EVs on recipient BMSCs were next defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To demonstrate interaction of EVs with the recipient cells, PSC-EVs were first labeled with PKH26 dye, and fluorescently labeled PSC-EVs were directly applied to human BMSCs. After 48 hr, fluorescence was observed on the recipient BMSCs in a cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). PSC-EVs were next labeled with a pH dependent dye (pHrodo Red Maleimide), which only fluoresces after exposure to an acidic environment such as the cellular interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After 48 hr, fluorescence was again observed suggesting EV internalization by the recipient BMSCs. PSC-EVs exerted a dose-dependent mitogenic effect on recipient BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>, 2.5, and 5 Î¼g/mL, MTS assays). Using a scratch wound healing assay, PSC-EVs represented a significant pro-migratory stimulus, with the lowest PSC-EV concentration demonstrating the largest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Under osteogenic differentiation conditions, PSC-EVs induced a dose dependent increase in ALP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and bone nodule deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Quantitative PCR analysis of characteristic osteoblastic gene markers confirmed a dose-dependent positive regulatory effect by PSC-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), including <italic>RUNX2 (Runt related transcription factor 2)</italic> and <italic>SP7</italic> (<italic>Osterix</italic>). We next queried as to whether recipient stromal cells responded to PSC-EVs in a tissue-specific manner. Here, humanÂ culture-derived ASCs were exposed to the identical PSC-EV treatment conditions with broad similarities and minor differences found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike BMSCs, the mitogenic effect of PSC-EVs was not observed among recipient ASCs. The pro-migratory and pro-osteogenic effects of PSC-EVs were conserved findings across both recipient stromal cells, although the maximum efficacious dose for each bioactivity assay was different when comparing BM- and AT-derived recipient cells. Finally, we compared the effects of EVs from unsorted ASCs and homogeneous PSCs on recipient BMSCs. Like PSC-EVs, ASC-EVs exerted mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects on recipient BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). However, the magnitude of change was significantly different between EV preparations, and PSC-EVs demonstrated a stronger induction of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, while ASC-EVs enhanced cell migration to a greater degree. In sum, perivascular EVs retain bioactive effects of their parent perivascular cell type and exert overall similar effects across different recipient multipotent mesenchymal cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48191.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PSC-EVs promote BMSC proliferation, migration, and mineralization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Appearance of BMSCs treated with or without PKH26 (red)-labeled PSC-EVs.

Here, the Affymetrix Clariom D microarray assayed the BMSC transcriptome at 48 hr post-PSC-EV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2HâK</xref>). 38,416 annotated genes were expressed in all samples among 135,750 total probesets (20,014 protein coding RNA; 5054 non-coding RNA; 2795 pseudo RNA; 207 sno RNA; 55 snRNA; 26 rRNA; two scRNA). Clear differences between control- and PSC-EV-treated BMSC gene expression were observed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). As shown by volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), 4129 transcripts showedÂ &gt;2 SD increase in expression with PSC-EV treatment (3.04% of total, red dots), while 2589 transcripts showedÂ &gt;2 SD reduction in expression with PSC-EV treatment (1.91% of total, blue dots). QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that the majority of the activated pathways were associated with the positive regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and/or osteogenesis, including for example SAPK/JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zha et al., 2016</xref>), HGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forte et al., 2006</xref>), Sirtuin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simic et al., 2013</xref>), FGF Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gharibi and Hughes, 2012</xref>), and PDGF Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2014</xref>), among recipient BMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> for a complete list). Conversely, downregulated signaling pathways among recipient BMSCs included those known to negatively regulate cell proliferation, such as AMPK Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Meester et al., 2014</xref>). PTEN signaling was also downregulated, which negatively regulates BMSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2018</xref>), migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comer and Parent, 2002</xref>) and osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> for a complete list). Next, the transcriptome of PSC-EVs (as previously determined by RNA-Seq) was cross-referenced to changes within the BMSC transcriptome after EV treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Here, of 7789 PSC-EV transcripts with a mean FPKMÂ &gt;0, approximately half of these transcripts demonstrated were increased among PSC-EV-treated BMSCs (3678 transcripts, 47.22% of total). Thus, global changes in the recipient BMSC transcriptome were not well explained by simple transfer of EV RNA cargo. Instead, PSC-EVs demonstrate prominent regulation of recipient cell gene transcription resulting in significant mitogenic, pro-migratory, and pro-osteogenic effects in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>EV surface-associated tetraspanins interact with recipient cell binding partners for bioactivity</title><p>EV uptake and downstream bioactive effects may be dependent on membrane-bound protein interaction with the recipient cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Escrevente et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morelli et al., 2004</xref>).

To test the requirement of surface-associated tetraspanins, neutralizing antibodies directed against CD9 or CD81 were pre-incubated with PSC-EVs before application to the recipient cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). PSC-EVs were labeled with a pH dependent dye and treated with or without neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Results demonstrated that both anti-CD9 and anti-CD81 reversed the mitogenic effects of PSC-EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Likewise, the pro-migratory effects of PSC-EVs were completely abrogated by either neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâG</xref>).

Here, low doses of PSC-EVs represented a potent migratory stimulus, while higher doses of PSC-EVs induced proliferation and differentiation. Presumably this has in vivo relevance in a skeletal injury site where a gradient concentration of EVs may exist. Skeletal progenitor cells at a distance may be recruited with low concentrations of EVs, and under exposure to higher EV concentrations they may expand in numbers and deposit bone matrix.</p><p>Our study suggests several intriguing questions regarding the uniqueness of both the parent and recipient cell type in mesenchymal progenitor crosstalk and EVs. Other groups have shown that the parent cell type for EVs matters in bone biology. For example, âMSCâ-derived EVs assist in fracture healing, whereas osteosarcoma-derived EVs do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2016</xref>). These findings may represent differential cargo between EVs. In terms of the parent cell in the current study, PSCs represent a FACS purified and relatively homogeneous stromal cell population in comparison to most current culture-based derivation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">James et al., 2017a</xref>). For this reason, PSCs may theoretically represent a more potent EV source as compared other stromal cell populations. Yet, ongoing and published studies from our research group suggest that PSCs exhibit profound intra-tissue cellular diversity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardy et al. (2017)</xref> showed that ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) bright and dim subpopulations of adipose tissue-derived perivascular cells were transcriptionally distinct, and this marker could be used to identify a more âprimitiveâ subpopulation. Likewise and in mice, functionally distinct pericyte subtypes have been examined using nestin and NG2 transgenic reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birbrair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birbrair et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birbrair et al., 2013b</xref>). How perivascular progenitor subpopulations exhibit overlapping or distinct vesicular secretomes is an interesting future avenue of investigation.</p><p>The recipient cell type is also important to consider in EV-based intercellular communication. In the present study, we focused explicitly on human BMSCs. Yet, our studies did examine adipose tissue progenitors and found basal differences in responsiveness to PSC-EVs. The largest difference we observed in human stromal cell preparations was that adiposeÂ tissue-derived cells did not exhibit the same mitogenic response to PSC-EVs. There is some literature about the âspecificityâ of EV uptake by certain cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mulcahy et al., 2014</xref>). For example, pancreatic adenocarcinoma-derived EVs are efficiently internalized by peritoneal cells as opposed to other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zech et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, other studies have shown that fluorescently labeled EVs are internalized by essentially every tested cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Svensson et al., 2013</xref>). This cell type specificity may well have relevance in bone repair, in which multiple cell sources are present which could directly participate in ossification. Whether any recipient cell specificity has to do with relative IGSF8 and PTGFRN cell surface expression or responsiveness to PSC-EV cargo is an intriguing and unanswered question. Of note, PTGFRN expression has been observed in both âMSCsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billing et al., 2016</xref>) and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanagata and Li, 2011</xref>). Although not specifically addressed in the present study, endothelial cells within a healing bone defect are likely beneficial recipients of EV effects. In prior studies, mesenchymal progenitor cell-derived EVs have been shown to induce a vasculogenic response to aid in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, the human PSCs have been shown to induce vasculogenic responses during wound and bone healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Askarinam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodnar et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that in vivo endothelial cells also receive and respond to perivascular EV signals.</p><p>Our in vitro studies suggest that PSCs elaborate large quantities of EVs under standard culture conditions. It is intriguing to hypothesize whether AT-derived PSCs secrete EVs to this degree in vivo under either physiologic or pathologic contexts. Pericytes are intimately associated with their underlying endothelium, we have recently observed that enzymatic dissociation of this relationship significantly changes the pericyte secretome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vezzani et al., 2018</xref>). In our past study, Lipogems technology was used to keep the pericyte:endothelial cell contact intact while enzymatic dissociation and FACS purification removed the endothelial cells from culture. Key differences in angiogenic proteins were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vezzani et al., 2018</xref>), and it is likely that the vesicular secretome was likewise changed. Although likewise speculative, PSC-derived EVs may play roles in pathologic conditions. Blood vessel wall mineralization and ossification may be examples of the unintended consequences of perivascular EVs. The concept of EV-mediated vascular calcification has been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapustin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kapustin and Shanahan, 2016</xref>), although the cell of origin has been presumed to be a smooth muscle cell rather than mesenchymal progenitor cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kapustin et al., 2015</xref>). These in vivo correlates represent interesting future avenues of investigation.</p><p>Finally, several features of EVs make them an appealing product for clinical translation as compared to their parent MSC. For example, EVs represent a potential âoff the shelfâ product which can be stored long term without compromising their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willis et al., 2017</xref>). According to leading opinions within ISEV, all EV-based therapies will be considered in accordance with the guidelines for biopharmaceutical drug products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lener et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Witwer et al., 2013</xref>), and may move more quickly through regulatory review. Improvement in EV isolation are being developed, such as the continuous centrifugation method, with advantages of convenient and rapid use, low cost, and easy operation. EVs also have low immunogenicity and toxicity but high permeability and biocompatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sterzenbach et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, whether derived from PSC or other mesenchymal progenitor cell preparations, EV-based therapies represent an attractive future drug for the promotion of tissue repair.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Summary</title><p>In sum, perivascular EVs induce proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, and the confluence of these effects positively regulates bone defect repair. Perivascular EVs require surface-associated tetraspanins for bioactivity, and recipient skeletal cells require their binding partners to respond to a perivascular EV stimulus. These data solidify the pleiotropic paracrine effects of perivascular stem cells on bone repair, and suggest the importance of perivascular EVs in both endogenous bone repair as well as in skeletal tissue engineering.

Cell migration was measured with Ibidi inserts (Ibidi, Planegg/Martinsried, Germany), where 1.4 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> BMSCs were seeded and grown to confluency followed by co-culture with or without 3 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> PSCs in reduced FBS conditions (GM with 1% FBS). Inserts were removed and cell migration into the empty area was monitored by brightfield microscopy at 0, 8, or 24 hr. The equilibrium width of the gap was calculated using the ImageJ software (Version 1.49 v, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>; NIH, Bethesda, MD). Here, gap closure = (scratch width at hour 0 â scratch width at hour 8 or 24)/scratch width at hour 0Â ÃÂ 100%. Osteogenic differentiation in co-culture was performed using osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) consisting of GM with 50 Î¼M ascorbic acid, 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich). 4 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> BMSCs were cultured with or without of 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> PSCs, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed at 72 hr using an ALP staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Relative staining intensity was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to the control group. In select studies, PSCs were labeled with PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). After 48 hr co-culture of PKH26-labeled PSCs (5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>) with unlabeled BMSCs (2 Ã 10<sup>4</sup>), images were acquired with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus, Cypress, CA). Unless otherwise stated, each experimental study was done in three technical replicates using two different PSC preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Extracellular vesicles isolation and analysis</title><p>EVs were derived from passage 3â9 cells using ultracentrifugation based on previously validated protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">ThÃ©ry et al., 2006</xref>). Each preparation of EVs was isolated from independent cells and were not mixed. Briefly, ASCs or PSCs were expanded in growth medium. Upon reaching subconfluency and after triplicate washes in PBS, cells were cultured in DMEM only for 48 hr. EVs were collected by serial centrifugation at 300Â ÃÂ g for 10 min, 2 000Â ÃÂ g for 30 min, 10 000Â ÃÂ g for 30 min, and 120 000Â ÃÂ g for 4 hr at 4Â°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were resuspended in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The protein concentration of EVs were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), according to the manufacturerâs instruction in similarity to prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2016</xref>). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 10 Î¼l of sample was adsorbed to glow-discharged 400 mesh ultra-thin carbon coated grids (EMS CF400-CU-UL) for two min, followed by three quick rinses of TBS and staining with 1% UAT (uranyl acetate with 0.05 Tylose). Grids were immediately observed with a Philips CM120 at 80 kV and images captured with an AMT XR80 high-resolution (16-bit) 8 Mpixel camera. The size distribution of EVs was examined by analysis of serial TEM images (nÂ =Â 57 images analyzed) or using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with NanoSight NS500 (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) with a 405 nm laser. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Proteins were separated by SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein extraction was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibodies at 4Â°C overnight. Finally, membranes were incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody and detected with ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EV in vitro assays</title><p>EVs (1, 2.5, or 5 Î¼g/mL protein content) were added to culture medium during proliferation, migration and osteogenic differentiation as described above.

In select experiments, PSC-EVs were labeled using PKH26 lipophilic dye or a pH sensitive dye (pHrodo Red Maleimide, Thermo Scientific) prior to use. Upon completion of the reaction with the PSC-EVs, an excess of glutathione was added to consume the excess thiol-reactive reagent. PSC-EVs and dye were separated by a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25 column; GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA). Proliferation assays were performed in 96-well plates (2 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> BMSCs/well) and assayed at 48, 72, and 96 hr. Migration was performed as above with or without EVs supplementation (1, 2.5, or 5 Î¼g/mL), with endpoints at 8 and 24 hr. Osteogenic differentiation was performed with OM with or without EVs (1, 2.5, or 5 Î¼g/mL), with medium and EVs replenished every 3 days. The degree of mineralization was assessed by Alizarin Red S staining after 7 days (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and photometric quantification using Epoch microspectrophotometer (548 nm absorbance). Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. 0.8 Î¼g of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) following manufacturerâs instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.

To assess progenitor cell migration, 10-week-old, male PdgfrÎ±-CreER;eGFP transgenic reporter mice were a kind gift from the Dwight Bergles laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). Validation of the high specificity of PdgfrÎ± reporter activity has been previously confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). In PdgfrÎ±-CreER;eGFP transgenic reporter mice, tamoxifen (TM) administration was performed by i.p. injection as per published protocols 14 days prior to defect creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). TM free base (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) in 98% sunflower seed oil and 2% ethanol was administered at a concentration of 0.07 mg/kg daily for 5 days by i.p. injection as per previously validated protocolsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). For calvarial defect creation, anesthesia was performed with 2â3% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 1 L/min and animals were operated upon on a warm, small animal surgery station. Post-operative monitoring was performed in accordance with institutional policy. Analgesia was administered using buprenorphine (0.1 ml/25 g body weight) via intraperitoneal injection after surgery, and a repeat injection was performed after 48 hr. A 4 mm skin incision was made over the right frontal bone. Next, a 1.8 mm diameter full thickness circular defect was created in the non-suture associated frontal bone using an Ideal Micro-Drill and a burr (Xemax Surgical, Napa Valley, CA). Meticulous care was taken not to injure the underlying dura mater. Finally, the skin was sutured and the animal was monitored per established postoperative protocols. PSC-EVs (1 or 2.5 Î¼g total dose) or vehicle control were percutaneously injected into the tissue directly overlying the defect every 3 days (27G Ã 5/8â Insulin Syringes, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Mice were euthanized after 4 weeks for postmortem analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Postmortem analyses</title><p>Samples were fixed in 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) for 24 hr and imaged using a high-resolution microcomputed tomography (microCT) imaging system (SkyScan 1294; Bruker MicroCT N.V, Kontich, Belgium). Scans were obtained at an image resolution of 10 Î¼m, with the following settings: 1 mm of aluminum filter, X-ray voltage of 65 kVP, anode current of 153 uA, exposure time of 65 ms, frame averaging of 4, and rotation step of 0.3 degrees. Three-dimensional images were then reconstructed from the 2D X-ray projections by implementing the Feldkamp algorithm using a commercial software package NRecon software (2.0.4.0 SkyScan, Bruker). For the 3D morphometric analyses of images, CTVox and CTAn software were used (1.13 SkyScan, Bruker). For calvarial defect analysis, a cylindrical volume of interest centered around each defect site was defined as the 1.8 mm in diameter and 1 mm in height with a threshold value of 80. The amount of bone formation was analyzed and quantified in three different ways. Firstly, bone volume (BV) was calculated from binary x-ray images. Second, bone fractional area (BFA) was calculated by using CTVox to create a 3D rendering of calvarial defect and measuring pixels of bone in defect divided by total defect area using Adobe Photoshop (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014199">SCR_014199</ext-link>; Adobe, San Jose, CA). Lastly, a bone healing score from 0 to 4 was assigned by three blinded observers according to previous published grading scales for calvarial defect healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spicer et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the grading system was as follows: 0âno bone formation, 1âfew bony spicules dispersed through defect, 2âbony bridging only at defect borders, 3âbony bridging over partial length of defect, and 4âbony bridging entire span of defect at longest point.</p><p>After radiographic imaging, samples were transferred to 14% EDTA for decalcification for 14â21 days. Samples were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and sectioned in a coronal plane at 10 Î¼m thickness. H&amp;E staining was performed on serial sections. For immunofluorescent staining, additional sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-Ki67 (1:200, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_302459">AB_302459</ext-link>), and anti-Osteocalcin (1:100, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10675660">AB_10675660</ext-link>). Sections were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, 10 min each. All sections were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 hr at 25Â°C; antigen retrieval was by trypsin enzymatic antigen retrieval solution for 10 mins at 37Â°C (ab970; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Primary antibodies were added to each section at their respective dilutions and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr and then overnight at 4Â°C. Next, a Dylight 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) polyclonal (1:200, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2336413">AB_2336413</ext-link>) was used as the secondary antibody.

It adds a valuable evidence to the pro-bone regenerative properties of some cell-specific EVs. Nevertheless, the title currently used by the authors implies that EVs with certain tetraspanins mediate bone repair.</p><p>The experimental design of the bone repair shows that PSC-EVs in general have induced bone repair, which is not specifically associated to the CD markers (tetraspanins under investigation in this study).</p><p>My comments are summarized below:</p><p>With regard to the processing and selection of the clinical samples: It was not clear to the reviewer of how many replicates/clinical sample? Were the PCSs mixed together after cell sorting as one universal sample? Or were they treated as independent samples? Accordingly, what is the source of the elaborated EVs?

EVs are heterogeneous in nature, we do not know which EVs have contributed to the bone repair. This is difficult to claim at this point since the technical tools available to the EV community cannot isolate CD-specific EVs and link them to bone repair.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a well written, well referenced and well designed study. The work confirms and extends the existing literature from the authors' and other's laboratories. The findings demonstrate that both pericytes or their exosomes/microvesicles can be used to enhance osteogenesis and wound healing in vitro and in vivo. The findings have broad interest to the adipose, bone, and vascular biology fields.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors discuss the concept of exosomes as an off the shelf substitute for actual pericytes in a clinical translational setting. The authors are encouraged to expand on this concept in the Discussion. Please highlight how exosome products could be easier to move through regulatory review, cheaper to manufacture, and less likely to elicit an immune response.</p><p>2) The work focuses almost exclusively on the FACS purified homogeneous pericyte and adventitial cell populations from adipose tissue. The process of isolating such cells adds considerable expense to the manufacturing process. Did the authors have any data on heterogenous, unsorted adipose stromal/stem cells alone? The inclusion of such data, even in a limited manner, in comparison to the isolated pericytes and adventitial cells using at least the in vitro assays, would provide a basis for the continued use and focus on the pericytic population as a source of commercial clinical translational products and manufacture.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Authors are here proposing an extremely interesting approach where adipose derived cells release EV that in turn influence marrow stromal cells performance in vitro in a dose dependent manner while same impact is difficult the be achieved using adipose stromal cells as target. They also propose that EV effects is dependent on surface-associated tetraspanins CD9 or CD81 via their binding partners IGSF8 and PTGFRN mostly by in vitro experiments. There are few very major aspects I would suggest to take into account:</p><p>1) A summarizing table with data to outline the features (isolation/culture techniques, basic morphology, FACS phenotype and cell culture doublings) of human PSC, BMSC and ASC is needed to clarify better all these different mesenchymal cell populations used as target and effectors.</p><p>2) Authors should justify/discuss why the impact of PSC-EVs on BMSCs is greater than with ASC. Any difference in the transcriptome level for targets BMCS versus ASC?</p><p>3) Why do the authors investigate whether human PSC-EV treatment may improve calvarial defect in BL6 mice. This is bit odd and does not account species specificity not only in the genomic signals exchange but also in the CD9/CD81 interaction with their murine receptors. To validate this model they should take marrow and or adipose cells from mice and treat them with human PSC-EV in vitro as done for human samples using the same read-out. We shall expect similar outcome.</p><p>4) In subsection âPSC-EVs promote BMSC proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiationâ: &quot;PSC-EVs were next labeled with a pH dependent dye&quot; Please specify this better.</p><p>5) In Figure 1C, the ALP staining is not very convincing.

We examined these two controls in both Figure 2F and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C. IgG did not significantly affect BMSC osteogenesis. Indeed, anti-CD81 antibody alone did inhibit BMSC osteogenic differentiation to some degree (Figure 3K). Although interesting, the potential direct effects of anti-CD81 without EVs was not the main subject of investigation and was not further pursued.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4E:</p><p>Knocking down the receptors of CD9 and CD81 has no effect on osteogenesis, mineralization in both the experimental conditions and controls were comparable.

Our observations found that EV induced osteogenic differentiation required the CD9/81 receptor PTGFRN but not IGSF8 on the recipient cell. Toward your good point, we returned to our transcriptome to examine potential other cell surface proteins that may be important in EV internalization (such as <italic>CD46</italic> or <italic>CD63</italic>) or otherwise mediate PSC-EV pro-osteogenic effects (such as <italic>CD44, CD82</italic>, and <italic>CD99</italic>). These interesting findings are further discussed in the revision (subsection âPSC-EVs induce proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation to induce calvarial defect healingâ) and shown in new Supplementary file 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5:</p><p>This experiment and the proof that PSC-EV promote bone repair in a mouse model of critical size calvarial defect does not indicate specifically that only CD9, and CD81 positive EVs have contributes to the bone repair.

Although both ASC and PSC derived EVs have similar positive regulatory effects on BMSC cell behavior, the magnitude of mitogenic and pro-osteogenic changes is significantly greater among PSC-EV. We concur that FACS purification adds considerable cost, but also believe that the higher homogeneity of a FACS identified population has both ramifications for safety and efficacy of a potential stem cell therapy.

Recipient cell type specificity was one of several findings that, while interesting to pursue, would have significantly expanded the scope of the present study.

Additional studies were performed using mouse recipient cells with the same readouts, including mouse calvarial cells (to directly align with in vivo mouse studies) and mouse ASC as suggested.
