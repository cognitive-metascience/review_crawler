The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are the main microtubule binding components of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> kinetochore. Cooperation between these two complexes enhances kinetochore-microtubule coupling and is regulated by Aurora B kinase. We show that the Ndc80 complex can simultaneously bind and bridge across two Dam1 complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by Aurora B kinase. Mutations in any one of the Ndc80p interaction regions abrogates the Ndc80 complex’s ability to bind two Dam1 rings in vitro, and results in kinetochore biorientation and microtubule attachment defects in vivo. We also show that an extra-long Ndc80 complex, engineered to space the two Dam1 rings further apart, does not support growth. Taken together, our work suggests that each kinetochore in vivo contains two Dam1 rings and that proper spacing between the rings is vital.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21069.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21069.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21069.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic material inside yeast, human and other eukaryotic cells is stored within structures called chromosomes. Every time a cell divides to make two “daughter” cells, all the chromosomes in the cell must be copied and then separated into two equal sets, with each set delivered to a different daughter cell. If the copied chromosomes divide into unequal sets the daughter cells may die or not work properly.</p><p>Chromosomes are attached to tube-like structures called microtubules, which pull the two sets of chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell just before it divides. Microtubules are constantly shrinking and growing, and chromosomes must stay attached the whole time, or they will not be correctly separated. Many proteins are involved in attaching chromosomes to microtubules, including two groups known as the Dam1 complex and the Ndc80 complex. The Dam1 complex forms a ring around microtubules, while the Ndc80 complex forms a long flexible rod that can bend in the middle. However, it was not clear how these shapes allow these complexes to perform their roles in cells.</p><p>Kim et al. studied these two complexes from yeast cells. The experiments show that the Ndc80 rod bridges two Dam1 rings, not one as previously assumed. Both of these rings and the rod are required for chromosomes to attach to microtubules. Cells with defective Ndc80 rods that can only bind to one ring do not distribute their chromosomes correctly when they divide. Kim et al. also show that the Ndc80 rod holds the Dam1 rings a specific distance apart, which also appears to be important for the chromosomes to be correctly divided between daughter cells.</p><p>The next step following on from this work is to find out exactly why both rings are needed and why they seem to need to be a set distance apart. Human and other eukaryotic cells divide in a similar way to yeast cells, so these findings may help us to understand what goes wrong in Down’s syndrome and other diseases caused by cells having the wrong number of chromosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21069.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21069.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>Dam1</kwd><kwd>Ndc80</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM040506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Trisha N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacCoss</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM079373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asbury</surname><given-names>Charles L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 RR026406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asbury</surname><given-names>Charles L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of the Ndc80 complex to bind two Dam1 complex rings is important for chromosome attachment, and the distance between the two rings is vital for supporting growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinetochores link replicated chromosomes to spindle microtubules. They form attachments flexible and strong enough to stay attached to microtubules during assembly and disassembly. Estimates of the strength of the attachments suggest that they are much stronger than required just to pull a chromosome through the cellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicklas, 1965</xref>). Yet, incorrect attachments are weak enough to be detached and corrected.</p><p>The Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are the main microtubule-binding components in the budding yeast kinetochore. The Ndc80 complex connects the Dam1 complex to the rest of the kinetochore. The two complexes interact on microtubules, significantly increasing the strength of Ndc80 complex attachment to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampert et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2010</xref>). How these two complexes interact on microtubules remains uncertain with conflicting results reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maure et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to providing strong attachments between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, kinetochores also serve as regulatory hubs. The Ndc80 complex and the Dam1 complex are at the center of this regulation. The Ndc80 complex is a scaffold for the spindle assembly checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiruma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>). Both the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes are targets of Aurora B kinase, which corrects aberrant kinetochore-microtubule attachments to achieve bioriented attachments (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarangapani and Asbury, 2014</xref>). Aurora B kinase phosphorylation of the Dam1 complex components Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p together disrupts the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2010</xref>); however, which phospho-protein is responsible for disrupting the interaction has yet to be deciphered.</p><p>The spontaneous assembly in vitro of the Dam1 complex into microtubule-encircling rings suggests a compelling mechanism for kinetochore-microtubule coupling. The ring might be pushed by the curled depolymerizing microtubule protofilaments and prevented from falling off of flared assembling ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asbury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntosh et al., 2008</xref>). We don’t know the organization of the Dam1 complex in the cell, although oligomerization is essential for formation of strong kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McIntosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Umbreit et al., 2014</xref>). Estimates of the number of Dam1 complexes at the kinetochore in vivo have suggested numbers as low as 10, which is not enough to form a single 16-membered ring, and as high as 32, which is enough for two rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joglekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>). Despite this uncertainty, previous budding yeast kinetochore models have assumed one Dam1 complex ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aravamudhan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joglekar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that the kinetochore requires the Ndc80 complex to bind and bridge two Dam1 complex rings in vivo and that Aurora B kinase regulates the interactions at both rings. Our work suggests that the specific ring-ring distance, defined by the Ndc80 complex bridge, is important for supporting growth. The presence of two Dam1 rings at the kinetochore, in a specific orientation bound to the Ndc80 complex, would have implications for how attachment strength is established and modulated by tension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three Ndc80p regions interact with Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p of the Dam1 complex</title><p>We identified where the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes interact using protein cross-linking and mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) following protocols developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoopmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kudalkar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelter et al., 2015</xref>). The full decameric Dam1 complex and tetrameric Ndc80 complex were cross-linked in the presence of taxol-stabilized microtubules. The C-terminal regions of Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p formed cross-links to three distinct regions of Ndc80p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The corresponding regions of Nuf2p also formed cross-links to these same regions of the Dam1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These three C-terminal regions of the Dam1 complex include five sites phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase. Phosphorylation of all five sites fully disrupts the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2010</xref>).

Importantly, Ndc80 complexes carrying a mutation in regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> demonstrated homogeneous behavior in size exclusion chromatography, similar to the wild type Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). These mutations also did not alter the residence time of the Ndc80 complex alone on microtubules, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tien et al., 2013</xref>). As reported previously, the presence of the Dam1 complex significantly increases the residence time of wild-type Ndc80 complex on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2010</xref>). However, addition of the Dam1 complex only partially increased the residence time of the mutant complexes as compared to the wild-type Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Ndc80-GFP complex containing Ndc80p insertional mutations outside the regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> had similar microtubule and Dam1 complex binding characteristics as the wild-type Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). These observations suggest regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup> each contribute to the interaction of Ndc80 complex with Dam1 complex; and the insertional mutants in these three regions were previously identified as lethal because they disrupted the interaction between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p participate in interactions with Ndc80 complex that can be separately regulated by Aurora B kinase</title><p>We then asked if the corresponding regions in the Dam1 complex also contribute to the interaction between Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes.

Phosphorylation of Dam1p S20 significantly decreases Dam1 complex oligomerization, while phosphorylation of the three C-terminal sites in Dam1p slightly inhibits direct binding of the Dam1 complex to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gestaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelter et al., 2015</xref>).

In the presence of the 10-heptad mutant Ndc80 (Ndc80<sup>10-hep</sup>) complex, Dam1 ring doublets were consistently separated by 42.1 ± 2.1 nm, 9 nm farther apart than in the presence of wild-type Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, mutation in regions A, B or C of Ndc80p abolished its ability to bind two rings as the Dam1 inter-ring distance in these cases was the same in the absence of Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1D–F and</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).

Rings are not required for the Dam1 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules in the absence of tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gestaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grishchuk et al., 2008</xref>). However, oligomerization of the Dam1 complex is required to maintain attachments under tension as would be experienced during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Umbreit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volkov et al., 2013</xref>). Prior models of the kinetochore have all assumed that each kinetochore contains only one Dam1 complex ring. Here we show that the Ndc80 complex bridges two rings of the Dam1 complex in vitro. Lethal mutations in Ndc80p that block binding of either one of the two rings result in loss of the Dam1 complex from the kinetochore and failure in biorientation and attachment of kinetochores to the mitotic spindle. These results suggest that faithful microtubule attachments require two Dam1 complex rings per kinetochore in vivo.</p><p>Counting of kinetochore components by fluorescence microscopy has yielded conflicting results for the number of Dam1 complexes at the yeast kinetochore depending on the standard used. Assuming two Cse4 histone molecules per kinetochore, Joglekar and coworkers report enough Dam1 complexes to form one ring at a kinetochore during metaphase and a partial ring during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravamudhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joglekar et al., 2006</xref>). Lawrimore and coworkers measured 5.5 Cse4 histone molecules per kinetochore, giving enough Dam1 complex for two rings at a kinetochore during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawrimore et al., 2011</xref>); whereas Coffman and coworkers measured 8 Cse4 histone molecules per kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coffman et al., 2011</xref>). Our results show that the Ndc80 complex can bind two Dam1 rings in vitro. Given the results of the latter two groups, we propose that there are two Dam1 complex rings at the kinetochore.</p><p>The region before the hairpin and the loop region of Ndc80p have both been identified as binding sites for the Dam1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maure et al., 2011</xref>). Our results indicate that the interaction between the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes is more extensive forming a tripartite network. The C-terminal domains of Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p interact with three distinct regions of Ndc80p, one of which is the hairpin consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampert et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are also consistent with a previous study showing an interaction between Ndc80p and the C-terminal region of Dam1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalantzaki et al., 2015</xref>). However, we did not find any evidence for an interaction between the Ndc80p ‘loop’ region and Dam1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maure et al., 2011</xref>). The inability of the loop deletion mutant to assemble the Dam1 complex into the kinetochore might be due to an indirect effect.</p><p>Comparing the predicted distances between regions A<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and C<sup>Ndc80p</sup>, and the 33 nm Dam1 complex inter-ring distance from EM experiments suggests that regions A and B contribute to the Ndc80 complex interaction with the ring closer to the N-terminus of Ndc80p/Nuf2p, while region C contributes to the Ndc80 complex interaction with the second ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our TIRF microscopy and live cell imaging results suggest that disrupting interaction A is more severe than disrupting interaction B or C. A recent computational model of the structure of the Dam1 complex bound to microtubules positions region A<sup>Dam1p</sup> and B<sup>Ask1p</sup> near the microtubule surface, while region C<sup>Spc34p</sup> is positioned away from the microtubule surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelter et al., 2015</xref>).

Our results suggest how the Aurora B kinase might fine tune the interaction between Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes, resulting in a range of disruption.</p><p>The inability of <italic>ndc80<sup>10hep</sup></italic> and <italic>nuf2<sup>10hep</sup></italic> together to support growth in vivo might be explained in several ways. The addition of extra heptad repeats in the coiled-coil domains might destabilize formation of the heterotetrameric Ndc80 complex, for example. However, we do not currently favor this hypothesis because the extra-long mutant version of Ndc80p is expressed in vivo, and because the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex is stable and binds to both microtubules and to the Dam1 complex in vitro, similar to wild-type Ndc80 complex. Unnatural orientation of the Ndc80p/Nuf2p globular head in the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex, due to the addition of extra heptad repeats, might also disrupt the specific geometry that the Ndc80 complex takes in relation to other kinetochore proteins. However given the presence of the flexible loop in Ndc80p, it seems unlikely that the two ends of the complex are held in a rigid orientation relative to each other. Compared to the wild-type Ndc80 complex, the Ndc80<sup>10hep</sup> complex further separates the Dam1 complex rings in vitro. We propose that the specific 33 nm Dam1 complex inter-ring distance is vital. The transition from 13 nm, in the absence of the Ndc80 complex, to 33 nm Dam1 complex inter-ring distance could signal the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachment or biorientation. Deviation from the specific 33 nm distance might disrupt a yet unknown mechanism for detecting kinetochore-microtubule attachments, or bioriented attachments, or both. Future work will focus on characterizing the specific effects of the extra-long Ndc80 complex and the role of the Dam1 complex inter-ring distance in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes were independently expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> using polycistronic vectors, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gestaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miranda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Powers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2005</xref>).

The two experiments identified similar interaction regions between the Dam1 and Ndc80 complexes. XL-MS was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelter et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, 10 µg of taxol stabilized microtubules were mixed with 10 µg Dam1 complex and 10 ug Ndc80 complex in 100 µL BRB80 at 25°C and allowed to stand for 5 mins. For DSS cross-linking, 3 µL 14.5 mM DSS in DMSO was added, and the mixture allowed to cross-link for 2 mins at 25°C before quenching by addition of 10 µL 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. For EDC cross-linking 7.5 µL 145 mM EDC plus 3.75 µL 145 mM Sulfo-NHS were added to the reaction, and the mixture allowed to cross-link for 30 mins at 25°C before quenching by addition of 10 µL 0.5 M NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Quenched reactions were spun at 58,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor for 10 min at 37°C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µL ice cold buffer reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 37°C for 30 min followed by 30 mins alkylation at RT with 15 mM iodoacetamide (IAA). Digestion with trypsin at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 60:1 was performed overnight at room temperature with shaking. Digested samples were acidified with 5 M HCL prior to being stored at −80°C until analysis. Mass spectrometry and data analysis was performed on either a Q-Exactive or Q-Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelter et al., 2015</xref>). Each cross-linked sample was run four times and the data were combined before analysis (technical replicate). Mass spectra were converted into mzML using msconvert from ProteoWizard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>). Standard linear peptide searches were performed using Comet to identify all proteins in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eng et al., 2013</xref>). Cross-linked peptides were identified using the Kojak version 1.4.2 cross-link identification software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoopmann et al., 2015</xref>) following the author’s instructions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kojak-ms.org">http://www.kojak-ms.org</ext-link>). Kojak results were exported to Percolator version 2.08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Käll et al., 2007</xref>) to produce a statistically validated set of cross-linked peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) at the desired false discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Percolator (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005040">SCR_005040</ext-link>) is a semi-supervised algorithm that assigns a statistically meaningful q value to each PSM through analysis of the target and decoy PSM distributions. Decoy PSMs derive from peptide sequences known to be false. In the current work the target databases consisted of all proteins identified in the sample analyzed, while the decoy databases consisted of the corresponding set of reversed protein sequences. Cross-link PSMs were considered to be false if at least one of the peptides was from a decoy protein sequence. The data presented in this paper was filtered to show only hits to the target proteins that had a Percolator assigned peptide level q value ≤ 0.05.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Andrea Musacchio, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stefan Westermann, and Kevin D Corbett.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors revisited the interaction of the Ndc80 complex, considered the main microtubule receptor at kinetochores, with the Dam1 complex, which is required for bi-orientation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This interaction had been studied in quite some detail before, but the authors add an important new twist to the story by proposing that Ndc80 binds two Dam1 rings, rather than one as previously believed. The manuscript reports a nice mechanistic investigation that sheds new light on an important piece of molecular machinery. The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> kinetochore remains central for the advancement of kinetochore studies, and the dissection of its mechanism of action is of general interest for the field. While the reviewers are supportive, they also identified some contentious points that will need to be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The definition of the A, B, and C region seems relatively clear for what concerns the Dam complex (defined by span of Ndc80 cross-linking pattern and containing most of the P sites previously identified), much less so for what concerns Ndc80. The original mutational analysis made use of 15-residue insertions, a serious perturbation that may be destabilizing. Are there conserved motifs that identify these Ndc80 regions and that could be mutated (substitutions, not deletion), singly and in combination, to reinforce the authors' contention that there are two separate binding sites? If this is not possible, are there at least a couple of lethal Ndc80 insertion mutants that fall outside of the predicted A, B, and C sites, and whose microtubule residence time could be measured? No change in residency time would be expected in this case if these mutations did not perturb the interaction with Dam1. Also, were mutations A, B, and C combined to see if they had an additive effect on residence time?</p><p>2) Subsection “Three Ndc80p regions interact with Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p of the Dam1 complex”, first paragraph: more detail in the description of the cross-linking experiment should be provided: First, the authors should make clear that complete 4- and 10-protein Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes were used, and that the experiment was done in the presence of stabilized microtubules. Second, there must have been cross-links between Dam1 complex subunits and Nuf2 (which runs right alongside Ndc80); do these confirm or fail to confirm the model? All detected cross-links, also those with Nuf2 and possibly Spc24 and Spc25 should be reported.</p><p>3) The manuscript implies that two of the Ndc80 sites bind a single Dam1 ring, while a third Ndc80 site binds the second ring, but the reviewers where not clear whether it is sites A and B or B and C that function together. The authors should explicitly clarify their views on this point.</p><p>4) The reviewers believe that the in vivo experiments should be extended, at least by visualizing Dam1 in presence of single and double Ndc80 mutants that are kept alive by the Ndc80 degron allele, and where the relocalization of Dam1 from kinetochores to the spindle should be visible. This would be consistent with the work in vitro and give more credit to the hypothesis.</p><p>5) The EM experiments are interesting but have limitations. Ndc80 is not visible as being associated with the differently spaced rings. Doublets either with normal spacing or with increased spacing in the presence of Ndc80 seem to make up only a small fraction of the total number of Dam1 rings present in the sample. If the authors' claim is correct, Ndc80 should force the Dam1 rings into doublets when Ndc80 concentration is raised. This has not been tested. The authors should vary the stoichiometry of Ndc80 in the EM experiments to see if they can force complex assembly and a tighter distribution.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21069.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The definition of the A, B, and C region seems relatively clear for what concerns the Dam complex (defined by span of Ndc80 cross-linking pattern and containing most of the P sites previously identified), much less so for what concerns Ndc80.

The insertional mutations in Ndc80p regions A, B, and C were previously characterized (Tien et al., 2013) and shown to form the Ndc80 complex in vivoand in vitro and bind microtubules in vitro similarly to the wild type Ndc80 complex. As defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, each Ndc80p interaction region is quite long, spanning between 60 and 98 amino acids. These are largely coiled coil regions and no motifs are obvious beyond the coiled coil heptad repeat. Finding specific substitution mutations that disrupt the interaction between the Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes would be quite difficult.</p><p>We appreciate your alternative suggestion to test lethal Ndc80p insertional mutants that are outside of the interaction regions for binding microtubules and Dam1 complex. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>, we tested two additional lethal Ndc80p insertional mutants at amino acid positions 219 and 652. Both of these Ndc80 complex mutants had microtubule and Dam1 binding characteristics similar to those of the wild type Ndc80 complex, demonstrating that the disrupted interaction between the Dam1 complex and Ndc80 complex with a mutation in A<sup>ndc80p</sup>, B<sup>ndc80p</sup>, or C<sup>ndc80p</sup> is not an artifact of the five amino acid insertion. This data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, D</xref> and subsection “Three Ndc80p regions interact with Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p of the Dam1 complex”, last paragraph.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion of combining mutations A, B, and C together. Instead of pursuing this in vitro experiment, we focused our efforts on making the combination mutants to test in vivo. Please see below.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “Three Ndc80p regions interact with Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p of the Dam1 complex”, first paragraph: more detail in the description of the cross-linking experiment should be provided: First, the authors should make clear that complete 4- and 10-protein Ndc80 and Dam1 complexes were used, and that the experiment was done in the presence of stabilized microtubules. Second, there must have been cross-links between Dam1 complex subunits and Nuf2 (which runs right alongside Ndc80); do these confirm or fail to confirm the model? All detected cross-links, also those with Nuf2 and possibly Spc24 and Spc25 should be reported.</italic></p><p>The requested additional details about the conditions of the cross-linking experiments have been added to the manuscript in the first paragraph of the subsection “Three Ndc80p regions interact with Dam1p, Ask1p, and Spc34p of the Dam1 complex”.</p><p>Thank you for asking about the cross-links between the Dam1 complex subunits (Dam1p, Ask1p, Spc34p) and Nuf2p. As predicted the Dam1 complex proteins form cross-links to Nuf2p. The Dam1p-Nuf2p cross-links correspond to the exact regions of Nuf2p predicted from the Dam1-Ndc80 cross-links, given the register of the coiled coil between Ndc80p and Nuf2p. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and discussed in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><p>We agree with <italic>eLife</italic> and the reviewers on full presentation and transparency of our data. We have recently developed an online Protein Cross-Linking Database (ProXL) for easy visualization and sharing of cross-linking data (Riffle et al., 2016). This is an effective method for sharing large and complicated cross-linking/mass spectrometry data as it allows users full access to both the raw and processed data as well as providing comprehensive tools for analyzing the data. As stated in the Materials and methods section, the full cross-linking data referred to in the manuscript are available to the public: (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proxl.yeastrc.org/proxl/viewProject.do?project_id=24">http://proxl.yeastrc.org/proxl/viewProject.do?project_id=24</ext-link>). Please access the full cross-linking data by going to this link.</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript implies that two of the Ndc80 sites bind a single Dam1 ring, while a third Ndc80 site binds the second ring, but the reviewers where not clear whether it is sites A and B or B and C that function together. The authors should explicitly clarify their views on this point.</italic></p><p>We have included a paragraph (Discussion, fourth paragraph) and a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) to clarify our views on this matter.</p><p><italic>4) The reviewers believe that the</italic> in vivo <italic>experiments should be extended, at least by visualizing Dam1 in presence of single and double Ndc80 mutants that are kept alive by the Ndc80 degron allele, and where the relocalization of Dam1 from kinetochores to the spindle should be visible. This would be consistent with the work</italic> in vitro <italic>and give more credit to the hypothesis.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion of this experiment. We think it is a very good hypothesis, given our results thus far. We have visualized the kinetochore and Dam1 complex with Mtw1-YFP and Dad4-CFP, respectively. Our new results suggest that the Dam1 complex becomes delocalized from kinetochores in the presence of Ndc80 with one or multiple mutations in regions A, B, and C. These results are presented in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and in the second paragraph of the subsection “The Ndc80 mutants have defects in recruiting the Dam1 complex to the kinetochore”.</p><p><italic>5) The EM experiments are interesting but have limitations. Ndc80 is not visible as being associated with the differently spaced rings. Doublets either with normal spacing or with increased spacing in the presence of Ndc80 seem to make up only a small fraction of the total number of Dam1 rings present in the sample. If the authors' claim is correct, Ndc80 should force the Dam1 rings into doublets when Ndc80 concentration is raised. This has not been tested. The authors should vary the stoichiometry of Ndc80 in the EM experiments to see if they can force complex assembly and a tighter distribution.</italic></p><p>The EM experiments are set up such that the Dam1 complex rings do not fully decorate the microtubules. Nevertheless, 49% of the Dam1 ring pairs were found in closely spaced doublets in the presence of the wild-type Ndc80 complex. This demonstrates that half the Dam1 complex rings are bridged by wild-type Ndc80 complex. We agree that this is a very important point and have added it to the manuscript (subsection “The Ndc80 complex binds two Dam1 complex rings”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
