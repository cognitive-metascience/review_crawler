Although this is likely to represent an evolutionary ancient developmental process, the regulatory architecture of nβ-catenin-induced mesendoderm remains elusive in the majority of animals. Here, we show that, in ascidian embryos, three nβ-catenin transcriptional targets, <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/</italic>20, are each required for the correct initiation of both the mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks. Conversely, these three factors are sufficient, in combination, to produce a mesendoderm ground state that can be further programmed into mesoderm or endoderm lineages. Importantly, we show that the combinatorial activity of these three factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to mesendoderm. We conclude that in ascidian embryos, the transient mesendoderm regulatory state is defined by co-expression of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/</italic>20.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14692.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14692.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ascidian</kwd><kwd>germ layer</kwd><kwd>mesendoderm</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>binary fate switch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. intestinalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005737</institution-id><institution>Université Pierre et Marie Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#1144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20131200223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ascidian mesendoderm is a transient regulatory state upstream of mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks and required for the initiation of both.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm arise during embryonic development by a process termed germ layer segregation. In many species, at least part of the endoderm and mesoderm derive from transient ‘mesendoderm’ precursors, as is the case in ascidian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimelman and Griffin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodaway and Patient, 2001</xref>). However, the precise nature of this induced regulatory state is not well understood. In ascidians, the first animal-vegetal (A-V) oriented cell division generates the eight-cell stage embryo and segregates the mesendoderm and some neural lineages into two pairs of vegetal founder lineages (the A- and B-line) and the ectoderm (epidermis and neural) into two pairs of animal lineages (a- and b-line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conklin, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishida, 1987</xref>). This study focuses on the A-line mesendoderm lineages. From the 8- to 16-cell stage, the two A4.1 blastomeres divide medio-laterally to generate the two pairs of neuro-mesendodermal NNE cells, for <underline>n</underline>otochord/<underline>n</underline>eural/<underline>e</underline>ndoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). NNE cells then divide along the A-V axis to generate NN cells (notochord/neural) and E cells (mostly endoderm) at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Subsequently, NN cells segregate into notochord and neural lineages at the 64-cell stage. At this stage, while the medial E cell generates two endoderm precursors, the lateral-most E cell is subject to an inductive interaction resulting in the generation of one endoderm and one mesoderm (the trunk lateral cell lineage) precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi and Levine, 2008</xref>). Later, during neural plate patterning, a muscle precursor is also generated from the lateral borders of the NN-lineage-derived neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicol and Meinertzhagen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishida, 1987</xref>). Thus, as in other species, ascidian germ layer segregation can be viewed as a progressive process with part of the neural tissue arising from bipotential neuro-mesodermal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>). The earliest cell divisions of the ascidian embryo along the A-V axis at the 8- and 32-cell stages can be considered as the earliest steps of germ layer segregation.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14692.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> are candidate NNE lineage specification factors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic drawings of embryos at the 16- and 32-cell stages.

The β-catenin/TCF complex promotes endoderm or mesendoderm in a wide range of organisms, and this process is therefore likely to represent an ancestral mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darras et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Logan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCauley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyawaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Momose and Houliston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wikramanayake et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2003</xref>). We have previously shown that the earliest steps of germ layer segregation in ascidian embryos are mediated by two rounds of nuclear(n)-β−catenin-dependent binary fate decisions. The first nβ-catenin-driven binary fate decision takes place at the 8- to 16-cell stage. During this process, the β-catenin/TCF complex is differentially activated between mesendoderm and ectoderm progenitors, resulting in segregation of these lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothbächer et al., 2007</xref>). The second step takes place at the 32-cell stage and controls the segregation of NNE mesendoderm cells into endoderm (E cell) and notochord/neural (NN cell) lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). During this step, the β-catenin/TCF complex is again differentially activated between E and NN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Therefore, cells in which nβ-catenin remains active during the two steps (ON + ON) are specified as endoderm lineage, cells in which nβ-catenin remains inactive during the two steps (OFF + OFF) are specified as ectoderm lineage and cells in which nβ-catenin is active during the first step but inactive during the second step (ON + OFF) are specified as notochord-neural lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). These two rounds of nβ-catenin-driven switches result in transcriptional activation of the lineage specifiers, <italic>Zic-related.b (Zic-r.b</italic>, formally <italic>ZicL</italic>) and <italic>Lhx3/4</italic> (formally <italic>Lhx3</italic>), in NN and E cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imai et al., 2002c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Satou et al., 2001</xref>). One of the key features of these reiterative nβ-catenin-driven binary fate decisions is that the same asymmetric cue (nβ-catenin) is interpreted differently during each step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand and Hobert, 2010</xref>). Thus, in the NNE lineage, it is likely that the transient regulatory state induced by the first nβ-catenin input in NNE cells confers a distinct transcriptional response to the second nβ-catenin input on E cells.</p><p>In this study, we characterise the NNE lineage specification factors, which are induced by the first nβ-catenin input and address how these mesendoderm factors feed into the gene regulatory network of the NN and E lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Foxa.a</italic>, <italic>Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> are nβ-catenin transcriptional targets in NNE cells</title><p>Following the first nβ-catenin activation at the 16-cell stage, <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd, Fgf9/16/20, cadherinII</italic> and β<italic>CD1</italic> (β-catenin downstream gene 1) are induced in the NNE cells, with at least <italic>Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> being direct targets of the β-catenin/Tcf7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imai et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2002c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothbächer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Satou et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>), we confirmed that in β-catenin–inhibited (β-catenin-MO injected) embryos analysed at the 16-cell stage, <italic>Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf/9/16/20</italic> expression was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In addition to the mesendoderm lineages, <italic>Foxa.a</italic> is also expressed in the a-line anterior ectoderm lineages in a nβ-catenin-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamy et al., 2006</xref>). In β-catenin–inhibited embryos, <italic>Foxa.a</italic> expression persisted in NNE and a-lineage cells, probably due to transformation of vegetal cells into animal cells that has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, ectopic stabilisation of nβ-catenin resulted in activation of all three genes in ectoderm lineages at the 16-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This was achieved by treating embryos with BIO, a chemical inhibitor of the upstream inhibitory regulator of β-catenin, GSK-3, from the eight-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meijer et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, our results confirm that <italic>Foxd, Foxa.a</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> are transcriptional targets of nβ-catenin in vegetal cells, although <italic>Foxa.a</italic> also has a nβ-catenin-independent expression in a-line animal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Foxa.a</italic>, <italic>Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic>-signals are required for the correct initiation of both NN and E gene expression</title><p>It is likely that these gene products, activated by the first nβ-catenin signal in NNE cells, act together with the second differential nβ-catenin signal to activate the distinct gene regulatory networks between NN and E cells.

However, we found that inhibiting any one of these factors prevented the correct initiation of gene expression in both NN (<italic>Zic-r.b</italic>) and E (<italic>Lhx3/4</italic>) lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We inhibited these factors using Morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides (<italic>Foxd-MO, Foxa.a-MO, Fgf9-MO</italic>) and analysed <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Lhx3/4</italic> expression at the 32-cell stage, when NN and E cell lineages become segregated. FGF signals are frequently mediated by the MEK/ERK signalling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation via ETS family transcription factors, as is the case in ascidian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Nishida, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miya and Nishida, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</xref>). We confirmed that Fgf9/16/20 is responsible for the broad activation of ERK at the 32-cell stage in most vegetal lineages, including NN and E lineages, as well as two neural lineages in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Treatment of embryos from the 16-cell stage with the MEK inhibitor U0126, also inhibits this ERK1/2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Nishida, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picco et al., 2007</xref>). Inhibition of Fgf9/16/20, MEK or ETS1/2 (ETS1/2-MO) gave similar results, although inhibition of ETS1/2 gave only a weak down-regulation of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> expression at the 32-cell stage, perhaps indicating the involvement of additional transcription factors that are also known to mediate FGF signals in <italic>Ciona</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gainous et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition, in the NN-cell lineage, FGF-signalling is required for notochord fate, but has to be attenuated for neural fate (Minokawa et al, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picco et al., 2007</xref>; Yasuo and Hudson, 2007). Thus, an FGF-independent expression of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> at the 64-cell stage, at least in neural fated cells, is not unexpected. In <italic>Foxa.a-</italic> and <italic>Foxd-</italic> inhibited embryos, <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> continues to be repressed in the NN-cell lineages at the 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 2006</xref>), consistent with a requirement for <italic>Foxa.a</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic> for both NN cell lineage-derived structures, the notochord and caudal central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imai et al., 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>).</p><p>Endoderm gene expression was continuously reduced up to at least the early gastrula stage, following inhibition of any one of the NNE factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–</xref>e). However, using alkaline phosphatase activity as an indicator of endoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Whittaker, 1977</xref>), a complete loss of endoderm at larval stages was observed only in <italic>Foxa.a-</italic>inhibited embryos, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imai et al., 2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>). In <italic>Foxd</italic> and FGF-signal inhibited embryos, a large domain of alkaline phosphatase activity could be detected, suggesting that endoderm fate recovers in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Simultaneous repression of <italic>Foxd</italic> and FGF-signalling, however, resulted in both a stronger repression of early endoderm gene expression as well as an almost complete absence of alkaline phosphatase activity at larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Thus, for eventual endoderm formation, the embryo is able to compensate for loss of either Foxd or FGF-signals but is not able to compensate for loss of both.</p><p>As well as promoting vegetal ‘mesendoderm’ fates, nβ-catenin also represses the ectoderm gene programme in vegetal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothbächer et al., 2007</xref>). In β-catenin knock-down embryos, ectopic expression of the early ectoderm gene <italic>Efna.d</italic> (formally <italic>ephrin-Ad</italic>) is observed in both NN and E cells at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>) as well as in NNE cells at the 16-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>). Double inhibition of <italic>Foxd</italic> and FGF-signals also resulted in ectopic expression of <italic>Efna.d</italic> in NN cells, but never in E cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Thus, NNE factors repress the ectoderm genetic programme in NN cells. A lack of derepression in E cells is probably due to the presence of nβ-catenin in E cells at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that nβ-catenin can repress the ectoderm genetic programme both via and independently of the NNE factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Combinatorial activity of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20</italic> induces a mesendoderm state</title><p>Our data so far show that <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20-ERK1/2</italic> are individually required for the correct initiation of the genetic programmes of both NN and E cell lineages. Indeed, co-expression of these three factors takes place only in mesendoderm lineages, the NNE and B-line mesendoderm lineages of the 16- and 32-cell stage embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). At the 32-cell stage, the E cells continue to express these three genes, while NN cells express only <italic>Foxa.a</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic>. However, we have previously shown that <italic>Foxd</italic> transcripts preferentially segregate into the NN cells during the NN-E cell division, before they rapidly disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, NN cells also contain <italic>Foxd</italic> transcripts early in their cell cycle. We conclude that <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> are co-expressed only in mesendoderm lineages. We next addressed whether these three factors were sufficient to induce a mesendoderm regulatory state.</p><p>As well as in vegetal cells, <italic>Foxa.a</italic> is also expressed in a-line anterior animal cells and ERK1/2 is activated in one pair of a-line cells (the a6.5 pair) at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamy et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, a6.5 cells possess two of the three mesendoderm lineage specifiers and yet they do not adopt an NNE-like lineage. Consistent with the notion that coexpression of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> represents a NNE regulatory state, reintroduction of the remaining factor, <italic>Foxd</italic>, by mRNA injection, was able to convert a-line cells to a mesendoderm state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Injection of <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> in a-line cells at the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imai et al., 2002c</xref>). Similarly, expression of <italic>Bra,</italic> a marker of notochord precursors, was induced at the 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The broad ectopic expression of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Bra</italic> in the a-lineage was clearly not restricted to the a6.5 cells. The most likely reason for this was that <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA injection led to weak activation of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and strong inhibition of <italic>Efna.d</italic> expression in the ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Efna.d is a known antagonist of FGF-signals in <italic>Ciona</italic> and its inhibition results in widespread activation of ERK1/2 in ectoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohta and Satou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi and Levine, 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, when <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA-injected embryos were treated with U0126, the ectopic expression of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> was reduced and <italic>Bra</italic> expression was completely suppressed, mimicking the effect of MEK inhibition on endogenous <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Bra</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

This was expected since the two-step nβ-catenin binary fate decision model predicts that segregation of the endoderm lineage from the NNE lineage requires a second round of nβ-catenin activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, when <italic>Foxd-</italic>mRNA injected embryos were treated from the late 16-cell stage with BIO in order to mimic the second input of nβ-catenin activation, both <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Bra</italic> were repressed and <italic>Lhx3/4</italic> ectopically activated in the a-line ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>). Thus, the NNE-like state induced in animal cells by <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA injection behaves in the same way as NNE state of unmanipulated embryos.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments provide strong evidence that the combinatorial activity of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20-ERK1/2</italic> represents a NNE mesendoderm regulatory state downstream of the first round of nβ-catenin input. To further test this model, we addressed whether co-expression of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> was sufficient to rescue mesoderm in β-catenin-knockdown embryos. β-catenin-MO injected embryos would express only <italic>Foxa.a</italic> among the three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We have shown that injection of <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA results in induction of low levels of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> expression, together with a strong suppression of <italic>Efna.d</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, injection of <italic>Foxd</italic> mRNA should be sufficient to recapitulate a <italic>Foxd/Foxa.a/Fgf9/16/20</italic> overlap.

To simplify the analysis and to rule out the possibility that signals from the vegetal cells may influence the experimental outcome, animal hemispheres of electroporated embryos were isolated by micro-dissection at the eight-cell stage. Isolated explants were cultured until the neurula stage when they were assayed for <italic>Bra</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). <italic>Bra</italic> was chosen for this assay for its mesoderm (notochord)-specific expression. We observed a clear combinatorial effect between <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> on the reprogramming of ectoderm to mesoderm, with strong induction of <italic>Bra</italic> seen only when all three constructs were co-electroporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Furthermore, ectoderm explants could be reprogrammed to adopt an endoderm state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To achieve this, ectoderm explants from embryos electroporated with the triple combination (<italic>pFT&gt;Foxa.a, pFT&gt;Foxd</italic> and <italic>pFT&gt;Fgf9/16/20</italic>) were treated with a pulse of BIO from the 76-cell stage to mimic the second round of nβ-catenin activation that normally drives the segregation of NN and E lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The 76-cell stage was chosen, as at this stage ectopic expression driven by the <italic>pFT</italic> constructs is readily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), the ectoderm programme is downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and ectopic <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> is not yet detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

However, our data also suggest that nβ-catenin can repress ectoderm gene expression independently of these three factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that this can take place via a physical interaction between β-catenin/Tcf7 and Gata.a, preventing this key regulator of ectoderm lineage from binding to its DNA target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oda-Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothbächer et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Following inhibition of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> or <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic>, both endoderm and mesoderm development is perturbed at later stages of development, although there is a redundancy between <italic>Foxd</italic> and FGF-signalling for the eventual recovery of endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imai et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2002b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2002c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumano et al., 2006</xref>). It is likely that these factors play on-going roles during mesoderm and endoderm lineage progression. For example, ERK1/2 activity is detected in both notochord and endoderm until the early gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishida, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</xref>), <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> is required at the 64-cell stage for induction of notochord and repression of neural gene expression in the notochord lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imai et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Nishida, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minokawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</xref>) and <italic>Foxa.a</italic> is continuously expressed in notochord and endoderm, suggesting an on-going role for Foxa.a in both of these lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imai et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, creating ectopic zones of co-expression of these three factors in distinct embryological settings, revealed their strong synergistic ability to induce a mesendoderm state, which can be further programmed to an NN or E-like lineage by modulation of nβ-catenin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20</italic> are crucial for the mesendoderm ground state that canalises the daughter lineages to adopt either E or NN fates depending on the status of the second nβ-catenin input.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind that the germ layers are still not fully segregated at the 32-cell stage. While this manuscript has focused on the mesendoderm fates that arise from the NNE lineage, this lineage also produces neural tissue. NNE cells divide into E cells and NN cells. In addition to notochord, the NN cell generates the posterior part of the CNS, including the equivalent of the ‘spinal cord’ of vertebrates (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson, 2016</xref>]). The binary cell fate decision between neural and notochord takes place at the 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minokawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Picco et al., 2007</xref>). The lateral neural progenitors that arise from the NN-cell lineage also produce a muscle cell during neural plate patterning, following another neuromesodermal binary fate decision (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hudson and Yasuo, 2008</xref>]). Bipotential neuromesoderm progenitors are not an ascidian novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>). For example, in the zebrafish tailbud, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitor cells generate notochord and floorplate (ventral spinal cord) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Row et al., 2016</xref>) and in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish tailbud stem cells, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitors generate paraxial mesoderm and posterior neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gouti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Kimelman, 2012</xref>). Even in the classical mesendoderm model, that is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMS cell, the MS (mesoderm) lineage also gives rise to some neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). The lateral E cells of <italic>Ciona</italic> are also not yet fate-restricted to endoderm fate. At the 64-cell stage of development, the lateral E cell divides into one endoderm and one trunk lateral cell (mesenchyme) precursor, following induction of trunk lateral cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi and Levine, 2008</xref>). Thus, as in other species, ascidian germ layer segregation is an progressive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>) and NNE specification should thus be considered as its first step.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulatory architectures of mesendoderm</title><p>We have shown that, in ascidian embryos, individual mesendoderm lineage specifiers are required for the initiation of both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that the combinatorial activity of just three NNE factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to a mesendoderm state. The mesendoderm regulatory state in ascidian embryos is similar to the situation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMS cell in which the MED1/2 GATA factors feed into both E (endoderm) and MS (mesoderm) lineage specification, such that MED1/2 directly activates both MS and E target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broitman-Maduro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maduro et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGhee, 2013</xref>). Similarly, Foxa.a and Foxd can bind to the upstream sequences of both <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> (NN lineage) and <italic>Lhx3/4</italic> (E lineage), suggesting that this genetic interaction is direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubo et al., 2010</xref>). While there is little doubt that mesendoderm transiently forms during embryogenesis of many animal models, and that both mesoderm and endoderm are induced by similar upstream regulators (β-catenin in invertebrates, β-catenin and Nodal in vertebrates), in most cases the transcriptional nature of the mesendoderm state does not appear to be similar to that of ascidians or nematodes. In particular, the existence of mesendoderm lineage specifiers (that is individual factors required for the initiation of both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs) have not been described in the majority of model organisms. For example, in sea urchins and anamniote vertebrates, mesendoderm has been described as a mixed regulatory state with simultaneous activation of mesoderm and endoderm GRNs, prior to the lineage segregation of these fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peter and Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodaway and Patient, 2001</xref>). This type of ‘mixed-lineage’ regulatory architecture is also described in other systems and displays characteristics of multi-lineage priming, whereby the GRNs of two lineages are simultanously activated prior to lineage segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Graf and Enver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nimmo et al., 2015</xref>). If this were the scenario for the ascidian mesendoderm regulatory state, one would expect individual NNE factors to be required for, and be able to induce, only one or other of the two subsequent lineages (NN or E), but not both. A ‘mixed-lineage’ regulatory architecture is therefore not consistent with our data describing the NNE mesendoderm regulatory state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>These two regulatory architectures are, however, unlikely to be mutually exclusive. In sea urchin and sea stars, for example, genes interacting with both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs have been identified (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sugp.caltech.edu/endomes/">http://sugp.caltech.edu/endomes/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCauley et al., 2015</xref>). It cannot be ruled out that mesendoderm lineage specifiers, acting upstream of both endoderm and mesoderm GRNs, are more broadly utilised, but are simply difficult to uncover due to the sheer complexity of early embryos and their GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Tabou de-Leon and Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tremblay, 2010</xref>). It is also possible that the regulatory architecture of nematode and ascidian mesendoderm resulted from an adaption to a lineage-based mode of development with small numbers of cells, perhaps enabling these rapidly developing embryos to bypass the need for cross-repression and prolonged stabilisations of the endoderm and mesoderm GRNs. In summary, it is not yet clear whether an obligate mesendoderm state (that is a state with mesendoderm lineage specifiers) is present in the majority of bilaterian developmental programmes, although this seems to be the case in nematode and ascidian embryos.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Overexpression and knockdown tools</title><p>Morpholinos (MOs) were purchased from GeneTools (Philomath, Oregon) and have been reported previously: β-catenin-MO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hudson et al., 2013</xref>); <italic>Foxa.a-MO</italic> and <italic>Foxd-MO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 2006</xref>); <italic>Fgf9/16/20-MO</italic> and <italic>Fgf8/17/18-MO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yasuo and Hudson, 2007</xref>), ETS1/2-MO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Foxa.a-MO</italic> was injected at 0.85 mM and ETS1/2-MO at 0.75 mM.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Brad Davidson.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, while the study is carefully carried out with nice experimental findings here, the reviewers felt that the overall hypothetical framework of a specific mesendodermal state was not well supported. Given this, the paper does not fundamentally change the way we think about the evolution of developmental regulatory networks and is perhaps more suited to a specialized developmental journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Hudson et al. present a re-evaluation of established regulatory relationships between early regulators of endomesodermal fates in early ascidian embryo, using Ciona as a model and focusing on 32- and 64-cell stages.</p><p>The main point of the paper is to argue that FoxD, FoxAa and Fgf9/16/20 together form a mesendoderm-specific regulatory state activated downstream of β-catenin.

This seems to be the case for FoxD, however Fgf9/16/20 is later maintained in the NN progenitors and notochord, whereas FoxAa is later maintained in the endoderm. This suggests that – as shown to be the case for NN by Kobayashi et al., Genesis, 2013 – the NNE progenitors are primed by expressing early regulators of both the NN and the E fate. Thus, I am not convinced that the NNE &quot;mesendoectoderm&quot; progenitors depart significantly from a more classical model of multilineage priming of progenitors, as stated by the authors.</p><p>Finally, by the authors' admission, several of these regulatory linkages have been documented before, so it is not always clear what the novel insights really are.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors make substantial progress in delineating the transcriptional circuitry underlying mesendoderm lineage specification. Through an extensive and well-documented series of manipulations the authors demonstrate that three transcription factors are both necessary and sufficient for establishing the tunicate mesendodermal lineage. The authors then attempt to employ their results to help resolve questions about the nature and evolution of mesendodermal regulatory states in various clades. However, some of these interpretations are unclear and potentially inaccurate as discussed below.</p><p>My primary concern regards the overall framework the authors used to interpret their results. In the Abstract, the authors propose the mesendoderm may represent an &quot;obligatory&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; developmental state and indicate that their data supports this assertion. However, it is not clear that this is an accurate assessment.</p><p>According to this premise, the loss of the mesendoderm regulatory state should preclude the subsequent establishment of endoderm and mesodermal lineages. Yet, the authors’ data contradict this. Instead they found that loss of one or more key mesendodermal regulatory factors did not preclude the eventual establishment of endoderm or mesoderm. In particular, they showed that:</p><p>a) <italic>ZicL</italic> (a mesoderm lineage marker) expression was eventually restored after inhibition of FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>);b) Endoderm differentiation (assayed by alkaline phosphatase activity) occurred despite inhibition of FGF or FoxD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>They also found that single &quot;mesendoderm&quot; factors were able to restore either mesoderm or endoderm even though were not able to restore the mesendoderm state, effectively bypassing this state and demonstrating that it is not essential or obligatory. In particular they showed that:</p><p>FoxD alone was able to restore expression of Mesoderm lineage genes after loss of the mesendoderm regulatory state through disruption of B-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>There are at least three ways that the authors could address these concerns.</p><p>1) Clarify what they mean by an &quot;essential&quot; role for the mesendoderm and how their experimental results support this hypothesis.</p><p>2) Modify their hypothesis, possibly by suggesting that the three mesendodermal factors are locked into a recursive regulatory relationship. This caveat might explain why disruption of one factor only temporarily blocks the establishment of this regulatory state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It may also serve to explain why expression of a single factor is sufficient to re-establish the mesendodermal state/subsequent germ layer sub-specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If they do propose this explanation, they should also evaluate whether it is supported by any data.</p><p>3) Discard their current hypotheses and focus on an alternative framework. For example, they could choose to focus their interpretation on different regulatory architectures that might underlie mesendoderm regulatory states in different embryos and some potential functional implications of these different architectures. This framework may allow a more productive comparison to other characterized endomesodermal circuits (nematode/sea urchins) as further discussed in the next point.</p><p>A secondary concern focuses on the authors' statement that a &quot;distinct mesendodermal state&quot; is not present in sea urchins (Introduction, first paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph). The sea urchin and sea star GRNs both include a conserved, transient mesendodermal state based on B-catenin dependent expression of wnt8 and Otx (Hinman, Yankura and McCauley 2009). The cited paper (Peter and Davidson, 2010) does state that:</p><p>&quot;In a strict sense, early endomesoderm specification therefore involves the concomitant activation of two separate GRNs, rather than the activation of a common endomesoderm GRN which diverges into two daughter programs. The co-expression of regulatory genes to which we refer to as endomesoderm regulatory state is the result of these two GRNs.&quot;</p><p>However, this interpretation is not definitive and a good argument could be made that the endomesodermal state is established prior to the simultaneous activation of the two germ-layer specific programs, as laid out in the cited Hinman paper. The authors should clarify exactly what they think defines a distinct endodermal regulatory state and whether or not their data suggests a tunicate regulatory circuitry that is fundamentally distinct from that observed in sea urchins/sea stars.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14692.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Hudson et al. present a re-evaluation of established regulatory relationships between early regulators of endomesodermal fates in early ascidian embryo, using Ciona as a model and focusing on 32- and 64-cell stages.</italic></p><p><italic>[Please also refer to: “Finally, by the authors' admission, several of these regulatory linkages have been documented before, so it is not always clear what the novel insights really are.”]</italic></p><p>This comment is in striking contrast to reviewer 2 who describes our work as ‘substantial progress’. Importantly, the point of our manuscript was to characterise the mesendoderm lineage specifiers and reveal exactly how these factors provide the ground state for the second round of β-catenin driven binary fate decisions that segregates the NN and E lineages and it was not possible to ascertain this from the data already published. A summary of the published data is summarised below and is described more carefully in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><p>In the literature at the time of our first submission it was reported that <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd</italic> and <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> are downstream of β-catenin and that <italic>Foxd</italic> is likely to be direct. Data showing that <italic>Foxa.a</italic> is a transcriptional target of β-catenin had never actually been documented, though it was previously mentioned in Imai et al., 2002b. The relationship between β-catenin and any of the three factors was also not reported at the 16-cell stage in relation to either loss or activation (BIO-treatment) of β-catenin. It was important to perform this analysis at the 16-cell stage, prior to fate segregation of the mesendoderm lineage into mesoderm and endoderm lineages at the 32-cell stage. While this data at the time was therefore novel (albeit expected), it has since shown by the group of Yutaka Satou that all three of these factors are downstream targets of β-catenin with at least <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> and <italic>Foxd</italic> being direct targets (Oda-Ishii et al., PLoS Genetics, 2016). This highly relevant manuscript is duly discussed in the revised version of our manuscript. We preferred to retain the, now mostly confirmatory, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of our revised manuscript as it forms an important basis for our study.</p><p>To summarise the published data on the role of <italic>Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20</italic> in <italic>Ciona</italic>: Foxa.a was reported to be required for notochord and endoderm formation; Foxd for notochord but not endoderm and Fgf9/16/20 for notochord (partially) but not endoderm (Imai et al., 2002a, 2002b, Imai et al., 2006; Yasuo and Hudson, 2007). Similarly, in <italic>Halocynthia</italic> embryos Foxa.a, Foxd and FGF-signals were reported to be required for notochord formation (Kumano et al., 2006).</p><p>Important for our study was whether the expression of the NN and E lineage specifiers of the 32-cell stage embryo (<italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Lhx3/4</italic> respectively) was affected by loss of any of the NNE factors in <italic>Ciona</italic>. However, only an examination of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> expression at the 32-cell stage following Foxd-MO injection has been reported previously (Imai et al., 2002b). Thus, it was not known prior to our study whether Foxa.a, Foxd or FGF9/16/20 were involved in the correct initiation of NN and E cell genetic programmes. Thus, our data showing that all three factors are required individually for the initiation of gene expression in <italic>both</italic> NN <italic>and</italic> E cells is novel and also quite unexpected. Much of the supporting data, showing that endoderm gene expression is repressed at least until the early gastrula stage following Foxd or FGF-signal inhibition is also novel. The demonstration that Foxd and FGF-signals act in a partially redundant way during late endoderm specification is also novel, these factors were previously deemed dispensable for endoderm formation. Finally, the conversion of animal cells to an NNE-like state by co-expression of the three NNE factors, together with the demonstration that developing ectoderm cells can be reprogrammed to mesendoderm fate by co-expression of these three factors are novel.</p><p>In summary, while we agree that the regulatory relationships of these factors were partially known, the available data was not sufficient to answer our particular question and required further investigation. This should not be interpreted in any way as a criticism of the published manuscripts, which were addressing distinct questions to ours.</p><p><italic>The main point of the paper is to argue that FoxD, FoxAa and Fgf9/16/20 together form a mesendoderm-specific regulatory state activated downstream of β-catenin.

Rather it seems likely that these early progenitors are quite ascidian-specific even though they use conserved pan-bilaterian regulatory inputs such as the β-catenin/TCF regulatory axis.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the NNE precursors are not strictly mesendodermal. However, we do not agree that the ascidian ‘neuro-mesendodermal’ cells are likely to be ascidian specific. Rather, a study of the literature reveals common origins for neural and mesoderm in many species and as in many other species, ascidian mesendoderm specification begins with β-catenin signalling. The ascidian NNE (Neural, Notochord, Endoderm) cell, specified by β-catenin signals, divides into a neuro-mesoderm (NN) and (mostly) endoderm (E) progenitor. The NN cell generates notochord (mesoderm) and the posterior part of the CNS, including the equivalent of the ‘spinal cord’ with its ventral cells that are potentially equivalent to the vertebrate floor plate. Formation of these tissues follows a binary cell fate choice between neural and notochord: not neural and epidermis. Similarly, in the zebrafish tailbud, bipotential progenitor cells generate notochord and floorplate (Row et al., 2016, Development); in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells and zebrafish tailbud stem cells, bipotential neuromesodermal progenitors generate paraxial mesoderm and posterior neural tube (Gouti et al., PLOS Biology, 2014; Martin and Kimelman, 2012; Dev. Cell.). Even in the classical mesendodermal model, that is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> EMS cell, the MS lineage also gives rise to neurons (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977, Developmental Biology; Sulston et al., 1983 Developmental Biology). Further, several mutations in mice result in fate changes between neural and mesoderm- <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant cells fail to pass through the primitive streak and form secondary neural tubes instead of mesoderm (Ciruna et al., 1997, Development); in Wnt-3a mutants, cells ingress through the primitive streak, but fail to form somites, instead forming secondary neural tubes (Yoshikawa et al., 1997, Developmental Biology); in Tbx6 mutants posterior somites are converted to extra neural tubes (Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998, Nature). While classically the mesoderm germ layer is called as such rather than neuromesoderm, we feel that it is highly likely, due to the widespread nature of the neuro-mesoderm bipotential choice, that some neural fates originates from the so-called the ‘mesoderm’ germ layer.</p><p>In response to this concern raised by reviewer 1, we have now discussed in more detail the process of germ layer segregation in ascidian embryos to make it clear that 1) it is a progressive process, 2) part of the neural tissue shares a common origin with mesoderm, and 3) these two points are similar to what is observed in other chordate embryos.</p><p><italic>For this cocktail of regulators to be specific to a mesendoderm state, one would expect them to be restricted to the pluripotent stage of the NNE progenitor. This seems to be the case for FoxD, however Fgf9/16/20 is later maintained in the NN progenitors and notochord, whereas FoxAa is later maintained in the endoderm. This suggests that – as shown to be the case for NN by Kobayashi et al., Genesis, 2013 – the NNE progenitors are primed by expressing early regulators of both the NN and the E fate. Thus, I am not convinced that the NNE &quot;mesendoectoderm&quot; progenitors depart significantly from a more classical model of multilineage priming of progenitors, as stated by the authors.</italic> </p><p>We disagree. Firstly, we see absolutely no reason that a regulator can only be used once rather than for multiple rounds of cell lineage decisions (though this would be more convenient for developmental biologists). Importantly for our study it is the <italic>combinatorial activity</italic> of these three factors that specifies the NNE state and co-expression of all three factors takes place only at the 16-to-32-cell stages of development in mesendoderm lineages. The on-going expression of these factors in different lineages does not preclude their role in NNE cell specification, but rather suggests pleiotropic requirements. Indeed, in order to unravel the role of NNE factors at the 16-cell stage from their later roles, we focused on the effect of their loss at the 32-cell stage, that is one cell cycle after the onset of NNE factor expression. The 32-cell stage corresponds to the stage when the lineage segregation of notochord-neural (NN) and endoderm (E) takes place. Later stages were also addressed, in part to tie in our data with the published literature. What our data showed was that all three factors were required individually for the correct initiation of <italic>both</italic> NN and E cell genetic programmes. This concern prompted us to highlight that these factors likely play on-going roles during NN and E lineage specification.</p><p>We also disagree that the NNE cells are an example of multi-lineage priming. We found no evidence for this. If NNE cell fate specification were a case of multi-lineage priming, one would predict that loss of individual NNE factors (Foxa.a, Foxd or <italic>Fgf9</italic>/16/20) would result in loss of <italic>either</italic> NN <italic>or</italic> E gene expression. However, (initially to our surprise) both NN and E gene expression was reduced if any one of these factors was inhibited. We concluded from this that NNE factors are not indicative of a primed state. In support of this proposition, overexpression of any one factor in developing ectoderm lineages was unable to promote ectopic mesoderm fate, whereas overexpression of all three factors could. This is again not what would be predicted if NNE cells were primed with a mixture of NN and E specifiers: in this case overexpression of individual NNE factors would promote either NN fates (for the NN factors) or E fates (for the E factors). In our system, it is clearly β-catenin and not cross-antagonism of primed NN and E factors, which generates the differential fate decision between NN and E cells.</p><p>Issues raised by both reviewers made it clear to us that we had not been sufficiently clear with what we meant by a ‘distinct’ regulatory state and how this differed from a ‘mixed' or 'mixed-lineage’ regulatory state. A ‘mixed-lineage’ regulatory state shares characteristics to a primed regulatory state whereby a mixture of cell-type specific genes are transcriptionally activated prior to their restricted expression in a cell-type specific fashion following lineage segregation (e.g. Graf and Enver, 2009, Nature). To put it more simply, a cell ‘AB’ expresses factors that are, individually, required for <italic>either</italic> of the subsequent fates ‘A’ <italic>or</italic> ‘B’. We preferred, however, not to call this a ‘primed’ regulatory state, since in many cases priming involves lows levels of gene activation followed by reinforcement in a lineage specific manner. Instead, we used the term ‘mixed-lineage regulatory state’ a term previously employed (Guo et al., Dev. Cell, 2010). A ‘distinct’ regulatory state would be, in contrast, a situation wherein the cell ‘AB’ expresses factors (AB lineage specification factors) and each of them is required for <italic>both</italic> subsequent states A <italic>and</italic> B. We realised that ‘distinct’ was perhaps not the best word, since a ‘mixed-lineage’ regulatory state is also distinct from either of the subsequent lineage-specific states. In the revised manuscript, we decided to avoid the use of the term ‘distinct regulatory state' and instead compare and contrast the regulatory situation of ascidians to that described in other systems. Our manuscript now includes a clear definition of a ‘mixed-lineage regulatory state’ with supporting schematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We hope that the schematics more clearly highlight the difference between regulatory architectures of ascidian mesendoderm regulatory state and a mixed-lineage regulatory state. We also decided to no longer bring this point up in the Introduction, but rather to focus this, now more in depth comparison, to the Discussion section.</p><p>To summarise our findings, we identified in <italic>Ciona</italic> the mesendoderm lineage specifiers, whose combinatorial activity is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to a mesendoderm state. This ectopic mesendoderm state segregates further into either mesoderm or endoderm lineages depending on β-catenin activity, in a similar way to the endogenous mesendoderm lineage.</p><p><italic>Finally, by the authors' admission, several of these regulatory linkages have been documented before, so it is not always clear what the novel insights really are.</italic></p><p>See response to the first comment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors make substantial progress in delineating the transcriptional circuitry underlying mesendoderm lineage specification. Through an extensive and well-documented series of manipulations the authors demonstrate that three transcription factors are both necessary and sufficient for establishing the tunicate mesendodermal lineage. The authors then attempt to employ their results to help resolve questions about the nature and evolution of mesendodermal regulatory states in various clades. However, some of these interpretations are unclear and potentially inaccurate as discussed below.</italic> </p><p><italic>My primary concern regards the overall framework the authors used to interpret their results. In the Abstract, the authors propose the mesendoderm may represent an &quot;obligatory&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; developmental state and indicate that their data supports this assertion. However, it is not clear that this is an accurate assessment.</italic> </p><p><italic>According to this premise, the loss of the mesendoderm regulatory state should preclude the subsequent establishment of endoderm and mesodermal lineages. Yet, the authors’ data contradict this. Instead they found that loss of one or more key mesendodermal regulatory factors did not preclude the eventual establishment of endoderm or mesoderm. In particular, they showed that:</italic></p><p><italic>a) ZicL (a mesoderm lineage marker) expression was eventually restored after inhibition of FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>);</italic></p><p><italic>b) Endoderm differentiation (assayed by alkaline phosphatase activity) occurred despite inhibition of FGF or FoxD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</italic></p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern. What we meant by ‘essential’ was ‘essential for normal specification’. Indeed, NN and E cells fail to correctly initiate their genetic programmes when <italic>any one</italic> of the three NNE factors is inhibited. We accept that perhaps our use of the word 'essential' was too enthusiastic since there is likely to be some regulative processes that lead to the recovery of tissues under certain conditions. Below, we respond to the particular points raised in the first concern and explain why we maintain that the NNE factors are required for correct mesendoderm formation.</p><p>Following Fgf9/16/20 inhibition, <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> expression is restored at the 64-cell stage in both notochord and neural precursors. However, this is not that surprising considering that while FGF-signalling is required for notochord fate, it is not compatible with neural fate (differential ERK activation between notochord and neural fates drives their binary fate choice). Thus, one would expect an FGF-independent expression of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> at the 64-cell stage, at least in neural fated cells. Consistent with potentially independent gene regulation between the 32- and 64-cell stages, it has been shown that <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> expression at these stages can be mediated by separate enhancer elements (Anno et al., 2006, Genes Dev. Evol.). In the revised version of our manuscript, we described in more detail the regulation of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and the on-going role of FGF signals during the correct specification of the notochord lineage. While, it is not possible to ascertain whether FGF-signalling is absolutely required at each successive time point, we would nonetheless argue that FGF-signalling via ERK is involved during the step-by-step (<italic>Zic-r.b</italic> at 32-cell, <italic>Bra</italic> at 64-cell) specification of notochord.</p><p>In Foxd-MO or Fgf9/16/20-MO injected embryos, while endoderm gene expression is reduced, at least until the early gastrula stage, endoderm fate eventually recovers by larval stages. Thus, while we are confident that Foxd and Fgf9/16/20 are required for the <italic>correct specification</italic> of endoderm, we also agree that endoderm fate can recover. This kind of recovery is not unusual. In sea urchin for example, in the absence of <italic>pmar1</italic>, skeletogenic mesenchyme fate recovers as a result of the action of <italic>blimp1</italic>, a process coined ‘regulative recovery’ (Smith and Davidson, 2009; PNAS). To use an ascidian example, the loss of Fgf9/16/20 results in an early loss of the notochord genetic programme. However, notochord cells later recover to some extent via the action of Fgf8/17/18 (Yasuo and Hudson, 2007). To turn the argument around, we would not argue from this that Fgf9/16/20 is <italic>not</italic> required for notochord formation, it clearly is required for notochord cells to follow their correct developmental programme. In the current study, the data showing that loss of Foxd and Fgf9/16/20 in combination leads to a strong loss of endoderm supports a level of 'redundancy' between these two factors, but also a requirement. While we do not find the recovery of endoderm particularly worrying for our model, we do understand the reviewer’s concern. We have now been more careful to highlight our observation that the NNE factors are required for the correct initiation of NN and E lineages, with some recovery during later development. We also no longer refer to an 'essential' regulatory state.</p><p><italic>They also found that single &quot;mesendoderm&quot; factors were able to restore either mesoderm or endoderm even though were not able to restore the mesendoderm state, effectively bypassing this state and demonstrating that it is not essential or obligatory. In particular they showed that:</italic> </p><p><italic>FoxD alone was able to restore expression of Mesoderm lineage genes after loss of the mesendoderm regulatory state through disruption of B-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</italic></p><p>No, this is not correct. <italic>Foxd</italic> is not alone in this experiment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, loss of β-catenin results in quite broad expression of <italic>Foxa.a</italic> in both a-line cells as well as A-line cells (which are now most likely converted to an a-line fate based on co-expression of <italic>Foxa.a</italic> and <italic>Efna.d</italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)). On the other hand, <italic>Foxd</italic> injection results in loss of <italic>Efna.d</italic> (a potent inhibitor of FGF-MEK-ERK-signals) and weak activation of <italic>Fgf9/16/20</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in β-catenin-MO injected embryos, injection of <italic>Foxd</italic> into the egg restores the co-expression of all three factors by the 16-cell stage. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of β-catenin-MO+Foxd mRNA embryos with UO126 to inhibit FGF-signalling results in a similar reduction of <italic>Zic-r.b</italic> and <italic>Bra</italic> as is seen in control embryos. We agree that we did not explain this experiment very well in our previous manuscript and in response to this concern of Reviewer 2, we now explained this experiment in detail.</p><p>Finally, in support of our hypothesis that all three factors are required to induce an NNE-like state, our overexpression data clearly show that <italic>all three</italic> factors are required to reprogramme ectoderm into mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>There are at least three ways that the authors could address these concerns.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Clarify what they mean by an &quot;essential&quot; role for the mesendoderm and how their experimental results support this hypothesis.</italic></p><p>We agree with Reviewer 2 that this was not sufficiently clear in our submitted manuscript. In response to both reviewers, we now include an explicit description of different regulatory architectures.</p><p><italic>2) Modify their hypothesis, possibly by suggesting that the three mesendodermal factors are locked into a recursive regulatory relationship. This caveat might explain why disruption of one factor only temporarily blocks the establishment of this regulatory state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It may also serve to explain why expression of a single factor is sufficient to re-establish the mesendodermal state/subsequent germ layer sub-specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If they do propose this explanation, they should also evaluate whether it is supported by any data.</italic></p><p>We think that the reviewer is suggesting that the three NNE factors may be locked into a kind of regulatory ‘kernel’ whereby each factor induces the expression of the others? This is a nice idea, but it is not supported by our data. Inhibition of any one factor does not affect expression of any other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although injection of <italic>Foxd</italic> does induce low levels of Fgf9/16/20 expression. Most importantly for our conclusions, expression of a single factor is <italic>not</italic> sufficient to re-establish NNE fate in developing ectoderm cells, as described above.</p><p><italic>3) Discard their current hypotheses and focus on an alternative framework. For example, they could choose to focus their interpretation on different regulatory architectures that might underlie mesendoderm regulatory states in different embryos and some potential functional implications of these different architectures. This framework may allow a more productive comparison to other characterized endomesodermal circuits (nematode/sea urchins) as further discussed in the next point.</italic> </p><p><italic>A secondary concern focuses on the authors' statement that a &quot;distinct mesendodermal state&quot; is not present in sea urchins (Introduction, first paragraph and Discussion, second paragraph). The sea urchin and sea star GRNs both include a conserved, transient mesendodermal state based on B-catenin dependent expression of wnt8 and Otx (Hinman, Yankura and McCauley 2009). The cited paper (Peter and Davidson, 2010) does state that:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;In a strict sense, early endomesoderm specification therefore involves the concomitant activation of two separate GRNs, rather than the activation of a common endomesoderm GRN which diverges into two daughter programs. The co-expression of regulatory genes to which we refer to as endomesoderm regulatory state is the result of these two GRNs.&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>However, this interpretation is not definitive and a good argument could be made that the endomesodermal state is established prior to the simultaneous activation of the two germ-layer specific programs, as laid out in the cited Hinman paper. The authors should clarify exactly what they think defines a distinct endodermal regulatory state and whether or not their data suggests a tunicate regulatory circuitry that is fundamentally distinct from that observed in sea urchins/sea stars.</italic> </p><p>Although we did not frame the question specifically in these terms, we were indeed trying to compare the architecture of the initial mesendoderm GRN of ascidians to that of different embryos. The specific aim of our study was to identify the mesendoderm lineage specifiers of the ascidian embryo and reveal how they influence the outcome of the second β-catenin driven binary fate decision that segregates the NN and E lineages. We concluded that ascidian mesendoderm bears most similarity to that in the <italic>C.elegans</italic> model and is not based on a mixed-lineage regulatory architecture. To date, to our knowledge, no mesendoderm lineage specifiers (that is individual factors at the top of the genetic hierarchy that are required for initiation of both mesoderm <underline>and</underline> endoderm GRNs) have been identified in other systems, other than the inducers (β-catenin and Nodal) themselves. However, the reviewer is correct to say that the published literature does not exclude the existence such mesendoderm specifiers upstream of both mesoderm and endoderm GRNs in sea urchins and vertebrates. It may simply be that regulative recovery/redundancy, together with extremely complicated early development and GRNs make the discovery of these kinds of factors very difficult. Or it may be that ascidians (and nematodes) do indeed use a fundamentally distinct mode of mesendoderm specification due to the simplification and rapidity of their early development. In the revised version of our manuscript, we attempt to address all of these issues in more detail.</p></body></sub-article></article>
