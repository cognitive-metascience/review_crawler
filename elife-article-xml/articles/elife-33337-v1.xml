The mechanisms coordinating cell cycle with activation, renewal, and differentiation of MuSCs remain poorly understood.

In the absence of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline>, skeletal muscle repair is severely impaired after injury. We show that <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is not expressed in quiescent MuSCs, while being induced in activated and proliferating myoblasts and maintained in differentiating myogenic cells. In agreement, isolated <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient primary myoblasts display differentiation defects and increased proliferation. We further show that the subcellular localization of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is dynamic; while <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is initially localized to the cytoplasm of activated/proliferating myoblasts, progressive nuclear translocation leads to growth arrest during differentiation.

Skeletal muscle has a remarkable capacity to self-repair after severe injuries, a process dependent on muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). MuSCs originate from a PAX3/7+ progenitor cells that in late fetal life acquire their characteristic anatomical position between the basal lamina and the plasma membrane of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mauro, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). MuSCs are indispensable for postnatal muscle growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</xref>), maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</xref>), and regeneration upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>). The majority of juvenile MuSCs acquire a non-proliferative, quiescent state around 3 weeks of post-natal life to ensure cellular/genomic integrity and long-term survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lepper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>). However, once stimulated by homeostatic demand or damage, adult MuSCs exit quiescence, re-enter the cell cycle, and provide differentiated progeny for muscle repair, while a subpopulation self-renews to preserve the quiescent pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). The myogenic regulatory factors including MYOD and MYOGENIN orchestrate MuSCs commitment and progression through the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), while the signals that trigger cell cycle exit and (re-) entry into quiescence remain more elusive.</p><p>Cell cycle is a tightly synchronized process responding to positive and negative signals, while inappropriate growth arrest can result in cancer, malformations during development, and defective stem cell renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherr, 2012</xref>). Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) are negative cell cycle regulators. CDKIs are divided into two structurally and functionally defined families: the INK4 family (including Cdkn2a, Cdkn2b, Cdkn2c, and Cdkn2d) and the Cip/Kip family (including Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, and Cdkn1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borriello et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although members of the Cip/Kip family have been shown to inhibit proliferation and promote differentiation in embryonic muscle or in myoblasts in vitro, their involvement in postnatal MuSC cell cycle regulation is less well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halevy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reynaud et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Messina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>). Given the emerging importance of Cdkn1c in stem cell quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furutachi et al., 2013</xref>), we explored its role in adult myogenesis and MuSC-supported regeneration. Using mouse mutants and ex vivo analysis, we provide evidence that Cdkn1c is involved in the early phase following MuSC activation events, with its genetic ablation leading to impaired muscle regeneration associated with decreased differentiation and increased proliferation. We further show that Cdkn1c is not detected in quiescent MuSCs but is induced upon activation and maintained in differentiating myogenic cells. Finally, we show that Cdkn1c subcellular localization is specifically regulated during adult myogenesis, with a progressive cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation as activated myoblasts proceed to differentiation. Our results suggest that muscle stem cells require Cdkn1c activity for the dynamic control of growth arrest during adult myogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cdkn1c is required for postnatal myogenesis</title><p>Although <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> loss is generally associated with perinatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Susaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mademtzoglou et al., 2017</xref>), a few <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant mice survived in a mixed CD1;B6 background (4.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient mice displayed reduced body weight compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in forelimb grip strength between <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant and control mice at 1 or 2 months of age when the strength was calculated on a per weight basis. Strength was even slightly higher in 3- or 4-month-old <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This difference could be explained by the smaller body weight of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutants, possibly leading to increased relative grip strength (N/kg) in mutants. To evaluate the role of CDKN1c in muscle homeostasis, we examined sections of the hindlimb <italic>Tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) muscles in adult mice. Histological analysis showed that <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> knock-out muscles contained smaller fibers and displayed increased fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>), implying hindered myogenic differentiation. The amount of centrally located nuclei, indicative of ongoing regeneration, was comparable in mutants and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Myofiber culture conditions used allow MuSCs to become activated, start dividing (T24-48), and eventually, proceed to myogenic differentiation or self-renewal of the quiescent pool (T72) (Zammit et al., 2004). The number of PAX7+ MuSC on freshly isolated myofibers of <italic>Extensor digitorum longus </italic>(EDLs) was increased in <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant mice compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Furthermore, PAX7+ MuSCs on <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant myofibers were mostly MYOD-, at a similar percentage to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that Cdkn1c is not regulating MuSCs quiescence. When single myofibers were cultured for 72 hr (T72), <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutants displayed an increased ratio of PAX7+ MYOD- self-renewing cells and a decreased ratio of PAX7-MYOD+ differentiating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that in the absence of CDKN1c the MuSC compartment is correctly established, but a proportion of the MuSC population undergo increased self-renewal at the expense of differentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33337.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cdkn1c</italic> deficiency impairs normal muscle growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) and Sirius red staining of control (Ctrl) and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant (<italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-Mut) mouse <italic>Tibialis anterior </italic>(TA) muscles were performed to examine muscle histology, centrally located nucleated myofibers, and fibrosis.

Once muscle degeneration is induced, MuSCs undergo: (1) activation, (2) proliferation to expand their population, (3) self-renewal of the quiescent pool for future needs, and (4) differentiation for newly generated fibers and muscle repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>).

In contrast, they were not detected in cells from mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>), demonstrating efficient Cre-mediated recombination of the <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> allele in FACS-isolated cells. We then performed primary myoblast cultures from control and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient mice. We monitored proliferating cells under ‘growth’ (high serum) or ‘differentiation’ (low serum) conditions, and at d1 and d3 post-differentiation we stained with early (e.g. MYOGENIN) or late (i.e. Myosin heavy chain, MyHC) differentiation markers, respectively. Consistent with the function of CDKN1cas a cell cycle inhibitor, we observed increased proliferation in primary myoblasts derived from MuSC-specific <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant mice. When cells were maintained in growth conditions for 5 days, we observed 50% and 38% more EdU+ and KI67+ cells, respectively, in the absence of CDKN1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>), suggesting that CDKN1c is involved in restraining cell cycle progression. Slightly more PAX7+ EdU+ cells were observed in the <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient myoblast cultures, while differences in MYOD+ EdU+ or MYOGENIN+ EdU+ populations did now show significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Furthermore, in cultures of FACS-isolated MuSCs from MuSC-specific <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient mice, myogenic differentiation was impaired. One-day post-differentiation, MYOGENIN was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,K,L</xref>). In addition, myotube formation 3 days post-differentiation was severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,M,N</xref>).

In conclusion, both MuSC-specific and global ablation of CDKN1c led to increased primary myoblasts proliferation at the expense of myogenic differentiation.

Thus, there is a mixed population of self-renewing (cells expressing PAX7 alone), activated/proliferating (cells co-expressing PAX7 and MYOD), and differentiating (cells expressing MYOGENIN and/or MYOD) myogenic cells. At this stage, we observed high percentages of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> expression in each of these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Interestingly, as differentiation proceeded (MYOD+ followed by MYOGENIN +at T72), Cdkn1c expression became increasingly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Although Cdkn1c was mostly cytoplasmic in PAX7+/Cdkn1c + T72 myoblasts, Cdkn1c exhibited nuclear presence in around 25% of MYOD+/Cdkn1c+ and 55% of MYOGENIN+/Cdkn1c + T72 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). In line with this, Cdkn1c protein was mainly restricted to cell nuclei at late stages of regeneration following in vivo muscle injury (d13 post-CTX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, similarly to the T24-T48 activated/cycling populations of myoblasts in single myofibers ex vivo, Cdkn1c continued to be present in KI67+ proliferating cells at T72, yet limited to their cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Next, to evaluate whether Cdkn1c nuclear translocation was linked with its association with MYOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynaud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vaccarello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figliola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busanello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battistelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>), we used data generated by a MYOD ChIP sequencing experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2010</xref>) to identify MYOD-binding sites at muscle regulatory regions. We performed ChIP experiments with an anti-Cdkn1c antibody to test whether Cdkn1c shares these binding sites with MYOD, and we found no significant enrichment at any of the tested sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to establish whether the subcellular localization of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> directly affects the cycling status of myoblasts, we generated retroviruses encoding full-length <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (Cdkn1c FL) or <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> lacking the Nuclear localization signal (Cdkn1c –NLS), using Cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) as a reporter to identify transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A mock CFP retrovirus was used as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Overexpression of Cdkn1c FL in single myofiber cultures was associated with nuclear <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and a marked decrease in cycling myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). In contrast, forced expression of the NLS-deficient construct restricted <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and did not induce cell cycle exit as Cdkn1c FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). By contrast, overexpression of either Cdkn1c FL or Cdkn1c –NLS did not alter the proportions of cells entering myogenic differentiation, as evidenced by MYOD and/or MYOGENIN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Lastly, in order to eliminate potential interference with endogenous Cdkn1c<underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in these experiments, we repeated them in <italic>Cdkn1c-</italic>deficient myoblasts following FACS isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Comparably to the ex vivo system of single myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), we observed cell cycle exit, uncoupled from myogenic differentiation, in Cdkn1c FL but not Cdkn1c –NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Together, these results show that nuclear <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> promotes growth arrest, while cytoplasmic localization of the protein - observed at early stages of MuSC activation - is compatible with proliferation. Furthermore, our data suggest uncoupling of cell cycle exit and myogenic differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regenerative adult myogenesis is crucial for recovery from injuries, but can be compromised by degenerative or disease states that affect the functional capacity of skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSC). The maintenance of MuSC function largely depends on the entry and maintenance of a non-cycling, reversible quiescent state. The molecular mechanisms that control MuSC cell cycle transitions and adult myogenesis have gained significant interest in recent years, as a way to understand post-trauma tissue restoration and, subsequently, to design efficient innovative therapies when it is defective.</p><p>Focusing on cell cycle exit signals and given our recent findings on the role of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in cell fate decisions in embryonic/fetal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> may control cell cycle and differentiation of MuSCs in adult muscle. Indeed, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> deficiency compromised muscle regeneration following in vivo injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and hindered primary myoblast differentiation and myotube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> expression correlates with differentiation in many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Westbury et al., 2001</xref>), while in myogenic cultures <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> has also been considered as a differentiation marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reynaud et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mounier et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the consequences of its ablation on adult muscle have not been examined previously, notably because of the perinatal lethality of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant mice. Maintaining the mice in a mixed CD1;B6 background allowed us to obtain some survivors, while analyzing floxed <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mice allowed cell-specific studies. In vivo and in vitro analysis of both models demonstrated that lack of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> compromised myogenic differentiation (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>)</italic>. In the case of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-null mice, there was increased MuSC self-renewal at the expense of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), while conditional deletion of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> in adult mice diminished the MuSC compartment after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These seemingly contradictory results might depend on compensatory mechanisms that are activated when <italic>Cdnk1c</italic> deletion is induced prenatally (mutant) versus postnatally (cKO). Moreover, in our cKO mice, compounding effects of inactivating both <italic>Pax7</italic> (due to CreERT2 insertion in the PAX7 locus) and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> cannot be excluded. However, comparing the <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> cKO mice to the Cre control, showed a much more severe regeneration impairment in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Together, our data on <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant and cKO mice implicate an important function for <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in adult myogenesis, similarly to its emerging importance in the quiescence and renewal of several other stem cell types [Matsumoto et a., 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zacharek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furutachi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Examining the myoblast populations expressing <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> (i.e. quiescent vs. activated), we did not detect <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in quiescent MuSCs on sections or isolated myofibers of resting adult (8–12 weeks) muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> was readily detected in interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our finding is consistent with previous reports of high <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> levels in adult muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuoka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park and Chung, 2001</xref>) and lack of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in FACS-isolated postnatal MuSC populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>) or myofiber-associated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naito et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, an early study detected <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in quiescent MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukada et al., 2007</xref>) which were isolated with a FACS protocol using an antibody previously described by the same group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukada et al., 2004</xref>). However, this antibody immuno-reacts with bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukada et al., 2004</xref>), while <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> has a well-established role and presence in the hematopoietic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> immunostaining in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukada et al.

Combining our observation with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naito et al., 2016</xref>); present study], we conclude that quiescent MuSCs do not express <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline>. Instead, it is established that they express <underline><underline>CDKN1b</underline></underline>, another member of the CDKI family including <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>); our unpublished data].</p><p>Upon MuSC activation and differentiation, we show that <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is strongly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Accordingly, activation of MuSCs during muscle regeneration has been shown to induce <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline>, with its levels peaking at d3-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2003</xref>); our unpublished observations]. The early induction of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> upon activation might be associated with MYOD expression, a transcription factor with which <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> has been implicated in a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynaud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osborn et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, MYOD has been shown to induce <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> both by disrupting a chromatin loop to release the <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> promoter and by upregulating intermediate factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vaccarello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figliola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busanello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battistelli et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we previously identified a muscle-specific <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> regulatory element that MYOD binds and transactivates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>), while co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed direct <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline>-MYOD binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynaud et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, <italic>MyoD</italic> mutant mice present a similar muscle phenotype as our <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>), also consistent with <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> being a direct downstream gene of MYOD, and possible association of MYOD and <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline>. MYOD is expressed within hours after MuSC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) and sustains the transition from quiescence to cell cycle via the replication-related factor CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). MYOD induces growth arrest in non-myogenic cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crescenzi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sorrentino et al., 1990</xref>) and has a well-established role for entry into the myogenic lineage. While the possibility of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> associating with MYOD to regulate <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> translocation was an attractive hypothesis, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> was not found associated with MYOD binding in muscle-specific gene regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2010</xref>) evaluated by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, despite robust expression of MYOD, myoblasts continue to proliferate and do not proceed to differentiation for several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tajbakhsh, 2009</xref>). In fact, in dividing myoblasts MYOD activity is inhibited by Id proteins and CDK/Cyclin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei and Paterson, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, additional factors, including MYOGENIN, were suggested to initiate or enhance transcription of some MYOD targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blais et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate robust <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> presence in activated MuSCs, including expression in proliferating myoblasts in isolated myofiber cultures (e.g. KI67+ cells at T72, cycling cells at T24-T48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These observations might contradict its traditional function as cell cycle exit factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuoka et al., 1995</xref>) and its role in growth arrest during embryonic myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>). Our data, however, suggest that the uncoupling of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> growth arrest activity in proliferating myoblasts of isolated myofiber cultures is related to its subcellular localization. <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is cytoplasmically restricted in activated myoblasts but is progressively detected in the nucleus as differentiation takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, forced <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> expression in myoblasts of isolated myofiber cultures led to nuclear <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> and growth arrest, while overexpression of Nuclear localization signal-deficient <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> was compatible with myoblast proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). On the contrary, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> cyto-nuclear shuttling was not related to myogenic differentiation, suggesting an uncoupling of cell cycle exit and myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), in line with our previous observations in embryonic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zalc et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We have not identified the molecular events underlying the <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, although some observations might explain this pattern. Firstly, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> could be implicated in cell cycle progression through CDK/Cyclin assembly, similarly to its Cip/Kip siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Michieli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harper et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaBaer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peschiaroli et al., 2002</xref>). In the absence of <underline><underline>CDKN1a</underline></underline> and <underline><underline>CDKN1b</underline></underline>, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> is solely responsible for CDK/Cyclin complex stabilization in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerqueira et al., 2014</xref>). However, this might be less likely in myoblasts, where Cdkn1c-MYOD binding engages the <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> helix domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynaud et al., 2000</xref>) that was found indispensable for CDK/Cyclin binding and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reynaud et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, in agreement with <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> function as a cell cycle inhibitor, we observed reduced differentiation and increased proliferation in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E–N</xref>). Secondly, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> could be involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of cyclins or CDKs, as previously observed in other cell types. <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> has been shown to interfere with the nuclear translocation of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou et al., 2011</xref>) and to relocalize a fraction of CDK2 into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figliola and Maione, 2004</xref>). Thirdly, while in the cytoplasm, <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> might participate in MuSC mobilization, one of the earliest manifestations of their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>). Cytoplasmic <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> was described to regulate cell motility together with LIM-kinase1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vlachos and Joseph, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Although we did not detect LIM-kinase1 in myogenic cells, we cannot exclude association with other, yet uncharacterized, partners. Future studies are expected to elucidate the roles of <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> in different sub-cellular compartments of myoblasts.</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> plays essential roles at the initial phase following MuSC activation. We suggest that <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> acts at that early phase, as a) in vivo, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutants display a strong phenotype during the first days after injury and b) <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mutant myoblasts have compromised functions in cultures that last a few days, thus resembling the first events after MuSC activation. <underline><underline>CDKN1c</underline></underline> presence is compatible with activation/proliferation and possibly represents an early activation event. Its loss profoundly affects ex vivo myogenic differentiation and delays in vivo post-injury recovery, which may lead to increased MuSC self-renewal. Therefore, the reduced regeneration capacity of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic>-mutant muscle is not caused by decreased numbers of MuSCs, but results from the reduction of myogenic differentiation, which increases propensity for stem-cell self-renewal. Defective stem cell cycle dynamics and continuous activation/proliferation can lead to DNA damage accumulation, apoptosis, pool exhaustion, and inability to support homeostatic or regenerative demands. A better understanding of cell cycle regulation in MuSCs is imperative to define the molecular events underlying their long-term preservation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Cdkn1c<sup>tm1Sje</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory; <break/>PMID: 9144284</td><td>MGI: J40203, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003336">IMSR_JAX:003336</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>p57<sup>flox</sup></italic></td><td>PMID: 28196404</td><td/><td>Mouse line generated by the <break/>group of F.Relaix and <break/>characterized in <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mademtzoglou et al.

We performed three sets of five consecutive measurements for one set, and mice were allowed to rest for at least 20 min between the sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Sections: Muscles were frozen fresh in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and sectioned at 8 µm. Frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. For hematoxylin-eosin staining, nuclei were stained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 11 min and cytoplasmes were counter-stained with eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 s. The sections were then dehydrated with brief passages through increasing concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, 100%). Sirius red staining (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed for detection of fibrosis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shimizu-Motohashi et al., 2015</xref>). For two-color immunofluorescence, frozen sections were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with M.O.M kit (Vector laboratories) followed by 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature. For three-color immunofluorescence, sections were permeabilized and blocked with 3% BSA, 10% lamb serum, 0.25% TritonX-100/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. In both cases, immunolabeling was performed at 4°C overnight for primary antibodies and at room temperature for 1 hr for secondary antibodies. To outline fibers with Alexa-conjugated anti-laminin, incubation was performed for 3 hr at room temperature, after washing out the secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained blue with DAPI. When mouse-raised antibodies were applied, endogenous mouse IgG was blocked by incubation with goat anti-mouse fab fragment affinity-purified antibody (115-007-003, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min at room temperature.</p><p>Single myofibers: After isolation (T0) or following culture (T24, T48, T72), myofibers were fixed with 37°C-preheated 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed fibers were permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100/PBS for 8 min, blocked with 10% goat serum, 10% swine serum in 0.025% Tween20/PBS for 45 min and incubated with primary antibody (overnight at 4°C) and secondary antibody (1 hr at room temperature). Nuclei were counterstained blue with DAPI.</p><p>Primary myoblast culture: Cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100/PBS for 5 min, blocked with 5% BSA, 10% goat serum and immunolabeled with primary antibody (overnight at 4°C) and secondary antibody (1 hr at room temperature).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

Previous work by the same authors indicated that p57 deletion during embryonic development leads to defects in muscle progenitors' proliferation and differentiation. Similarly, a role for p57 in the proliferation and differentiation of the myogenic C2C12 cell line has been reported.</p><p>Here, the authors report that a very small percentage (4.2%) of germline p57 mice survived to adulthood in a mixed background. The surviving animals displayed reduced body weight, decreased myofiber cross-sectional area and increased fibrosis. A marginal increase (1%) of Pax7+ MuSCs was observed on freshly isolated fibers of p57 knock-out mice. Such small increase in Pax7+ MuSCs persisted 30 days after muscle injury. At this time point, no statistically significant difference was noted in Pax7+/MyoD+ committed muscle progenitors of p57 knock-out versus control. To circumvent the lethality observed in germline p57 knock-out mice, the authors selectively deleted p57 in MuSCs by crossing maternal p57fl(m)/+ with tamoxifen-inducible Pax7-CreERT2 mice. Unfortunately, p57 was not efficiently ablated at high frequency. FACS-isolated p57-deleted MuSCs had increased proliferation and decreased differentiation potentials. Quiescent MuSCS did not express p57 which was detected in activated in MuSCs.</p><p>Subcellular localization of p57 progressively shifted from the cytoplasm during activation to the nucleus upon differentiation. Overexpression of full-length p57, but not of a mutant incapable of nuclear localization, negatively regulates cell proliferation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Beside causing perinatal lethality, germline p57 ablation induces gross developmental defects owing to its role in controlling quiescence of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. Thus, the combination of very few (~4%) p57 knock-out surviving animals and the extensive non-cell specific function of p57 make the results of the presented experiments difficult to interpret.</p><p>2) To circumvent the limitations related to germline deletion, the authors have attempted to specifically delete p57 in MuSCs using the Pax7-CreERT2 driver. This approach has been proven unsuccessful in ablating p57 with high frequency. This is a technical issue that should be rectified. Without deleting p57 in the majority of MuSCs, in vivo experiments aimed at evaluating the role of p57 in homeostatic as well as regenerative conditions are simply not possible and the major tenet of this study, i.e., the function of p57 in adult MuSCs, cannot be conclusively determined.</p><p>3) Because of the low recombination of the p57 allele, in vitro experiments were presumably conducted with rare recombined MuSCs. Were there a selection process, the results may be difficult to interpret.</p><p>4) Based on the results presented in Figure 2, the authors conclude that p57 counteracts self-renewal. It remains unclear whether Pax7+ p57-null MuSCs proliferate or return to quiescence 30 days after injury. For this, it is necessary to evaluate cell proliferation by EdU labeling in vivo at later stages after tissue repair (30 days), as well as to determine cell anatomical position and expression of quiescent genes.</p><p>5) The cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of p57 should be documented upon MuScs in vivo activation. P57 subcellular localization could be determined in activated MuSCs on cultured myofibers with analysis of p57 protein localization upon in vivo activation. Analysis could be done on muscle stem cells at different early time points after tissue injury, either in tissues or on fixed cells after FACS isolation.</p><p>6) The fate of cells in which p57 has been overexpressed should be investigated to determine whether they are differentiating (Myogenin staining). Moreover, p57 overexpression experiments should be conducted in p57-null MuSCs.</p><p>7) No mechanistic insight of how p57 regulate different function in the cytoplasm and the nucleus is offered. P57 has been reported to associate with MyoD. Does nuclear p57 colocalize with MyoD at muscle regulatory regions? Even data that helps to exclude certain mechanisms would be useful in determining the subcellular functional role of p57.</p><p>We are also including the full reviews below in case the additional comments are helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this manuscript report that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 regulates skeletal muscle cell differentiation. Constitutive as well as conditional p57 knock-outs display increased proliferating muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and decreased differentiating muscle cells following muscle injury and regeneration. P57 was not expressed in quiescent MuSCs and activated in MuSCs entering the cell cycle. During cell differentiation p57 relocated from the cytoplasmic compartment to the nucleus where it is required to induce growth arrest.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well conducted and the conclusions supported by the results.</p><p>While p57 has not been previously ablated in adult muscle cells, there have been several independent reports indicating that p57 either along with p21 or on its own regulates skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhang et al., 1999; Naito et al., 2016).</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>; p57+/-; <italic>ROSA<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice should be challenged with muscle injury and MuSC-mediated repair investigated.</p><p>2) The nuclear role of p57 in promoting growth arrest should be experimentally addressed.</p><p>P57 has been reported to associate with MyoD (Reynaud et al., 1999). The authors could evaluate whether p57 is recruited on selected MyoD targets in differentiating myocytes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript entitled 'Cellular localization of the cell cycle inhibitor p57kip2 controls proliferation and growth arrest of adult skeletal muscle stem cells' the authors are investigating the role of the cell cycle inhibitor p57kip2 during adult skeletal myogenesis for the first time. p57kip2 has been previously studied as a regulator of stem cell quiescence in other stem cell system such as HSC and neural stem cells (Matsumoto et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011;Furutachi et al., 2013). Previous work in myogenesis has shown that p57kip2 inhibits proliferation and controls muscle differentiation in embryonic muscle or in myoblasts cell line (C2C12) in vitro.</p><p>The manuscript by Mademtzoglou et al., attempts to demonstrate for the first time a role for p57kip2 during proliferation and differentiation of adult skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSC). In particular, the authors showed that p57kip2 protein is not expressed in quiescent muscle SCs, but its expression is increased upon MuSC activation and retained during differentiation. By using genetic mouse model and ex vivo experiments they showed that p57kip2 is required for proper myogenic lineage progression. Genetic ablation of p57kip2 lead to increased proliferation and self-renew, but muscle differentiation is impaired. Interestingly, they showed that p57kip2 subcellular localization is progressively shifting from cytoplasm during activation to nuclear translocation upon differentiation.</p><p>There are two main issues with this manuscript:</p><p>1A) The authors revealed a role for p57kip2 during post-natal muscle growth and adult skeletal muscle regeneration relying on the germline p57kip2 mutant mice. However, compensatory upregulation of other cell cycle inhibitors from the Cip/Kip family (p18, p27), as shown previously in HSC (Zou et al., 2011), may diminish the effect of p57 in MuSC. An inducible knockout may give a more profound phenotype than that observed in straight KO mice, as suggested from severe MuSC differentiation defect derived from <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>;p57<sup>flox</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3J-L) compared to more modest reduced differentiation from p57 mutant myoblasts, shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C. In addition, any proliferative phenotype during embryogenesis may negatively impact the adult SC in a regenerative context.</p><p>1B) In an attempt to use inducible mutant mice, the authors make a cursory comment that they were not able to achieve high efficiency recombination. This is a technical problem that should be rectified. The analysis of myogenic cell fate should include staining for Pax7, Ki67 and MyoD, at different time points after regeneration (d4, d7 and d30). These additional immunostains would further strengthen the conclusion that loss of p57 results in expansion of progenitors and increased self-renew at expense of differentiation.</p><p>1C) in vitro experiments were performed with rare recombined cells, this may be problematic if there is a selection process. Due to these potential artefacts, it is important the authors perform the above experiment.</p><p>2A) Despite their attempt to demonstrate that subcellular localization of p57kip2 directly affects the cycling status of myoblasts, they did not fully characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying p57kip2's cytoplasm-nuclear shuttling.</p><p>In particular, the authors failed to 1) Demonstrate the cellular phenotype of p57kip2 localization specifically in Pax7+ MuSCs and their progeny; 2) Fully understand the mechanism behind p57kip2 cytoplasm-nuclear shuttling and cell cycle/myogenic state.</p><p>2B) The authors generated retroviruses encoding the full length p57 (p57FL) or p57 lacking the nuclear localization signal (p57NLS). They showed that overexpression of p57-FL correlates with nuclear localization of the p57 protein and growth arrest based on the absence of Ki67 staining. NO phenotype with P57 lacking NLS. The authors should assess what is the fate of the arrested cells by immunostaining. Are they differentiating (Myogenin)?</p><p>In this experimental design, the authors exploit an overexpression system. The authors should perform retrovirus studies in the null background. Finally, can the authors use P57NLS to drive nuclear expression only?</p><p>2C) The manuscript lacks mechanistic detail of how P57 functions in a spatially- dependent manner. The authors speculate in the discussion to four potential mechanisms. It is important that some attempt is made to provide the readers with some mechanistic insight-even data that helps to exclude certain mechanisms that may be more tractable, would support the functional role of P57 localization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The present work by Mademtzoglou et al. investigates the role of the cell cycle inhibitor p57 on muscle stem cell function. The authors have previously reported that p57 deletion during embryonic development leads to defects in muscle progenitors' cell fate decisions. Here they extend these findings to adult muscle stem cells by showing that in a mixed background a small percentage of p57 knockout mice survived to adulthood and exhibited reduced body weight and myofiber cross-sectional area and increased fibrosis. These mice also exhibited a slight increase in muscle stem cell number, which on myofibers ex vivo or 30 days after tissue injury in vivo are more biased towards self-renewal at the expenses of myogenic commitment. They complement these studies by conditionally inducing p57 deletion in adult muscle stem cells, and upon isolation and culture they observed consistent results. They report that p57 is initially localized in the cytoplasm during early activation of muscle stem cells, and its progressive nuclear localization correlates with growth arrest and myogenic differentiation. Finally, overexpression of a full length, but not a mutant p57 lacking its nuclear localization signal, has a negative effect on myoblast proliferation. They conclude that p57 does not regulate muscle stem cell quiescence but rather their self-renewal vs. commitment cell fate choices.</p><p>Overall, the findings in this well written manuscript are interesting and novel, particularly the subcellular localization of p57 in muscle stem cells, although they could be strengthened by increasing the depth of the mechanism underlying the regulation of this process. Also, additional experiments are required in order to fully support the authors' interpretation.</p><p>1) Increased self-renewal or failure to reentry into quiescence: In Figure 2 the authors show that p57 knockout mice exhibit a mild increase in the number of muscle stem cells 30 days after injury, but no effect on MyoD expression. The authors conclude that p57 counteracts self-renewal. Are these cells proliferating or they efficiently went back to quiescence? Considering this gene has been previously implicated in stem cell quiescence, it might play a role here in promoting the reentry to this state after tissue repair, even if it is not required for the developmental entry in quiescence. The authors should control for proliferation by EdU labeling in vivo at later stage after tissue repair (30 days), as well as their anatomical location and expression of quiescent genes. In addition, analysis of muscle stem cells should be performed not only at 30 days but also at earlier stages after tissue injury, by immunostaining for Pax7, MyoD and EdU in vivo, in order to evaluate the dynamics of activation and commitment in the native tissue. This would strengthen the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>2) Efficiency of p57 floxing in muscle stem cells: The efficiency of the floxing in Figure 3 should be indicated, in order to evaluate whether the FACS isolation of labeled cells yields sufficient numbers to be representative of the stem cell pool, or a very low percentage that may hold an intrinsic bias in population heterogeneity. This should be discussed in the text.</p><p>3) Validating p57 expression dynamics upon in vivo activation: Data could be strengthened by reinforcing the observation of p57 subcellular localization in activated muscle stem cells on cultured myofibers, with analysis of p57 protein localization upon in vivo activation, i.e. analysis could be done on muscle stem cells at different early time points after tissue injury, either in tissues or immediately fixed after FACS isolation.</p><p>4) Effect of p57 loss on myogenic commitment: In Figure 5 the authors show that overexpression of a full length, but not a mutant p57 lacking its nuclear localization signal, has a negative effect on myoblast proliferation. It would be interesting to test whether there is a similar effect also on myogenic commitment.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cellular localization of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1c controls growth arrest of adult skeletal muscle stem cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is important to quantify MuSCs number using a different antibody (syn-4, or m-cadherin). The answer to this question would help to determine the severity of the Pax7 haplo-insufficiency phenotype. In addition, the images representing the figure need to be accompanied by quantification, for instance, the number and size of regenerating fibers across the 3 groups.</p><p>4) New Figure 4. The observed reduced number of Pax7+ cells should also be discussed in more detail, as in most of the other assays the authors show that deletion of Cdkn1c leads to increased self-renewal and impaired myogenic differentiation. It would be useful if the authors could comment on this phenotypic difference in the different conditions. A more thorough analysis of the in vivo phenotype may resolve these contradictions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33337.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Beside causing perinatal lethality, germline p57 ablation induces gross developmental defects owing to its role in controlling quiescence of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. Thus, the combination of very few (~4%) p57 knock-out surviving animals and the extensive non-cell specific function of p57 make the results of the presented experiments difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we added data on satellite-cell-specific p57 deletion in adult MuSCs, using the tamoxifen-inducible Pax7-CreERT2 recombinase. These data are presented in (new) Figure 4. Inclusion of this figure changed the numbering of subsequent figures and figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To circumvent the limitations related to germline deletion, the authors have attempted to specifically delete p57 in MuSCs using the Pax7-CreERT2 driver. This approach has been proven unsuccessful in ablating p57 with high frequency. This is a technical issue that should be rectified. Without deleting p57 in the majority of MuSCs, in vivo experiments aimed at evaluating the role of p57 in homeostatic as well as regenerative conditions are simply not possible and the major tenet of this study, i.e., the function of p57 in adult MuSCs, cannot be conclusively determined.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to provide more conclusive evidence of p57 function in adult MuSCs, we treated <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>; p57<sup>flox</sup></italic> animals with tamoxifen diet for a total of five weeks. This approach allowed the ablation of p57 in adult muscle satellite cells and their post-regeneration progeny, in contrast to our previous approaches of 3-5 i.p. tamoxifen injections or 1-2 weeks of tamoxifen diet. Ablation of p57 in MuSC led to impaired muscle repair after injury. We also provide relevant controls. The new data are included in new Figure 4.</p><p><italic>3) Because of the low recombination of the p57 allele,</italic> in vitro <italic>experiments were presumably conducted with rare recombined MuSCs. Were there a selection process, the results may be difficult to interpret.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers remark and in the revised manuscript, we strengthened these in vitroresults by in vivoanalysis of MuSC-specific <italic>p57</italic> ablation (in <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup>; p57<sup>flox</sup></italic> animals) during muscle repair (Figure 4). Under these conditions, recombined and non-recombined cells were equally challenged by cardiotoxin-induced muscle degeneration and regeneration and showed a severely compromised potential to reconstitute normal muscle tissue.</p><p>Of note, we conducted all in vitroexperiments with freshly isolated 70-80% (recombined) MuSCs, avoiding passages that potentially increase the presumed selection process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Based on the results presented in Figure 2, the authors conclude that p57 counteracts self-renewal. It remains unclear whether Pax7+ p57-null MuSCs proliferate or return to quiescence 30 days after injury. For this, it is necessary to evaluate cell proliferation by EdU labeling in vivo at later stages after tissue repair (30 days), as well as to determine cell anatomical position and expression of quiescent genes.</p></disp-quote><p>In our new data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, PAX7+ <italic>p57</italic>-null MuSCs located underneath the LAMININ+ basal lamina returned to quiescent state 30 days after injury confirmed by EdU staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of p57 should be documented upon MuScs in vivo activation. P57 subcellular localization could be determined in activated MuSCs on cultured myofibers with analysis of p57 protein localization upon in vivo activation. Analysis could be done on muscle stem cells at different early time points after tissue injury, either in tissues or on fixed cells after FACS isolation.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed muscle injury and monitored p57 subcellular presence at early and late time points following regeneration in muscle sections. We observed cytoplasmic p57 at D3 post-injury, while later on p57 was present in the central nuclei of the newly-formed, regenerated myofibers. We present data on D3 and D13 postinjury in updated Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The fate of cells in which p57 has been overexpressed should be investigated to determine whether they are differentiating (Myogenin staining). Moreover, p57 overexpression experiments should be conducted in p57-null MuSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we analyzed the effects of p57 overexpression on differentiation, by quantifying the Myogenin+ cells at early and late time points of Myogenin expression in single myofiber culture. Due to the lack of significant difference, we further investigated whether p57 overexpression acts earlier during myogenic differentiation, by analyzing the MyoD+ cells after 72h of single myofiber culture. At that time point, MyoD labels not only activated myoblasts but also those that will proceed to differentiation. Furthermore, we performed overexpression experiments in p57-deficient MuSCs after FACS isolation as requested. These data are now shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) No mechanistic insight of how p57 regulate different function in the cytoplasm and the nucleus is offered. P57 has been reported to associate with MyoD. Does nuclear p57 colocalize with MyoD at muscle regulatory regions? Even data that helps to exclude certain mechanisms would be useful in determining the subcellular functional role of p57.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of p57 action, we used data generated by a MyoD ChIP sequencing experiment (Cao et al., 2010) to identify MyoD binding sites at muscle regulatory regions. We then performed ChIP experiments with an anti-p57 antibody to test whether p57 shares these binding sites with MyoD. The results are shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cao Y, Yao Z, Sarkar D, Lawrence M, Sanchez GJ, Parker MH, MacQuarrie KL, Davison J, Morgan MT, Ruzzo WL, Gentleman RC, Tapscott SJ.
