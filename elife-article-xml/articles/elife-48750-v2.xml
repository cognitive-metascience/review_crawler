diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Prominent uses include as intracellular antibodies or intrabodies to bind and deliver cargo to specific proteins and/or subcellular sites within cells, and as nanoscale immunolabels for enhanced tissue penetration and improved spatial imaging resolution. Here, we report the generation and validation of nAbs against a set of proteins prominently expressed at specific subcellular sites in mammalian brain neurons. We describe a novel hierarchical validation pipeline to systematically evaluate nAbs isolated by phage display for effective and specific use as intrabodies and immunolabels in mammalian cells including brain neurons. These nAbs form part of a robust toolbox for targeting proteins with distinct and highly spatially-restricted subcellular localization in mammalian brain neurons, allowing for visualization and/or modulation of structure and function at those sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>llama</kwd><kwd>intrabody</kwd><kwd>immunolabel</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS099714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24NS109113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nanobodies are developed that target neuronal proteins with restricted subcellular distributions and used as intrabodies to deliver cargo to specific sites within neurons and nanoscale immunolabels for improved imaging resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nanobodies (nAbs) are the recombinant minimal antigen binding fragments derived from the atypical monomeric immunoglobulins present in camelid mammals and cartilaginous fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desmyter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Könning et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). They have broad utility as biomedical research reagents, diagnostics and therapeutics. nAbs are ideally suited for use as intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lafaye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beghein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van Audenhove and Gettemans, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>), as they fold efficiently and remain stable under a wide range of conditions, including the reducing cytoplasmic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gahrtz and Conrad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böldicke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goenaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to their potential utility as intrabodies, nAbs also have advantages as immunolabeling reagents, as their small size (≈1/10 of conventional IgG antibodies) improves penetration of the cell or tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perruchini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, nAbs improve imaging resolution by reducing the distance between the immunolabeling signal and the target protein from the 10–20 nm obtained with conventional primary and secondary antibodies down to 2–4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>). Their ability to precisely target specific proteins in living cells, and/or label them in <italic>post vivo</italic> samples with a high degree of efficacy and spatial resolution make nAbs attractive for numerous biomedical research applications, including in neuroscience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Südhof, 2018</xref>).

Integral to the functional complexity of neurons is the diversity of proteins they express (estimated to encompass the products of two-thirds of the genome), a complexity markedly enhanced by compartmentalization of specific proteins at highly restricted sites within the neuron’s complex structure. This includes not only the basic polarized compartments (dendrite, cell body, axon), but also distinct subcompartments within these domains (<italic>e.g.</italic>, dendritic spines, the axon initial segment [AIS], nodes of Ranvier, presynaptic terminals, etc.). Each of these sites is responsible for distinct events in neuronal signaling and function, creating opportunities for specific delivery of reporters and actuators to these sites with high subcellular resolution to report on or influence, respectively, specific aspects of neuronal function.</p><p>Here, we describe the development and characterization of recombinant nAbs with specificity for a set of neuronal proteins with restricted expression in subcellular compartments associated with discrete signaling events crucial to mammalian brain neuron function and plasticity. These targets are the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins Homer1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandstätter et al., 2004</xref>), IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soltau et al., 2002</xref>), and SAPAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takeuchi et al., 1997</xref>) that are present at partially overlapping sets of excitatory synapses, Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kneussel et al., 2001</xref>) found postsynaptically at most inhibitory synapses, and the Kv2 channel auxiliary subunit AMIGO-1 (36) found in large clusters at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions present on the soma, proximal dendrites and AIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of nAbs against brain target proteins and their isolation by panning phage display libraries prepared from an immunized llama</title><p>Neuronal proteins with a restricted localization in specific subcellular compartments were targeted for nAb development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Recombinant protein fragments were produced and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and combined in a cocktail to immunize a single llama (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Antiserum was collected at intervals and assayed for immunoreactivity against the separate recombinant protein fragments by ELISA. We also purified IgG fractions corresponding to the conventional heavy and light chain subclass versus the heavy chain-only subclasses and assayed them for immunoreactivity against the individual target proteins by ELISA. Once a sufficient titer was achieved, we obtained whole blood and isolated the leukocytes to use as source of total RNA that served as a template for RT-PCR to specifically amplify cDNAs corresponding to the IgG heavy-chain variable fragments. These cDNAs were ligated into the pComb3XSS phagemid which allows for expression of the cDNA-encoded nAbs as PIII protein fusions on the pili of phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We subjected this phage display library (complexity ≈ 8 × 10<sup>7</sup>) to panning against the individual purified recombinant target proteins immobilized in wells of a microtiter plate.

We also used ‘sandwich’ panning, in which wells of a microtiter plate were coated with pooled IgG fractions purified from the immunized llama to capture and display the individual recombinant target protein fragments. The bound and eluted phage from sandwich panning were subjected to two more rounds of sandwich panning. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> contains a summary of the outcome of the phage display.</p><p>Isolated phage were used to infect fresh cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria ER2738 which were plated onto bacterial culture plates, from which single colonies were isolated and grown in liquid culture to express and secrete soluble nAbs.

This also involved the removal of the N-terminal bacterial leader sequence, addition of a start codon and removal of the sequences encoding the C-terminal PIII protein. The linker region containing 6XHis and HA tags between the nAb and C-terminal GFP was retained. After sequence verification, each of the 113 nAb mammalian expression plasmids was tested for nAb expression and intrabody function in mammalian cells by transient transfection into COS-1 cells. This assay entailed expression of each nAb and target protein either alone or together in separate wells of a 96 well microtiter plate. After two days of expression, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and subjected to IF-ICC performed with validated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against each target protein and analyses of the expression and subcellular localization of the nAb and target protein. Of note, COS-1 cells do not express detectable levels of any of these target proteins.</p><p>We found that the vast majority of COS-1 cells expressing EGFP- or EYFP-tagged nAb alone had substantial fluorescence signal in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Substantial nuclear localization was also observed for these fluorescent proteins alone, as expected from prior studies showing nuclear localization of GFP [<italic>e.g.</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seibel et al., 2007</xref>)]. In contrast, when the target proteins, such as Homer1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were exogenously expressed in COS-1 cells, they were predominantly found in the cytoplasm, with the exception of the type I transmembrane protein AMIGO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuja-Panula et al., 2003</xref>), which primarily accumulates in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2018</xref>). We next evaluated whether target protein coexpression led to a change in nAb subcellular localization, which we interpreted as being due to nAb binding to the cytoplasmic- or ER-localized target protein. We visually determined whether coexpression of the predominantly nuclear nAb with the cytoplasmic/ER target protein would alter the nuclear localization of the nAb such that it colocalized with the target protein, as an indication that the nAb functioned as a target-binding intrabody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a representative example of an anti-Homer1 nAb that was scored as a positive in this assay. While there was some variability in the extent of the target-protein-dependent impact on nAb localization between different cells in the population, and between different nAbs, likely reflecting cell-specific differences in the relative expression levels of nAb and target protein, the target protein-dependent altered distribution of nAbs provided a facile assay that allowed us to test every ELISA-positive nAb for whether they functioned as intrabodies in mammalian cells. A summary of the results of these intrabody screening assays on heterologous COS-1 cells is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A subset of the nAbs that function as intrabodies in heterologous cells recognize endogenously expressed target proteins in cultured rat and mouse hippocampal neurons</title><p>These experiments in heterologous cells yielded a subset of nAbs that exhibited altered localization in the presence of target proteins when expressed in mammalian cells, indicating that they functioned as intrabodies. We next tested whether these nAbs could recognize endogenous target proteins when expressed in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (CHNs). Each of the GFP-or YFP-tagged nAbs that were scored as positive as intrabodies in heterologous cells was subsequently transfected into CHNs at 7–10 DIV. At 48 hr post-transfection, the neurons were fixed and subjected to IF-ICC with target-specific mAbs, or with markers for specific subcellular compartments. We evaluated colocalization between the GFP- or YFP-tagged nAbs and target protein immunolabeling, relative to CHNs expressing GFP or YFP alone. For each target, we identified nAbs that colocalized with the endogenously expressed target protein (results summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Examples of CHNs expressing nAbs for each target with the corresponding target-specific immunolabeling are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for the excitatory synaptic proteins Homer1, IRSp53 and SAPAP2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for Gephyrin and AMIGO-1. Analysis by Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient (PCC) demonstrated that the nAb-GFP intrabodies were colocalized with the corresponding endogenous target protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Importantly, the expression and subcellular localization of the endogenous target proteins were not altered by nAb expression, as quantified by a lack of significant change in target protein puncta size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). For nAbs targeting the excitatory postsynaptic target proteins Homer1, IRSp53 and SAPAP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), the punctate pattern of nAb localization in dendrites was closely associated with immunolabeling for PSD95, a marker of the excitatory postsynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), supporting that the nAb puncta were at excitatory synapses. Moreover, expression of the nAbs against target proteins at excitatory synapses did not impact the sizes of PSD-95 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, anti-Gephyrin nAbs had a subcellular localization that not only colocalized with endogenous Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) but were also frequently found opposed to immunolabeling for the synaptic vesicle protein Synapsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), supporting the observation that these nAbs were localized at synapses. The sizes of the puncta of Gephyrin and Synapsin immunolabeling were not impacted by expression of anti-Gephyrin nAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). In the case of AMIGO-1, we identified nAbs that colocalized with endogenous AMIGO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is present in large clusters at ER-PM junctions on the soma and proximal dendrites of CHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the AMIGO-1 nAb colocalized with labeling for Kv2.1, a partner subunit of AMIGO-1 in Kv2 channel complexes found at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The sizes of AMIGO-1 and Kv2.1 puncta were not impacted by expression of anti-AMIGO-1 nAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). These results indicate that these nAbs act as intrabodies that recognize their endogenous target proteins in CHNs, and the expression of the nAbs has little discernible impact on the expression and subcellular localization of their endogenous targets.</p><p>A subset of the anti-Homer1 nAbs were expressed in mouse CHNs over a longer time period from recombinant lentivirus under the control of the neuron-enriched Synapsin promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At 10 days post-infection CHNs were subjected to IF-ICC with an anti-Homer1 mAb and an antibody against the dendritic marker MAP2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, in spite of such long-term expression of the cytoplasmically synthesized nAbs, nAbs such as HC20 exhibited little cytoplasmic accumulation of the nAb-YFP fluorescence (green) within the cell body (asterisk in the merged panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, there was robust nAb-YFP fluorescence throughout the MAP2-positive (blue) dendrites of the expressing neuron, where it was present in puncta that precisely overlapped with punctate anti-Homer1 immunolabeling (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). An analysis of the localization of a number of anti-Homer1 nAb-YFP fusions after such long-term expression revealed that a subset of the nAb-YFP fusions (green), such as HC20 and HC87, exhibited precise colocalization with Homer1 immunolabeling (red), with little or no detectable signal in dendritic shafts, consistent with their binding to and accumulation at Homer1 clustered in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). However, other nAbs yielded more diffuse localization throughout the dendritic shafts, similar to that obtained with YFP alone, although most of these nAbs also exhibited a significantly higher degree of colocalization with Homer1 than YFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In spite of these differences in binding, in no case did long-term expression of the anti-Homer1 nAbs lead to significant changes in the overall sizes or density of Homer1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), showing that the long-term expression of these nAbs and their binding to synaptic Homer1 did not detectably impact Homer1 expression and localization.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48750.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anti-Homer nAbs expressed as intrabodies from recombinant lentivirus target to dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the lentivirus targeting construct.

We next determined whether the discrete target protein-containing puncta labeled by GFP-tagged nAbs expressed as intrabodies in CHNs label stable structures or target protein containing transport vesicles (or other mobile structures). We performed short term time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of live nAb-expressing CHNs. Over the course of one-minute recordings collected at 1 Hz, we observed that the nAb-GFP puncta (which we observed colocalized with the target proteins in the experiments mentioned in the previous section) were marking stable structures present in the TIRF field, such that overlaid time-lapse images of nAb-GFP localization yielded tightly colocalized structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, a systematic evaluation of the utility of nAbs for immunolabeling endogenous target proteins in brain neurons has not been reported. Here, we took an unbiased approach by testing all of the ELISA-positive nAbs for immunolabeling of conventional formaldehyde fixed transfected heterologous cells and brain sections. We first transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> with each of the ELISA-positive nAb phagemids, and after induction of nAb expression and overnight culture, collected the bacterial cell culture media as bacterial culture supernatants (BC supes) containing secreted nAbs. We first tested these nAb-containing BC supes in IF-ICC against fixed COS-1 cells transiently transfected to heterologously express their cognate brain target protein in a subset of cells, an assay we routinely use for screening mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). This assay allows for a facile determination of which candidate antibodies detect the target protein after fixation by providing a mosaic of numerous target-expressing and non-expressing cells in the same field. Here, we double-immunolabeled cells with candidate nAb BC supes and previously validated mouse mAbs against the same target protein to distinguish expressing versus non-expressing cells. We found that a substantial subset (33/39) of the ELISA-positive anti-Homer1 nAb BC supes tested exhibited robust immunolabeling of fixed and permeabilized COS-1 cells expressing Homer1L. Examples of positive immunolabeling with anti-Homer1 nAb BC supes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>, which shows robust nAb labeling (green) that colocalizes with Homer1 mAb labeling (red). In contrast, none of the unique ELISA-positive nAb BC supes against the other targets yielded detectable immunoreactivity in this assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We next determined whether the anti-Homer1 nAbs exhibiting positive immunolabeling of Homer1L exogenously expressed in COS-1 cells would label endogenous Homer1 in brain sections. We evaluated each of the BC supes for labeling in sections prepared from perfusion-fixed adult rat brains. We found that a large proportion (25/33) of the BC supes tested yielded robust immunolabeling of brain sections, with the remainder exhibiting no detectable immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Each of the 25 brain IHC-positive nAbs was also scored as positive in the heterologous COS-1 cell IF-ICC assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for nAb HS15, the positive anti-Homer1 nAbs exhibited substantial immunolabeling of neuropil in caudate putamen (CPU), cerebral cortex (CTX) and hippocampus (HC). In hippocampus, immunolabeling for the positive anti-Homer1 nAbs (note that the HS12 nAb was scored as negative in this application) was especially prominent in subiculum and CA1 stratum oriens and radiatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The pattern of immunolabeling obtained with the anti-Homer1 nAbs matched closely that obtained with validated anti-Homer1 mouse mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). While Homer1 labeling in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was consistently high for all nAbs that were scored as exhibiting positive immunolabeling, different nAbs exhibited variation in signal intensity in the CA2-CA3 regions and dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

These include the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins Homer1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandstätter et al., 2004</xref>), IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soltau et al., 2002</xref>), and SAPAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takeuchi et al., 1997</xref>), present at partially overlapping sets of excitatory synapses, Gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kneussel et al., 2001</xref>), found at most inhibitory synapses, and the Kv2 channel auxiliary subunit AMIGO-1, found at ER-PM junctions on the soma, proximal dendrites and AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bishop et al., 2018</xref>). We validated these nAbs for use as intrabodies in living neurons, and a subset as immunolabels in ICC, IHC, and IB applications. Since their initial discovery, nAbs have been employed in diverse applications in biomedical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muyldermans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desmyter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Könning et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Meyer et al., 2014</xref>) and have shown promise as human therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Könning et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steeland et al., 2016</xref>). However, few nAbs have been developed against neuronal proteins for use in neuroscience research applications. We report the feasibility of generating nAbs against a diverse set of neuronal target proteins with restricted subcellular distribution at sites mediating crucial neuronal signaling events and their validation in brain neurons as intrabodies and immunolabels, representing a valuable toolbox for neuroscience research applications that will be made publicly available in plasmid form.</p><p>Our approach relied on isolating nAbs from a library derived from immunized llamas. Numerous other studies demonstrated the feasibility of isolating nAbs from synthetic libraries, or libraries derived from nonimmunized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Kruif et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2005</xref>). However, these approaches often yield low affinity binders that need to be matured by molecular evolution in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gustchina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gram et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jackson et al., 1995</xref>), which is a time and labor-consuming process. Therefore, we elected to use immunizations to increase the representation of high affinity binders in the llama used as the source of our nAb cDNA library. One advantage of using large animals, like llamas, is that each animal can be simultaneously immunized with multiple targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). This reduces the number of animals used and has the advantage that obtaining leukocytes for cDNA library generation does not require that the animal is sacrificed.</p><p>Our overall strategy generated at least one nAb that functioned as an intrabody in neurons for each of the five targeted brain proteins. These nAbs have potential use in a variety of research applications in living neurons, including visualizing endogenous target protein localization and dynamics, or modifying expression or function of the target protein. Moreover, they can be used to deliver cargo to specific sites, for example genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> or membrane potential indicators to report on signaling events occurring in the specific subcellular compartments in which the target proteins are selectively localized. In addition, they could be used to target actuators to specific sites to locally modify membrane potential, enzymatic activity, or specific cell signaling events. The nAb intrabodies that we developed provide an array of specificities to target discrete neuronal compartments (excitatory and inhibitory synapses, ER-PM junctions) that play crucial and distinct roles in neuronal function, and importantly, do so without detectably altering the expression and localization of their target proteins. That the nAbs we evaluated by live cell imaging label stable structures within cultured rat hippocampal neurons suggests that the nAbs are primarily binding their targets at final subcellular location, as opposed to binding to the proteins while in transit to these sites, or otherwise targeting mobile structures. This may contribute to the lack of a detectable effect of nAb expression on target protein expression and localization.</p><p>In addition to developing nAbs as intrabodies for use in live cells, we also validated a subset of anti-Homer1 nAbs for use as immunolabels that recognize Homer1 in aldehyde-fixed samples of brain neurons. These nAbs exhibit the enhanced resolution in super-resolution light microscopy predicted for such nanoscale labeling reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beghein and Gettemans, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Szymborska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pleiner et al., 2018</xref>). It is surprising to us that among the five proteins targeted in the nAb development efforts described here, only the Homer1 nAb project yielded large pools of nAbs positive for immunolabeling transfected heterologous cells and brain sections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), given that we had previously performed mouse mAb projects against each of these targets, using the same recombinant proteins as immunogens and in screening, and for each obtained a substantial number of mAbs positive for these applications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We do not know the basis of this distinction between the Homer1 nAb project relative to the other nAb projects, and the overall differences between the corresponding llama nAb and mouse mAb projects. However, a retrospective analysis of the antiserum from the immunized llama by IF-ICC against transfected COS-1 cells expressing the individual target proteins yielded substantial immunolabeling only for cells expressing Homer1 (not shown), suggesting a fundamental lack of an immune response against epitopes preserved in aldehyde-fixed samples, and not a failure of phage display selection to capture immunolabeling-competent nAbs. A similar scenario held for epitopes present on SDS-denatured target proteins detected on immunoblots blots, with the Homer1 nAb project yielding substantial numbers of positive nAbs, the Gephyrin project two, and the other projects none (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), again in contrast to the corresponding mouse mAb projects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It has been suggested that nAbs preferentially bind to target proteins via a convex paratope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wurch et al., 2012</xref>), which could contribute to the inability of the nAbs against the targets with the exception of Homer1 to detect aldehyde-fixed and/or denatured target proteins. While nAbs have widespread use in binding to native protein, which enhances their utility as chaperones for crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>), certain nAbs generated against GFP and other proteins have been used as immunolabels for immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamagata and Sanes, 2018</xref>) and immunoblots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruce and McNaughton, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have generated a series of validated nAbs against neuronal proteins selectively expressed in specific subcellular compartments in brain neurons. These nAbs represent a valuable toolbox of reagents available to the neuroscience community for diverse applications. The pipeline we employed is an exemplar that can be used in developing nAbs against other neuronal targets to enhance the spectrum of experimental approaches available to researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>)</td><td>COS-1</td><td>ATCC Cat # CRL-1650, Lot # 59102713; PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6260373">6260373</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0223">CVCL_0223</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>numerous</td><td/><td/><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pComb3XSS</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10986398">10986398</ext-link></td><td>Addgene #63890 (Addgene RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002037">SCR_002037</ext-link>)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Photoshop</td><td>Adobe Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014199">SCR_014199</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Axiovision</td><td>Carl Zeiss MicroImaging</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002677">SCR_002677</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743772">22743772</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures involving llamas were performed at Triple J Farms of Kent Laboratories (Bellingham, WA) in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH.

Several aspects are worth noting including the use of animal immunization rather than a synthetic approach. One of the intrabodies is validated for use in super-resolution microscopy. Ultimately, these will be valuable reagents for the community. There may be a general commitment toward further reagent generation in the future. In general, as a community resource, it seems to me that the paper succeeds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this Tools and Resources paper, Trimmer and colleagues describe generation of nanobodies to 5 neuronal proteins, and their use for immunolabeling neurons. In brief, they generated and pooled recombinant fragments of the 5 proteins, immunized a llama with the pool, generated a library from lymphocyte RNA, isolated antibodies by phage display, transferred the cDNAs to mammalian expression vectors containing a GFP tag, and screened them by expression in heterologous cells. They then introduced a subset of them into neurons by electroporation or lentiviral infection, and used them as &quot;intrabodies&quot; to localize endogenous proteins at short and long intervals. Finally, they showed that a subset of the nanobodies could be used to label antigen in brain sections and on immunoblots.</p><p>The manuscript is clear, complete and very-well illustrated.

Here we developed a large collection of nanobodies against five targets and evaluated them for both uses.</p><p>2) To date, a very small number of intrabodies of any kind have been developed against neuronal targets for neuroscience research, most prominently the two monobodies/FingRs (against PSD-95 and Gephyrin) developed in Don Arnold’s lab and published in Neuron, and that have gained widespread use, showing the overall need for such reagents.</p><p>3) While the development and screening pipeline we used, like all pipelines, employed individual components similar to those used in published work, this is the first time anyone has used them in this novel combination to screen a large set of nanobodies or other small format single chain binders against endogenous targets for those that work as both intrabodies and immunolabels, and that can be used in brain samples.</p><p>4) The value of these nanobodies is evident by the number of requests we have received for these reagents due to the bioRXIV posting that was suggested by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>5) The value of this resource is further underscored in that our work was selected by Walter Koroshetz, Director of NINDS, to be presented in a mini-symposium at the 2019 SFN meeting whose focus is to highlight important research resources generated under the BRAIN Initiative. It will also be highlighted in a brief minisymposium article in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p></body></sub-article></article>
