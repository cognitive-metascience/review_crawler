axon regenerative ability with maturation, but the mechanism remains unclear. Using an in-vitro laser axotomy model, we show a progressive decline in the ability of cut CNS axons to form a new growth cone and then elongate. Failure of regeneration was associated with increased retraction after axotomy. Transportation into axons becomes selective with maturation; we hypothesized that selective exclusion of molecules needed for growth may contribute to regeneration decline. With neuronal maturity rab11 vesicles (which carry many molecules involved in axon growth) became selectively targeted to the somatodendritic compartment and excluded from axons by predominant retrograde transport However, on overexpression rab11 was mistrafficked into proximal axons, and these axons showed less retraction and enhanced regeneration after axotomy. These results suggest that the decline of intrinsic axon regenerative ability is associated with selective exclusion of key molecules, and that manipulation of transport can enhance regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26956.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nerves in the brain and spinal cord can be damaged by trauma, stroke and other conditions. Damage to these nerve fibres can destroy the connections they form with each other, which may lead to paralysis, loss of sensation and loss of body control. If we could stimulate the regeneration and reconnection of the damaged nerve fibres then neurological function could be restored. However, although embryonic nerve fibres can regenerate when they are transplanted into the adult central nervous system, this regenerative ability appears to be lost as the nerve fibres mature.</p><p>To investigate when and why nerve fibres lose the ability to regenerate, Koseki et al. first developed a tissue culture assay in which individual nerve fibres were cut with a laser and imaged for several hours to track their regeneration (or failure to regenerate). The results demonstrate that nerve fibres from the central nervous system progressively lose the ability to grow and regenerate as they mature.</p><p>To investigate why mature nerve fibres cannot regenerate, Koseki et al. measured whether nerve fibres can transport some of the molecules needed for growth and regeneration to sites of damage. This showed that the compartments in which some key growth molecules are transported become excluded from mature nerve fibres. These compartments are marked by a protein called rab11, and Koseki et al. found that forcing rab11 back into mature nerve fibres restored their ability to regenerate.</p><p>There is still a lot of work needed before these findings can lead to a new regeneration treatment for patients, but it is a crucial step forwards. Furthermore, the assay developed by Koseki et al. could be used to develop and test such treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon

due to a combination of extrinsic inhibitory cues and an inadequate intrinsic regenerative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Long-distance regeneration can only be achieved if axons have a high intrinsic growth ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheah et al., 2016</xref>). Embryonic axons have this ability, and can elongate for long distances if immature neurons are transplanted into the adult CNS environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reier et al., 1986</xref>). However with maturation, adult CNS neurons lose much of this intrinsic regeneration ability, and axons such as those of the corticospinal tract show limited growth even in a permissive environment such as a peripheral nerve graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geoffroy et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richardson et al., 1984</xref>). Several changes occur during neuronal differentiation that might explain this maturational reduction in growth ability. Amongst these a key factor that changes radically with maturity is the establishment of selective transport to axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). Polarised transport of proteins is required for the correct molecules to travel to pre-and postsynaptic sites and in order for axons and dendrites to possess different structures and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeder et al., 2014</xref>). A consequence of polarised transport is that several key growth-related molecules including integrins, trkB and IGF receptor become excluded from cortical axons as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollis et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollis et al., 2009b</xref>). This development of polarised transport therefore provides a possible mechanism for the maturational loss of intrinsic regeneration ability. Our previous work has focused on integrins as an example of a molecule necessary for efficient regeneration and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheah et al., 2016</xref>), and has shown that these receptors are progressively excluded from cortical axons to become exclusively somatodendritic both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, sensory and retinal ganglion cell neurons, which can be more easily manipulated to make them regenerate, continue to transport integrins into their axons into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Integrins are transported into axons in recycling endosomes marked by the small GTPases rab11 and ARF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>). Rab11 is implicated in the trafficking of a number of growth associated molecules, including Trks A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascaño et al., 2009</xref>). Integrins, Trks and rab11 are all excluded from cortical CNS axons in-vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollis et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheehan et al., 1996</xref>). Rab11 is involved in axon elongation in young CNS and adult PNS neurons regenerating in vitro, and is required for correct growth cone function as its targeted removal leads to growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eva et al., 2010</xref>). These findings led us to ask whether selective exclusion from axons of the rab11 vesicles that transport these growth-related molecules contributes to their maturational loss of intrinsic regenerative ability, and whether replenishment and/or modulation of activation of rab11 can enable regeneration.</p><p>Previous studies of selective transport have used an in vitro model in which cortical neurons mature and exclude integrins from their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). We further developed this culture model for regeneration studies, and demonstrated that axons in these cultures lose the ability to regenerate with maturity, and that this loss is intrinsic to the axons rather than due to environment. We found that the characteristics of retraction bulb formation define the probability of regenerating a growth cone, but that subsequent axon elongation is controlled differently. The behaviour of rab11 was then investigated: we find that it becomes excluded from axons as neurons mature in-vitro, but that restoring the presence of rab11 in axons modifies retraction and enhances regeneration of mature axons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cortical neurons mature in the in-vitro culture model</title><p>Embryonic CNS neurons can differentiate in culture and provide a model for maturation-related changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbati et al., 2013</xref>). We asked whether this type of culture could also be used to model the developmental loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity. Dissociated embryonic day 18 (E18) rat cortical neurons were grown in the presence of astrocyte feeder cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). Neuronal maturity was tracked by examining the electrical properties of neurons, their pattern of gene expression through mRNA sequencing, and immunolabelling of cytoskeletal maturity markers. Electrophysiological maturation was examined by patch clamping neurons at 4, 8, 16, and 24 days in vitro (DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). During time in culture, resting membrane potential lowered to −55 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and membrane capacitance increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only 29.4 ± 10.6% of neurons were able to fire action potentials in response to steps of depolarizing current at 4 DIV, but the percentage increased to 100% by 24 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Concurrently the action potential spikes turned from single to multiple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), increased in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), decreased in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and spike threshold increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) while input resistance decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). All of these are changes associated with the maturation of neurons in vivo. Interestingly, the main statistical difference for these parameters was observed between 8 DIV and 16 DIV. As for network development, compatible with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kay et al., 2011</xref>), co-localization of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers was observable by 10DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, spontaneous activity increased between 16 DIV and 24 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26956.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrical maturation of neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Resting membrane potential of maturing neurons.

Events after axotomy unfold over several hours for CNS axons (compared with sensory axons which usually regenerate within one hour).

Axotomy was followed by either neuronal death, branch loss or retraction bulb formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Neurons were considered dead if axon disintegration or cell disruption was seen within 10 hr of axotomy, and were excluded from further analysis: this occurred in 15 ~ 25% of axotomies with no variation with DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Branch loss was the retraction of the cut axon branch to the nearest branch point with no formation of a retraction bulb: this occurred in 10 ~ 15% of axotomies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>) which were also excluded from further analysis. Retraction bulb formation was the commonest result of axotomy. Starting immediately after axotomy, the GFP signal within the axon disappeared proximal to the cut for up to 1000 µm. Following this, the cytosol would reflux up to the newly sealed axon tip and start accumulating to form a retraction bulb which was usually motile; this usually took from 1 to 3 hr (see below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).

We analysed these long (≧ 70 µm) and short (&lt;70 µm) retracting neurons separately in our further analysis of retraction distance and regeneration. For retraction distances, in 4 DIV neurons and short retracting 16 DIV neurons the position of axotomy was not a factor; short retracting axons were seen after both proximal and distal axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However the in long retracting 16 DIV neurons and all 24 DIV neurons, distal axotomy led to a greater retraction distance on average than proximal axotomy (&gt;600 µm for 16 DIV and &gt;400 µm for 24 DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Therefore, we categorized axons according to short or long retraction, and by proximal or distal axotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Distal axotomy led to less regeneration in the long retraction group of 16 DIV neurons (proximal 64% vs distal 11%, p=0.0002) and in 24 DIV neurons which all showed long retraction (proximal 24% vs distal 2%, p=0.0116), but distal axotomy did not affect regeneration success in the short retraction groups (p=0.0325) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We focused on rab11 because it is associated with the recycling endosomes responsible for bringing growth receptors and integrins into axons, and because these endosomes are reported to be restricted to a somatodendritic distribution in-vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheehan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>).

Previous studies have demonstrated different trafficking mechanisms for the active and inactive forms of rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welz et al., 2014</xref>), so tagged wild type (WT), dominant negative (DN), and constitutively active (CA) forms of rab11a were transfected. Overexpression of all forms caused a degree of mis-trafficking in neurons, leading to some rab11 being found in proximal axons and an increase in the proximal axon/dendrite ratio for total rab11 (GFP 0.62 ± 0.05, WT 0.63 ± 0.04, DN 0.61 ± 0.04, CA 0.51 ± 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

Staining for total rab11 in transfected neurons confirmed that transfection had increased total rab11 in the proximal axons, and the proximal axon/dendrite ratio of immunofluorescence intensity was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).</p><p>Axons were cut in the proximal region where rab11 was now present and their regeneration behaviour was measured. Laser axotomy led to an accumulation of fluorescent rab11 for all forms in the retraction bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), showing that transfected rab11 is present during the reorganization of the severed stump. Interestingly, in some cases this accumulation started even before (~30 min) the reflux of the cytosolic GFP or bulb formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We then analysed the regenerative measures as in the previous experiments. As with GFP-transfected neurons, retraction distance and time to form a retraction bulb was correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), and the retraction distance of rab11a transfected neurons showed a biphasic distribution for all forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), so we again separated neurons into short and long retraction groups. The percentages of axons in the short and long retraction groups did not change between GFP and the other rab11 forms. But strikingly, for all rab11 forms, overexpression resulted in decreased retraction in the long retraction group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The presence of rab11 also influenced growth cone regeneration, and the long retraction group of rab11 neurons had an improved regeneration ratio, but only with the WT and DN form suggesting the importance of the inactivated state of rab11 (GFP 11%, WT 38%, DN 38%, CA 13%, GFP vs WT p=0.0174, GFP vs DN p=0.0342, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

We therefore transfected neurons with rab11-GFP or control GFP at DIV10, the time at which partitioning of transport between axons and dendrites becomes apparent. At DIV 16 the neurons were stained for GFP and for a growth-associated receptor normally excluded from mature neurons. For this growth-related molecule normally carried in rab11 vesicles we selected α5 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caswell and Norman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eva et al., 2010</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hülsbusch et al., 2015</xref>), which is present in neurons and can be detected with a reliable antibody.

We describe an in-vitro single neuron axotomy model, in which there is a progressive decline in the intrinsic regeneration ability of the axons of cortical neurons as they mature. The neurons in these cultures can be transfected and regeneration-promoting effects of pharmaceuticals and other interventions tested (unpublished observations). We describe here an analysis which demonstrates that the development of polarised neuronal transport is an important factor in the loss of regeneration ability, through exclusion of rab11 recycling endosomes (which contain key growth molecules) from axons. The main influence on regeneration in this study was neuronal maturity, represented by days in vitro (DIV). This is in line with many in vivo studies which show that the regenerative ability of CNS axons is lost with maturity. Neuronal maturity is also a key factor in vivo, where grafted embryonic neurons have shown extensive growth in the adult brain and spinal cord, yet mature neurons show no growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jakeman and Reier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2006</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C.elegans</italic> axons also lose regenerative ability with age, although the mechanism may be rather different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang and Chisholm, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byrne et al., 2014</xref>). Even when regeneration is stimulated by manipulation of signalling pathways using Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog Deleted from Chromosome 10 (PTEN) deletion, the knockdown is much more effective if it is performed during the growth phase of cortical neurons rather than adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geoffroy et al., 2016</xref>). However some regenerative events are seen after CNS axotomy in adulthood. In the corticospinal tract and other pathways extensive lateral sprouting can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>), particularly in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenzweig et al., 2010</xref>), and growth into embryonic grafts can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein-Goral and Bregman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kadoya et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Detailed quantification of the events following axotomy revealed behaviours that change at different DIV. The retraction distance after axotomy increased with maturity; at 4 DIV retraction distances were short, but by 24 DIV they were much longer, with a mixture of short and long retractors at 16DIV. Retraction distance predicted regeneration with long retractors seldom regenerating, especially after distal axotomy. The correlation between long retraction and regeneration failure has also been shown in vivo after cutting intracortical axons by laser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canty et al., 2013</xref>). We suggest that the increased retraction distance with maturity may reflect changes in cytoskeletal dynamics together with decreased anterograde transport of materials required to maintain the axons. At DIV16, where we see both long and short-retracting axons indicating a mixed degree of maturity in neurons as they are becoming polarized and selective transport is being established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>). By DIV 24 these changes are fully established and all axons show long retraction after axotomy and almost complete loss of regenerative ability. The speed of axon growth after initiation of regeneration and the size of regenerated growth cones declined earlier than these retraction changes, the changes being complete by 16 DIV. Growth cone size is affected by many environmental and intrinsic factors, does not correlate with axon growth speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tosney and Landmesser, 1985</xref>), and is probably not a useful general indicator of regenerative ability.</p><p>We focused on the hypothesis that the developmental change in regenerative ability in axons is related to the progressive exclusion of growth-related molecules from axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britt et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, previous work has shown that integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franssen et al., 2015</xref>) and Trks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollis et al., 2009a</xref>) become excluded from axons after they mature, as are most postsynaptic proteins. Precise control of the location of intracellular molecules is necessary so that axons or dendrites can have different structures and functions. Many growth-related molecules are transported into axons via the recycling pathway in vesicles marked by the small GTPase rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lasiecka and Winckler, 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baetz and Goldenring, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welz et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we show that rab11 is present in immature axons but becomes restricted to a somatodendritic distribution with maturity, correlating with the loss of ability to regenerate axons in both rodent cortical neurons and human dopaminergic neurons. As with many molecules the selective transport mechanism is somewhat leaky, which could indicate passive diffusion of vesicles and molecules into axons followed by selective removal by retrograde transport. Overexpression of rab11 leads to mis-trafficking and therefore leads to the presence of some rab11 in the proximal axons of mature neurons. This allowed us to ask whether the presence of rab11 affects regeneration.</p><p>In our study, rab11 WT and CA enhanced regeneration length and growth cone size, and this is in line with previous studies where these molecules have been shown to be involved in axon and dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Our results also demonstrated that along with WT the DN mutant enhances formation of a new growth cone to initiate regeneration whereas the CA does not. Other studies have also confirmed the protrusion-initiating properties of rab11 DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shirane and Nakayama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramel et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the different forms of rab11 can have different effects on different processes including vesicle transport, trafficking and actin reorganization and can therefore affect different phases of regeneration. Rab11 overexpression also enhanced regeneration in human dopaminergic neurons. The regeneration-promoting effect of rab11 overexpression is assumed to be due to the transport into axons of the many growth-related molecules that are transported in this class of endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welz et al., 2014</xref>). As an example, we showed that α5 integrin is transported into the proximal axons of rab11 overexpressing neurons.</p><p>Rab11 transport is controlled in several ways. A transport complex of rab11, Arf6 and JIP3/4 can associate with kinesin or dynein depending on the activation state of Arf6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montagnac et al., 2009</xref>) and rab11 associates with kinesin through activated protrudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuzaki et al., 2011</xref>). Enhancing the level of PIP3 through PTEN knockdown has been a successful method for inducing regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2015</xref>). Our results fit with this story, because PIP3 has effects on transport through GAPs and GEFs and on membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Randazzo et al., 2001</xref>). It is probable that there is a cycle, where transport of receptors allows PI3K activation and PIP3 generation, which in turn enhances transport and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Manipulation of rab11 transport using these methods can enhance regeneration in mature cortical neurons (unpublished observations), and will be the basis of future in vivo investigations.</p><p>The changes in transport that we have shown affect regeneration, but CNS axons nevertheless show some regenerative activity after damage, particularly lateral sprouting and growth into embryonic tissues. It is unlikely that these events can happen without the presence of a receptor on the axons and a corresponding ligand in the environment. These receptors, currently unidentified, must continue to be transported into mature axons, presumably independently of rab11.</p><p>Overall this study supports the concept that CNS axons lose their intrinsic ability to regenerate with maturation. Mature axons lose regeneration-associated molecules due to the development of polarised transportation, which directs the many growth-related molecules in rab11 vesicles to dendrites and away from axons. Modifying selective axon transportation could therefore be a strategy for enhancing intrinsic regeneration ability in the adult CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cortical neurons were derived from E18 Sprague Dawley rat cortex, and were plated at the density of 100–150 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>.

For dendrites, the brightest three branches were chosen, and the ‘dendrite signal’ was calculated by averaging the immunofluorescence intensities of the 0–100 μm region of these three dendrites. Cell body signal was measured at the soma, by cutting off the dendrite and axon area from their stems. For ‘400 μm axon signal’ and ‘800 μm axon signal’, immunofluorescence intensities of axon regions 350–450 μm and 750–850 μm away from the cell body were measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-9"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies: VGLUT1 (Synaptic systems, 135–303, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887875">AB_887875</ext-link>), VGAT (Synaptic systems, 131–003, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887869">AB_887869</ext-link>), PSD95 (ThermoFisher, MA1-04, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_325399">AB_325399</ext-link>), Gephyrin (Synaptic systems, 147–011, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887717">AB_887717</ext-link>), extracellular Pan-Neurofascin (NeuroMab, 75–172, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2282826">AB_2282826</ext-link>), cleaved caspase 3 (Cell signaling, 9664S, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2070042">AB_2070042</ext-link>), rab11 (ThermoFisher, 71–5300, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533987">AB_2533987</ext-link>), β3 Tubulin (abcam, ab41489, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_727049">AB_727049</ext-link>), SMI312 (abcam, ab24574), Ankyrin G (NeuroMab, 75–146), GFP (ThermoFisher, A10262), RFP (abcam, ab62341, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_945213">AB_945213</ext-link>), integrin alpha5 (MERCK, AB1928, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2128185">AB_2128185</ext-link>).Secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti chicken, 568 goat anti rabbit, 660 goat anti mouse (ThermoFisher).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-10"><title>Culture of hESC-derived neurons</title><p>RC17 clinical grade hESC cells (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_L206">CVCL_L206</ext-link>) were sourced from Roslin Cells, Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

An Andor spinning disk confocal microscope with temperature and CO2 controlled live imaging chamber was used. GFP-transfected neurons were selected and the axon was identified based on morphology. For axotomy, a MicroPoint photo-stimulation tool with 365 nm laser in combination with a 40xH2O objective were used. The distance from the cell body was kept similar for all experiments (between 300–500 um). Both axon and cell body were imaged for 16 hr following axotomy with 20 min intervals using a 20x objective and minimal laser intensity to reduce the risk of phototoxicity. Neuronal survival was high (typically 100%). Axotomy results were manually analysed using Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-13"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>For human neurons, cells were fixed by addition of 8%PFA to equal volume of culture medium (final concentration 4%) and incubating for 15 min at RT. Then cultures were blocked for 30 min at RT in blocking buffer (2% Normal Horse Serum, 2% Normal Goat Serum, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% Triton X‐100) followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies in blocking buffer. The following day, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min at RT. Images were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with 40x objective. Axons were identified using <italic>SMI312 (</italic>Biolegend, San Diego, California).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-14"><title>Quantification of integrin alpha5 axon-dendrite ratio</title><p>Cortical neurons were transfected at DIV10 with either GFP or rab11WT and fixed at DIV14 with methanol. These were immunolabelled for integrin alpha5 and GFP. Control and rab11 transfected cultures were fixed and labelled together, using identical conditions. Images were acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope, using identical settings for each image. Images were acquired at 40x to include the cell body, dendrites and the proximal section of axon in each image. Leica LAS AF software was used to measure mean fluorescnece in the axon, and in two dendrites (to give a mean dendrite measurement). A region next to each neurite was used to subtract background fluorescence. Axon dendrite-ratio was determined as the mean dendrite fluorescence intensity divided by the axon intensity. GraphPad Prism (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) was used for statistical analysis of data using a students T-Test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism and the program R. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used for normality testing. For comparison of 2 sample groups, t-test was used. Student’s or Welch’s t-test was used depending on the variance. For comparison of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA was normally used. For the post hoc test, Bonferroni’s, or Dunnett’s post hoc test was used depending on the comparisons that were going to be made. For the cases where the assumption of equal variance was significantly violated (determined by Bartlett’s test), Games-Howell post hoc test was used. Some of the patch clamp results and many of the axotomy results violated the normal distribution assumption. For the patch clamp results, Kruskal-Wallis test was used instead of one-way ANOVA. For the axotomy results, the data was converted by log10 to shift it to normal distribution. For regeneration ratio results, fisher’s exact test was used, and Bonferroni correction was applied for repeated comparisons. For the rab11 vesicle movement analysis, two-way ANOVA was used, followed by a Bonferroni’s post hoc test.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.

While in general it has been previously noted that axonal transport is enhanced in peripheral axons after injury and that central axons may lack this response to injury, this work takes these previous (poorly documented) claims to mechanistic depth, demonstrating a novel mechanism related to axonal transport that is lost as a function of neuronal maturation. They also that demonstrate that &quot;correction&quot; of altered axonal transport by over-expression of rab11 enhanced regeneration. This is a nicely conceived, executed and supported set of studies. The novelty is high, and of interest to a broad readership. It would be nice to have in vivo confirmation of the relevance of this mechanism, but that is not essential as the mechanistic findings are so nicely and elegantly provided.</p><p>On a general level some concerns arose which can be readily addressed in re-writing. Some figures are a bit hard to follow. Some observations are interesting but it would be really interesting to provide more mechanistic insights, e.g., the biphasic response, short vs long retracting, recycling endosomes. Some parts need more clarification, e.g., distal vs proximal axotomy (rationale, experimental model, etc). In parts the manuscript feels a bit diffuse and may be much improved by focusing on the most important points and presenting the most relevant data that support the hypothesis.</p><p>Specific suggestions for modifications and clarification follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state: &quot;These results suggest that the decline of intrinsic axon regenerative ability is due to selective exclusion of key molecules, and that manipulation of transport can restore regeneration,&quot; These statements may be a bit bold. More likely, the authors have identified a *contributing* mechanism to central axonal growth failure, and manipulation of transport can significantly improve (not necessarily &quot;restore&quot;) regeneration. There are numerous other mechanisms limiting regeneration that also contribute to central regeneration failure. Along these lines, the authors argue that CNS axons such as corticospinal axons lose the ability to regenerate even in a permissive environment, such as a peripheral nerve graft. A recent report in Nat Med 2016 (Kadoya) showed that adult corticospinal axons do indeed regenerate into a permissive environment of a neural stem cell graft. This undermines the authors' argument. This by no means negates the authors' findings or the importance of their work, but perhaps they should present their findings in a modified context: overcoming maturation-associated alterations in axonal transport can enhance central axonal regeneration.</p><p>2) The authors might comment on in vivo extension of their work. Did the authors already attempt to extent these tools to in vivo models and encountered some limitations? In my view, this would not at all undermine the importance of this work or its suitability for publication. I also appreciate that in vivo experiments can fail for many reasons unrelated to the accuracy of the proposed mechanism, and that practical limitations in vivo may preclude clear documentation of an in vitro finding that is well documented, as in the case of the present results. The authors might at least discuss in vivo extension of their work, and issues that might be encountered.</p><p>3) The authors are using y-axes on a log scale in some of the later figures, likely to deal with a large spread in the data. This hinders however the ability to compare data presented in other panels on a linear scale. Please reconsider whether a log10 scale is the only way to present these data.</p><p>4) Although the study showed that over-expression of rab11a in DIV 16 neurons significantly enhanced some of their regenerative responses to axotomy, such as decreased long retract and increased regeneration length in two hours, it is unclear how rab11 achieved such promoting effects. For instance, it is not clear why rab11a had different trafficking directions and velocities in axons and dendrites. It is also not clear why rab11a overexpression-induced mis-trafficking into axons enhanced some regenerative responses to axotomy. Can the authors show that over-expression of rab11a results in increased transport of axon growth-related molecules into the axon? Conversely, will the known axon regeneration promoting approaches affect the rab11 trafficking or localization in aged neurons? The answers to these questions will greatly strengthen the proposed hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26956.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a novel and interesting set of studies.

The detailed response to individual points is below. We kept the Introduction and Discussion short, but we have now added some more mechanistic information and speculation. We apologise for the way the illustrations were presented in the constructed pdf, which led to a diffuse feel. The figures were not numbered in the review pdf, and it was not clear which figures were supplementary. <italic>ELife</italic> encourages supplementary figures attached to main figures, which we have done. In the resubmission we have put figure numbers underneath the figures to make things clearer. We worked hard on the figures, and we don’t think we can do better. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which we admit shows complex information, we have divided the figure into panels, used coloured labels to guide the reader, and inserted arrows between the graphs to indicate the groups of data from short and long retractors that are being analysed. We do not want to take out details of axonal behaviour etc. from the paper, because we hope that other groups will want to use the assay we describe, and they will find these details useful. We have inserted information and speculation on short vs. long retraction and mechanism in several places in the discussion. The additional sections are highlighted in red, and we have not pasted them all here in the interests of compactness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state: &quot;These results suggest that the decline of intrinsic axon regenerative ability is due to selective exclusion of key molecules, and that manipulation of transport can restore regeneration,&quot; These statements may be a bit bold. More likely, the authors have identified a *contributing* mechanism to central axonal growth failure, and manipulation of transport can significantly improve (not necessarily &quot;restore&quot;) regeneration. There are numerous other mechanisms limiting regeneration that also contribute to central regeneration failure. Along these lines, the authors argue that CNS axons such as corticospinal axons lose the ability to regenerate even in a permissive environment, such as a peripheral nerve graft. A recent report in Nat Med 2016 (Kadoya) showed that adult corticospinal axons do indeed regenerate into a permissive environment of a neural stem cell graft. This undermines the authors' argument. This by no means negates the authors' findings or the importance of their work, but perhaps they should present their findings in a modified context: overcoming maturation-associated alterations in axonal transport can enhance central axonal regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these comments, and we have changed wording throughout the paper to make it clear that we are describing one of several mechanisms- these changes are in red. However, we believe that many of the mechanisms controlling regeneration will be seen to depend on the mechanisms controlling transport and trafficking such we have described. This is a new focus for the field, and the data on rab11 that we give in this paper is just one of several transport and trafficking mechanisms that control axon growth and regeneration. We have also commented on axonal sprouting and regeneration into embryonic grafts. Our view is that there must be one or more unidentified axonal surface receptors that interact with ligands in the adult and embryonic CNS environment, that are responsible for these behaviours, and which are transported into mature CNS axons (presumably independently of rab11). It would be a great advance to identify these receptors.</p><p>The following is in two places in the discussion.</p><p>“However, some regenerative events are seen after CNS axotomy in adulthood. In the corticospinal tract and other pathways extensive lateral sprouting can occur (Bareyre et al., 2004), particularly in primates (Rosenzweig et al., 2010), and growth into embryonic grafts can occur (Bernstein-Goral and Bregman, 1993; Kadoya et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The changes in transport that we have shown affect regeneration, but CNS axons nevertheless show some regenerative activity after damage, particularly lateral sprouting and growth into embryonic tissues. It is unlikely that these events can happen without the presence of a receptor on the axons and a corresponding ligand in the environment. These receptors, currently unidentified, must continue to be transported into mature axons, presumably independently of rab11.</p><p>2) The authors might comment on in vivo extension of their work. Did the authors already attempt to extent these tools to in vivo models and encountered some limitations? In my view, this would not at all undermine the importance of this work or its suitability for publication. I also appreciate that in vivo experiments can fail for many reasons unrelated to the accuracy of the proposed mechanism, and that practical limitations in vivo may preclude clear documentation of an in vitro finding that is well documented, as in the case of the present results. The authors might at least discuss in vivo extension of their work, and issues that might be encountered.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that overexpression of rab11 will promote long tract regeneration in vivo, and we do not plan to try it. The mistrafficking of rab11 and associated integrin into axons is to the proximal region and for in vivoregeneration we need a longer range effect. The data in this paper are designed to help us analyse the loss of regeneration with maturity, and provide proof of principle for a role of rab11 vesicles and their contents in regeneration. However we are working on solutions based on these observations that should promote CNS regeneration. We find that axonal transport of rab11 and integrins is controlled by Arf6 GAPs and GEFs, which can have a large effect on regeneration. A submitted paper is on http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/14/150037.full.pdf</p><p>We also have very strong regeneration-promoting effects and transport-promoting effects from overexpression of active PI3K isoforms, and from expression of an active form of protrudin. Our strategy is to find an optimum combination of interventions using the model described in this paper, then do a definitive in vivoexperiment with full behaviour. We do not like doing quickie regeneration experiments.</p><p>We have put the following comment in the discussion.</p><p>“Our results fit with this story, because PIP3 has effects on transport through GAPs and GEFs and on membrane trafficking (Macia et al., 2008; Randazzo et al., 2001). It is probable that there is a cycle, where transport of receptors allows PI3K activation and PIP3 generation, which in turn enhances transport and trafficking. Manipulation of rab11 transport using these methods can enhance regeneration in mature cortical neurons (Unpublished observations), and will be the basis of future in vivoinvestigations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors are using y-axes on a log scale in some of the later figures, likely to deal with a large spread in the data. This hinders however the ability to compare data presented in other panels on a linear scale. Please reconsider whether a log10 scale is the only way to present these data.</p></disp-quote><p>The distribution of this data is log Gaussian, so the clearest way to show clearly that the axon retraction after axotomy divides into short retraction in immature axons, long retraction in mature axons, and a mixture of the two in maturing axons is to plot on a log scale. The data is also shown on a linear scale in the supplementary figure attached to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. To guide readers we have added the following in the Results section:</p><p>The same data are plotted on a non-log scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-E</xref>)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although the study showed that over-expression of rab11a in DIV 16 neurons significantly enhanced some of their regenerative responses to axotomy, such as decreased long retract and increased regeneration length in two hours, it is unclear how rab11 achieved such promoting effects. For instance, it is not clear why rab11a had different trafficking directions and velocities in axons and dendrites. It is also not clear why rab11a overexpression-induced mis-trafficking into axons enhanced some regenerative responses to axotomy. Can the authors show that over-expression of rab11a results in increased transport of axon growth-related molecules into the axon? Conversely, will the known axon regeneration promoting approaches affect the rab11 trafficking or localization in aged neurons? The answers to these questions will greatly strengthen the proposed hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The penultimate sentence contains an important suggestion, which we had begun to address when Dr. Koseki had to return to Japan. We have now finished an experiment which provides this new data, and the results certainly strengthen the paper.</p><p>Rab11 vesicles transport many molecules, many of them cell surface receptors involved in axon growth. We decided to see whether rab11 forced into mature axons would carry with it an integrin. Alpha5 integrin is expressed in the cortical neurons, and normally completely excluded from the axons. Integrins are powerful promoters of axon growth. We transfected neurons with rab11-GFP, leading to rab11 being present in the proximal axons (identified by neurofascin staining). We stained the neurons for endogenously produced alpha5 integrin, which is normally completely excluded from axons. We found that, as predicted, the rab11 had carried alpha5 integrin with it into the axons. This experiment is now described in subsection “rab11 positive vesicles are excluded from axons in mature neurons” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and a section of the Materials and methods section.</p><p>As to why overexpression induces mis-trafficking, there are several possibilities. Mis-trafficking is a common finding after overexpression of molecules. Two probable explanations are a) that the selective anterograde transport selection process is overloaded and cannot cope with the excess cargo, and b) that the overexpressed molecule is excluded from axons by retrograde transport out of axon of molecules that have diffused into the axons. We think the second is more likely. We have put a sentence into the discussion:</p><p>As with many molecules the selective transport mechanism is somewhat leaky, which could indicate passive diffusion of vesicles and molecules into axons followed by selective removal by retrograde transport.</p><p>The final sentence asks whether known regeneration-promoting approaches affect transport. The paper answers this question for immature vs. mature axons. We are currently working on PIP3 levels, modulated by overexpression of PI3K. One isoform of PI3K has a very strong effect on both anterograde transport of rab11 and integrins and on regeneration. We plan to write this up soon.</p><p>The mechanisms by which selective transport is regulated in axons, and methods to alter it and promote regeneration are a main topic of current research in our lab. One mechanism is described in the paper on http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/14/150037.full.pdf. We are also working on regulation of transport and regeneration by PI3K/PIP3, protrudin and initial segment knockdown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
