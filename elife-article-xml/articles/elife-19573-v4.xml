In angiosperms, seed development is initiated after a double-fertilization event, which produces the endosperm and the zygote. Arabidopsis mature seeds consist of a desiccated and highly resistant embryo surrounded by a single cell layer of endosperm and an external layer, the testa, consisting of dead integumentary maternal tissues. The endosperm nourishes the developing embryo as both tissues develop. The endosperm is triploid, bearing two maternal genomes and one paternal genome, whereas the zygote is diploid, bearing one maternal and one paternal genome.</p><p>Seed germination is a developmental transition that transforms the embryo into a fragile seedling. Unsurprisingly, this process is tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nonogaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). Primary seed dormancy, hereafter referred to as ‘dormancy’, is a property of freshly produced seeds whereby seed germination does not occur even under otherwise favorable germination conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chahtane et al., 2016</xref>). Dormancy is a vital trait that prevents germination out of season while maintaining the embryo in a protected state within the dry seed. As they age, dry seeds lose dormancy, a process known as dry after-ripening, i.e. they acquire the capacity to germinate under favorable germination conditions. The time period of dry after-ripening required before the seed acquires the capacity to germinate can be used to define the dormancy levels stored in seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chahtane et al., 2016</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the trait of dormancy varies markedly among plant species, including among <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, with important consequences in plant ecology, phenology and agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baskin and Baskin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmuths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</xref>). Indeed, different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions produce seeds with low or high dormancy levels. Low dormancy accessions need only a short dry after-ripening time to acquire the capacity to germinate upon imbibition, unlike highly dormant accessions.</p><p>Final seed dormancy levels are strongly influenced by the climatic conditions experienced by the mother plant. In particular, cold temperatures lead to higher final dormancy levels in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mature seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, this response is maternally controlled, and involves the genes <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) and <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Abscisic acid (ABA) is a growth-repressive hormone that is essential to repress the germination of dormant seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Debeaujon and Koornneef, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali-Rachedi et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, upon imbibition, ABA stimulates the expression of <italic>LATE EMBRYONIC ABUNDANT</italic> (<italic>LEA</italic>) genes, whose products promote osmotolerance, and inhibits embryonic lipid catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Molina and Chua, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopez-Molina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Penfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekkers et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the endosperm is essential to repress the germination of dormant seeds. Indeed, removing the testa and endosperm upon dormant seed imbibition triggers growth and greening of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Lopez-Molina, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, removing the testa while leaving the endosperm layer surrounding the embryo does not trigger embryonic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethke et al., 2007</xref>). A ‘seed coat bedding assay’, monitoring the growth of dissected embryos cultured on a layer of dissected endosperms with the testa still attached, showed that the endosperm of dormant seeds is able to block embryonic growth by continuously synthesizing and releasing ABA towards the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). In fully after-ripened seeds, the endosperm ceases to release sufficient ABA upon imbibition, thus allowing germination to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In summary, dormancy is a multi-faceted process in which, upon seed imbibition, (1) embryonic growth is repressed, (2) utilization of at least part of the seed’s food reserves is repressed and (3) osmotolerance gene expression programs are stimulated.</p><p>Imprinted gene expression, also called genomic imprinting, is the preferential expression of a given parental allele over the other. Such parent-of-origin gene expression is observed in both mammals and flowering plants, which share the habit of nourishing the embryo through a sexually derived tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pires and Grossniklaus, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, genomic imprinting was found and studied in the endosperm during seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehring, 2013</xref>). Given the endosperm’s nourishing role, it is often regarded as a plant equivalent of the mammalian placenta. The kinship or ‘parental conflict’ theory is often proposed to account for the evolutionary origin of imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haig and Westoby, 1989</xref>). Nevertheless, the evolutionary forces that led to imprinting remain obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodrigues and Zilberman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Dormancy levels can be maternally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). However, the general nature and extent of the maternal control of seed dormancy remain poorly characterized. The occurrence and biological role of endospermic imprinting in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mature seeds has not been investigated previously. Given the central role played by the mature endosperm in preventing the germination of dormant seeds, we investigated whether genomic imprinting could be implicated in maternal inheritance of primary seed dormancy. Here, we provide direct evidence that the maternal inheritance of seed dormancy does indeed involve dormancy-specific genomic imprinting programs that take place in the mature endosperm.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maternal inheritance of seed dormancy levels</title><p>When cultivated under standard laboratory conditions, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions Cape Verde Islands-0 (Cvi) and C24 (C24) produce seeds with high and low dormancy levels, respectively. Cvi seeds require a longer dry after-ripening time than C24 seeds to acquire the capacity to germinate. To assess whether seed dormancy levels are determined by parental inheritance in these accessions, we measured the dormancy levels of F1 hybrid seeds generated after reciprocally crossing Cvi and C24 plants. F1 hybrid seeds produced by C24 mother plants (with a Cvi pollen donor) are referred to as C24xCvi F1 seeds and those from Cvi mother plants (with a C24 pollen donor) as CvixC24 F1 seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Following a short after-ripening period (five days), C24, Cvi, and F1 seeds were unable to germinate 72 hr after seed imbibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, a long dry after-ripening period (6 months) led to full germination of all seed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An intermediate after-ripening time (25 days) led to full germination of C24 seeds but not of Cvi seeds, consistent with their different natural seed dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, C24xCvi F1 seeds almost fully germinated, unlike CvixC24 F1 seeds, indicating that C24xCvi F1 seeds are less dormant than CvixC24 F1 seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Maternal inheritance of dormancy levels could be due to several factors including: (1) a purely maternal effect whereby the Cvi maternal plant tissues impose higher dormancy to the seed progeny; (2) an endospermic gene-imprinting effect; (3) a gene expression dosage effect resulting from the endosperm’s parental genome imbalance, which favors the maternal genome (2 maternal vs. 1 paternal genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the last case, duplication of maternal dormancy genes would impose a pattern in their expression more akin to the maternal genotype. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive and could therefore all be valid.</p><p>To assess the contribution of endospermic gene dosage effects, we used tetraploid Cvi-0 (Cvi<sup>tet</sup>) and C24 (C24<sup>tet</sup>) plants as pollen donors in crosses with normal diploid C24 and Cvi female accessions, respectively. These crosses produce hybrid C24xCvi<sup>tet</sup> and CvixC24<sup>tet</sup> F1 seeds containing a 2:2 Cvi to C24 genome ratio in endosperm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Unsurprisingly, Cvi<sup>tet</sup> seeds were more dormant than C24<sup>tet</sup> seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, CvixC24<sup>tet</sup> F1 seeds were more dormant than C24xCvi<sup>tet</sup> F1 seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, presence of the endosperm was required to repress seed germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data therefore indicate that the endosperm’s natural maternal genome imbalance does not readily account for the observed inheritance in F1 seeds of dormancy levels akin to those of their maternal genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This prompted us to explore whether F1 seed dormancy is associated with genomic imprinting in the endosperm of F1 seeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The mature testa contains insignificant amounts of mRNA relative to the endosperm</title><p>Partial dissection of the endosperm, i.e. the isolation of the endosperm with the testa still attached to it, is a rapid and easy procedure. By contrast, full dissection of the endosperm, i.e. the isolation of the endosperm without the surrounding testa, is a challenging task because it requires peeling the testa, a delicate and lengthy procedure that more often than not wounds the endosperm. The testa originates from ovular integuments that undergo progressive degeneration and collapse during seed development. Electron microscopy studies reveal that the mature testa does not contain obvious traces of organelles, cytoplasm or nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yadav et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, researchers assume that the testa is not a significant source of maternal RNA contamination and thus that the partially dissected endosperm can be used as a source of RNA for endosperm transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Lopez-Molina, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We sought to verify that the testa is not a significant source of maternal mRNA contamination. Using WT seed material, total RNA was isolated from 40 partially dissected endosperms, 40 testas and 40 fully dissected endosperms in two independent experiments. To ensure maximal RNA recovery, a nucleic acid carrier was used for final RNA precipitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Materials and methods). The concentration levels of RNA extracted from testas were below detection levels, unlike those from partially and fully dissected endosperm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). 200 ng of RNA was used to construct partially and fully dissected endosperm cDNA libraries. Although testa RNA could not be detected in our RNA testa sample, we sought to construct testa cDNA libraries using avolume of RNA testa sample equal to that of the largest one used for the construction of the partially and fully dissected endosperm cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, Materials and methods). Unsurprisingly, the resulting testa libraries contained concentrations of cDNA that were smaller than 25 fold than those in the partially and fully dissected endosperm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All cDNA libraries were subject to high-throughput sequencing and sequencing reads were mapped to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome. The total number of reads obtained with the testa sample was only about 1% of the read numbers obtained for the partially and fully dissected endosperm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, the read numbers of the partially and fully dissected endosperm samples were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We compared the gene expression profiles between partially and fully dissected endosperm samples. Only 14 genes among 33,557 annotated genes were differentially expressed between the partially and fully dissected endosperm samples (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (Material and methods). Among these 14 genes, seven are osmotic stress-induced genes whose expression was higher in the fully dissected endosperm relative to the partially dissected endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winter et al., 2007</xref>). The differential expression of these genes could be due to the lengthy testa peeling procedure, prior to endosperm isolation, which likely deprives the endosperm tissue of moisture. Similarly, among the 14 genes, two genes (<italic>AT4G35100</italic> and <italic>AT1G62510</italic>) were reported to be downregulated in response to osmotic stress and had higher expression in the partially dissected endosperm relative to the fully dissected endosperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winter et al., 2007</xref>).

Furthermore, these imprinted gene expression programs appear to change according to seed dormancy levels. Given that dormancy is maternally inherited and given the small number of identified PEGs, we focused on studying dormancy-specific MEGs. Indeed, among the 57 dormancy-specific MEGs, seven were shown to regulate dormancy or germination, whereas another nine could potentially perform the same role based on current knowledge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and see below). By contrast, only three genes that directly (two genes) or indirectly (one gene) regulate germination were among the 36 non-dormant-specific MEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dormancy-specific MEG expression can correlate with seed dormancy levels</title><p>We evaluated whether dormancy-specific MEG expression correlates with dormancy levels. Clustering analysis of gene expression levels revealed that among the 57 identified dormancy-specific MEGs, about half (26 out of 57) had expression levels that were negatively correlated with seed dormancy levels: Cvi seeds being the most dormant, followed by CvixCol F1, ColxCvi F1 and finally Col seeds, which are the least dormant (cluster 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Strikingly, the majority of MEGs (12 out of 16) that are involved or potentially involved in regulating seed germination belonged to cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Other gene expression clusters did not show any apparent correlation between mRNA and seed dormancy levels (cluster 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, among all <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes only a minority (about 7%) had expression levels that negatively correlated with seed dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). These data therefore indicate that genes belonging to the dormancy-specific MEG group tend to have expression levels that correlate negatively with seed dormancy levels.</p><p>Cultivating <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under low temperatures (10°C) increases final seed dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using seed nicking experiments, a previous report indicated that the presence of an intact endosperm is necessary to repress the germination of highly dormant seeds produced under low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kendall et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we observed that removal of the endosperm and testa, but not removal of the testa alone, triggered embryonic growth and greening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). This demonstrates that the endosperm is also necessary to repress the germination of highly dormant seeds that developed under low temperatures.</p><p>Strikingly, among the 57 dormant-specific MEGs, about half (33) had their expression lowered when seeds developed under cold temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). By contrast, among the 36 MEGs identified in non-dormant seeds, only one had its expression lowered while the expression of the vast majority of genes was unchanged. Furthermore, the majority (23 out of 33) of the genes that were downregulated in response to cold belonged to the cluster 1 of genes whose expression negatively correlates with dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, at least a third of dormancy-specific MEGs are involved or potentially involved in regulating seed germination. Moreover, about half of dormancy-specific MEGs have their expression correlated negatively with seed dormancy levels. Among the latter, most have their expression downregulated by cold during seed development, which increases mature seed dormancy levels.</p><p>We focused our attention on two MEGs, <italic>CYSTEINE PROTEASE1</italic> (<italic>CP1</italic>) and <italic>ALLANTOINASE </italic>(<italic>ALN</italic>).

We provide direct evidence that it regulates dormancy, at least partially through maternal gametophytic alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations suggest a model in which maternal dormancy inheritance involves the preferential maternal allele expression of regulators of seed dormancy upon seed imbibition. Therefore, dormancy levels in hybrid seeds reflect the maternal genotype, reflected in the maternal expression levels or product activities of genes regulating dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of genomic imprinting upon seed imbibition raises the question of which developmental stage, i.e. prior or after mature seed formation, is the one in which maternal allelic transcription takes place. It appears unlikely that this transcription takes place only during seed development, with resulting mRNAs being stored in mature seeds. Indeed, we found that <italic>CP1</italic> maternal allelic mRNA accumulation increased over time after imbibition, indicating de novo and dormancy-specific maternal allele transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). Furthermore, the MEGs and PEGs identified in non-dormant seeds probably involve maternal allelic transcription upon seed imbibition as they were not detected in dormant seeds. These observations support the notion of a dedicated parental-specific allele transcription program operating upon mature seed imbibition.</p><p>The biological significance of maternally inherited dormancy remains to be understood. Presumably, the mother plant adjusts the dormancy of its seed progeny to optimize future germination according to seasonal cues. Interestingly, the majority of dormancy-specific MEGs whose expression correlates with dormancy levels also have their expression further regulated by cold during seed development. This suggests that imprinted gene expression levels upon imbibition are further adapted to the environmental cues perceived by the mother plant or by the developing seed tissues or both.</p><p>The evolutionary driving force leading to imprinting in the context of seed dormancy is unclear. Although the following scenario might seem unlikely for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is mainly a self-fertilizing species, it might reflect an evolutionary trend present in related cross-pollinating species. Indeed, in the case of a seed fathered by a pollen grain coming from a distant plant, which could be either a different accession or have experienced different climatic conditions than the mother plant, the paternal allele expression may interfere with maternal control of seed dormancy. It would seem advantageous therefore to silence paternal genes that regulate germination to prevent such paternal interference. Consistent with this speculation, the number of PEGs identified in dormant seeds is markedly lower than that reported previously during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pignatta et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In plants, genomic imprinting during early embryogenesis is mainly proposed to arise from a ‘parental conflict’ over food allocation to the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang and Köhler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Köhler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gehring, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodrigues and Zilberman, 2015</xref>).

This led us to identify 107,977 common exonic SNPs covering 15,814 genes, which in turn were used to distinguish Cvi and Col reads in ColxCvi and CvixCol F1 RNA sequencing data. The SNPs used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Identification of imprinted genes</title><p>We sequenced cDNA libraries prepared from ColxCvi and CvixCol endospermic F1 RNA. Low-quality reads were filtered out and the remaining reads were treated as described above for the Cvi reads.</p><p>We called variants at each SNP position using the SAMtools Mpileup (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002105">SCR_002105</ext-link>) supplied with a reference bed file of SNP positions to generate a pileup file. The resulting file was used with the SAMtools Filter pileup program, which generated read counts for the reference (Col) and variant (Cvi) genome for every SNP position. Next, reads specific to Col and Cvi alleles were summed across all the SNPs present in each gene. The resulting numbers for each gene are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 6</xref>. A list of potential maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and paternally expressed genes (PEGs) was established after applying the following criteria: (1) potential MEGs are those genes whose ratio of maternal allele to paternal allele read number is more than 0.8 in both ColxCvi and CvixCol endosperm F1 material; similarly potential PEGs are those whose ratio of paternal to maternal allele read number is more than 0.6; (2) potential MEGs or PEGs with read numbers lower than five were discarded; (3) the probabilities of deviation from expected ratio (maternal:paternal = 2:1) in a Fisher's two-tailed exact test were calculated and only potential MEGs or PEGs with a p &lt; 0.05 were retained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Validation of imprinting</title><p>RNA was extracted from other sets of reciprocal crosses between Col and Cvi (after ripening for five days and two months), treated with DNase, and cDNA was synthesized using ImpromII reverse transcriptase (Promega) and oligo dT primers. We selected 17 MEGs and two PEGs and designed primers to amplify cDNA fragments containing SNPs. PCR amplicons were purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), then sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The same PCR amplicons were pooled and libraries were constructed using the Illumina NexteraXT kit (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced using the MiSeq system (Illumina) with paired-end 150 bp reads. The resulting reads were mapped to the Col-0 genome (TAIR10) using the TopHat software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013035">SCR_013035</ext-link>). Col and Cvi reads at the SNP position of each gene were counted as described above for RNA-seq.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gene expression profile</title><p>Transcripts assembly and normalization was performed with the Cufflinks program (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013307">SCR_013307</ext-link>), and gene expression levels were calculated in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million mapped fragments) units.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dormancy-specific imprinting underlies maternal inheritance of seed dormancy in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Steven Penfield (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper reports a transient imprinting phenomenon in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> endosperm that appears to involve a different set of genes from those identified in earlier development. The reviewers felt that this is an interesting and important study that presents novel and exiting findings. The paper suggests an unappreciated new role for imprinting, shows for the first time that imprinting persists into maturity, and that imprinting is dynamic with respect to dormancy state and environmental temperature during seed maturation.</p><p>However, there are four key areas in which substantial revisions are required:</p><p>1) Verification of the new imprinting phenomenon.</p><p>The report of gene imprinting in mature seeds is novel and exciting, but there are several reasons to be cautious about the findings. a) The imprinted genes reported are almost completely different from known imprinted genes. b) There is little overlap between genes imprinted in dormant and non-dormant seeds. c) The imprinting phenomenon is transient. d) Only one replicate for each cross was used. e) Some of the Sanger sequencing chromatograms used for validation are inconsistent. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ABCG30 in non-dormant seeds seems mono-allelic and VIM5 in non-dormant seeds seems bi-allelic, unlike stated. This kind of inconsistency is also observed in several cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. f) The p-value used to call imprinted genes (0.05) is quite permissive, and likely led to inclusion of false positives. g) The RNA-seq results are not always consistent between reciprocal crosses. For example, CP1 has 5683 maternal vs. 17 paternal reads in Col x Cvi, but only 56 maternal vs. 10 paternal reads in Cvi x Col. h) Only MEGs specific for the dormant dataset were tested by Sanger sequencing.</p><p>For these reasons, it is imperative that the imprinting results are thoroughly verified using a robust, quantitative technique. We suggest RT-PCR of multiple genes from both the dormant and non-dormant datasets, using RNA samples different from those used for RNA-seq, followed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (many PCR products can be multiplexed in one lane). Furthermore, we think it is important to verify parent-of-origin specific expression in mature endosperm using a reporter construct. Because creating a new reporter construct would take a long time, we suggest using the published FWA:GFP reporter.</p><p>In addition to new experiments, please provide more information about the analysis of imprinted genes. Specifically, please include in a supplementary table parent-of-origin RNA-seq counts for all genes, not just those deemed significantly imprinted, and please state in the text whether most genes conform to the expected 2:1 maternal/paternal ratio. Also, please explain in more detail in the methods section how imprinted genes were called, particularly how information from the reciprocal crosses was used.</p><p>2) A direct functional link between imprinted expression and dormancy.</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that the paper presents evidence for a link between imprinting and dormancy, but not direct evidence that imprinted genes regulate dormancy. The paper shows that maternal control of dormancy cannot be explained by the predominance of maternal genetic material in the endosperm, but this is not proof that imprinted expression controls dormancy. Signals from the maternal seed coat could influence the state of the endosperm, so that even after the seed coat degenerates, how endosperm regulates dormancy may be governed by earlier seed coat signals. Correlation of imprinted gene expression with dormancy can run in either direction: gene expression may influence dormancy, or dormancy can influence gene expression. The gene that was examined in detail, CP1, fits the latter pattern. The effects of the <italic>aln</italic> mutation were not tested in F1 seeds derived from reciprocal crosses with wild-type, so it remains unclear whether maternal expression of ALN regulates dormancy. Therefore, the title of the paper presently does not accurately reflect the reported findings.</p><p>We feel the best way to remedy this would be to show that maternal expression of ALN (or another gene, such as KAI2) regulates dormancy. Depending on the results of these experiments, the paper's conclusions may need to be adjusted to reflect a link with dormancy instead of a causative relationship.</p><p>3) Quantification of cruciferin (CRU) proteins.</p><p>There is concern that the quantification of CRU proteins reported in this paper may not be reliable. First, the loading control for the CRU assays may be inadequate. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> another protein band is used as a loading control, but when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this band varies greatly between samples. This raises the question of whether there is indeed a depletion of the putative CRUs during dormancy break, or if the low band intensity is due to less total protein being loaded on the gel. Second, reliance on coomassie-stained gels, instead of Western blots, to determine CRU levels may lead to inaccurate CRU quantification. To address these concerns, please include an adequate loading control, and either utilize Western blots or explain why coomassie staining is a reliable method.</p><p>4) Manuscript readability.</p><p>During initial editorial assessment of the manuscript and peer review, a common concern was that the writing presents difficulties even for experts, with descriptions like &quot;circular&quot;, &quot;turgid&quot; and &quot;repetitive&quot;. Please do your best to improve the logical flow and accessibility of the paper, keeping in mind the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. To assist you, we are enclosing the original reviews below, which include many suggestions for manuscript improvement.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper reports a transient imprinting phenomenon in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> endosperm that appears to involve a different set of genes from those identified in earlier development. This imprinting phenomenon doesn't obviously fit the established mechanisms, where most MEGs are directly activated by DNA demethylation (which shouldn't be transient), and PcG regulation mostly occurs at PEGs. The authors show that the expression of many of these genes correlates with dormancy, and show that maternal expression of the protease CP1 regulates the levels of cruciferin storage proteins.</p><p>Overall, I think this is an interesting manuscript that makes two important contributions: the discovery of a new set of imprinted genes, and the strong implication that some of these genes are involved in seed dormancy – a function that doesn't easily fit the predominant parental conflict hypothesis. Considering how little we know about the functions of plant imprinted genes, this paper presents important progress.</p><p>This said, this manuscript has substantial weaknesses. The greatest is the absence of unambiguous evidence that imprinting regulates dormancy. The authors show that maternal control of dormancy cannot be explained by the predominance of maternal genetic material in the endosperm, but this is not proof that imprinted expression controls dormancy. Signals from the maternal seed coat could influence the state of the endosperm, so that even after the seed coat degenerates, how endosperm regulates dormancy may be governed by earlier seed coat signals. Correlation of imprinted gene expression with dormancy can run in either direction: gene expression may influence dormancy, or dormancy can influence gene expression. The gene that the authors chose to examine in detail, CP1, fits the latter patterns. The authors state that several of the imprinted genes are known regulators of dormancy – why didn't they test whether maternal expression in the endosperm of one or more of these is important for dormancy? I think this would be the single most important addition to the paper, which would clearly establish that imprinted expression of a particular gene or genes regulates dormancy.</p><p>The other major weakness, related to the above, is that the manuscript makes for a difficult read. The text is frequently dense, circuitous and repetitive, and the logical thread from dormancy to CP1 is hard to follow.</p><p>A smaller issue is the lack of any mechanistic insight into how the newly identified genes are imprinted. This is probably beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the authors could at least check if the new imprinted genes are enriched in DME-catalyzed DMRs or PcG targets (as measured by H3K27me3).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this work, Piskurewicz et al. report that maternal regulation of seed dormancy in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may be caused by the differential expression of maternal and paternal alleles in the endosperm (imprinted genes). This finding is novel and exciting; however, I have several concerns that require to be addressed to fully support this major claim.</p><p>1) One major concern with this work is the lack of details for the analysis of imprinted genes. Apparently no replicates have been generated, limiting the value of the analysis. It is also not clear how many genes follow the expected ratio of two maternal to one paternal and how many deviate. Furthermore, how many genes are commonly imprinted in reciprocal crosses and how many are not? The data provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 6</xref> do not allow to extract this information, partly because the labelling of the columns is incomplete, partly because only selected genes are shown.</p><p>2) To provide convincing proof that genes are specifically maternally expressed in the endosperm after imbibition, reporter genes should be tested. There are published reporters for e.g. FWA that could be used for this analysis.</p><p>3) The authors do not provide genetic evidence that the identified imprinted genes have a role in seed dormancy. Even if there is indeed a cluster of MEGs whose expression correlates with the dormancy status of different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions (and their hybrids), it is not possible to distinguish what is cause and consequence. It is possible that those genes are expressed because dormancy was broken rather than their expression being the cause for the break in dormancy. For instance, the authors propose that the differential expression of CP1, a MEG, may be involved in dormancy due to its potential role in protein storage decay. However, <italic>cp1</italic> mutant seeds do not seem to have different dormancy levels compared to WT. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the expression of certain MEGs and dormancy levels, there is no evidence in this work for a functional link between the two.</p><p>4) I also have major concerns regarding the analysis of cruciferin (CRU) levels in this manuscript. Unlike stated by the authors, Barthole et al. (2014) do not rely on coomassie-stained gels to determine CRU levels, but instead make use of anti-CRU antibodies in a Western-blot. This raises the question of how can the authors in this manuscript distinguish CRUs from other abundant proteins? Furthermore, there is no adequate loading control for the assays. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the authors make use of another protein band for loading control, but when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this band varies greatly between samples. This raises the question of whether there is indeed a depletion of the putative CRUs during dormancy break, or if the low band intensity is due to less total protein being loaded on the gel. In my view, these two points raise major questions on whether the CRU-related data is reliable.</p><p>5) The chromatograms for the Sanger sequencing are sometimes dubious. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ABCG30 in non-dormant seeds seems mono-allelic and VIM5 in non-dormant seeds seems bi-allelic, unlike stated. This kind of inconsistency is also observed in several cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>6) Why were only MEGs specific for the dormant dataset tested by Sanger sequencing?</p><p>7) The effect of <italic>aln</italic> on dormancy should be tested in F1 seeds derived from reciprocal crosses with wild-type to test whether the mutant phenotype has a maternal origin.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Recently harvested seeds are often dormant and fail to germinate when they are imbibed. It is well-known that the maternal parent plays a major role in establishing dormancy, and that mature endosperm, a single layer of cells between the embryo and maternal testa cell layers, is essential for dormancy. Different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions display different levels of seed dormancy. C24 has low dormancy and Cvi has high dormancy, and the differences are quite dramatic. After a short 5-day after-ripening period, neither C24 or Cvi seeds germinate after 72 hrs imbibition. After an intermediate after-ripening period (25 days), full germination of C24 occurs, while almost no Cvi seeds germinate. Both C24 seeds and Cvi seeds after a long after-ripening period (6 months). The authors used these dormancy differences between C24 and Cvi to show that:</p><p>The maternal parent determines the level of seed dormancy. That is, F1 seed from C24xCvi have low seed dormancy to C24, and F1 seed from CvixC24 have high seed dormancy equivalent to Cvi.</p><p>The maternal bias is not due to the endosperm's 2:1 ratio of maternal:paternal chromosomes. That is F1 progeny C24xCvitetraploid and CvixC24tetraploid had similar levels of dormancy as F1 progeny between diploid parents.</p><p>These results motivated them to determine whether gene imprinting might underlie the maternal inheritance of seed dormancy.</p><p>Comment. Throughout the manuscript, the authors use the word &quot;gene imprinting&quot;. However, the issue of whether a gene imprint exists that distinguish maternal versus paternal alleles is never addressed. Therefore, although it is OK to use the phrase gene imprinting, I think the phrase parent-of-origin gene expression should also be incorporated into the paper.</p><p>The authors convincingly show that the seed coat (endosperm + testa) can be used to isolate endosperm RNA that will be used to identify parent-of-origin gene expression in the endosperm because the testa contributes little mRNA.</p><p>For the high-throughput RNA-seq experiments, the authors replaced C24 with Col, which is considered to be a low dormancy accession. Following a short after-ripening period of 10 days, 40% of ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated whereas only 1% of CvixCol F1 seeds germinated. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When intermediately after-ripened for 20 days, about 80% of ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated whereas only 10% of CvixCol F1 seeds germinated.</p><p>Comment. In the Material and Methods section –, the authors state, &quot;ColxCvi and CvixCol seeds were harvested the same day and after-ripened for 10 days (dormant seeds) or for 2 months (non-dormant seeds). Total RNA samples were isolated from seed coats (n=200) dissected 36 hours after seed imbibition.&quot;</p><p>This sentence should be moved into the body of the text because it clearly defines what is meant by &quot;dormant seeds&quot; and &quot;non-dormant&quot; seeds, terminology that is first used in subsection “Dormancy-specific genomic imprinting in the endosperm” paragraph seven for &quot;dormant&quot; CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds, and &quot;non dormant&quot; CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds.</p><p>It should be noted that after 10 days of ripening, 40% of the ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated and 60% did not, so they are a mixture of approximately equal numbers of dormant and non-dormant seeds. Perhaps the authors could explain why this time point was chosen.</p><p>Although it is likely that at 2 months all ColxCvi and CvixCol F1 seeds are non-dormant, the authors never show data supporting this, and only present the 6-month after-ripening data (see above).</p><p>The authors identified candidate imprinted genes by high-throughput sequencing RNA from F1 hybrid seeds; using SNPs to distinguish parent-of-origin expression.</p><p>They identified 67 MEGs/4 PEGs in dormant seed coat (endosperm) and 49 MEGs/8 PEGs for non-dormant seed coat (endosperm). Only 14 MEGs were present in both dormant and non-dormant seed coat. Only 5 MEGs and 3 PEGs have been previously identified in studies using seeds at earlier stages of development.</p><p>9 of the MEGs were selected for further analysis. Sanger sequencing experiments using F1 seed from reciprocally crossed parents was used to verify parent-of-origin expression. Interestingly, the parent-of-origin specific expression was dynamic – with many showing parent-of-origin expression at the dormant stage (10-day after-ripening) and biallelic expression at the non-dormant stage (2-month after-ripening).</p><p>As shown in Table 3, many of the dormancy-specific MEGs likely play roles in regulating dormancy/germination. The authors focused on the function of two particularly interesting MEGS – ALN and CP1.</p><p>ALN. As described in Watanabe et al. (2014, Plant Cell Environment, 37:1022) the purine metabolite, allantoin, promotes abscisic acid (ABA) production by activating transcription of a key enzyme for ABA biosynthesis, and by a post-translational activation mechanism. ABA is a major plant hormone that promotes dormancy. The ALN gene encodes allantoin amidohydrolase, which, according to Werner et al. (Plant Physiol 2008, 146:418) degrades allantoin. Consistent with this, <italic>aln</italic> loss-of-function mutations result in increased allantoin production, and increased ABA production.</p><p>Comment. I believe that the function of the ALN gene can be more clearly described in the manuscript. Also, only the Watanabe reference is cited, but it is not included in the references.</p><p>Importantly, the authors show that the <italic>aln</italic> mutant displays high dormancy relative to wild-type seeds. Thus, the ALN MEG gene is a positive regulator of dormancy.</p><p>The authors next raise the issue whether there is an ecotype bias for expression of the MEGs.</p><p>Comment. Analysis of expression after reciprocal crosses seemed to point to expression of alleles being controlled by their parent-of-origin, not by their respective ecotypes. So, it seemed that the issue of ecotype bias was already ruled out for gene imprinting.</p><p>However, the authors investigated ecotype-biased expression by assessing whether dormancy-specific MEG expression correlates with dormancy levels imposed by a given ecotype. They show that somewhat less than half (23 out of 53) had expression levels that negatively correlate with seed dormancy levels. That is, lower expression is correlated with higher dormancy.</p><p>Comment. I believe that the authors are not addressing an ecotype effect that affects the silencing of the paternal allele (gene imprinting). Rather, their clustering results point to a group of genes that conform to the ALN gene model, where lower maternal expression results in higher dormancy (see above).</p><p>CP1.</p><p>The CP1 gene encodes cysteine protease1, which promotes storage protein decay. CP1 expression is activated upon imbibition, resulting in release of amino acids from storage proteins to be used by the young seedling. CP1 is a MEG whose expression level increases with after-ripening time, but the level of CP1 expression is lower in Cvi (high dormancy) than in Col (high dormancy). Thus, CP1 expression, like ANL and the gene cluster (see above) is negatively correlated with dormancy.</p><p>The authors go on to show that the CP1 allele inherited from the maternal parent, and more specifically, the CP1 allele inherited from the maternal gametophyte, promotes decay of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seed storage proteins, cruciferins (CRU).</p><p>Finally, expression of CP1, like ANL, becomes biallelic as ripening time passes. Thus, the parent-of-origin expression is dynamic.</p><p>Discussion.</p><p>The authors state, &quot;Concerning the MEGs and PEGs identified in non-dormant seeds it seems likely that their monoallelic transcription takes place upon seed imbibition, since they were not identified in dormant seeds. It appears therefore that a dedicated developmental program of genomic imprinting is operating in mature seeds upon imbibition.&quot;</p><p>Comment. Have the authors determined that the monoallelic expression occurs during the 36 hr imbibition period? Has an expression time course been carried out? Is it possible that expression occurs late in seed development before seed dessication occurs?</p><p>Summary. The authors have discovered a new cluster of novel imprinted genes that provide significant insights into the mechanisms that regulate an important biological process – the maternal control of seed dormancy. Their data justify the conclusions made in the manuscript. It is likely that further investigation of their parent-of-origin expression will yield novel mechanisms that regulate plant gene imprinting. I recommend that this paper be published in <italic>eLife</italic> after the authors respond to comments and thoroughly rewrite the paper to improve its clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Firstly I think this is a very interesting study and important because it suggests an actual role for imprinting, which is very welcome, and it shows for the first time that imprinting persists into maturity, and that imprinting is dynamic with respect to dormancy state and environmental temperature during seed maturation. The authors clearly rule out any contamination by maternal tissues of the testa which in any case is well known to be dead at maturity.</p><p>My main concern with the current narrative is that imprinted genes contain important germination regulators, notably KAI2, but frustratingly none of these are investigated in any detail such that it is shown that imprinting of these genes affects dormancy in any way. So although the manuscript makes claims about a role of imprinting in dormancy control, these remain hypothetical in my view although it is an interesting possibility. There is therefore no clear relationship between the data gathered that shows that dormancy control is maternal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and the action of any imprinted genes, and this creates a somewhat confusing narrative. Thus although it was shown that dormancy state affects imprinting, it is not clear that imprinting affects dormancy, and the author has not satisfactorily ruled out that the maternal tissues are affecting dormancy state in CVI x C24 or CVI x Col crosses, which they are well known to do (Debeaujon et al., 2001). In fact <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> could be removed from the paper without detracting from the study. Proving a role for imprinting in dormancy control could be achieved using kai2 mutants in crosses for instance, but would be a substantial amount of further work.</p><p>The opposite is true for storage protein breakdown, where an effect of the maternal allele is clearly shown with very nice data. So there is a part of the study which is really well supported and where imprinting is clearly shown to affect the physiology of germinating seeds.

For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ABCG30 in non-dormant seeds seems mono-allelic and VIM5 in non-dormant seeds seems bi-allelic, unlike stated.</italic></p><p>The term “mono-allelic”, which we used only a few times in the first version of the manuscript, no longer appears. We much prefer the term “preferential maternal/paternal allele expression”, which is now used throughout the text. Indeed, strict monoallelic expression is actually a rare phenomenon (e.g. discussed in Mary Gehring, 2013, Annual Rev. Genet (47:187-208). We define preferential maternal, respectively paternal, allele expression when more than 80%, respectively 60%, of the reads come from the maternal, respectively paternal, alleles.</p><p>For ABCG30 the two traces overlap, giving the impression that it is monoallelic. For VIM5, you are probably referring to the “ColxCvi dormant” and “CvixCol non dormant” cases. The yellow trace in the “ColxCvi dormant” case is the maternal allele and its height is consistent with the notion that it represents a minor contribution. Similarly the blue trace in the “CvixCol non dormant” is the maternal allele and also a minor contribution. The VIM5 gene, as well as the ABCG30 (together with other genes) have been reamplified from independent endosperm samples and analyzed by MiSeq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 2—source data 7</xref>). They confirm ABCG30’s dormancy-specific preferential maternal allele expression and VIM5’s preferential paternal allele expression.</p><p><italic>This kind of inconsistency is also observed in several cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</italic></p><p>Please note that by definition only genes maintaining preferential maternal (or paternal) allele expression in both reciprocal crosses are considered to be imprinted. If a gene loses preferential parental allele expression in one of the F1 seeds then we do not consider that it is imprinting (e.g. in the case of SOT12 (At2g03760) we did not observe preferential maternal expression in non-dormant CvixCol F1 seeds).</p><p>All the genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> are now analyzed by MiSeq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 2—source data 7</xref>).</p><p> <italic>f) The p-value used to call imprinted genes (0.05) is quite permissive, and likely led to inclusion of false positives.</italic></p><p>We have confirmed imprinting in independent experiments using MiSeq.</p><p><italic>g) The RNA-seq results are not always consistent between reciprocal crosses. For example, CP1 has 5683 maternal vs. 17 paternal reads in Col x Cvi, but only 56 maternal vs. 10 paternal reads in Cvi x Col.</italic></p><p>We observed that many of the imprinted genes found in dormant seeds happen to have their expression negatively correlating with seed dormancy levels (e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and, for CP1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The differences that you point out are further consistent with this notion: CvixCol F1 seeds, which tend to display dormancy levels more akin to the maternal ecotype Cvi, are more dormant than ColxCvi F1 seeds and express lower maternal allele CP1 expression levels.</p><p><italic>h) Only MEGs specific for the dormant dataset were tested by Sanger sequencing.</italic></p><p>We have now included the non-dormant class in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>For these reasons, it is imperative that the imprinting results are thoroughly verified using a robust, quantitative technique. We suggest RT-PCR of multiple genes from both the dormant and non-dormant datasets, using RNA samples different from those used for RNA-seq, followed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (many PCR products can be multiplexed in one lane).</italic></p><p>This is now done in the revised version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). A total of 19 genes are further studied: 10 dormant-specific MEGs, 5 non-dormant specific MEGs, 2 MEGs found in dormant and non-dormant datasets and 2 PEGs.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, we think it is important to verify parent-of-origin specific expression in mature endosperm using a reporter construct.

For some unknown reason Drs D. Susai and T.

Signals from the maternal seed coat could influence the state of the endosperm, so that even after the seed coat degenerates, how endosperm regulates dormancy may be governed by earlier seed coat signals. Correlation of imprinted gene expression with dormancy can run in either direction: gene expression may influence dormancy, or dormancy can influence gene expression. The gene that was examined in detail, CP1, fits the latter pattern. The effects of the aln mutation were not tested in F1 seeds derived from reciprocal crosses with wild-type, so it remains unclear whether maternal expression of ALN regulates dormancy.

This raises the question of whether there is indeed a depletion of the putative CRUs during dormancy break, or if the low band intensity is due to less total protein being loaded on the gel. Second, reliance on coomassie-stained gels, instead of Western blots, to determine CRU levels may lead to inaccurate CRU quantification. To address these concerns, please include an adequate loading control, and either utilize Western blots or explain why coomassie staining is a reliable method.</italic></p><p>We have repeated all the experiments using new and independent seed material and a specific CRU antibody in Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For the loading control with use a non-specific band whose intensity remains constant under all developmental and temporal conditions. The new results confirm our previous observations. We have kept the coomassie gel data as a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Manuscript readability.</italic></p><p><italic>During initial editorial assessment of the manuscript and peer review, a common concern was that the writing presents difficulties even for experts, with descriptions like &quot;circular&quot;, &quot;turgid&quot; and &quot;repetitive&quot;. Please do your best to improve the logical flow and accessibility of the paper, keeping in mind the broad readership of eLife. To assist you, we are enclosing the original reviews below, which include many suggestions for manuscript improvement.</italic></p><p>We are sorry about the bad readability. We have done our best to make it more readable. The Introduction has been rewritten and the Results sections simplified. Of course, we have taken into account the reviewers’ suggestions. We hope you will find that the manuscript is now more readable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…]This said, this manuscript has substantial weaknesses. The greatest is the absence of unambiguous evidence that imprinting regulates dormancy. The authors show that maternal control of dormancy cannot be explained by the predominance of maternal genetic material in the endosperm, but this is not proof that imprinted expression controls dormancy. Signals from the maternal seed coat could influence the state of the endosperm, so that even after the seed coat degenerates, how endosperm regulates dormancy may be governed by earlier seed coat signals. Correlation of imprinted gene expression with dormancy can run in either direction: gene expression may influence dormancy, or dormancy can influence gene expression. The gene that the authors chose to examine in detail, CP1, fits the latter patterns. The authors state that several of the imprinted genes are known regulators of dormancy – why didn't they test whether maternal expression in the endosperm of one or more of these is important for dormancy? I think this would be the single most important addition to the paper, which would clearly establish that imprinted expression of a particular gene or genes regulates dormancy.</italic></p><p>If by dormancy you only mean “lack of germination” then yes, the first version of our manuscript does not provide unambiguous evidence that imprinting regulates dormancy. However, “germination” is only one of many developmental aspects that characterize dormant seeds. One of the aspects is how CRU protein levels are downregulated according to dormancy levels. The <italic>cp1</italic> mutants can be seen as more “dormant” in what concerns their CRU abundance upon imbibition. The reason we focused on <italic>CP1</italic> is because its (imprinted) expression is remarkably specific to the mature endosperm in imbibed dormant seeds. We reasoned that this would give us the best opportunity to detect parent-of-origin effects and indeed gamete-of-origin effects in CRU protein abundance.</p><p>In any case we completely agree with you that it would be preferable to also show that imprinted gene expression of a regulator of gene dormancy can also have consequences for germination. We are now including similar experiments for the case of <italic>ALN</italic>, which further support the view that imprinting regulates dormancy. This time the readout is germination percentage rather than CRU abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>The other major weakness, related to the above, is that the manuscript makes for a difficult read. The text is frequently dense, circuitous and repetitive, and the logical thread from dormancy to CP1 is hard to follow.</italic></p><p>We hope you will find the new version more readable (see also our comments to the editor and the other reviewers who made a similar critique).</p><p><italic>A smaller issue is the lack of any mechanistic insight into how the newly identified genes are imprinted. This is probably beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the authors could at least check if the new imprinted genes are enriched in DME-catalyzed DMRs or PcG targets (as measured by H3K27me3).</italic></p><p>We are fully aware that the work leaves aside the mechanistic aspects of the observed imprinting. We are working on this issue and we plan to report about our findings in a future manuscript. We think that mechanistic aspects are beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>In this work, Piskurewicz et al. report that maternal regulation of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis may be caused by the differential expression of maternal and paternal alleles in the endosperm (imprinted genes). This finding is novel and exciting; however, I have several concerns that require to be addressed to fully support this major claim.</italic></p><p><italic>1) One major concern with this work is the lack of details for the analysis of imprinted genes. Apparently no replicates have been generated, limiting the value of the analysis. It is also not clear how many genes follow the expected ratio of two maternal to one paternal and how many deviate. Furthermore, how many genes are commonly imprinted in reciprocal crosses and how many are not? The data provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 6</xref> do not allow to extract this information, partly because the labelling of the columns is incomplete, partly because only selected genes are shown.</italic></p><p>We would rather not discuss the genes that appear to have preferential parental allele expression in only one of the two reciprocal crosses. Indeed, in these cases we do know whether these genes are imprinted or whether they correspond to a gene with an accession expression bias. Nevertheless, these genes are now accessible in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 6</xref>.</p><p>Other issues are addressed in the new version of the manuscript:</p><p>a) RT-PCR products of candidate MEGs and PEGs (dormant and non-dormant case) were performed using independent endosperm material</p><p>b) We include a new figure showing that most genes conform to the expected 2:1 maternal/paternal ratio.</p><p>c) The labeling of the column was completed</p><p>d) The material and method section was improved.</p><p><italic>2) To provide convincing proof that genes are specifically maternally expressed in the endosperm after imbibition, reporter genes should be tested. There are published reporters for e.g. FWA that could be used for this analysis.</italic></p><p>This experiment is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The authors do not provide genetic evidence that the identified imprinted genes have a role in seed dormancy. Even if there is indeed a cluster of MEGs whose expression correlates with the dormancy status of different Arabidopsis accessions (and their hybrids), it is not possible to distinguish what is cause and consequence. It is possible that those genes are expressed because dormancy was broken rather than their expression being the cause for the break in dormancy. For instance, the authors propose that the differential expression of CP1, a MEG, may be involved in dormancy due to its potential role in protein storage decay. However, cp1 mutant seeds do not seem to have different dormancy levels compared to WT. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the expression of certain MEGs and dormancy levels, there is no evidence in this work for a functional link between the two.</italic></p><p>Please also see our comments to reviewer #1. <italic>cp1</italic> mutants are “more dormant” from the perspective of CRU protein abundance since they retain higher CRU abundance over time upon seed imbibition relative to WT. If by dormancy you only mean “lack of germination” then we agree with you. However, we tend to view absence of germination as only a particular aspect of dormancy (as stated in the Introduction).</p><p>In any case, we have now included a study, similar to the one performed for <italic>CP1</italic>, describing the case of <italic>ALN</italic>, which negatively regulates dormancy from the aspect of germination.</p><p><italic>4) I also have major concerns regarding the analysis of cruciferin (CRU) levels in this manuscript. Unlike stated by the authors, Barthole et al. (2014) do not rely on coomassie-stained gels to determine CRU levels, but instead make use of anti-CRU antibodies in a Western-blot. This raises the question of how can the authors in this manuscript distinguish CRUs from other abundant proteins? Furthermore, there is no adequate loading control for the assays. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the authors make use of another protein band for loading control, but when looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, this band varies greatly between samples. This raises the question of whether there is indeed a depletion of the putative CRUs during dormancy break, or if the low band intensity is due to less total protein being loaded on the gel. In my view, these two points raise major questions on whether the CRU-related data is reliable.</italic></p><p>We have repeated these experiments using new seed material and a specific antibody. See also our comments to the editor. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The chromatograms for the Sanger sequencing are sometimes dubious. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ABCG30 in non-dormant seeds seems mono-allelic and VIM5 in non-dormant seeds seems bi-allelic, unlike stated. This kind of inconsistency is also observed in several cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</italic></p><p>Please see our comments to the editor.</p><p><italic>6) Why were only MEGs specific for the dormant dataset tested by Sanger sequencing?</italic></p><p>This is due to our particular interest in seed dormancy. We now include more data for the non-dormant dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) The effect of aln on dormancy should be tested in F1 seeds derived from reciprocal crosses with wild-type to test whether the mutant phenotype has a maternal origin.</italic></p><p>We performed these experiments and we do indeed detect maternal effects. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>Recently harvested seeds are often dormant and fail to germinate when they are imbibed. It is well-known that the maternal parent plays a major role in establishing dormancy, and that mature endosperm, a single layer of cells between the embryo and maternal testa cell layers, is essential for dormancy. Different Arabidopsis accessions display different levels of seed dormancy. C24 has low dormancy and Cvi has high dormancy, and the differences are quite dramatic. After a short 5-day after-ripening period, neither C24 or Cvi seeds germinate after 72 hrs imbibition. After an intermediate after-ripening period (25 days), full germination of C24 occurs, while almost no Cvi seeds germinate. Both C24 seeds and Cvi seeds after a long after-ripening period (6 months). The authors used these dormancy differences between C24 and Cvi to show that:</italic></p><p><italic>The maternal parent determines the level of seed dormancy. That is, F1 seed from C24xCvi have low seed dormancy to C24, and F1 seed from CvixC24 have high seed dormancy equivalent to Cvi.</italic></p><p><italic>The maternal bias is not due to the endosperm's 2:1 ratio of maternal:paternal chromosomes. That is F1 progeny C24xCvitetraploid and CvixC24tetraploid had similar levels of dormancy as F1 progeny between diploid parents.</italic></p><p><italic>These results motivated them to determine whether gene imprinting might underlie the maternal inheritance of seed dormancy.</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. Throughout the manuscript, the authors use the word &quot;gene imprinting&quot;. However, the issue of whether a gene imprint exists that distinguish maternal versus paternal alleles is never addressed. Therefore, although it is OK to use the phrase gene imprinting, I think the phrase parent-of-origin gene expression should also be incorporated into the paper.</italic></p><p>OK, we introduced this phrase in the Introduction as follows:</p><p>“Imprinting gene expression, also called genomic imprinting, is the preferential expression of a given parental allele over the other. Such parent-of-origin gene expression is observed in both mammals and flowering plants, which share the habit of nourishing the embryo through a sexually derived tissue (Pires and Groniklaus, 2014).”</p><p><italic>The authors convincingly show that the seed coat (endosperm + testa) can be used to isolate endosperm RNA that will be used to identify parent-of-origin gene expression in the endosperm because the testa contributes little mRNA.</italic></p><p><italic>For the high-throughput RNA-seq experiments, the authors replaced C24 with Col, which is considered to be a low dormancy accession. Following a short after-ripening period of 10 days, 40% of ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated whereas only 1% of CvixCol F1 seeds germinated. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When intermediately after-ripened for 20 days, about 80% of ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated whereas only 10% of CvixCol F1 seeds germinated.</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. In the Material and Methods section, the authors state, &quot;ColxCvi and CvixCol seeds were harvested the same day and after-ripened for 10 days (dormant seeds) or for 2 months (non-dormant seeds). Total RNA samples were isolated from seed coats (n=200) dissected 36 hours after seed imbibition.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>This sentence should be moved into the body of the text because it clearly defines what is meant by &quot;dormant seeds&quot; and &quot;non-dormant&quot; seeds, terminology that is first used in subsection “Dormancy-specific genomic imprinting in the endosperm” paragraph seven for &quot;dormant&quot; CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds, and &quot;non dormant&quot; CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds.</italic></p><p>In the first submitted version of the manuscript we referred to the dormancy of CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds slightly earlier (“RNA was extracted from seed coats dissected from dormant and non-dormant CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds 36h upon seed imbibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).”).</p><p>However, we agree with you that it is helpful to better define in the main text how we generated this seed material. In the second submitted version of the text we write: “<italic>ColxCvi and CvixCol seeds were harvested the same day and after-ripened for 10 days (dormant seeds) or for 2 months (non-dormant seeds). Total RNA samples were extracted from the endosperm (n=200) of dormant and non-dormant CvixCol and ColxCvi F1 seeds 36h upon seed imbibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</italic>”</p><p><italic>It should be noted that after 10 days of ripening, 40% of the ColxCvi F1 seeds germinated and 60% did not, so they are a mixture of approximately equal numbers of dormant and non-dormant seeds. Perhaps the authors could explain why this time point was chosen.</italic></p><p>Please note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, germination is scored at 72h. In reality all seeds are still dormant as they did not germinate at earlier time points (36 hours). Overall this seed population is still more dormant than Col.</p><p>Furthermore, we knew from previous experiments that certain genes regulating dormancy are not detectable in freshly harvested seeds (no after-ripening) relative to more after-ripened seeds (e.g. as in the case of <italic>CP1</italic>). We therefore reasoned that by choosing a substantial amount of after-ripening time that is partially breaking dormancy we would have a higher chance to identify imprinted dormancy genes.</p><p><italic>Although it is likely that at 2 months all ColxCvi and CvixCol F1 seeds are non-dormant, the authors never show data supporting this, and only present the 6-month after-ripening data (see above).</italic></p><p>The reason we show 6 months of after-ripening in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is because that is what is needed in order to break Cvi dormancy. Indeed, the ColxCvi and CvixCol F1 seeds are no longer dormant after 2 months.</p><p><italic>The authors identified candidate imprinted genes by high-throughput sequencing RNA from F1 hybrid seeds; using SNPs to distinguish parent-of-origin expression.</italic></p><p><italic>They identified 67 MEGs/4 PEGs in dormant seed coat (endosperm) and 49 MEGs/8 PEGs for non-dormant seed coat (endosperm). Only 14 MEGs were present in both dormant and non-dormant seed coat. Only 5 MEGs and 3 PEGs have been previously identified in studies using seeds at earlier stages of development.</italic></p><p><italic>9 of the MEGs were selected for further analysis. Sanger sequencing experiments using F1 seed from reciprocally crossed parents was used to verify parent-of-origin expression. Interestingly, the parent-of-origin specific expression was dynamic – with many showing parent-of-origin expression at the dormant stage (10-day after-ripening) and biallelic expression at the non-dormant stage (2-month after-ripening).</italic></p><p><italic>As shown in Table 3, many of the dormancy-specific MEGs likely play roles in regulating dormancy/germination. The authors focused on the function of two particularly interesting MEGS – ALN and CP1.</italic></p><p><italic>ALN. As described in Watanabe et al. (2014, Plant Cell Environment, 37:1022) the purine metabolite, allantoin, promotes abscisic acid (ABA) production by activating transcription of a key enzyme for ABA biosynthesis, and by a post-translational activation mechanism. ABA is a major plant hormone that promotes dormancy. The ALN gene encodes allantoin amidohydrolase, which, according to Werner et al. (Plant Physiol 2008, 146:418) degrades allantoin. Consistent with this, aln loss-of-function mutations result in increased allantoin production, and increased ABA production.</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. I believe that the function of the ALN gene can be more clearly described in the manuscript. Also, only the Watanabe reference is cited, but it is not included in the references.</italic></p><p>We have now included more information about Allantoinase by describing its house-keeping role in the purine degradation pathway as well as its emerging role in the plant’s responses to stress. In this context ALN was shown to regulate ABA synthesis by Watanabe et al. 2014. This reference is now included in the list of references. Thank you.</p><p><italic>Importantly, the authors show that the aln mutant displays high dormancy relative to wild-type seeds. Thus, the ALN MEG gene is a positive regulator of dormancy.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors next raise the issue whether there is an ecotype bias for expression of the MEGs.</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. Analysis of expression after reciprocal crosses seemed to point to expression of alleles being controlled by their parent-of-origin, not by their respective ecotypes. So, it seemed that the issue of ecotype bias was already ruled out for gene imprinting.</italic></p><p><italic>However, the authors investigated ecotype-biased expression by assessing whether dormancy-specific MEG expression correlates with dormancy levels imposed by a given ecotype. They show that somewhat less than half (23 out of 53) had expression levels that negatively correlate with seed dormancy levels. That is, lower expression is correlated with higher dormancy.</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. I believe that the authors are not addressing an ecotype effect that affects the silencing of the paternal allele (gene imprinting). Rather, their clustering results point to a group of genes that conform to the ALN gene model, where lower maternal expression results in higher dormancy (see above).</italic></p><p>We are not sure we understand your comment. We think there are two things that need to be distinguished:</p><p>Firstly, imprinted genes are those whose preferential parental allele expression is observed in both sets of seeds arising from reciprocal crosses. Thus, the identification of an imprinted gene is independent of its expression levels (of course genes with too low expression are discarded for this analysis).</p><p>Secondly, one can next be interested by the expression of these genes according to environmental cues (e.g. cold) or ecotype. Our point is that a substantial fraction of dormancy-specific MEGs happens to have high expression in Col, which has low dormancy levels, and low expression in Cvi, which has high dormancy levels. Furthermore, cold, which increases dormancy in both ecotypes, diminishes expression in both cases. These observations suggested to us (our model) that the maternal allele regulates dormancy levels by imposing expression levels of dormancy genes that is characteristic of the maternal ecotype. These levels would be further regulated by temperature during seed development.</p><p><italic>CP1.</italic></p><p><italic>The CP1 gene encodes cysteine protease1, which promotes storage protein decay. CP1 expression is activated upon imbibition, resulting in release of amino acids from storage proteins to be used by the young seedling. CP1 is a MEG whose expression level increases with after-ripening time, but the level of CP1 expression is lower in Cvi (high dormancy) than in Col (high dormancy). Thus, CP1 expression, like ANL and the gene cluster (see above) is negatively correlated with dormancy.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors go on to show that the CP1 allele inherited from the maternal parent, and more specifically, the CP1 allele inherited from the maternal gametophyte, promotes decay of Arabidopsis seed storage proteins, cruciferins (CRU).</italic></p><p><italic>Finally, expression of CP1, like ANL, becomes biallelic as ripening time passes. Thus, the parent-of-origin expression is dynamic.</italic></p><p><italic>Discussion.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors state, &quot;Concerning the MEGs and PEGs identified in non-dormant seeds it seems likely that their monoallelic transcription takes place upon seed imbibition, since they were not identified in dormant seeds. It appears therefore that a dedicated developmental program of genomic imprinting is operating in mature seeds upon imbibition.&quot;</italic></p><p><italic>Comment. Have the authors determined that the monoallelic expression occurs during the 36 hr imbibition period? Has an expression time course been carried out? Is it possible that expression occurs late in seed development before seed dessication occurs?</italic></p><p>In the first version of the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>, now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>) we monitor <italic>CP1</italic> mRNA abundance over time upon seed imbibition (time points: 24h, 48h, 72h). The expression increases while remaining preferentially maternal. This strongly suggests that at least for the case of <italic>CP1</italic>, imprinted gene expression occurs de novo upon imbibition and therefore is not only a carry over from developing seeds.</p><p>We did not monitor <italic>CP1</italic> expression during seed development and we cannot rule out that <italic>CP1</italic> is expressed during seed development. However, when seeds are dormant, <italic>CP1</italic> expression is undetectable. This rules out that the detected <italic>CP1</italic> expression corresponds to that already present in dry dormant seeds.</p><p><italic>Summary. The authors have discovered a new cluster of novel imprinted genes that provide significant insights into the mechanisms that regulate an important biological process – the maternal control of seed dormancy. Their data justify the conclusions made in the manuscript. It is likely that further investigation of their parent-of-origin expression will yield novel mechanisms that regulate plant gene imprinting. I recommend that this paper be published in eLife after the authors respond to comments and thoroughly rewrite the paper to improve its clarity.</italic></p><p>We hope the new version is now more readable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>My main concern with the current narrative is that imprinted genes contain important germination regulators, notably KAI2, but frustratingly none of these are investigated in any detail such that it is shown that imprinting of these genes affects dormancy in any way. So although the manuscript makes claims about a role of imprinting in dormancy control, these remain hypothetical in my view although it is an interesting possibility. There is therefore no clear relationship between the data gathered that shows that dormancy control is maternal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and the action of any imprinted genes, and this creates a somewhat confusing narrative. Thus although it was shown that dormancy state affects imprinting, it is not clear that imprinting affects dormancy, and the author has not satisfactorily ruled out that the maternal tissues are affecting dormancy state in CVI x C24 or CVI x Col crosses, which they are well known to do (Debeaujon et al., 2001). In fact <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> could be removed from the paper without detracting from the study. Proving a role for imprinting in dormancy control could be achieved using kai2 mutants in crosses for instance, but would be a substantial amount of further work.</italic></p><p>We would like to keep <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> since it is the observation that initiated the study. We use this figure to explain the different scenarios that could explain our observations, which include gene dose effects, maternal tissue effects and imprinting.</p><p>A role for imprinting in dormancy was strongly suggested by our experiments with <italic>aln</italic> mutants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>The opposite is true for storage protein breakdown, where an effect of the maternal allele is clearly shown with very nice data. So there is a part of the study which is really well supported and where imprinting is clearly shown to affect the physiology of germinating seeds. This is a major advance in my view, but ideally should be uncoupled from the dormancy story which with further work could be elaborated into a second interesting manuscript.</italic></p><p>See our comments to the other reviewers above).</p></body></sub-article></article>
