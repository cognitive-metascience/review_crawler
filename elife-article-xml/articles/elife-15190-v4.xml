To better understand the cellular and molecular basis of the anti-inflammatory actions of apoA1, we explored the effect of acute human apoA1 exposure on the migratory capacity of monocyte-derived cells in vitro and in vivo. Acute (20–60 min) apoA1 treatment induced a substantial (50–90%) reduction in macrophage chemotaxis to a range of chemoattractants. This acute treatment was anti-inflammatory in vivo as shown by pre-treatment of monocytes prior to adoptive transfer into an on-going murine peritonitis model. We find that apoA1 rapidly disrupts membrane lipid rafts, and as a consequence, dampens the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway that coordinates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Our data strengthen the evidence base for therapeutic apoA1 infusions in situations where reduced monocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation could have beneficial outcomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15190.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15190.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A molecule called cholesterol is an important component of the membranes found in cells and is also used to make some hormones and other useful molecules. However, cholesterol can also contribute to the formation of plaques in arteries, which can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis, the cause of heart attacks. Particles called high density lipoproteins (HDL) carry cholesterol around the body in the bloodstream and are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties. A protein called apoA1 is a major component of HDL particles and, acting as part of a HDL particle or alone, it removes cholesterol from cells.</p><p>Atherosclerotic plaques form when white blood cells collect in places where the arteries are inflamed. The membranes that surround the white blood cells contain receptors that are able to detect inflammatory signals called chemokines. These receptors eventually communicate with the machinery needed for cell movement. This machinery is concentrated in parts of the membrane known as lipid rafts. Iqbal, Barrett et al. investigated whether apoA1 can block the movement of mouse and human white blood cells towards the chemokines produced during inflammation.</p><p>The experiments show that apoA1 treatment strongly inhibited the movement of white blood cells towards a range of chemokines in a culture dish. The apoA1 protein removes cholesterol from lipid rafts in the membrane of the white blood cell, which changes the properties of the membrane and decreases the activity of the machinery needed for cell movement. Further experiments in mice with inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen, produced similar findings. The next step following on from this work would be to investigate whether apoA1 treatment can reduce the accumulation of white blood cells in mice that act as models of other inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and atherosclerosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

signalling proteins that mediate leukocyte trafficking in immune homeostasis and play a non-redundant role in monocyte/macrophage recruitment in pre-clinical models of inflammation (<xref

Macrophage chemotaxis towards CC chemokines and other pathophysiological chemoattractants, such as N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF), complement component 5a (C5a) and chemerin, are mediated by G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled G protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Chemokine-mediated recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, in addition to retention and activation, are attractive areas for the development of novel anti-inflammatory agents that could find application in a wide range of chronic inflammatory pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asquith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schall and Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabas and Glass, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zernecke and Weber, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) is the major structural protein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and is widely recognized to have atheroprotective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). The cellular mechanisms that account for the observed anti-inflammatory effects of apoA1 and HDL, including those on innate immune cell activation, are incompletely understood. Postulated mechanisms include but are not limited to: (i) dependence on ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) A1, but independence of scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>); (ii) inhibition of NF-kB and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bursill et al., 2010</xref>); and (iii) increased Activator of Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) expression, which represses a subset of proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Nardo et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the bulk of studies that have shown anti-inflammatory effects of apoA1 or HDL involve relatively long-term treatment of macrophages in culture or chronic exposure in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diederich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bursill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansell et al., 2003</xref>). We thought it timely to focus on the acute effects of apoA1 treatment, in both in vitro and in vivo assays of monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis, a process of fundamental importance to the initiation and amplification of inflammation. We also explored the cellular mechanisms for anti-chemotactic effects and their dependence on cholesterol efflux.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute exposure to apoA1 significantly reduces murine macrophage chemotactic responses</title><p>Chronic treatment of human monocytes with HDL and apoA1 has been reported to reduce chemotaxis to fMLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diederich et al., 2001</xref>). In the current study, we wanted to test whether acute exposure to the human form of apoA1 (referred to throughout as simply apoA1) could alter monocyte-derived cell chemotaxis to CC chemokines and in the process, to look for the earliest signalling events following addition of apoA1. To address this question, we used a real-time chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iqbal et al., 2013</xref>). Biogel elicited murine macrophages (4 × 10<sup>5</sup>/well) were pre-treated with apoA1 (40 µg/ml; a standard amount used in cholesterol efflux studies, e.g.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorni et al., 2007</xref>) for 60 min at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and allowed to migrate towards 10 nM CCL2. The representative trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a clear reduction in chemotaxis towards CCL2 as quantified by slope and max-min analysis (67% reduction, p≤0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). A similar reduction in chemotaxis (71% reduction, p≤0.01) was observed in response to 10 nM CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). We also found that washing cells following acute exposure to apoA1 led to a similar impairment in migration as unwashed cells (data not shown). We extended our studies to show that this reduction in chemotaxis was seen with other, non-chemokine, chemoattractants: a 52% reduction in macrophage chemotaxis was observed in response to 10 nM C5a peptide (p≤0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), and a 80% reduction in chemotaxis to 10 nM chemerin, a potent chemoattractant of antigen presenting cells (p≤0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15190.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acute pre-treatment with apoA1 inhibits macrophage chemotaxis.</title><p>Biogel elicited macrophages were incubated with apoA1 (40 μg/ml) for 60 min before being added to the upper chamber (4 × 10<sup>5</sup>/well) of a CIM-16 plate and allowed to migrate for 7–8 hr toward 10 nM CCL2, CCL5, or C5a.

Biogel elicited macrophages were treated for 60 min with apoA1 (40 µg/ml), or vehicle prior to plating in chamber slides and stimulating cells with 10 nM CCL5. Quantitative assessment of macrophage migratory behaviour was obtained by tracking individual cells using image analysis software (representative traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). Analysis revealed that macrophage migration towards CCL5 was significantly impaired (p≤0.05) when cells were pre-treated with apoA1 as determined by the forward migration index (FMI) −0.090 v −0.012, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with apoA1 reduced the Euclidean distance and velocity of CCL5-stimulated macrophages to that of unstimulated controls, demonstrating a loss in cell directionality. Collectively, these findings support our observation that apoA1 directly impairs macrophage chemotaxis.</p><p>The initial time and concentration used for apoA1 treatment were based on several previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diederich et al., 2001</xref>). We wanted to test whether similar inhibitory effects on macrophage chemotaxis could be observed with shorter incubations and different doses of apoA1. Comparable to 60 min pre-treatment, both 20 min and 40 min were shown to significantly (p≤0.001) reduce macrophage chemotaxis to CCL5 by 75–86% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Pre-treatment with 20 or 80 µg/ml of apoA1 for 60 min was also shown to reduce macrophage chemotaxis to CCL5 by 43% and 51% (p≤0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effects of apoA1 on cell migration require cholesterol efflux independent of ABCA1</title><p>ApoA1 functions in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, through both ABCA1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Phillips, 2014</xref>). Given the strong inhibitory effect of apoA1 in our chemotaxis studies, we were interested to see if the effects were mediated through cholesterol efflux, and if so, whether they were dependent on the cholesterol transporter, ABCA1. Our initial experiments used a recombinant apoA1 in which the Trp72 residue has been oxidized, thereby rendering apoA1 unable to efflux cholesterol via ABCA1-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the migration capacity of macrophages to CCL5 treated with either recombinant wild-type apoA1 (rapoA1) or 5-OH-Trp72 rapoA1 (ox-rapoA1) was significantly inhibited (90–94% reduction, p≤0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We further demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of apoA1 to cell migration was independent of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by comparing the migratory ability of macrophages from C57BL/6 and <italic>Abca1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found that macrophages from both C57BL/6 and <italic>Abca1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have an equal capacity to migrate to CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and that migration of both is inhibited by 62–70% (p≤0.05–0.001) following treatment with apoA1 for 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>).

A major factor that sustains inflammation in these diseases is a mobilization and activation of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabas and Glass, 2013</xref>). Chronic inflammation is characterized by the continued recruitment of circulating monocytes, in part mediated by their response to chemokines, such as CCL2 and CCL5, which are synthesized locally in response to tissue damage and resultant locally-generated inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabas and Glass, 2013</xref>). After entering the tissue, recruited monocytes become macrophages and the degree of their activation is frequently judged in vitro by the chemotactic response to chemokines. Thus, the identification and development of agents with the ability to inhibit monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis to various chemokines is an extremely active area of investigation with the ultimate goal of deploying such agents as therapeutics to combat chronic inflammatory diseases, including arthritis and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koelink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koenen and Weber, 2011</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously reported that both HDL and its major protein component apoA1 can inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis to various chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bursill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansell et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies have been heavily weighted towards experimental conditions in which the assays were exclusively performed in vitro or the duration of treatment was prolonged (≥24 hr). Furthermore, the mechanistic basis for the effects on chemotaxis has been largely unexplored. In this present report, we have addressed these issues in both murine and human monocytes and macrophages in vitro and in models of inflammation in vivo. Our major findings are that: (1) only a short exposure (&lt;1 hr) of monocytes or macrophages to apoA1 is required to reduce chemotaxis to chemoattractants in vitro and most notably, recruitment to an inflammatory site in vivo; (2) apoA1 treatment reduces both the velocity and the directionality of macrophage migration to an established chemokine gradient; (3) inhibition of monocyte-derived cell chemotaxis requires cholesterol depletion of the cells, through a mechanism independent of ABCA1, a cholesterol transporter previously invoked to explain certain anti-inflammatory effects of apoA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>), but rather through cholesterol efflux most likely by aqueous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorni et al., 2007</xref>). We propose a model in which apoA1 and CyD treatment disrupts plasma membrane lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion, which, in turn, dampens the signalling pathway required for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, as reflected by impaired PI3K/Akt activation. These findings will now be discussed in more detail.</p><p>ApoA1 or HDL treatments of monocytes/macrophages in vitro and of mice have typically been of longer duration than used in this current report, sometimes reaching one week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smythies et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hewing et al., 2014</xref>). This makes it difficult to discern early direct effects of apoA1 from those that are downstream and likely to include many subsequent indirect effects. For example, in Bursill <italic>et al</italic>., a 24 hr treatment of monocytes with recombinant HDL resulted in reduced chemotaxis, and this was associated with decreased expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bursill et al., 2010</xref>). These long-term effects are unlikely to be the basis for the observed ~80% reduction in macrophage chemotaxis following only 20 min of exposure to apoA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). In our experiments, important “upstream” or “receptor proximal” signalling functions of chemokine G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) were not affected by acute treatment with apoA1 i.e. decreased intracellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), β-arrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In the current studies, both murine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and human monocyte migration to CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) were inhibited by apoA1 treatment. Importantly, in some chemotaxis experiments, apoA1 was removed after pre-treatment of cells, yet with even short pre-treatment times (as little as 20 min) an ~80% inhibition of chemotaxis to CCL5 was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). In other words, continuous exposure to apoA1 was not required for significant inhibition of chemotaxis.</p><p>Our in vivo studies recapitulated important features of assays performed on immune cells in vitro. For example, continuous and prolonged exposure of leukocytes to apoA1 and HDL, inherent to the <italic>Apoa1</italic>Tg mouse model, was associated with reduced recruitment of innate immune cells to sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As with the experiments in vitro which involve long-term incubation of cells with apoA1 or HDL, early vs. late effects cannot be discerned using this transgenic mouse model. Thus, it was especially notable that in our adoptive transfer approach, only 45 min ex-vivo exposure of monocytes to apoA1 was required to reduce their recruitment to an inflammatory site by 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>That the rapidity of these effects in vitro and in vivo parallels the acute loss of lipid rafts in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>) or macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is not likely to be a coincidence. Rather, this rapid desensitization to the chemoattractant effects of chemokines likely represents the perturbation of lipid rafts, which are crucial to the common signalling machinery downstream from chemokine receptors that are required for the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and integral to chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vorotnikov, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this is our finding that incubation with apoA1 was effective in blunting chemotaxis to multiple chemokines and chemoattractants, yet the early events following receptor ligation were unimpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). More directly, we show using independent assays (western blotting and flow cytometry) that lipid raft abundance was reduced after incubation of macrophages with apoA1, as was Akt phosphorylation. Akt activation in response to phosphorylation by PI3K is required for chemotaxis and was confirmed by our experiments using the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of lipid raft organization to chemotaxis, we were interested in the mechanism by which apoA1 mediated its effects. Lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol and its depletion is known to change the content and function of many of its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>). While it is long been appreciated that apoA1 is a major acceptor of cellular cholesterol, and therefore can affect the lipid raft structure and functions, most studies of apoA1’s anti-inflammatory effects have focused on cholesterol efflux mediated by specific membrane factors, in particular ABCA1 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pagler et al., 2011</xref>). By multiple criteria, our results are consistent with a non-specific cholesterol depletion process (sometimes called aqueous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorni et al., 2007</xref>) that was responsible for the impairment in chemotaxis, as: (1) similar effects of apoA1 incubation were observed with <italic>Abca1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>); (2) CyD mediated cholesterol efflux was equally effective as apoA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>); and (3) a mutant form of apoA1 (ox-rapoA1, or 5-OH-Trp72 apoA1), which is a poor acceptor of cholesterol via ABCA1, also inhibited chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). It should be noted that under the conditions of our assays using non-cholesterol loaded cells, ~80% of cholesterol efflux is likely through the aqueous diffusion mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorni et al., 2007</xref>), and this dominance is consistent with our results. Furthermore, that apoA1 can promote cholesterol efflux in <italic>Abca1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophages has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the inhibitory effect of apoA1 on macrophage chemotaxis to CCL5 is not affected by cholesterol loading of the cell (data not shown), consistent with apoA1’s ability to promote cholesterol removal from membrane lipid rafts of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Continued monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation are hallmarks of sites of chronic inflammation. CC chemokines play a key role in monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation in pre-clinical models of human diseases characterised by chronic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charo and Ransohoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">White et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabas and Glass, 2013</xref>). Extending the findings from chemokine receptor knockout mice to interventional studies in man using chemokine receptor antagonists has proven challenging with multiple drugs that target single chemokine receptors failing to progress beyond early phase randomised clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schall and Proudfoot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koelink et al., 2012</xref>). As an alternative to targeting single macrophage chemoattractant GPCRs for therapeutic benefit, we and others have explored the potential of targeting multiple chemokines using chemokine binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">White et al., 2011</xref>) or blocking macrophage responses to multiple chemoattractants using netrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van Gils et al., 2012</xref>) or apoA1 (this study). The effects of netrin on macrophage chemotaxis are dependent on the Unc5b receptor while our experiments show that the effects of apoA1 occur via a receptor-independent mechanism by changing lipid raft organisation leading to decreased PI3K activity and hence decreased monocyte/macrophage adhesion, rolling and chemotaxis.</p><p>The present results are relevant to our recent studies of apoA1’s anti-tumorigenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zamanian-Daryoush et al., 2013</xref>). This effect was attributed, in part, to suppression of the recruitment and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), potent stimulators of tumor growth. Notably, MDSC recruitment to tumors was significantly reduced in both apoA1 Tg mice and in apoA1-deficient mice receiving apoA1 therapy. MDSCs are comprised of a mixture of myeloid cells with granulocytic and monocytic morphology. The ability of apoA1 to suppress the recruitment of MDSCs to tumors, therefore, is in agreement with our current results showing the ability of apoA1 to suppress myeloid cell migration to inflammatory sites. While the exact molecular mechanism behind apoA1’s anti-tumor effect is currently unknown, given the similarities between the results in the cancer and inflammation settings, it is likely that apoA1’s ability to modulate membrane lipid raft cholesterol content influences signalling pathways regulating MDSC recruitment to tumors.</p><p>Using recombinant apoA1 particles, Nissen and colleagues showed regression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients given 5 weekly intravenous injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nissen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kingwell et al., 2014</xref>), and it is tempting to speculate that the efficacy was due, at least in part, by the mechanisms illustrated by our studies.

In future studies, it will be interesting to test the effect of apoA1 or CyD infusion in pre-clinical models of ischemia reperfusion injury (mimicking a myocardial infarction), septic shock or ischemic stroke, all of which are situations where limiting the initial rush of inflammatory leukocytes into sites of injury could have a significant effect on subsequent tissue injury and repair processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All cell culture media and buffers were obtained from PAA systems (Yeovil, UK) or Gibco (Life Technologies, NY) unless otherwise specified.

The purity of the resulting populations confirmed by flow cytometry using antibodies specific for CD45 (BD Bioscience), CD11b (BD, Bioscience), 7/4 (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) and Ly-6G (Biolegend, London, UK). Bone marrow isolations from a total of 4 femurs were typically found to yield 1–2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells at a purity of 65–85% monocytes. Monocytes were incubated with apoA1 (40 µg/ml) for 45 min at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and washed twice before i.v. administration. C57BL/6J mice were administered 100 µg zymosan A in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) i.p. 30 min before i.v. administration of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> isolated monocytes (70–80% GFP positive, in 200 µl).

They find that apoA1 inhibits macrophage and human monocyte chemotaxis to a range of chemokine and non-chemokine ligands. Exposure of mouse bone marrow monocytes to apoA1 in vitro reduces their ability to migrate into the peritoneal cavity in response to an inflammatory stimulus after adoptive transfer. They present evidence that the mechanism of inhibition of chemotaxis is through depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts and reduced signaling through AKT. The findings are novel and interesting and may be of significance with respect to therapeutic applications of apoA1. Overall there was general enthusiasm for this manuscript for all three reviewers. One reviewer commented, 'The findings certainly provide a new venue for the utility of acute treatment apo-A1 and functionally similar agents in preventing the pro-inflammatory effects of monocytes/macrophages recruited to sites of inflammation.' Another reviewer commented, 'This is an interesting manuscript which I enjoyed reading and which I think the readership of the journal will certainly find of interest.'</p><p>The following major concerns were raised that would need to be satisfactorily addressed for the manuscript to be suitable for acceptance.</p><p>1) Specificity for apoA1. The experiments as currently presented lack a 'negative control'. Both wild type apoA1 and ox-apoA1 have the same activity. The findings would be strengthened by comparison with a mutant form of apoA1 that is unable to mediate cholesterol removal by either ABCA1-dependent or ABCA1-independent mechanisms.</p><p>2) The evidence that apoA1 blocks monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis by reducing lipid raft cholesterol remains correlative. Can the effect of apoA1 be blocked by cholesterol loading?</p><p>3) Following along the lines of points 1 and 2, the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-J</xref> should be repeated to include testing effects of ox-apoA1, to confirm that it also depletes cholesterol from lipid raft fractions.</p><p>4) In the subsection “Decreased Akt cell signaling by apoA1 is associated with modulation of membrane lipid rafts”, Is it known how the comparative levels of circulating apoA1 in the Tg mouse compared to the WT? How does this compare with the concentrations of apoA1 that the isolated macrophages experience in vitro?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> The competitive ELISA performed on RAW cells treated with C5a shows a trend for a reduction in PIP<sub>3</sub> production following apoA1 treatment. If possible, it would be nice to see this repeated at least one more time to see if anything statistically significant can be drawn from it.</p><p>6) The second paragraph of the subsection “Acute exposure to apoA1 significantly reduces murine macrophage chemotactic responses” and the second paragraph of the Discussion claim that apoA1 treatment reduces the velocity and directionality of the migration, although the statistics in the table (Panel M) suggest these were not significantly different. It would be good to go back to the raw data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J-L</xref> and analyze the ratio of track length to Euclidean distance to get the directionality parameter. Significant differences between vehicle and apoA1 treatment would support these claims. It may be that the experiment is slightly underpowered to detect subtle differences in these parameters, although there certainly appears to be a trend for their reduction with apoA1 treatment.</p><p>7) It would be excellent to support this aspect of the work with a similar ibidi study using freshly isolated human monocytes to see if the same migration parameters are affected to similar degrees.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Acute exposure to apolipoprotein A1 inhibits macrophage chemotaxis in vitro and monocyte recruitment in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The results of one experiment, however, seem to run counter to the major conclusion that apoA1 exerts effects on macrophage chemotaxis by reducing the concentration of cholesterol in lipid rafts.</p><p>Main point 2 of the initial review was:</p><p>The evidence that apoA1 blocks monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis by reducing lipid raft cholesterol remains correlative. Can the effect of apoA1 be blocked by cholesterol loading?</p><p>The authors respond:</p><p>To assess if cholesterol loading of cells blocks the effect of apoA1, biogel elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and incubated with CyD:cholesterol complexes to mediate cell loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3A</xref>). Once loaded, cells were incubated with apoA1 and their migratory capacity to CCL5 assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3B</xref>). Under these conditions we find that the inhibitory effect of apoA1 is evident even when cells are cholesterol-loaded.</p><p>This result is not discussed or included in the revised manuscript. On the face of it, loading cells with cholesterol should have had the opposite effect on macrophage chemotaxis than cholesterol depletion by cyclodextran or apoA1, and at least partially blunted the effect of apoA1. It is possible that apoA1 still reduces lipid raft cholesterol under these conditions, but the fact that there was no measurable impact of cholesterol loading on the effects of apoA1 does not allay the original concern that the effects of apoA1 and lipid raft cholesterol are correlative.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A compelling reason for why the cholesterol loading experiment is not informative needs to be provided or the experiments performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I and J</xref> need to be repeated under conditions of cholesterol loading to establish at apoA1 reduces cholesterol content in raft fractions even in cholesterol loaded cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15190.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The following major concerns were raised that would need to be satisfactorily addressed for the manuscript to be suitable for acceptance.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Specificity for apoA1.

Even a single helix is competent to mediate cholesterol efflux from cells. L-4F is a peptide with one copy of an amphipathic helix that mimics the secondary structure of apoA1’s lipid-binding domain (Nagao et al., 2014). We found that treatment of biogel elicited macrophages with L-4F significantly impaired their migratory capacity to CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). As an appropriate negative control, we tested the effect of a scrambled peptide that did not contain α-helices and found that macrophage migration to CCL2 was unaltered compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1A</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that deleting all of the helixes would be necessary to make a truly incompetent molecule. We next considered using a C-terminal deletion mutant. This domain is the most non-polar segment of the human apoA1 molecule. Apoa1 mutants that delete all or parts of the C-terminal have a diminished ability to efflux cholesterol via ABCA-1 dependent pathways, however their ability to promote cholesterol efflux via aqueous diffusion is minimally impacted (Nagao et al., 2014, Gillotte et al., 1999). As published, using a C-terminal deletion mutant (in which amino acids 185-243 are deleted) at a concentration similar to that used in our in vitro studies, total cholesterol efflux was ~85% that of wild type apoA1 because of the presence of multiple 22-amino acid amphipathic α-helices. Not surprisingly, then, incubating macrophages with this mutant also inhibited their migration to CCL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1B</xref>). Note that this result supports our contention that ABCA1-mediated efflux is not required for the anti-migratory effects of apoA1, consistent with 80% of cholesterol efflux in unloaded cells being mediated by the aqueous diffusion pathway (Adorni et al., 2007).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15190.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Peptides incorporating apoA1 amphipathic α-helices impair macrophage migration.</title><p>Biogel elicited macrophages were and incubated with either (<bold>A</bold>) 50 µg/mL L-4F (Ac-DWFKAFYDKVAEKFKEAF-NH<sub>2</sub>), 50 µg/mL scrambled peptide (sc-4F) (Ac-DWFAKDYFKKAFVEEFAK-NH<sub>2</sub>) or (<bold>B</bold>) 40 µg/mL apoA1, 40 µg/mL C-terminal deleted apoA1 (Δ185-243) or PBS as vehicle control, before being added to the upper chamber (4×10<sup>5</sup>/well) of a CIM-16 plate and allowed to migrate for 7-8 h toward 10 nM CCL2 or CCL5.

We repeated the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-J</xref> with the addition of ox-rapoA1 and observed a significant depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts fractions. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> panels I and J and noted in the revised text at the end of Results.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “Decreased Akt cell signaling by apoA1 is associated with modulation of membrane lipid rafts”, Is it known how the comparative levels of circulating apoA1 in the Tg mouse compared to the WT? How does this compare with the concentrations of apoA1 that the isolated macrophages experience in vitro?</italic></p><p>For our in vitro studies we chose to use 40 µg/mL of apoA1, as at this concentration the efflux capacity of apoA1 has reached its saturation point, e.g. (Hoang et al., 2012). In apoA1 Tg mice, total apoA1 (murine plus human apoA1) is increased two fold compared to WT controls, with the concentration of apoA1 in Tg mice being approximately 252 mg/dL (2520 µg/mL) (Rubin et al., 1991, Chajek-Shaul et al., 1991). The average concentration ratio of interstitial fluid to plasma for apoA1 is between 0.07 to 0.12 (Sloop et al., 1987). Taking into account the interstitial fluid/plasma ratio, the effective apoA1 concentration a typical cell would see in vivois approximately 176-302 µg/mL. Even in WT mice, the apoA1 plasma concentration is approximately 110 mg/dL (Rubin et al., 1991), with a typical interstitial concentration estimated to be 77-132 µg/mL. These calculations indicate that our in vitro experiments employ an apoA1 concentration well within the physiological range of that achieved not only in the transgenic, but also the WT mice, and, thus, the results are not a consequence of a pharmacologic effect of apoA1.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> The competitive ELISA performed on RAW cells treated with C5a shows a trend for a reduction in PIP<sub>3</sub> production following apoA1 treatment. If possible, it would be nice to see this repeated at least one more time to see if anything statistically significant can be drawn from it</italic></p><p>This has been repeated and data added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D (n</xref>= 4 independent experiments). With the additional data, the previous trend in reduction in PI3K activity following apoA1 treatment that we observed is now statistically significant.</p><p><italic>6) The second paragraph of the subsection “Acute exposure to apoA1 significantly reduces murine macrophage chemotactic responses” and the second paragraph of the Discussion claim that apoA1 treatment reduces the velocity and directionality of the migration, although the statistics in the table (Panel M) suggest these were not significantly different. It would be good to go back to the raw data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J-L</xref> and analyze the ratio of track length to Euclidean distance to get the directionality parameter. Significant differences between vehicle and apoA1 treatment would support these claims. It may be that the experiment is slightly underpowered to detect subtle differences in these parameters, although there certainly appears to be a trend for their reduction with apoA1 treatment.</italic></p><p>We have gone back and reanalysed the data to calculate directionality, however this parameter was not different between vehicle and apoA1 treated cells. We still believe that apoA1 inhibits chemotaxis, as FMI was significantly reduced and migration distances were reduced, but we accept that in order to detect subtle changes in directionality this experiment may be underpowered.</p><p>However, we conducted new ibidi experiments with human monocytes, and the effect of apoA1 treatment was very striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J-M</xref>). All parameters were dramatically reduced, including the new directionality parameter. Therefore, we believe that using these data we can substantiate the claim that apoA1 reduces the velocity and directionality of chemotaxis. We have updated the text to reflect this new analysis of the ibidi data (subsection “Acute exposure to apoA1 significantly reduces human monocyte chemotaxis”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) It would be excellent to support this aspect of the work with a similar ibidi study using freshly isolated human monocytes to see if the same migration parameters are affected to similar degrees.</italic></p><p>We have addressed this point by including a new ibidi real time chemotaxis study on human monocytes at the end of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (panels J-M). To further extend upon this comment we also performed flow chamber studies with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; discussed in subsection “Acute exposure to apoA1 significantly reduces human monocyte chemotaxis”, second paragraph) to highlight that acute treatment with apoA1 also inhibits PBMC rolling, adhesion, and transmigration under flow and that these effects were independent of changes in receptor and adhesion molecule expression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p><italic>The revised manuscript from Iqbal, et al., satisfactorily addresses most of the major concerns raised during initial review.
