Chief among them are reactive species produced in the so-called oxidative burst. Here, we show that bacteria exposed to a neutrophil-like cell line experience a rapid and massive oxidation of cytosolic thiols. Using roGFP2-based fusion probes, we could show that this massive breakdown of the thiol redox homeostasis was dependent on phagocytosis, presence of NADPH oxidase and ultimately myeloperoxidase. Interestingly, the redox-mediated fluorescence change in bacteria expressing a glutathione-specific Grx1-roGFP2 fusion protein or an unfused roGFP2 showed highly similar reaction kinetics to the ones observed with roGFP2-Orp1, under all conditions tested. We recently observed such an indiscriminate oxidation of roGFP2-based fusion probes by HOCl with fast kinetics in vitro. In line with these observations, abating HOCl production in immune cells with a myeloperoxidase inhibitor significantly attenuated the oxidation of all three probes in bacteria.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32288.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A group of cells of the immune system defends the body against infections by wrapping themselves around bacteria, and effectively ‘eating’ them. During this process, called phagocytosis, the cell also douses the bacterium with a deadly cocktail of chemicals, including an antiseptic – hydrogen peroxide – and bleach. This mixture chemically burns, and then kills, the invader. The immune cells create hydrogen peroxide and bleach through chemical reactions that require two enzymes, NOX2 and MPO. The NOX2 enzyme is activated first, and produces a compound which is then transformed into hydrogen peroxide. In turn, hydrogen peroxide is used by MPO to make bleach.</p><p>Phagocytosis is still poorly understood, and difficult to study: for example, it is not clear when the toxic mix is released, and which of its components are the most important. Here, Degrossoli et al. peer into this process: to do so, they genetically engineer bacteria and give them a built-in chemical burn tracker. The bacteria are made to carry fluorescent proteins which normally glow under blue light, but start to also react to violet light if they are exposed to a chemical burn.</p><p>Under the microscope, when these bacteria encounter immune cells, they start glowing under violet light only a few seconds after they have been phagocytized. This shows that, during phagocytosis, the chemical mix is used almost immediately. The new technique also reveals that cells without a working NOX2 enzyme – which cannot produce hydrogen peroxide – could not burn the bacteria. However, hydrogen peroxide is also used by MPO to create bleach. If just MPO is deactivated, the cells can burn the bacteria, but much less efficiently. This, and the speed with which these fluorescent proteins were burnt, shows that the bleach is the main component of the toxic mix used during phagocytosis.</p><p>Chronic granulomatous disease is a condition where patients can have a faulty version of NOX2, which makes it harder for them to fight infection. Understanding the mechanisms and the enzymes associated with phagocytosis could lead to improved treatment in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox regulation</kwd><kwd>thiol oxidation</kwd><kwd>hypochlorous acid</kwd><kwd>roGFP2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PDE 248836/2013-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Degrossoli</surname><given-names>Adriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 213/840-1 FUGG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winklhofer</surname><given-names>Konstanze F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ME1567/9-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Andreas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE2905/1-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leichert</surname><given-names>Lars I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of genetically encoded redox sensors in phagocytized bacteria reveals that, among the toxic cocktail of oxidants released into the neutrophil's phagolysosome, HOCl is the main component responsible for the oxidative modification of bacterial protein thiols.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When bacteria encounter professional phagocytic immune cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages, they are engulfed and phagocytized. Within the phagosome, an intracellular compartment formed during phagocytosis, bacteria are exposed to a complex mixture of toxins, chiefly among them oxidative and nitrosative species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Urban et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013</xref>). This mechanism, termed respiratory burst, is initiated by the reduction of oxygen to superoxide radicals through NADPH oxidase NOX2, an enzyme that is assembled at the phagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chanock et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segal and Abo, 1993</xref>). From superoxide, other reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), are formed and released into the phagosomal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hampton et al., 1998</xref>). The respiratory burst is potentiated through lysosomal degranulation that releases myeloperoxidase (MPO) and other microbicidal proteins into the phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2012</xref>). MPO catalyzes the formation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong oxidant, from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and chloride ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furtmüller et al., 2003</xref>). These ROS can oxidize and damage virtually any cellular molecule, and together with other subsequent mechanisms, ultimately lead to microbial death. In contrast, individuals with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a genetic disease with impaired NADPH oxidase activity, as well as mice that lack components of the NADPH oxidase are strongly susceptible to microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hampton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mandell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vethanayagam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Winkelstein et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanisms that kill bacteria in phagocytic immune cells are still not fully understood. However, investigation of the phagosomal environment is quite challenging due to its transient nature and the complexity of the mixture of oxidative species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nüsse, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Several methods have been employed for the detection of phagosomal ROS, including fluorescent redox-sensitive dyes. However, most of these methods have a number of limitations such as non-specificity, irreversibility, non-quantitative information, or a lack of subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nauseef, 2014</xref>). The most widespread compound to detect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in intact cells is 2’,7’-dihydrodichlorofluorescein (H<sub>2</sub>DCF), which can be oxidized to fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maghzal et al., 2012</xref>). DCF oxidation, however, is considered mainly qualitative, as it is observable in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and is stimulated by metals, peroxidases, and cytochrome c. Therefore, it does not provide detailed quantitative and compartment-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarpey et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, roGFP2 (reduction-oxidation-sensitive green fluorescent protein 2) has been used to study oxidative and nitrosative stress dynamics in <italic>Salmonella</italic> inside macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Heijden et al., 2015</xref>). roGFP2 has several advantages when compared to commercially available fluorescent redox-sensitive dyes. As a GFP variant, it can be genetically introduced into virtually any biological system and can be even targeted to specific cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dooley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2004</xref>). Its redox state, which depends on the redox state of the biological system, can then be measured with the help of an engineered pair of cysteine residues close to the fluorophore. The reversible disulfide bond formation between these cysteines triggers a slight conformational change, which results in a reversible change of the protonation status of the fluorophore. The reduced and oxidized form of roGFP2 therefore have distinct fluorescence excitation maxima at 395 and 490 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dooley et al., 2004</xref>). Either the 405/488 nm ratio with laser-based excitation or 390/480 nm ratio on filter-based recording devices can thus be used to directly determine the probe’s redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>). This ratiometric approach compensates for variations due to differences in absolute roGFP2 concentrations, allowing for quantitative monitoring. These probes thus allow compartment-specific real-time ratiometric quantification of the intracellular redox status in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Barreiro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaskar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Heijden et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the use of three different roGFP2-based fluorescent redox probes to quantitatively track the redox state of bacteria during the phagocytic process. Using the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive roGFP2-Orp1 probe expressed in the cytoplasm of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, we could show with fluorescence spectroscopy and quantitative fluorescence microscopy that phagocytosis by a neutrophil-like cell line leads to probe oxidation within seconds. Comparison of roGFP2-Orp1’s oxidation kinetics to the oxidation kinetics of the glutathione-specific Grx1-roGFP2 probe and the oxidation kinetics of unfused roGFP2 suggested that the presence of a strong oxidant in the phagosome is over-riding the specificity of the fusion probes. Based on previous in vitro studies and chemical inhibition of myeloperoxidase, we conclude that HOCl is the major reactive species during the onset of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and initiates non-specific thiol oxidation in phagocytized bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of the roGFP2-based fusion probes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></title><p>When bacteria are phagocytized by professional phagocytic immune cells, they are exposed to a toxic cocktail of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) generated by the action of NADPH-oxidase and superoxide dismutase.

Thus, we expressed the roGFP2 fusion probe roGFP2-Orp1 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MG1655.

Addition of the strong oxidant Aldrithiol-2 (AT-2, 2,2′-Dipyridyl disulfide) to the bacterial cells led to full oxidation of the probe, while addition of DTT resulted in full reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>). The exposure to reactive species in the phagolysosome could also interfere with the glutathione redox potential (E<sub>GSH</sub>) within the cell.

To differentiate PLB-985 cells we exposed them to DMSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010</xref>) and added interferon γ (IFNγ). After 5 days of incubation, differentiated cells showed significantly higher expression of CD11b and CD64 than undifferentiated cells, while CD16 and CD66b expression was unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Differentiated cells lost their spherical shape, and the cells showed a morphology typical of neutrophils when stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). Differentiated cells internalized IgG-opsonized <italic>E. coli</italic>, demonstrating their phagocytic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the usage of undifferentiated PLB-985 cells or non-opsonized <italic>E. coli</italic> led to significantly decreased internalization of bacteria, despite their presence in the surrounding medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). When IFNγ was not added during the differentiation process, phagocytosis was less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Our microscopic data was corroborated and quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). For subsequent experiments, we used DMSO+ IFNγ-differentiated cells and opsonized <italic>E. coli</italic>, because under those conditions the neutrophil-like cells had the highest phagocytic capacity.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32288.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differentiation of the myeloid cell line PLB-985 to neutrophil-like cells.</title><p>Determination of surface markers CD11b, CD16b, CD64, and CD66 before and after two different differentiation protocols (<bold>A–D</bold>).

All three probes have different specificities: Unfused roGFP2, for example, is known to react slowly with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and glutathione in vitro and thus is not well-suited for the detection of transient and weak oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>). Additionally, the Grx1-roGFP2 probe rapidly equilibrates with the cell’s glutathione redox potential, but is not directly affected by hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>). However, we showed recently, that, in vitro, the specificity of these three probes breaks down in the presence of strong oxidants. All roGFP2-based probes react similar and with fast kinetics with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and polysulfides in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2017a</xref>).

However, our knowledge on the early events within the phagosome as well as inside engulfed bacteria is quite limited. This is mainly due to a lack of methods that would allow specific, spatio-temporal, and quantitative measurements of ROS and changes in the cell's redox status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balce and Yates, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalyanaraman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterbourn, 2014</xref>). To close this gap, we set up a phagocytosis assay using neutrophil-like PLB-985 cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria expressing roGFP2-based probes in their cytoplasm.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis was that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> plays a major role in microbial oxidation during early phagocytosis, as NADPH oxidase is the first enzyme in the respiratory burst cascade and the generated superoxide is thought to be quickly converted to hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segal et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segal, 2005</xref>). We therefore used roGFP2-Orp1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> to specifically measure H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation in the bacterial cell. The probe was oxidized rapidly inside <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but recovery was observable within approximately 30 min. Permanent probe oxidation was achieved upon addition of 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the bacteria are incapable of detoxifying these high concentrations.</p><p>We then tested the response of roGFP2-Orp1, but also Grx1-roGFP2 and unfused roGFP2 to co-incubation and phagocytosis by PLB-985. All probes were effectively oxidized under these conditions and showed virtually the same kinetics. This was somewhat unexpected, since the roGFP2-Orp1 probe typically shows high specificity toward hydrogen peroxide, whereas the Grx1-roGFP2 probe was designed to rapidly and specifically equilibrate with the glutathione redox couple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutscher et al., 2008</xref>): in vitro, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment of purified Grx1-roGFP2 did not lead to significant probe oxidation even at concentrations as high as 100 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2017b</xref>). In the same vein, unfused roGFP2 only slowly equilibrates with the glutathione redox couple and did not show significant oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and oxidized glutathione in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer and Dick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2017b</xref>). However, we previously showed that all three probes are effectively oxidized by HOCl in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Müller et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2017b</xref>), and HOCl is well known to be highly reactive with most thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peskin and Winterbourn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Storkey et al., 2014</xref>). To test if this holds true in an in vivo setting in bacteria as well, we treated <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing any of the three probes with increasing concentrations of HOCl. The response was instant at all concentrations and comparable for all three probes. It is therefore likely that a complex mixture of reactive species, with HOCl as the main component, leads to the oxidation of the probes in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In a parallel approach, ROS formation in differentiated PLB-985 cells stimulated with PMA was found strongly increased as well. Others have compared the activity of PLB-985 (and cell line HL-60, which is essentially the same cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drexler et al., 2003</xref>]) to that of neutrophils. It was shown that this cell line, when differentiated to neutrophils, expresses slightly less myeloperoxidase than blood neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pivot-Pajot et al., 2010</xref>) and had a generally weaker functional response. However, in other studies, superoxide production and MPO activity have been described to be comparable or even exceeding that of human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hua et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thompson et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>Since HOCl and other reactive species produced during the oxidative burst are ultimately derived from superoxide produced by NADPH-oxidase, roGFP2-based probe oxidation was largely diminished when PLB-985 cells lacking NOX2 activity were used in the co-cultivation assays. Our data also indicates that <italic>E. coli</italic> experiences the largest amount of oxidative stress within the phagolysosome, since the probe expressed in non-phagocytized bacteria was significantly less oxidized in the same co-cultivation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This is somewhat surprising, as especially H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is thought to easily diffuse through membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupré-Crochet et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our hypothesis that HOCl could be responsible for the unspecific roGFP2 probe oxidation in phagocytized <italic>E. coli</italic> was further substantiated using the myeloperoxidase inhibitor ABAH. Pre-treatment of neutrophil-like cells with ABAH resulted in a significant decrease of the probes’ oxidation and release of reactive species as measured with a DCF assay. Taken together, these results suggest HOCl is most likely the major reactive species responsible for roGFP2 oxidation in <italic>E. coli</italic> ingested by PLB-985 cells.</p><p>Our results provide some insights into the nature of ROS released within the phagosome. While production of different ROS at the onset of phagocytosis was known and described before and has been observed using roGFP2 expressed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Heijden et al., 2015</xref>), the exact composition and concentrations of individual reactive species as well as their time-resolved release remain largely elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupré-Crochet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klebanoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013</xref>). As soon as neutrophils ingest opsonized bacteria and the vacuole is formed, degranulation begins within seconds and NADPH oxidase becomes activated and produces superoxide, which dismutates to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Segal et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segal, 2005</xref>). When the granules are fused to the phagosome, MPO levels increase, leading to the formation of HOCl and derived chloramines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013</xref>). This HOCl generation in the phagolysosome could be directly observed in porcine neutrophils phagocytizing zymosan particles with the help of a chemical probe selective for HOCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koide et al., 2011</xref>). Due to its high abundance, MPO thus can be regarded as a sink for hydrogen peroxide, which would favor the view that it does not accumulate to concentrations high enough to harm bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupré-Crochet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klebanoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013</xref>). Instead, HOCl and potentially HOCl-derived chloramines seem to play the major role in the oxidation of bacterial macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark and Borregaard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klebanoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vissers and Winterbourn, 1987</xref>). These results are in agreement with previous studies in which bacterial killing following phagocytosis was analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palazzolo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>). GFP bleaching in phagocytized bacteria suggested that cytoplasmic HOCl concentrations were significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Winterbourn and Kettle, 2013</xref>). Our approach allowed real-time tracking of the roGFP2 oxidation state during phagocytosis and thus provided strong evidence of the presence of HOCl or derived chloramines within the cytoplasm of bacteria within seconds after phagocytosis.</p><p>Interestingly, most individuals with MPO deficiency do not particularly suffer from microbial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kutter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nauseef, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parry et al., 1981</xref>). Inhibition of MPO, the enzyme producing HOCl in neutrophils, led to lower probe oxidation but did not fully inhibit oxidation, indicating that ROS produced prior to HOCl can still affect the thiol redox state of proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>’s cytoplasm, or alternatively, that ABAH did not fully inhibit MPO, as has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björnsdottir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parker et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of NOX2, roGFP2 remained fully reduced, indicating that the absence of superoxide, which is needed for the formation of peroxynitrite, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and further derived ROS and RNS including HOCl, prevents the breakdown of the bacterial thiol redox state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>PLB-985 culture and differentiation</title><p>The human myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985 (obtained from DSMZ, German collection of microorganisms and cell culture) was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clare Hawkins (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-performed study that presents novel and interesting results. The authors show that roGFP proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> are sensitive to oxidation by hypochlorous acid (or derived oxidants), that there is myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation of the probe when expressing bacteria are ingested by neutrophils, and that the probe is capable of real-time monitoring of HOCl production in phagocytosing neutrophils. The latter observation has potential for wide application.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is a major issue with the context in which the results are described, i.e that the authors expected to see specificity of the probes that have been developed to be sensitive to H2O2 or glutathione redox state, then express surprise that this was not the case. To the reviewers this is not at all surprising, however. It is well known that HOCl is highly reactive with almost all thiols (see for example Peskin, 2001; Storkey, 2014) and it would be expected that all the thiol-based probes would be prime targets. Furthermore, the authors themselves have just published a paper (Mueller et al., 2017) showing non-selectivity of the probes for HOCl. The manuscript should be revised and written from the perspective of this prior knowledge. It is fine to present the data showing no difference between the probes with either the isolated or phagocytosed bacteria, but the results should be described and interpreted on the basis of previous knowledge and the potential value of roGFP-expressing cells for following events after phagocytosis. The Discussion section in particular should be revised significantly.</p><p>1) The tone of the article is to present the observations in terms of sensing of HOCl rather than considering them more simply as a reflection of widespread thiol oxidation. For example, &quot;thiol redox potential&quot; in the title, abstract and elsewhere, and &quot;the bacteria sense redox stress&quot; (subsection “Probe oxidation is dependent on effective phagocytosis”) imply a functional effect. It is not clear from the data presented, whether oxidation of the probe is influenced by the bacterial redox environment (as implied in the Title) or reflecting a direct reaction of the probes. The authors need to change their wording. Sensing may be involved, but we do not yet know. It may become more apparent after further work establishing when oxidation occurs – before or after the bacteria are killed.</p><p>2) Please clarify what medium was used to treat the bacteria with HOCl (e.g. for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and whether it may have influenced the response. Subsection “Fluorometric measurement of roGFP2-based probe oxidation state in <italic>E. coli”</italic> says they were in HEPES, subsection “Measurement of roGFP2-based probe oxidation state in a 96-well format” in PBS with FBS, and it is not always clear which were used for which experiments. It is important to note that HOCl reacts rapidly with HEPES to form a chloramine, which is likely to mediate much of the effect of HOCl. Also, FBS would scavenge some of the HOCl and decrease sensitivity to low concentrations.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. This gives qualitative information that the PLB-985 cells undergo an oxidative burst. However, it would be helpful to have some quantitative information, for example with cytochrome c, to show how active they are compared with neutrophils, and also to know relative MPO levels. This information may be available in the literature, otherwise it would be good to include experimental values. Also, it would be worth looking more closely at the fluorescence spectra, as previous studies of oxidant formation in the phagosome show that HOCl forms a product with a slightly shifted fluorescence spectrum compared to DCF, e.g. Tlili et al., 2011.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, subsection “Probe oxidation 290 is dependent on myeloperoxidase” andthe Discussion section. Inhibition by ABAH indicates a role for MPO. However, on the basis of the evidence presented, it cannot be concluded that partial inhibition indicates a contribution by other oxidant(s). An alternative is that inhibition by ABAH is not 100% effective. In fact, the latter explanation is more likely, as others have shown only partial inhibition of intracellular MPO by ABAH (see comment in Parker, 2011; Bjornsdottir, 2015). The conclusion of the last paragraph of the Discussion section should be changed accordingly.</p><p>5) In revising the Discussion section please provide less repetition of the results, and give more critical analysis and comparison with other studies that have attempted to quantify the composition, concentration and kinetics of oxidant formation (e.g. Koide et al., 2011 – use of HOCl<sup>-</sup>specific probe and van der Heijen et al., 2015 – cited in the Introduction).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32288.077</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is a major issue with the context in which the results are described, i.e that the authors expected to see specificity of the probes that have been developed to be sensitive to H2O2 or glutathione redox state, then express surprise that this was not the case.

We have thus re-written the manuscript from the perspective of our prior knowledge regarding the probes’ in vitro-specificity. However, since it could be a common (although, as the reviewers rightly point out, naïve) assumption that these probes are specific even in the highly oxidizing environment of the phagolysosme, we still state that initial hypothesis briefly in the discussion to dismiss it based on our data. Probe specificity was indeed our initial assumption and only the results obtained in our study led us to perform the above mentioned in vitro-characterization of the roGFP2-based probes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The tone of the article is to present the observations in terms of sensing of HOCl rather than considering them more simply as a reflection of widespread thiol oxidation.

Since we have not yet published these results, we changed the tone of the article and no longer refer to redox sensing and breakdown of the redox potential. Specifically, we have changed the Title to “Neutrophil-generated HOCl leads to non-specific thiol oxidation in phagocytized bacteria”, changed “thiol redox potential” accordingly, where appropriate, and changed the offending “sense” to “experience”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify what medium was used to treat the bacteria with HOCl (e.g. for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and whether it may have influenced the response.
