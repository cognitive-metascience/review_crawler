To do so, corollary discharges are conveyed to sensory areas and gate expected reafference. Such gating is observed in neonatal rats during wake-related movements. In contrast, twitches, which are self-generated movements produced during active (or REM) sleep, differ from wake movements in that they reliably trigger robust neural activity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the gating actions of corollary discharge are absent during twitching. Here, we identify the external cuneate nucleus (ECN), which processes sensory input from the forelimbs, as a site of movement-dependent sensory gating during wake. Whereas pharmacological disinhibition of the ECN unmasked wake-related reafference, twitch-related reafference was unaffected. This is the first demonstration of a neural comparator that is differentially engaged depending on the kind of movement produced. This mechanism explains how twitches, although self-generated, trigger abundant reafferent activation of sensorimotor circuits in the developing brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18749.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18749.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18749.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many parts of our body twitch while we are asleep and these movements are especially common in babies. Unlike the movements we make while awake, twitches during sleep are brief, staccato-like movements that appear to be aimless – but they are not, as traditionally believed, mere remnants of dreams. Rather, it is believed that twitches help infants learn about their bodies and how they move.</p><p>When we are awake, the brain routinely compares information from the areas of the brain that produce movements with information coming in from the senses, so that we are better able to anticipate and control the movements we make. However, this comparison appears to be suspended during twitching: in 2014, researchers studying infant rats reported that twitches, although self-produced, are treated by the brain as if they are unexpected or surprising.</p><p>To confirm that the brain treats twitches differently from wake movements, Tiriac and Blumberg – who were involved in the previous study – recorded electrical activity in the brains of infant rats while they were awake and asleep. These experiments show that a brain area known as the external cuneate nucleus (ECN) was mostly inactive when awake rats vigorously moved their front legs, but became highly active when these same legs twitched during sleep. Drugs that disinhibited electrical activity in the ECN unmasked leg movement signals produced by awake rats, but these same drugs had no effect on leg movement signals produced during twitching. Thus, these experiments indicate that, when infant rats are awake, the ECN compares signals from the senses with signals from the parts of the brain that produce movements, a key feature of motor control. However, when the rats are asleep and twitching, the comparison mechanism is disengaged and sensory signals are allowed to cascade through the ECN to many other structures in the brain.</p><p>Tiriac and Blumberg’s findings open new avenues for understanding how the developing brain learns to distinguish the movements that we produce ourselves from those that occur due to forces in the outside world. Also, the challenge remains to identify the specific mechanisms by which twitches help develop and refine the brain circuits that enable mammals to move around as effectively as they do.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18749.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18749.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>corollary discharge</kwd><kwd>myoclonic twitching</kwd><kwd>efference copy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-HD081168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD063071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A neural gating mechanism in the external cuneate nucleus of the rat brain is engaged during wake movements and disengaged during sleep-related twitches.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals of diverse vertebrate and invertebrate species distinguish between sensations arising from self-generated movements from those arising from other-generated movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sommer and Wurtz, 2008</xref>). To make this distinction between self and other, motor areas produce copies of motor commands (i.e., corollary discharges) that are directly compared with sensory signals arising from self-generated movements (i.e., reafference; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poulet and Hedwig 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sommer and Wurtz 2002</xref>]).

First, to be a comparator, the ECN must be a sensory structure; in fact, the ECN processes proprioceptive inputs from forelimb and nuchal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 1974</xref>) and recordings from anesthetized cats have demonstrated that the ECN codes, with high fidelity, the stretch on muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mackie et al., 1999</xref>). Second, the ECN must receive motor-related input; in fact, the ECN receives direct and indirect input from premotor areas, including the red nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holstege and Tan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 1974</xref>) and C3-C4 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pivetta et al., 2014</xref>). Third, the ECN should not participate in the production of movement; as shown here, disinhibition of the ECN had no discernible effect on the production of wake movements or twitches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Finally, and most critically, a comparator must gate reafference arising from movements. This was demonstrated here by showing that inhibitory blockade of the ECN unmasked reafference exclusively during wake movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, inhibitory blockade had no effect on the ECN’s tonic firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), thus demonstrating that inhibitory control of the ECN is not engaged throughout the waking state. Furthermore, when we manually stimulated the forelimbs, ECN activity was evoked similarly during sleep and wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible mechanisms underlying movement-dependent modulation of reafference</title><p>There is no evidence that wake movements and twitches are produced by independent brainstem structures. On the contrary, the red nucleus is involved in the production of both types of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gassel et al., 1966</xref>). Therefore, it may be that (a) premotor structures like the red nucleus are state-dependently modulated such that they convey motor copies to the ECN (or an intervening structure) only during wake movements, or (b) the ECN receives motor copies from both types of movements, but state-dependent modulation of the ECN prevents the twitch-related motor copies from engaging the inhibitory mechanism. Indeed, in neonatal rats, there are structures, including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, that could play a state-dependent modulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlsson et al., 2005</xref>). Regardless of which mechanism turns out to be correct, the fact remains that wake movements and twitches are processed very differently at the level of the ECN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications</title><p>Experimental disruption of corollary discharge pathways has a negative impact on forelimb reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azim et al., 2014</xref>) and control of eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sommer and Wurtz 2002</xref>). In this context, the gating of wake-related reafference within the ECN makes functional sense. But if sensory gating is critical for motor function, why disengage this mechanism during sleep-related twitches?</p><p>The absence of sensory gating during sleep raises the possibility that corollary discharge mechanisms interfere with functional processes in which twitches are involved. Indeed, if sensory gating were to occur during active sleep, twitches—which are especially abundant during early development—would trigger little or no reafference. In the context of a developing system that relies heavily on activity-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirkby et al., 2013</xref>), the gating of twitch-related reafference would suppress the very activity upon which some of these processes depend. Because reafference is not gated during twitching, it is permitted to sequentially activate interconnected sensorimotor structures—including the ECN (as shown here), red nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2015</xref>), cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2015b</xref>), thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiriac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>), sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiriac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>), and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohns and Blumberg, 2010</xref>). Such cascading neural activity provides the opportunity for competitive synaptic interactions that, through such mechanisms as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song and Abbott, 2001</xref>), can contribute to the development and refinement of somatotopic organization across the neuraxis.</p><p>The very presence of a neural comparator that is differentially engaged in a movement-dependent manner argues both for the importance of sensory gating during wake and its absence during sleep. With regard to the latter, the identification here of a neural mechanism that distinguishes twitches from wake movements reinforces the notion that twitches play a critical role in shaping sensorimotor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumberg et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication No. 80–23) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Iowa.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 42 Sprague-Dawley Norway rats (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_5508397">RGD_5508397</ext-link>) were used at P8-10.

The skin overlying the skull was removed and a custom-built head-fix apparatus was attached to the skull with cyanoacrylate adhesive. A small hole was drilled over the forelimb region of primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC).

After surgery, the pup was transferred to a humidified incubator maintained at thermoneutrality (35°C) to recover for at least 1 hr, after which it was transferred to a stereotaxic apparatus. The pup’s torso was supported on a narrow platform such that the limbs dangled freely on both sides. The pup acclimated for at least one additional hour before recordings began, by which time it was cycling between sleep and wake.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>The electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were connected to a differential amplifier (A-M Systems, Carlsborg, WA; amplification: 10,000x; filter setting: 300–5000 Hz). To record from forelimb SMC, 16-channel silicon depth electrodes were used (100 µm vertical separation; NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI). To record from the ECN, four-channel silicon depth electrodes were used (50 µm vertical separation). Silicon electrodes had impedances ranging from 1 to 4 MΩ. To simultaneous perform ECN recordings during iontophoretic application of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptor antagonists, multibarrel electrodes were used with an iontophoretic pump (Kation Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). Electrodes were connected to a headstage which communicated with a data acquisition system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL) that amplified (10,000x) and filtered the signals. All cortical recordings were obtained using a 5000 Hz low-pass filter, and all recordings in ECN were obtained using a 500–5000 Hz band-pass filter. A 60-Hz notch filter was also used. Neurophysiological and EMG signals were sampled at 25 kHz and 1 kHz, respectively, using a digital interface and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).</p><p>Prior to insertion of the silicon probe into SMC or ECN, the electrode surface was coated with fluorescent DiI (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for subsequent histological verification of electrode placement. A Ag/AgCl ground electrode (Medwire, Mt. Vernon, NY, 0.25 mm diameter) was placed into the visual cortex ipsilateral to the silicon probe. Brain temperature was monitored using a fine-wire thermocouple (Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT) placed in the visual cortex contralateral to the ground wire.

Recording sessions comprised continuous collection of neurophysiological and EMG data for at least 30 min. During acquisition, an experimenter monitored the subject’s behavior and digitally marked the occurrence of sleep-related twitching and wake movements in synchrony with the physiological data. For the scoring of limb movements, we used two sets of digital markers. One set of markers was used for twitches and wake movements of the forelimb, and the other set was used for twitches and wake movements of the other limbs. As described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlsson et al., 2005</xref>), myoclonic twitches are phasic, rapid, and independent movements of the limbs and tail against a background of muscle atonia; in contrast, wake movements, which are high-amplitude, coordinated movements occurring against a background of high muscle tone, include kicking, stretching, and yawning. Finally, the experimenter was always blind to the physiological data when scoring behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Forelimb stimulation</title><p>In 6 of the 14 animals in which spontaneous sleep-wake activity was recorded in the ECN, the forelimb ipsilateral to the recording site was stimulated using a fine paintbrush over a period of 10 min.

Before infusion, 30 min of baseline ECN activity was recorded. During this recording, a −10 nA retaining current was used to ensure that the antagonists did not leak passively into the ECN. After the baseline recording, the current was switched to +50 nA to eject the drugs and another 30 min of ECN activity was recorded. After this recording period, fluorogold was infusedwith the same current parameter that was used for drug infusion to mark the location of the electrode.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of the recording session, the pup was overdosed with sodium pentobarbital (1.5 mg/g) and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.

Recording sites were verified by visualizing the DiI tract or fluorogold at 5–20X magnification using a fluorescent Leica microscope.

Spike sorting was performed using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). For LFPs, channels were band-pass filtered (1–40 Hz) to extract spindle bursts. Spindle bursts were defined as comprising at least three oscillations, a dominant frequency of 10–15 Hz, and a duration of at least 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>). LFP channels were processed using root mean square (RMS) with a time constant of 0.01 s. Five random high-amplitude spindle bursts were averaged and the baseline value of the RMS channel was calculated. The midpoint between those two values was used as a threshold for identification of spindle bursts. A second pass through the data was performed to manually remove any spindle bursts that did not match the requisite criteria. Throughout this process, artifacts in the LFP and MUA signals were identified and manually removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Identification of behavioral state and motor activity</title><p>Sleep and wake periods were defined using methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tiriac et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the nuchal EMG signal was dichotomized into periods of high tone (indicative of wake) and atonia (indicative of sleep). Active sleep was characterized by the occurrence of myoclonic twitches against a background of muscle atonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seelke and Blumberg, 2008</xref>). Spikes of EMG activity with amplitudes greater than 3x baseline were considered twitches.</p><p>For the identification of forelimb wake movements, the forelimb EMG was rectified and smoothed (0.01 ms). To be considered a wake movement, a spike in the forelimb EMG had to be at least 300 ms in duration and had to occur while nuchal muscle tone was high (indicative of wake). Five random wake movements that met these criteria were selected and their maximum amplitude was averaged. Using the midpoint between atonia and max amplitude of wake movements as a threshold, an automatic peak detection was applied to extract forelimb movements as events. Similar to spindle burst detection, a second pass through the data was performed to manually remove any wake movements that did not match the requisite criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Analysis of state dependency</title><p>There were at least 20 bouts of wake and active sleep for each pup.

For each event correlation, mean firing rate during quiescence (1–1.5 s preceding motor activity) was calculated. These means were then subtracted from each respective event correlation. For each animal, the event correlation of the pre-infusion time period was subtracted from the event correlation of the post-infusion time period. The resulting event correlations depicting the change in firing rate (∆ firing rate) were then averaged within each experimental group for each behavioral state and standard errors for every bin were calculated. Peak change in firing rate around the expected latency of sensory reafference was then calculated along with standard errors.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Congratulations: we are very pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;Gating of reafference in the external cuneate nucleus during wake movements but not sleep-related twitches&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The Reviewing Editor for your submission was David Kleinfeld and the Senior Editor was Sabine Kastner.</p><p>A basic computational motif in engineering is the process of computing the difference between the intending and the actual action. Here, Tiriac and Blumberg examine forelimb movements in the rat and show that the external cuneate nucleus in the brainstem acts as a comparator of intended movement, as defined by a reference signal or so called &quot;corollary discharge' of motor control, and the measured output from cutaneous or proprioceptive receptors or the so called &quot;reafferent signal&quot;. In fact, if the two signals are congruent, the nucleus gates sensory input generated by the motion. Interestingly, the gate is inactive during sleep so that sensory signals from self-generated muscle twitches can activate cortical neurons.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers have identified some minor issues that need to be fixed and made suggestions with regard to the Discussion. Please consider these issues carefully and send us an updated manuscript that we will take into production.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper by Tiriac and Blumberg bears on the gating of re-afferent signals during forelimb movements generated during waking versus forelimb twitches generated during deep sleep in rat pups. It is reported that gating of re-afferent signals occurs during waking, but not during twitches, and that gating occurs in the dorsal column nuclei (the external cuneate nucleus).</p><p>This is the second report from this group on the gating of re-afferent somatosensory (proprioceptive) signals. In a prior study a gating process was documented for hindlimb movements during waking (Current Biology, 2014). What is new in the present study is that the authors provide strong evidence that gating occurs in the dorsal column nuclei. Although pre and postsynaptic inhibition has long been documented in these nuclei, no study has addressed the function of the inhibitory circuitry in somatosensory processes.</p><p>It would be interesting to determine the behavioral effect of inactivating the inhibitory circuit in dorsal column nuclei to determine whether adult rats can still differentiate between re-afferent inputs and other generated movements.</p><p>In the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel D is not correctly identified. It should be D instead of C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Authors explored a critical component of their developing story implicating limb twitching during sleep as having functional significance. They investigated whether the external cuneate nucleus (ECN) acts a comparator of corollary discharge and reafferent signals in relation to wake-state forelimb movements and REM sleep-state forelimb twitches. The authors addressed this question during spontaneous waking and sleeping epochs with LFP and MU recordings in sensorimotor cortex and the ECN, with EMG recordings in forelimb, hindlimb, and nuchal muscles, and with pharmacological manipulations of the ECN. They provide compelling evidence substantiating their claims. First, they convincingly show that sensorimotor cortex responds to sleep-twitches but not to wake-movements. Second, they likewise demonstrate that the ECN has a stronger response to sleep-twitches than to wake-movements. Finally and critically, by disinhibiting ECN, the authors uncover a reafference signal in ECN in response to wake-movements without having an effect on sleep-twitches. These results represent strong evidence that the ECN meets the criteria of a comparator of corollary discharge and reafferent signals.</p><p>This is an excellent study with compelling results. Overall, I have no major concerns. The experimental design and procedures are suitable for the questions investigated, the results (and figures) are clear, and the discussion of potential mechanisms and the implications of reafferent signals during twitches in relation to development are plausible and interesting. My only recommendations are positive ones. My main suggestion is to expand upon the Discussion (last paragraph) of the potential role of twitches in organizing networks during sleep. A minor suggestion is to include the supplemental figure into the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18749.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper by Tiriac and Blumberg bears on the gating of re-afferent signals during forelimb movements generated during waking versus forelimb twitches generated during deep sleep in rat pups.
