These molecular contacts are often highly dynamic, may be of weak affinity, and depend on the cell context. Capturing these versatile interactions is therefore a key challenge to better understand the molecular cues underlying protein function in vivo.</p><p>Two types of experimental strategies are classically used for high-throughput screening of protein-protein interactions (PPIs): yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (TAP-MS). Y2H detects PPIs in an automatable way in live yeast cells, while TAP-MS is based on co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and subsequent MS analysis of the different constituents of the complex (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cusick et al., 2005</xref>] for review). Recent developments such as proximity based biotinylation (BioID) have significantly increased the sensitivity of the TAP-MS approach, allowing capturing low affinity PPIs from a small number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varnaitė and MacNeill, 2016</xref>). Despite their wide range of applications, Y2H and TAP-MS still have several drawbacks. For example, Y2H does not reproduce the plant or animal cell environment, and each revealed interaction needs thus to be validated in the relevant physiological context afterwards. TAP-MS can be performed in the appropriate cell type, but the extraction protocol requires experimental conditions (especially for cell fixation and/or cell lysis) that are often not neutral to the integrity of endogenous PPIs. Finally, BioID allows interaction analyses without fixation, but may capture proteins promiscuously based on proximity rather than direct physical interactions, which could yield false positives.</p><p>In addition to these high-throughput approaches, PPIs can also be analyzed at a low-scale level, for example to validate the interaction status of one protein with few candidate partners. Co-IP followed by western blot is classically used for this purpose. However, this approach requires tools that are not systematically available, such as good antibodies or tagged-constructs. Co-IP experiments may also be poorly sensitive, detecting mainly interactions that will resist cell lysis and purification conditions.</p><p>An alternative and more sensitive approach is in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), which provides a direct readout of the candidate PPI in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagchi et al., 2015</xref>). A major limitation of PLA is the need of good antibodies against both interacting proteins. In addition, PLA works on fixed material, which is not neutral for PPIs.</p><p>Among the few methods that are compatible for PPI analysis in live conditions is Förster (or Fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET), which relies on the transfer of a virtual photon between two fluorescent chromophores upon excitation. This transfer occurs within a small distance (less than 10 nm) and can thus be used to validate the close proximity between two candidate proteins, or to capture a conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piston and Kremers, 2007</xref>). FRET requires high level of protein expression and dedicated interfaces to interpret the few emitted signals with confidence and therefore cannot be used for large-scale applications.</p><p>By contrast, Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) appears much more convenient since it is based on a visible fluorescent signal. BiFC relies on the property of monomeric fluorescent proteins to be reconstituted from two sub-fragments upon spatial proximity (in a similar range of distance as FRET). This method has been used in different plant and animal model systems and with various types of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerppola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kodama and Hu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, recent work has established experimental parameters for performing BiFC in the live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudry et al., 2011</xref>), and the method was coupled to a candidate gene approach to identify new interacting partners of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the bright intrinsic fluorescence of BiFC allows analysis of PPIs using commonly available fluorescent microscopes and with normal protein expression levels. Originally established with the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2000</xref>]), BiFC has by now been developed with various GFP-derivatives such as the YFP, Venus or Cerulean proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu and Kerppola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shyu et al., 2006</xref>). BiFC has also been established with other types of monomeric fluorescent proteins, including red fluorescent variants like mRFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jach et al., 2006</xref>) or mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2008</xref>), and more recently the near infrared fluorescent protein iRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In all cases, the complementation between the two sub-fragments of the fluorescent protein induces the formation of covalent junctions, leading to a stabilization of the protein complex. While this property forbids monitoring temporal dynamics of PPIs, this practically irreversible nature of the complementation allows detection of weak and otherwise transient PPIs, making BiFC a very sensitive approach for studying PPIs in vivo. BiFC has also been used in several high throughput approaches in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sung et al., 2013</xref>), plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), or for drug discovery against a specific PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2013</xref>), demonstrating its suitability for large-scale applications.</p><p>Here, we present a genetic repertoire covering 450 <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors (TFs) (corresponding to around 65% of annotated TFs) for performing BiFC in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner in vivo. This genetic repertoire is called multicolor BiFC library and consists of a collection of fly lines that complement the previously established FlyORF collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flyorf.ch/">https://flyorf.ch/</ext-link> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischof et al., 2013</xref>]). The multicolor BiFC library is continually updated and aims at covering all <italic>Drosophila</italic> TFs in the near future. We provide proof of concept experiments showing the suitability of the BiFC FlyORF library for performing either large-scale interaction screens or for analyzing individual PPIs. This collection of fly lines constitutes the first genetic toolbox for analyzing thousands of different PPIs in a live animal organism, opening new avenues for understanding molecular properties of protein interaction networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a fly library containing Gal4-inducible ORFs compatible with Venus-based BiFC</title><p>560 open-reading frames (ORFs) among the 3000 actually present in the FlyORF library code for TFs.

In particular, several controls showed that Venus-based BiFC could not occur under conditions where the interaction between the two candidate partners was disrupted. This was demonstrated by using mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hudry et al., 2011</xref>) or by coexpressing one partner that cannot complement (not fused to a Venus fragment) and thus competes against BiFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although very convenient for generating new fusions without additional fly transgenesis, swapping experiments require several generations, and therefore several weeks, before getting the desired BiFC-compatible fly line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischof et al., 2014</xref>). In order to introduce ready-to-use fly lines for performing Venus-based BiFC, we systematically exchanged the 3xHA tag in a number of TF lines of the FlyORF library for the VN tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These first rounds of swapping experiments led to a collection of 136 ORF-VN fly lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, third column). We further generated an alternative VN-swapping fly line that allows fusing the ORF to the Venus fragment, however with a shorter linker region between ORF and VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, see also Materials and methods). Reducing the length of this region could potentially diminish the risk of revealing indirect PPIs in vivo. A series of pilot tests confirmed that the new VN-short tag fly line is suitable for swapping and BiFC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This new swapping fly line is now systematically used for generating additional ready-to-use ORF-VN tagged fly lines. To date, 74 ORFs have been fused to the VN fragment with the short linker region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, fourth column).

Interestingly, the homeodomain (HD) class of TFs appears significantly enriched in the Ubx (p value=0,041) and AbdA (p value=0,017) interactomes, suggesting that HD-containing TFs could constitute a privileged class of common cofactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This result confirms that the multicolor BiFC library can be used to capture specific interaction partners between two closely related bait proteins. Interestingly, bZIP-containing TFs are absent from the two specific interactomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), suggesting that this class of TFs could be specifically dedicated to Ubx- and AbdA common functions.</p><p>Overall, the BiFC screen shows that the two Hox proteins could interact with a surprisingly high number of various types of TFs. A similar conclusion (with 41% of positive interactions) was obtained from a previous candidate gene screen based on competitive BiFC with a set of 80 TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>). This high interaction potential of Hox proteins could be explained by their numerous functions during embryogenesis and the extreme sensitivity of BiFC (linked to the fluorescent signal and UAS/Gal4 expression system).</p><p>The BiFC screen was performed in the <italic>Ubx-</italic> or <italic>abdA</italic>-expression domain by expressing the TFs using <italic>Ubx-Gal4</italic> or <italic>abdA-Gal4</italic> driver. True positive interactions are expected to occur between TFs that are co-expressed in the same spatial expression domain. To test this, we considered the extent of the overlap between the expression domain of Ubx or AbdA and each TF (as the ratio between the number of tissues in which the TF and Ubx or AbdA are co-expressed and the total number of tissues composing the TF expression domain during embryogenesis). To this end, we used annotations from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammonds et al., 2013</xref>) and the Flybase database to assign the expression status of Ubx, AbdA and each TF in 25 different developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This analysis showed that the extent of co-expression is significantly higher when TFs and Hox protein interactions are detected with BiFC than when they are not (Wilcoxon test, pvalue = 1.10<sup>−2</sup> and 5.10<sup>−5</sup> for Ubx and AbdA, respectively: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). Thus, the BiFC screen reveals more frequently interactions between TFs and Hox proteins when they are co-expressed during embryogenesis.</p><p>Further analysis of interactomes in major embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C’, D’, E’ and F’</xref>) revealed that the AbdA-specific interactome was enriched in TFs expressed in the fat body/gonad primordium (p value=8.10<sup>−4</sup>) when compared to all positive interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F’</xref>, encircled TFs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In contrast, TFs expressed in this tissue are not present in the Ubx-specific interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E’</xref>). This observation is consistent with the specific role of AbdA in the gonad primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 1998</xref>). Another TF, Spalt major (Salm), is also found in the AbdA-specific interactome (encircled by a dotted-line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Among other functions, Salm is important for oenocyte specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elstob et al., 2001</xref>), a role also specifically ensured by AbdA during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodu et al., 2002</xref>). A significant enrichment (p value=5.10<sup>−2</sup>) is also observed in the dorsal vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F’</xref>, TFs annotated with a star in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), which again coincides with a specific function of AbdA in particular for the differentiation of ostia and heart beating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ponzielli et al., 2002</xref>). By comparison, TFs expressed in tissues where Ubx and AbdA have redundant/common functions show no significant enrichment in the AbdA-specific interactome (i.e epidermis, CNS, somatic mesoderm and trachea: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>’and F’ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Together these observations underline that the multicolor BiFC library is efficient in revealing relevant candidate cofactors involved in AbdA-and tissue-specific functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Validating BiFC observations by a functional genetics approach in haltere primordium</title><p>Since BiFC revealed a number of potential interactions, we asked whether hits from the large-scale interaction screen could somehow be confirmed to contribute to Hox protein function. To this end, we searched for a sensitive genetic background where any subtle modification in Hox protein function could lead to a quantifiable phenotype. In this context, the loss of a Hox cofactor could affect the sensitized Hox protein function and lead to a stronger phenotype. No sensitive Hox-dependent phenotypes are known in the embryo, but several exist in the adult, like eye reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plaza et al., 2001</xref>) or antenna-to-leg transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plaza et al., 2008</xref>). These phenotypes rely however on ectopic expression of the Hox product and are therefore not ideal for assessing the role of a candidate cofactor in the normal developmental context. To circumvent this problem, we considered the haltere-to-wing phenotype, which results from the specific loss of Ubx in the haltere primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis, 1978</xref>). A particular combination of <italic>Ubx</italic> mutant alleles has more recently been used to measure the ability of different Ubx isoforms to rescue haltere formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Navas et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the haltere-to-wing phenotype is sensitive to the dose of Ubx, and removing one copy of the Hox gene is sufficient to induce the formation of few small hairs that are normally found in the wing margin, revealing a weak haltere-to-wing transformation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In this context, RNAi against <italic>Ubx</italic> is sufficient to induce a strong haltere-to-wing transformation, with the formation of numerous wing-like hairs and a flattened wing-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). This result highlights that the heterozygote <italic>Ubx</italic> mutant phenotype can be increased when <italic>Ubx</italic> function is affected. We decided to use this sensitive background for measuring the role of TFs tested in our BiFC screen (see Materials and methods). The rational was that affecting the expression of a positive TF acting as a Ubx cofactor in the haltere primordium should increase the haltere-to-wing phenotype. Reversely, a negative TF should have no effect.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38853.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional genetics validates BiFC observations with Ubx in haltere primordium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scanning electron microscopy of haltere phenotypes in the different genetic backgrounds, as indicated.

The resulting 40 TFs (among all the 260 that were tested in the embryo BiFC screen) were assayed using RNAi experiments in <italic>Ubx</italic> heterozygous mutant haltere discs. Slightly more than half of the tested TFs (23/41: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) did not increase the phenotype of the heterozygous <italic>Ubx</italic> mutant upon RNAi (as illustrated with RNAi against <italic>absent_small_or_homeotic_discs_2</italic> (<italic>ash2</italic>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). The large majority of those TFs (18/23) were classified as BiFC negative with Ubx in the embryo, confirming that BiFC was specific enough not to identify these as interacting partners of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that the five other TFs that were BiFC positive could act as Ubx cofactors in another developmental context. Among the 17 remaining TFs, eight enhanced the phenotype upon RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The phenotype enhancement was not as strong as with the RNAi against Ubx, and consisted in the appearance of several wing-like hairs in the haltere (as illustrated with RNAi against <italic>homothorax</italic> (<italic>hth</italic>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). 7/8 of those TFs scoring positively in the RNAi assay were also BiFC-positive in the embryo, highlighting that Ubx cofactors were efficiently captured in the BiFC interaction screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). It is also worth mentioning that the TF that gave the strongest phenotype upon RNAi, Hth, displays enriched binding adjacent to Ubx binding sites genome wide in the haltere tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choo et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that Hth could constitute a crucial cofactor for Ubx in the haltere specification program. Finally, RNAi against 10 TFs led to malformations that were difficult to interpret with regard to a potential role as Ubx cofactor since the morphological defects could also be independent of a Ubx cofactor function. An illustrative phenotype is given with a RNAi against the TF Mad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Because of this ambiguous putative role, these TFs were not further considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and black boxes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the haltere sensitized genetic background highlighted that 80% (25/31) of the selected TFs that give an interpretable phenotype were correlated to the BiFC interaction status.

Analysis with the four other TFs showed that the majority of expressing nuclei (as assessed with the mCherry reporter) were positive for both green and blue fluorescent signals, thus demonstrating that simultaneous bicolor BiFC was efficient with different types of TFs in the live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Green-only nuclei could not be found in the case of the four positive TFs, although Exd is expressed at the same level as AbdA.

In addition to having distinct spectral properties from Venus and Cerulean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>-figure 3), sfGFP has also a shorter maturation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we tested the complementation between sfGFPN and CC fragments by considering five TFs that were positive with Exd in our previous BiFC analyses. The sfGFPN fragment was fused at the N-terminus of Exd, making a sfGFPN-Exd fusion protein with the same fusion topology as previously done with the VN fragment (Materials and methods). BiFC was analyzed with excitation and emission wavelengths of the sfGFP. Results showed that the sfGFPN-Exd fusion protein could complement with the CC fragment in the case of all five tested TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, fluorescent signals were of similar brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and maturation time when compared to signals obtained with VN-Exd. Finally, since the sfGFPN and sfGFPC fragments are described as having a strong auto-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), we also performed BiFC with the negative control Ems-CC. No fluorescent signal was obtained between Ems-CC and sfGFPN-Exd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), confirming that the affinity between the sfGFPN and CC fragments is not strong enough to artificially induce complex formation between the two non-interacting proteins.

This hypothesis is supported by the observation that common interactions were not so frequent between Ubx and a more divergent Hox protein like Sex combs reduced (40% of common interactions among 35 tested TFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>]), or between AbdA and Exd (59% of common interactions among 37 tested TFs).</p><p>The diversity of positive TFs reflects the likely high potential of Hox proteins to engage in many different types of interactions in vivo, as previously shown for Ubx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bondos et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, activators or repressors were equally enriched in Ubx and AbdA interactomes, highlighting that Hox proteins are involved in both positive and negative regulation of transcription. The screen was performed with a unique <italic>Hox-Gal4</italic> driver and therefore in conditions that do not reproduce the expression profile of the tested ORF. Despite this, we found that TFs that are endogenously more frequently co-expressed with Ubx and AbdA during embryogenesis were significantly enriched among the positive interactions.</p><p>Specificity of the BiFC screen was further demonstrated by the identification of several interactions that were exclusive to either Ubx or AbdA. Interestingly, the AbdA-specific interactome was significantly enriched in TFs that are expressed in tissues (gonad, heart) or cells (oenocytes) with known AbdA-specific functions.</p><p>Finally, the functional analysis of a selected pool of TFs expressed in the haltere disc showed that 80% of the interpretable phenotypes (25/31 TFs) were consistent with the interaction status found by BiFC in the embryo.</p><p>Altogether these results confirm that the multicolor BiFC library is suitable for performing large-scale interaction screens and revealing specific interactomes even for two closely related bait proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Suggestions for fine-tuning the specificity of the multicolor BiFC library screens</title><p>The multicolor BiFC library relies on the inducible UAS/Gal4 expression system, and caution should be taken regarding expression levels since high doses of protein expression could lead to artificial positive signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerppola, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, we recommend using a unique Gal4 driver in the case of a large-scale interaction screen. Ideally, this driver should derive from a <italic>P-Gal4</italic> insertion that will affect the expression of the bait-encoding gene, as done here with the <italic>Ubx-Gal4</italic> or <italic>abdA-Gal4</italic> driver. This genetic context allows expressing the bait protein at normal levels while eliminating one dose of endogenous competitive gene product. Furthermore, expressing the cofactor in cells that do not contain the corresponding endogenous gene product allows doing BiFC in the absence of competition, therefore increasing assay sensitivity. Here interactions were analyzed in the epidermis, which is an easily accessible tissue with low fluorescent background. The epidermis was previously shown to be tolerant for interactions with many different types of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Hox-Gal4</italic> expression domain is also large in the epidermis, making it an ideal tissue for a large-scale interaction screen. By comparison, the split-Gal4 system will not provide a better resolution since it will reproduce the expression pattern of only one cofactor with the bait protein. Therefore, not all potential interactors will be observed in their normal domain. In addition, the split-Gal4 system is less active and not compatible with <italic>P-Gal4</italic> insertions. In conclusion, we recommend using a bait-Gal4 driver derived from a <italic>P-Gal4</italic> insertion for performing a large-scale BiFC interaction screen and doing competition experiments (this work and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>]) for validating the specificity of BiFC. Mutations affecting the interaction potential of the bait protein can also be used as a specificity control, as previously shown with mutated Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>), and the interaction confirmed by alternative methods such as co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baëza et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We showed that the interaction could be confirmed in the relevant developmental context in vivo by doing BiFC with the split-Gal4 system, In particular, the split-Gal4 system was used to visualize BiFC specifically in the overlapping expression domain of Ubx and Twi. The large number of fly lines compatible with the split-gal4 system makes this system very attractive for the future use of the multicolor BiFC library. Along the same line, the Janelia and Mimic collections propose hundreds of fly lines compatible with the LexAop/LexA-AD induction system. This expression system is also compatible with the multicolor BiFC library since UAS sequences of ORF-VN and ORF-CC constructs are swappable with LexAop sequences upon FLP/FRT-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bischof et al., 2014</xref>). The two candidate partners could then be expressed independently and in their respective domain by using the UAS/Gal4 system on the one side, and the LexAop/Lex-AD system on the other side. In this context, BiFC will only be analyzed in the overlapping expression domain of the two partners, as described with the split-Gal4 system. Since the ORF-CC library is inserted on the second chromosome, we have generated another LexAop-swapping fly line that is compatible for FRT-mediated recombination with this chromosome (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In conclusion, the versatile inducible expression systems for thousands of enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the multicolor BiFC library enable selection of biologically relevant conditions that better recapitulate the endogenous expression profile of each candidate partner, thus maximizing specificity and providing an unprecedented combination of possibilities for large-scale and/or in depth analysis of PPIs in a live animal organism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cloning of pTSVNm9short.attB</title><p>The FRT2-VNm9short fragment was PCR-amplified from plasmid pTSVNm9.attB with forward primer FRT2-VN-F (5’-TATGGATCCGAAGTTCCTATTCTCTACTTAGTATAGGAACTTCGATGGTGAGCAAGGGCG-3’) and reverse primer tub-R2 (5’-ACACTGATTTCGACGGTTACC-3’), thereby eliminating a stretch of 12aa between FRT2 and VNm9 and introducing flanking restriction sites BamHI and NotI.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, a new resource is presented, a set of <italic>Drosophila</italic> fly lines called &quot;multicolor BiFC library&quot;, which covers most of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factors and thus allows to capture transcription factor (TF) interactions using the Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) in live conditions. Importantly, the multicolor BiFC can be used to simultaneously probe two binary interactions, is compatible for large-scale interaction screens and can be combined with the existing <italic>Drosophila</italic> tools, for example, the split-GAL4 system and thus allows a visualization of potential interactions only in domains where the proteins of interest are co-expressed.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very solid and provides an important genetic toolbox for the identification and analysis of protein-protein interactions. Although BiFC has a couple of disadvantages, this resource is nonetheless very valuable. Our initial enthusiasm on reading the manuscript was somewhat tempered on careful reading. Several important issues need to be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and these are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have described before the usability of BiFC to monitor interactions in vivo. What is new and exciting in this paper is the use of this system to show interactions of not only two but also of three interaction partners. The authors show that they can detect interactions between Abd-A and a third partner and Exd and the same third partner (Figure 6). However, the co-occurrence of blue and green signals in the same cell is not proof that the three proteins appear in a complex. These could be simply independent interactions in the same cell. The issue of whether using BiFC to study interactions between three proteins provides information about tripartite complexes is important. The authors appear to be aware of the issue that the assay only directly reports on binary interactions, describing &quot;analyzing two different PPIs simultaneously&quot; and in Figure 6 legend &quot;potentially in the context of…complexes&quot;. The relationship between simultaneous reporting of two binary interactions and information about tripartite complexes should be clarified. The authors should drop the term &quot;tripartite&quot; from the Abstract and instead generally make it clear that the advance is to study two binary interactions in the same cell. This may provide information on potential complexes and they should present how the binary information might be used; e.g. where they suggest that &quot;BiFC with Exd is dependent on the concomitant interaction with AbdA&quot; since TF-Exd BiFC (green) is only found in cells that also have TF-AbdA BiFC (blue). They should also remove in Figure 6A the 'tripartite complex' or indicate somehow that this is just a possibility but not shown in the paper.</p><p>2) For showing the functional relevance of the identified interactions, the authors used the haltere-to-wing transformation and a sensitized mutant background (Ubx heterozygous condition). This is an elegant experiment, however, the pictures in Figure 5 are not good enough. The authors need to show higher magnifications and better images of the bristles. In addition, quantification of the phenotypes for all genotypes is needed.</p><p>3) The authors introduce the super-folded GFP as an additional GFP derived protein useable for BiFC and show that this variant behaves similarly to VN fusions. Their reasoning for introducing this variant was that it has shorter maturation times and distinct spectral properties from Venus and Cerulean. However, the authors do not specifically test the usability of this variant for detecting interactions with unstable proteins. Thus, the data as presented just show that the sfGFP variant works similarly well as the VN variants for more stable proteins, which is good but not surprising. If the authors could show an interaction using an unstable TF comparing the performance of the Venus and sfGFP variant, this would strengthen this point very much. In any case, the authors should move the sfGFP part to the supplement if they cannot show its usability for a more unstable protein.</p><p>4) The use of the split-GAL4 system is an excellent addition, however, it also raises the question why the strong interaction of Ubx and Twi in the visceral mesoderm, which is clearly visible with the split-GAL4 system (8C') is not detectable with the <italic>Ubx-GAL4</italic> or <italic>twi-GAL-4</italic> drivers (8A', C'). Careful quantification of the fluorescence signal is required for the split-GAL4 line described in Figure 8, as the fluorescence intensities are quite different. Does this result also mean that BiFC should be in principle only be done with the split-GAL4 system? This needs to be carefully discussed.</p><p>5) Figure 3 is unreadable. Could the authors think of better ways to represent the interactomes? For example, they could show the overlap of Abd-A and Ubx interactors in a circle diagram etc. They show that HD TF are enriched, any other class? What about the function of these TFs: repressors, activators? The same is true for Figure 4, the information could be better and more intuitively presented.</p><p>6) The paper could be considerably shortened. The presentation of the large-scale BiFC analysis of interactions with Ubx and AbdA (subsection “Using the multicolor BiFC library for large-scale interaction screens in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos”) is followed by a number of approaches seeking to &quot;validate&quot; the observed interactions.

What is new and exciting in this paper is the use of this system to show interactions of not only two but also of three interaction partners. The authors show that they can detect interactions between Abd-A and a third partner and Exd and the same third partner (Figure 6). However, the co-occurrence of blue and green signals in the same cell is not proof that the three proteins appear in a complex. These could be simply independent interactions in the same cell. The issue of whether using BiFC to study interactions between three proteins provides information about tripartite complexes is important. The authors appear to be aware of the issue that the assay only directly reports on binary interactions, describing &quot;analyzing two different PPIs simultaneously&quot; and in Figure 6 legend &quot;potentially in the context of…complexes&quot;. The relationship between simultaneous reporting of two binary interactions and information about tripartite complexes should be clarified. The authors should drop the term &quot;tripartite&quot; from the Abstract and instead generally make it clear that the advance is to study two binary interactions in the same cell. This may provide information on potential complexes and they should present how the binary information might be used; e.g. where they suggest that &quot;BiFC with Exd is dependent on the concomitant interaction with AbdA&quot; since TF-Exd BiFC (green) is only found in cells that also have TF-AbdA BiFC (blue). They should also remove in Figure 6A the 'tripartite complex' or indicate somehow that this is just a possibility but not shown in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “tripartite complex” is an over-interpretation and we have removed the term form the Abstract. We now present this aspect as a possibility, both in the new Figure 6A (with a dotted arrow) and in the corresponding legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For showing the functional relevance of the identified interactions, the authors used the haltere-to-wing transformation and a sensitized mutant background (Ubx heterozygous condition). This is an elegant experiment, however, the pictures in Figure 5 are not good enough. The authors need to show higher magnifications and better images of the bristles. In addition, quantification of the phenotypes for all genotypes is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Illustrative phenotypes of the different categories were de novo acquired with a scanning electron microscope and higher magnifications of ectopic bristles are also shown in the new Figure 5. Statistical quantification of the number of ectopic bristles is also provided for each positive RNAi (together with one representative negative RNAi, wild type and <italic>abxpbxbx</italic> background).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors introduce the super-folded GFP as an additional GFP derived protein useable for BiFC and show that this variant behaves similarly to VN fusions. Their reasoning for introducing this variant was that it has shorter maturation times and distinct spectral properties from Venus and Cerulean. However, the authors do not specifically test the usability of this variant for detecting interactions with unstable proteins. Thus, the data as presented just show that the sfGFP variant works similarly well as the VN variants for more stable proteins, which is good but not surprising. If the authors could show an interaction using an unstable TF comparing the performance of the Venus and sfGFP variant, this would strengthen this point very much. In any case, the authors should move the sfGFP part to the supplement if they cannot show its usability for a more unstable protein.</p></disp-quote><p>There is some confusion about the usability of sfGFP-based BiFC for detecting interactions with unstable proteins. The sfGFP protein has a faster maturation time than other GFP-derived proteins, and is therefore more appropriate for monitoring protein dynamics. However, BiFC with sfGFP- or Venus-derived fragments requires several hours for maturation, which forbids tracking protein interaction dynamics. To date, there is no fluorescent protein with a complementation maturation time that could be compatible with the analysis of protein interaction dynamics in vivo. In addition, sfGFP- or Venus-based BiFC stabilizes the interaction once it is revealed. In conclusion, the novel combination of fragment complementation between the sfGFPN and CC fragments just adds to the fluorescence repertoire of the multicolor BiFC library. It will not provide access to protein stability or interaction dynamics. We tried to reformulate more clearly this aspect to avoid any confusion with this regard. The corresponding results are also included in the supplement (Figure 6—figure supplement 16), as suggested by reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of the split-GAL4 system is an excellent addition, however, it also raises the question why the strong interaction of Ubx and Twi in the visceral mesoderm, which is clearly visible with the split-GAL4 system (8C') is not detectable with the Ubx-GAL4 or twi-GAL-4 drivers (8A', C'). Careful quantification of the fluorescence signal is required for the split-GAL4 line described in Figure 8, as the fluorescence intensities are quite different. Does this result also mean that BiFC should be in principle only be done with the split-GAL4 system? This needs to be carefully discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Because of this interesting comment on the split-Gal4 system, we decided to better describe the interaction profile with each different driver. The use of the split-Gal4 system with the multicolor BiFC library was also more carefully discussed. Practically, the <italic>Ubx-</italic> and <italic>Twi-Gal4</italic> drivers lead to expression and interaction of Ubx and Twi in different parts of the embryo, including the visceral mesoderm. BiFC in the visceral mesoderm was not obvious in the previous Figure 8 of the first version, due to strong fluorescent signals in the epidermis or somatic mesoderm, respectively. We now present maximum intensity projections of confocal sections centered on the visceral mesoderm to better highlight BiFC in this tissue with each individual driver (A’ and B’ in the new Figure 7). In addition, we quantified the intensity of BiFC in the visceral mesoderm with the split-Gal4 system, in comparison to the BiFC intensity observed in the same tissue with the <italic>Ubx-Gal4</italic> driver. Values are in accordance with the known diminished activation activity of the reconstituted Gal4 when compared to full length Gal4 (which is now mentioned in the main text). Finally, we discussed why and how the split-Gal4 system should be used with the multicolor BiFC in the Discussion section (briefly, not for large-scale interaction screens, but rather for confirming/analyzing individual binary interactions in the relevant developmental tissue).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3 is unreadable. Could the authors think of better ways to represent the interactomes? For example, they could show the overlap of Abd-A and Ubx interactors in a circle diagram etc. They show that HD TF are enriched, any other class? What about the function of these TFs: repressors, activators? The same is true for Figure 4, the information could be better and more intuitively presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Interactomes of Ubx and AbdA are now presented differently, in a way that each TF name could be read upon higher magnification in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 10. As suggested by reviewers, interactomes are also presented in a simplified manner to better illustrate the repartition of the main TFs families in the different Ubx and AbdA interactomes (new Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 11). Of note, the distribution of the different BiFC fly lines was voluntary switched from the supplement to the new Figure 3 to directly provide the global information that will evolve in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The paper could be considerably shortened. The presentation of the large-scale BiFC analysis of interactions with Ubx and AbdA (subsection “Using the multicolor BiFC library for large-scale interaction screens in live Drosophila embryos”) is followed by a number of approaches seeking to &quot;validate&quot; the observed interactions. However, these approaches do not provide straightforward validation, demonstrating corroboration based on expected outcomes, but rather lead to novel findings. Although these novel findings, such as the difference in IDR and SLiM occurrence between Ubx- and AbdA-specific interactomes and differential effects of HX mutations on Ubx and AbdA, are intriguing, they do not provide clear validation of the BiFC observations. We would recommend deleting the sections beginning &quot;The multicolor BiFC library reveals Hox-specific…&quot; and &quot;A short conserved Hox protein motif…&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The entire parts dedicated to the analysis of intra-molecular features of Ubx and AbdA interactors have been deleted according to the reviewers’ suggestion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
