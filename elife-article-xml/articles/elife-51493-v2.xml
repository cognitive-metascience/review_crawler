microbial communities remains highly challenging. Interspecies interactions can impact antibiotic activity through many mechanisms, including alterations to bacterial physiology. Here, we studied synthetic communities constructed from the core members of the fruit fly gut microbiota. Co-culturing of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species altered its tolerance to the transcriptional inhibitor rifampin. By measuring key metabolites and environmental pH, we determined that <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species counter the acidification driven by <italic>L. plantarum</italic> production of lactate. Shifts in pH were sufficient to modulate <italic>L. plantarum</italic> tolerance to rifampin and the translational inhibitor erythromycin. A reduction in lag time exiting stationary phase was linked to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> tolerance to rifampicin, opposite to a previously identified mode of tolerance to ampicillin in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

However, unlike in laboratory monocultures, the vast majority of bacteria live in diverse communities. In environments such as the human intestine, antibiotics impact communities in many ways, ranging from the loss of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dethlefsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jernberg et al., 2007</xref>) to the evolution of multidrug-resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016</xref>). Hence, there is a pressing need for new frameworks that predict how antibiotics affect bacterial communities in ways that cannot be predicted from simple monocultures.</p><p>Synthetic microbial communities provide the opportunity to perform controlled experiments that uncover mechanistic principles of microbial ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Momeni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zuk and Travisano, 2018</xref>). Such communities have been used to demonstrate the evolution and consequences of microbial cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harcombe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>), reveal the role of interactions on spatial patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>), and to link physiology and metabolism to mutualistic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ponomarova et al., 2017</xref>). Interspecies interactions can occur through specific mechanisms involving members of a community (e.g. cross-feeding or competition for resources) and through global environmental variables modified by bacterial activity. An example of the latter is pH, which has recently been shown to drive community dynamics in an artificial laboratory system of decomposition bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ratzke and Gore, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A natural system with low diversity provides a consortium of species with a common evolutionary and ecological history from which to build synthetic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ponomarova et al., 2017</xref>). The gut microbiota of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fruit flies is such a low diversity assemblage in which all members can be cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obadia et al., 2017</xref>), making it amenable to the systematic dissection of bacterial interactions. This community consists of ~5 species predominantly from the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Acetobacter</italic> genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Members of multispecies communities, such as biofilms and models of urinary tract infections, can display altered sensitivity to antibiotics in the community context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamowicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicoloff and Andersson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanchez-Vizuete et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have used synthetic communities to uncover the interplay between interspecies interactions and antibiotic efficacy; for example, the exoproducts of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> affect the survival of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> through changes in antibiotic uptake, cell-wall integrity, and intracellular ATP pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radlinski et al., 2017</xref>). In genetically modified communities, intracellular antibiotic degradation affords cross-species protection against chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorg et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, metabolic dependencies within synthetic communities can lower the viability of bacteria when antibiotics eliminate providers of essential metabolites, leading to an apparent change in the MICof the dependent species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamowicz et al., 2018</xref>). However, we still lack understanding of how metabolic interactions between bacteria affect the physiological processes targeted by antibiotics and the resulting balance between growth inhibition (bacteriostatic activity) and death (bactericidal activity). For example, the intimate relationship between bacterial metabolism and environmental pH could also lead to changes in antibiotic efficacy, as previously shown in monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aagaard et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamberi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karslake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). The interplay of all these processes in complex communities will provide new ways to combat pathogen survival and resistance evolution, particularly in cases involving tolerance, an important and understudied aspect of antibiotic susceptibility that can be elicited by diverse mechanisms and can facilitate the evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we interrogated how interspecies interactions affect growth, pH, and antibiotic susceptibilities. We used high-throughput assays to measure and compare these parameters in monocultures and co-cultures. We found that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) exhibited antibiotic tolerance (delay in death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>) in the presence of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species. Lactate accumulation by <italic>Lp</italic> in monocultures acidified the media, inhibiting growth during stationary phase. <italic>Acetobacter</italic>-mediated lactate consumption released this inhibition by increasing pH, leading to a shorter <italic>Lp</italic> lag while exiting stationary phase. This reduced lag exiting stationary phase was correlated with the antibiotic tolerance of <italic>Lp</italic> that we observed.

To test this hypothesis, we inoculated a 48 h culture of <italic>Lp</italic> to an initial OD = 0.02 into the supernatant of a 48 h <italic>Lp</italic> culture at pH = 3.77 or manually adjusted to pH = 7.

As expected, the maximal growth rate was lower than in fresh MRS, presumably due to the partial depletion of nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); addition of glucose to the conditioned medium supported faster growth, but only starting from neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also hypothesized that the accumulation of lactate by <italic>Lp</italic> would allow growth of <italic>Ap</italic> in <italic>Lp</italic>-conditioned medium even at low starting pH.

We then assessed if increasing the pH at 30 h resulted in a decrease in the duration of lag phase by diluting the monoculture to OD = 0.0375 into fresh MRS after an additional 18 h of growth. Indeed, the lag phase was shorter for the pH-adjusted cells compared with a control culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To test whether pH changes can also decrease tolerance, we grew co-cultures of <italic>Lp</italic> and <italic>Ap</italic> for a total of 48 hr, decreasing the pH to 3.7 at <italic>t</italic> = 30 h or 40 hr. In both cases, the viability after 24 h of rifampin exposure was significantly reduced relative to an untreated monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, pH can affect tolerance both positively and negatively.</p><p>In co-culture with <italic>Lp</italic>, <italic>Ap</italic> raised the pH earlier than did <italic>Aa</italic>, while <italic>Ao</italic> only raised the pH very slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We hypothesized that due to these distinct pH dynamics, rifampin would also have different <italic>Lp</italic> killing dynamics in these co-cultures. We grew co-cultures of these <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species with <italic>Lp</italic> as previously, and then treated the co-cultures with 50 µg/mL rifampin. While all co-cultures had extended survival relative to <italic>Lp</italic> monoculture, the killing dynamics of <italic>Lp</italic> were indeed distinct, with <italic>Aa</italic> inducing the highest tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To determine the extent to which these dynamics can be explained by the time at which each species raises the pH, we measured CFU/mL at various time points after rifampin treatment for <italic>Lp</italic> monocultures grown for 48 h whose pH was raised to pH seven at <italic>t</italic> = 30 h or 40 hr, mimicking the early and late increases in pH for <italic>Ap</italic> and <italic>Aa</italic> co-cultures, respectively. The shift to pH 7 at 40 h induced higher rifampin tolerance than the shift at 30 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the increased tolerance of the <italic>Lp-Aa</italic> co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, shifting the pH to 4.5 at <italic>t</italic> = 30 hr, to mimic the slight increase caused by <italic>Ao</italic>, was also sufficient to increase tolerance comparable to pH neutralization at <italic>t</italic> = 30 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the similar killing dynamics of the <italic>Ap</italic> and <italic>Ao</italic> co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). All pH shifts induced higher tolerance compared to control cultures that underwent the same protocol but whose pH was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Taken together, these experiments establish that pH changes drive changes in both the exit from stationary phase and tolerance of <italic>Lp</italic> to rifampin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Growth status and pH also modulate tolerance to a ribosome-targeting antibiotic</title><p>The robust relationships among changes in pH, lag time, and rifampin tolerance prompted us to explore how changes in pH and lag time affect survival to other antibiotics. We decided to use the ribosome-targeting macrolide erythromycin because it is bacteriostatic (in contrast to rifampin) and <italic>Lp</italic> is sensitive to it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). We treated <italic>Lp</italic> monocultures grown for 20 h or 48 h with increasing concentrations of erythromycin for 24 h at a starting cell density of ~5 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. Opposite to our observations with rifampin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), a 48 h <italic>Lp</italic> monoculture displayed tolerance to erythromycin, while a 20 h culture did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). While both cultures had the same MIC in erythromycin (0.078 µg/mL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), at concentrations above the MIC, the 48 h culture showed no changes in CFU/mL after 24 h of erythromycin treatment; the 20 h culture had a reduction of ~10 fold in CFU/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This result suggests that <italic>Lp</italic> cells are typically tolerant to erythromycin but killing is accelerated under conditions that make them tolerant to rifampin.</p><p>To determine whether antibiotic tolerance underlies the survival of <italic>Lp</italic> to erythromycin as well as to rifampin, we diluted 20- and 48 h cultures to a starting density of ~5 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, exposed them to a high concentration of erythromycin (2 µg/mL, 25X MIC), and monitored CFU/mL over time. Cells from a 20 h culture died significantly more rapidly than cells from a 48-hr-old culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that the differences in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) are explained by erythromycin tolerance. Further, increasing the pH of an <italic>Lp</italic> monoculture at 30 h and then exposing it after an additional 18 h of growth to 2 µg/mL erythromycin in fresh medium had an increase in the rate of killing that was similar to that achieved with a 20 h culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). These results highlight that the effects of changing the growth status of a culture on antibiotic response are not limited to rifampin and—as in the case of erythromycin—can be opposite.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our measurements of growth behavior in synthetic communities motivated by the natural context of the fly gut indicate that interspecies interactions impact both growth and the effect of antibiotics on individual species. The pH-based mechanism underlying the tolerance of <italic>Lp</italic> induced by <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species is intrinsically connected to the metabolic capacity of each species, and hence is likely to be generally relevant in more complex communities. Moreover, these findings could have important implications for human health, for example in the context of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-dominated vaginal microbiotas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boris and Barbés, 2000</xref>), hence their generality should be tested broadly in other contexts.</p><p>In this study, we observed a novel form of antibiotic tolerance. Tolerance has been defined as increased time to killing of the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brauner et al., 2017</xref>), as opposed to resistance (a change in the MIC), or persistence or heterotolerance whereby a subpopulation of bacteria displays increased time to killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Lp</italic> cells in monoculture rapidly died, while <italic>Lp</italic> cells in co-cultures showed close to 100% survival for extended periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Furthermore, the time and magnitude of pH change affected the kinetics of killing but not the size of the surviving population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). These behaviors contrast with the stereotypical rapid decrease in viability, with a small subpopulation of surviving cells, observed in persistence. At high doses and late time points, cell counts were below our limit of detection and therefore we cannot rule out that, in addition to tolerance, pH changes in stationary phase could also modulate persistence. Tolerance to beta lactams such as ampicillin has been observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures that exhibit slow growth or a long lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants with longer lag phases can be selected through experimental evolution to match the time of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these previous studies, we were surprised to find the opposite effect with rifampin on <italic>Lp</italic>: cultures with a shorter lag phase exhibited increased tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Moreover, although tolerance to erythromycin was associated with a longer lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,H</xref>), killing retardation was at least an order of magnitude longer than the change in lag time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,H</xref>), indicating that tolerance is not determined by an elongation of lag phase alone, in contrast to the effects of ampicillin on <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>). The opposite behaviors of <italic>Lp</italic> to rifampin and erythromycin upon pH changes suggest that tolerance is more complex than previously thought, and should motivate future investigations into the physiological and genetic basis of tolerance.</p><p>Several genetic factors that increase time to killing have been identified in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including toxin-antitoxin modules such as <italic>hipBA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rotem et al., 2010</xref>) that induce the stringent response and thus cause transient growth arrest. In <italic>Lp</italic> co-culture with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species, metabolic interactions alter the physiological state of <italic>Lp</italic> during late stationary phase by changing the environmental pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The stringent response is required to survive acid shock in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mouery et al., 2006</xref>) but not in <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abranches et al., 2009</xref>), which is in the same taxonomic order as <italic>Lp</italic>. In the case of <italic>Lp</italic>, whether the stringent response could be a major factor in the increased tolerance to rifampin is unclear due to the surprising connection with decreased lag.</p><p>The pH in stationary phase can affect many factors, such as the chemistry of extracellular metabolites and macromolecules as well as the surface of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, our assays of antibiotic sensitivities were all performed at a starting pH of 7. Nonetheless, shifts in extracellular pH can lead to buffered drops in cytoplasmic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi and Groisman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olsen et al., 2002</xref>) that can be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>) or result from internalization of low-p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> species such as short-chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ricke, 2003</xref>). Such changes could lead to protonation of macromolecules involved in adsorption or changes in the proton motive force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krulwich et al., 2011</xref>). How these factors affect non-polycationic antibiotics such as rifampin remains to be determined; neither of the ionizable functional groups of rifampin (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>s 1.7 and 7.9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maggi et al., 1966</xref>) nor erythromycin (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> 8.88 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McFarland et al., 1997</xref>) have p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub>s in the pH range achieved in our cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Protonation changes in target macromolecules could also lead to protection against antibiotics, although we would expect a subsequent change in MIC, contrary to our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Intracellular acidification by the short-chain fatty acid propionate has been proposed to lengthen lag phase in <italic>Salmonella</italic> in vitro and in the mouse gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with our finding that lag time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and intracellular pHluorin fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) are related.</p><p>Changes in intra- and extracellular pH have been shown to lead to transcriptional responses that provide cross-protection against antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McMahon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Sullivan and Condon, 1997</xref>), suggesting that the killing retardation due to a pH increase in stationary phase may result from a complex regulatory process. One major factor influencing the <italic>Lactobacillus-Acetobacter</italic> interaction is that these organisms form a recurrent community and may therefore have evolved to sense and benefit from each other’s presence. Further experiments are needed to uncover the molecular mechanisms that link growth state and susceptibility to antibiotics in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, other non-model organisms, and microbial communities. In addition, although we consistently observed related shifts in lag phase and tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), it remains to be established whether lag time and tolerance are causally linked or coupled to some global variable. The opposite connections with rifampin and erythromycin tolerance underscore the complexity of the link between growth and antibiotic action. Changes in growth may lead to changes in the levels and activity of these antibiotics’ molecular targets. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms that lead to death downstream of the antibiotic target could be a function of the growth state of the cell. Previous work has shown that bacterial interactions can elicit changes in antibiotic sensitivity by changing cellular physiology or interfering with antibiotic action directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamowicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radlinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In principle, a myriad of intra- and extracellular variables are subject to the composition and dynamics of the ecosystems that bacteria inhabit, and microbial communities within animal hosts can elicit changes in environmental variables both locally and globally. Specifically, the microaerobic and anaerobic microenvironments of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obadia et al., 2017</xref>) and human gastrointestinal tracts enable the growth of short chain fatty acid producers. Some of these short chain fatty acids, like butyrate, have been shown to play an important role on host physiology and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref>). The consequences of the accumulation of these short chain fatty acids and other small molecules on microenvironments, as well as their effect on bacterial physiology and antibiotic treatment efficacy in vivo, have yet to be systematically explored. Our findings linking short chain fatty acid metabolism, growth, and antibiotic action in commensal microbes from the fruit fly gut opens the door to studying these phenomena in a model organism. While the human gut microbiome comprises hundreds of bacterial species, the simplicity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong et al., 2011</xref>), the genetic tractability of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the fact that ~ 65% of human disease-causing genes have homologs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ugur et al., 2016</xref>), make the fruit fly a powerful model for host-microbiome interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas, 2018</xref>). Our results also emphasize the need to probe the action of antibiotics – as well as other drugs that are thought not to target microbial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maier et al., 2018</xref>) – in complex and varied conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beppler et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our findings highlight the utility of studying growth physiology in co-cultures in the absence of antibiotics for uncovering novel mechanisms of community-encoded protection against antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Flies were dissected under a stereo microscope and their guts were placed in 2 mL screw cap microtubes containing 200 µL of 0.1 mm sterile zirconia-silicate beads (BioSpec Products 11079101z) and 350 µL of sterile lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mg/mL lysozyme). Samples were homogenized by bead beating at maximum speed (Mini-Beadbeater, BioSpec Products) for 1 min. Proteinase K was added at 400 µg/mL and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C.

Redundant strain identities were collapsed into single OTUs. Common reagent contaminant strains were then removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salter et al., 2014</xref>). After filtering, only five unique species were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We isolated these species in culture and verified the taxonomic identity of our isolates using Sanger sequencing of the complete 16S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gould et al., 2018</xref>). At 97% OTU clustering, only three species were found: <italic>Acetobacter</italic> sp., <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic>. When less stringent FASTQ quality filtering was used, trace amounts (~0.01%) of two mammalian gut strains were identified: <italic>Blautia</italic> sp. and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> sp.

flies. The authors find that a strain of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> (Lp) is killed more slowly by rifampin when the bacteria are co-cultured with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species also found in fly guts. In this system, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> increases the pH of growth media through the release of lactate. <italic>Acetobacter</italic> reduce acidification and reduce the lag time of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in co-culture. It appears that the reduced impact of rifampin on <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in co-culture is driven by the impact that <italic>Acetobacter</italic> have on pH and lagtime. The reduced killing can be recapitulated by either altering the pH or the lagtime of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in monoculture. This work adds to the growing literature demonstrating that bacterial interactions can alter the impact of antibiotics. The described mechanism of increasing tolerance by reducing lag time is novel.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bacterial interspecies interactions modulate pH-mediated antibiotic tolerance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers and the evaluation was overseen by Wenying Shou as the Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jianxiao Song (Reviewer #2); Jeff Gore (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Understanding how antibiotics impact multi-species microbial communities is an important challenge to microbiology and medicine. In this study, the authors find that antibiotic tolerance of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp</italic>) to rifampicin increases in the presence of other members of the fruit fly microbiome, and that this increase in tolerance is mediated by pH changes of the media induced by microbial metabolism. Surprisingly, the increase in tolerance was associated with a decrease in the lag time, which is the opposite of what has been observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with ampicillin (and also opposite to what we would expect based on the rule of thumb that non-growing cells are better able to survive antibiotics).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers liked this work. They would like to see some clarifications and more clear writing - please see the points below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Aranda-Diaz et al., describe how microbial interactions alter the impact of antibiotics on bacteria found in the gut of fruit flies. The described mechanism of increasing tolerance by reducing lag time is novel.</p><p>One question I have is whether the increased tolerance could be the result of growth compensating for the number of dying cells or instead is purely a matter of cells dying at a slower rate. For example, if the cells were inoculated into carbon-free media and therefore could not replicate would the change in death rate still be observed?</p><p>I also think that there is room for clarifying the writing. For example, it would be helpful to have more information on how the bacterial strains were isolated. Were all strains isolated at the same time or were strains reported in previous papers isolated at different times. Did any of the strains come from the same fly? Similarly, it seems that asterisks are not used in a consistent manner in figures making it difficult to determine which results are significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The figures in the manuscript are titled with Fig X or Figure X…), while the figure legends are titled with Figure X. Please change them to have consistent names (either Figure X or Fig.X) across the whole manuscript including supporting information.</p><p>2) Reformulate the first sentence of subsection “Co-culturing leads to growth of <italic>Lp</italic> in stationary phase”.</p><p>3) Please clarify the implication on human gastrointestinal tracts, which is more complex by studying fly gut microbiota in the Discussion section.</p><p>4) Discussion section, please be very careful with the definition of tolerance and resistance (as well as the differences between tolerance and resistance).</p><p>5) Discussion section, “or result from” should be changed to “or resulted from”.</p><p>6) Figure 1 legend, please indicate the meaning of the dashed line the exact MIC in Figure 1B or the figure legend and to make the figure self-understandable without reading the whole manuscript. Figure 1C legend, CFUs of <italic>Lp</italic> grown in monoculture (Lp) or in co-culture with Ax-cocultures was Normalized to CFUs at t=0? The figure legends in Figure 2C are confusing. Please revise it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors should do a more thorough search for published papers on pH and antibiotics to set the proper stage. An example is Karslake et al.

For example, if the cells were inoculated into carbon-free media and therefore could not replicate would the change in death rate still be observed?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a very interesting point. To address this question, we imaged cells from an <italic>Lp</italic>+<italic>Ap</italic> co-cultureon MRS pads with rifampin. From these experiments, we did not observe any growth taking place, so it does not appear that the increased tolerance is due to a shift in the balance of growth and death. The new data is in Figure 1—figure supplement 2E.</p><p>We included the following text:</p><p>“To test whether the increased time to death was due to a disruption in the balance of growth and death, we performed single-cell imaging of mono- and co-cultures on MRS agarose with 50 µg/mL rifampin. We observed no growth in either mono- or co-cultures over 3 h of imaging (<italic>n</italic>=568 and <italic>n</italic>=236 cells, respectively; Figure 1—figure supplement 2D), indicating that survivability is due to protection from death, as opposed to increased growth. Because the MIC of <italic>Lp</italic> was unchanged in co-cultures compared with monocultures (no resistance), and the delay in killing was observed in the bulk population in co-cultures, these results indicate that co-culturing <italic>Lp</italic> with <italic>Ap</italic> induces tolerance of <italic>Lp</italic> to rifampin (Balaban et al., 2019; Brauner et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think that there is room for clarifying the writing. For example, it would be helpful to have more information on how the bacterial strains were isolated. Were all strains isolated at the same time or were strains reported in previous papers isolated at different times. Did any of the strains come from the same fly?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insight into whether strains that are isolated together have more interactions. The strains used in this study were isolated from pools of flies and hence we cannot identify whether any came from the same animal. We note that these are the same strains that we have used in previous publications (Obadia et al.,2017 and Gould et al.,2018). This deep question about strain-level changes to interactions goes beyond the scope of this study, but we are actively investigating this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, it seems that asterisks are not used in a consistent manner in figures making it difficult to determine which results are significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We have now corrected any inconsistencies and clarified any multiple hypothesis corrections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The figures in the manuscript are titled with Fig X or Figure X…), while the figure legends are titled with Figure X.

They now read:</p><p>“To investigate possible environmental factors that could be linked to <italic>Lp</italic> tolerance to rifampin when co-cultured with <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species (Figure 1C,E), we first inquired whether the total amount of growth of the co-culture was larger or smaller than expected from the yield of the monocultures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify the implication on human gastrointestinal tracts, which is more complex by studying fly gut microbiota in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the implications of our results on the human GI tract by adding the following text:</p><p>“Our findings linking short chain fatty acid metabolism, growth, and antibiotic action in commensal microbes from the fruit fly gut opens the door to studying these phenomena in a model organism. While the human gut microbiome comprises hundreds of bacterial species, the simplicity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut microbiota (Wong et al., 2011), the genetic tractability of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the fact that ~65% of human disease-causing genes have homologs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (Ugur et al., 2016), make the fruit fly a powerful model for host-microbiome interactions (Douglas, 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion section, please be very careful with the definition of tolerance and resistance (as well as the differences between tolerance and resistance).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point and have been very careful about the definitions in our manuscript by reviewing a recent review by Balaban et al., that seeks to clarify definitions of persistence and tolerance. We have modified the following paragraph in the Introduction:</p><p>“Bacteria can survive antibiotics through (i) resistance mutations, which counteract the antibiotic mechanism and increase the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); (ii) tolerance, whereby the entire population enters an altered physiological state that prolongs survivability without changing the MIC of the antibiotic, leading to an increase in the time required to kill a given fraction of the population; (iii) heteroresistance, whereby a subset of the population has a higher MIC and grows at concentrations that would otherwise kill the population; and (iv) persistence, whereby a subset of the population survives treatment for a longer period (Balaban et al., 2019; Brauner et al., 2016).”</p><p>The lines mentioned by the reviewer now read:</p><p>“In this study, we observed a novel form of antibiotic tolerance. Tolerance has been defined as increased time to killing of the population as a whole (Brauner et al., 2017), as opposed to resistance (a change in the MIC), or persistence or heterotolerance whereby a subpopulation of bacteria displays increased time to killing (Balaban et al., 2019; Brauner et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion section, “or result from” should be changed to “or resulted from”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1 legend, please indicate the meaning of the dashed line the exact MIC in Figure 1B or the figure legend and to make the figure self-understandable without reading the whole manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we have added a label to the dashed line to the figure and clarified the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C legend, CFUs of Lp grown in monoculture (Lp) or in co-culture with Ax-cocultures was Normalized to CFUs at t=0?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we have explained the normalizations in all legends more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figure legends in Figure 2C are confusing.

The authors should do a more thorough search for published papers on pH and antibiotics to set the proper stage. An example is Karslake et al. (2016) (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005098).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate all of the reviewer’s feedback. We have included the reference above, and others to set the stage for our discussion of pH and antibiotics. The following paragraph was modified in the Introduction:</p><p>“For example, the intimate relationship between bacterial metabolism and environmental pH could also lead to changes in antibiotic efficacy, as previously shown in monocultures (Aagaard et al., 1991; Argemi et al., 2013; Kamberi et al., 1999; Karslake et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014). The interplay of all of these processes in complex communities will provide new ways to combat pathogen survival and resistance evolution, particularly in cases involving tolerance, an important and understudied aspect of antibiotic susceptibility that can be elicited by diverse mechanisms and can facilitate the evolution of resistance (Levin-Reisman et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>I thought that this study illuminated a fascinating consequence of growth in the context of a multi-species community, and that many of the lessons could have broad implications.

Changes in growth may lead to changes in the levels and activity of these antibiotics’ molecular targets. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms that lead to death downstream of the antibiotic target could be a function of the growth state of the cell.Previous work has shown that bacterial interactions can elicit changes in antibiotic sensitivity by changing cellular physiology or interfering with antibiotic action directly or indirectly (Adamowicz et al., 2018; Radlinski et al., 2017; Sorg et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, in the Results section I think that the authors should be more clear about the direction of the effect and that this is a surprise (this is done in the Discussion section, but a short comment about it in the Results section may be appropriate).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this point to the Results section in the following paragraph:</p><p>“We previously observed for <italic>Lp</italic> monocultures when shifting the pH that the stimulation of growth in stationary phase was connected with a shorter lag phase (Figure 3E).In agreement with these data, there was a significant decrease in bulk lag time for all of the <italic>Acetobacter</italic> co-cultures (Figure 4A,B).
