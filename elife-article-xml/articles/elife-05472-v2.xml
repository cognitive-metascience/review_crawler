A systematic study of their collective function, however, is lacking and forms the focus of this study. We functionally reconstitute a two-dimensional actin-myosin interface using myosin V and VI precisely patterned on DNA nanostructures, in combination with a model keratocyte actin meshwork. While scaffolds display solely unidirectional movement, their directional flux is modulated by both actin architecture and the structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux can be finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each scaffold. Pairing computation with experimental observations suggests that the ratio of motor stall forces is a key determinant of the observed competitive outcomes.

These vesicles can travel along filaments made of a protein called actin, which forms a network that criss-crosses the cell. A family of motor proteins called myosin bind to the vesicles and are responsible for pulling them along the actin filaments. For example, myosin V pulls vesicles towards the ‘plus-end’ of the filament or the outer edges of the cell, while myosin VI pulls them in the opposite direction towards the ‘minus-end’ or the interior of the cell.</p><p>Both proteins are often found on the same vesicle, and it is not clear in which direction such a vesicle will move. Hariadi et al. have shed new light on this question by sticking different combinations of myosin V and myosin VI proteins to a tiny nanostructure made of DNA and using a microscope to watch it move on actin.</p><p>When a nanostructure with one myosin V and one myosin VI protein was placed on a single actin filament, it moved towards the plus-end of the filament. However, when it was placed on a two-dimensional network of actin filaments, the nanostructure was equally likely to move in either direction. Therefore, the architecture of the actin filaments influences the outcome of the competition between the two motor proteins.</p><p>When both types of myosin protein were present, the nanostructure was pulled along the filament more slowly than when only one type was present. This suggests that myosin V and myosin VI are involved in a ‘tug of war’ on the actin filament. Next, Hariadi et al. altered the numbers of myosin V and myosin VI proteins on the nanostructure. The direction in which the nanostructure moved depended on the ratio of motor proteins present: when there were more myosin V proteins than myosin VI proteins, the nanostructure moved towards the plus-end, and vice versa.</p><p>Hariadi et al.'s findings suggest that cells direct the movement of vesicles around a cell by altering the relative number of myosin V and myosin VI proteins bound to each vesicle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05472.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05472.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>unconventional myosin</kwd><kwd>DNA nanotechnology</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd><kwd>single molecule biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-R01-GM-105646-01-A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sivaramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sivaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13SDG14270009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sivaramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sivaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2 CA186752-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sivaramakrishnan</surname><given-names>Sivaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sommese</surname><given-names>Ruth F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Competition between the antagonistic motor proteins myosin V and myosin VI finely tunes unidirectional transport of cargo on different actin architectures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane sorting in the secretory and endocytic pathways occurs in the midst of the actin cytoskeleton, and involves a range of unconventional myosins that link membrane components to the actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>). However, traditional reconstituted systems to study membrane traffic do not incorporate the effects of actin-myosin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, while unconventional myosins are necessary for timely membrane traffic, their functional role is not apparent in live cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sahlender et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>). The bulk of our knowledge of unconventional myosin function instead stems from single molecule biophysical and structural studies, which demonstrate distinct functional regimes for actin-myosin interactions including bi-directional motion, unidirectional transport, and mechano-sensitive anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trybus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</xref>). There remains, however, a considerable gap between the insights gained from single-motor studies and a mechanistic understanding of cargo transport in living cells. Furthermore, membrane trafficking often involves multiple disparate motor types, and their collective function cannot be trivially extrapolated from single molecule studies. In this study, we focus on myosin V and VI, two opposing unconventional myosins that co-reside on membrane vesicles in neuronal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suter et al., 2000</xref>). Myosin V has been implicated in secretory traffic, whereas myosin VI facilitates timely endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>). Individual myosin V and VI molecules within a transport ensemble may coordinate, cooperate, or mechanically impede one another to influence collective movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, studies with mixed motor ensembles are essential to define the function of myosins in membrane trafficking.</p><p>All myosins share a conserved catalytic domain that converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into a unidirectional mechanical stroke of the motor lever arm. In the case of myosin V and VI, they are considered evenly matched antagonistic motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trybus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Both motors are thought to bind membrane cargo as dimers; myosin V through a coiled-coil motif following its lever arm that natively homodimerizes it, and myosin VI presumably through dimeric adaptor proteins that link it to cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buss and Kendrick-Jones, 2008</xref>). Homodimers of either myosin move processively on actin filaments with similar step sizes (V—36 nm; VI—30 nm), stepping kinetics (V –12 s<sup>−1</sup>; VI –9 s<sup>−1</sup>), and stall forces (V ∼3 pN; VI ∼2 pN) albeit in opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rief et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishikawa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yildiz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Uemura et al., 2004</xref>). All myosin levers, with the exception of myosin VI, swing towards the barbed (plus) end of the actin filament. In the case of myosin VI, a unique insert reverses the direction of its lever stroke towards the pointed (minus) end of the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</xref>). With the plus-ends of actin networks oriented toward the cell periphery, plus-end directed myosin V thus contributes to exocytosis, whereas minus-end directed myosin VI is critical to endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, despite their many similarities, myosin V and VI have structurally distinct lever arms. The myosin V lever consists of six light chain binding IQ-motifs wrapped with calmodulin light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trybus, 2008</xref>). The myosin VI lever is composed of two calmodulin-binding IQ-motifs followed by a pliable proximal tail domain, and a semi-rigid single α-helical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spudich and Sivaramakrishnan, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Translating the detailed structural understanding of individual myosin V and VI into cellular function, specifically when they cohabit the same scaffold, remains an outstanding challenge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al. (2011)</xref> reported that tethering a single myosin V and a single VI homodimer on a quantum dot leads to unidirectional motion on single actin filaments, with myosin V dominating the competition (79% of processive runs towards the plus-end of actin filaments). We recently extended this finding to DNA nanostructures containing two myosin V and two myosin VI molecules interacting with a keratocyte-derived actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>). While we did observe solely unidirectional movement, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al. (2011)</xref>, myosin V and VI were evenly matched in our system (52% of processive runs towards the keratocyte cell periphery). Our previous study focused on trajectory shapes and did not address this observed discrepancy in the outcome of the competition. Further, the generality of these observations for different ratios of myosin V and VI and the mechanisms that control directionality remain unexplored and form the focus of this study.</p><p>Here, we use DNA nanotechnology to precisely scaffold defined collections of myosin V and VI and pair it with both single actin filaments and a model cellular actin network derived from the extensive lamellipodium of fish epidermal keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>), we observe solely unidirectional movement regardless of actin architecture or relative myosin number. However, for matched scaffolds we find that the directional flux is dependent on both actin architecture and the structural properties of the myosin lever arm. This directional flux is finely-tuned by the relative number of myosin V and VI motors on each scaffold. By pairing computation and experiment, we identify a single mechanical parameter that defines regimes in any motor ensemble wherein this mechanism is likely to be observed. Overall, our study demonstrates an elegant mechanism for sorting of membrane cargo simply by modulating the relative number of engagement sites for each motor type. For matched, but opposing motors such as myosin V and VI, this mechanism is necessary and sufficient to precisely control sorting of tethered scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Combining DNA nanostructures with defined motor composition and 1D/2D actin tracks</title><p>To investigate the role of actin organization in trafficking, DNA nanostructures containing a defined number of antagonistic myosins (V and VI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were examined on two distinct actin architectures, namely one-dimensional actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D,F</xref>) and dense two-dimensional actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Svitkina and Borisy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schaus et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E,G</xref>). Precise positioning of myosin V and VI on the origami scaffold was achieved using myosins labeled with single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides complementary to attachment sequences projecting from the scaffold strand (1–6 per scaffold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Experiments involving 1D actin filaments provide a confined set of actin-myosin interactions, with each myosin having either a forward (red rectangle) or a backward (gray rectangle) binding site available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The 2D actin networks, on the other hand, provide a more complex energy landscape for the myosins to navigate, as there are multiple binding sites for both forward (red arc) and backward (gray arc) steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05472.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of myosin-driven cargo sorting on 1D and 2D actin tracks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of a programmable DNA scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rothemund, 2006</xref>) with six attachment sites at the vertices of a hexagon (dashed-line, 35-nm side), yielding 122 unique myosin V and VI combinations.

However, they disagree in the observed outcome of the competition. Myosin V dominates the competition (79%) when it is tethered to myosin VI through a quantum dot (2 total) and the two compete on a single actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, myosin V and VI are evenly matched (myosin V wins 52%) when two of each motor (4 total) are tethered to a DNA nanostructure and they compete on a two-dimensional cellular actin network. This discrepancy between the observations could stem from either the scaffold type (quantum dot vs DNA nanostructure), the total motor number (2 vs 4), or the actin architecture (single filament vs keratocyte-derived actin network). We first tested the influence of scaffold type by assessing the competition between a single myosin V dimer and a single myosin VI dimer on 1D actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In positive controls, ØV:2VI scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) move toward the minus-end of the actin filaments, whereas 2V:ØVI scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) travel toward the plus-end. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>), scaffolds with both myosin V and myosin VI (1V:1VI) commit to a single direction on actin filaments (&gt;99%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with no directional reversal detected. The movement of 1V:1VI scaffolds on single actin filaments is dominated by plus-end directed movement (Φ<sub><italic>out</italic></sub> = 68 ± 1%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is qualitatively consistent with previous observations using quantum dot scaffolds (79% plus-end directed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>]).

Likewise, the speed of nanostructure movement on the keratocyte network decreases as the difference in the number of the two motor types approaches zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These reductions in speed with antagonistic motors are in agreement with the previously published experiments involving quantum dots conjugated to one myosin V and one myosin VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>). Based on the reduction in speed for antagonistic ensembles, as compared to groups of one myosin type, we hypothesized that all of the motors can continuously interact with the actin tracks and collectively engage in competition. To test this hypothesis, scaffolds were formed with three myosin V and three myosin VI (3V:3VI), where one of the motor types was attached by photo-cleavable linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Regardless of which motor type is cleaved, removal of one myosin type from the competition increases the speed and results in a single direction of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). The directional switch and increase in speed after photo-cleavage indicate that all motors, regardless of type, are able to access the actin tracks and engage in continuous competition. Together, these observations suggest that the collective movement is due to a continuous interaction of both motor types, and not due to detachment of losing motors from the actin track (or scaffold), when overpowered by the winning motor. Lastly, the underlying continuous interaction is also consistent with our previous observation that myosin V changes the trajectory shape of ensembles of myosin V and VI on 2D actin tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05472.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Disengagement of one motor species resolves the competition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Schematics of mixed-motor scaffolds (gray hexagons) with three myosin V (<bold>A</bold>; red arrows) or three myosin VI (<bold>B</bold>; blue arrows) attached by photo-cleavable linkers.

To test this model, we engineered a myosin V/VI chimera containing the myosin V motor domain with the flexible myosin VI lever arm and a myosin VI/V chimera consisting of the myosin VI motor domain with a rigid myosin V lever arm. These chimeras allow us to assess the competition involving opposing motors with similar lever arm rigidity, specifically 1V/VI:1VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (<italic>i</italic>); flexible vs flexible) and 1VI/V:1V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (<italic>ii</italic>); rigid vs rigid).

Myosin V is implicated in secretory traffic, whereas myosin VI is important for timely endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sahlender et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kneussel and Wagner, 2013</xref>). While previous studies have examined the competition between myosin V and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>), a systematic measurement of their collective behavior is unexplored and formed the focus of this study. We report that while antagonistic motor ensembles display solely unidirectional movement, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>), their directional sorting can be linearly tuned by the relative number of the two motor types. Further, this directional sorting can be modulated independently by the myosin lever arm and the actin architecture. These observations support a simple generalizable model, wherein competitive outcome is dependent on the ratio of the stall forces of the antagonistic motor types. Taken together, our findings provide an elegant mechanism for regulating vesicle sorting mediated by unconventional myosins, without the need to either segregate motor subtypes to distinct cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>) or engage regulatory proteins that preferentially modulate the accessibility or activity of one of the motor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>).</p><p>One model for the observed unidirectional transport is that only a single myosin on the DNA scaffold interacts with the actin network at any given time. Under these conditions, the probability of movement towards the cell center or periphery is proportional to the relative number of myosin VI or V, respectively. However, this mechanism for the observed sorting is refuted by four distinct observations. First, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>), scaffold run length linearly increases with motor number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that multiple motors on the same scaffold are capable of interacting with the actin network. Second, scaffold speed changes substantially with varying number and type of myosin motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For scaffolds with a given number of myosins, those with a single subtype move faster than those with both myosin V and VI. The reduction in speed with both myosin subtypes is consistent with the trailing myosin interacting with the actin network, despite the unidirectional movement of the scaffold. This interpretation is consistent with the coordinated back-stepping of the trailing motor observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al. (2007)</xref>. Third, for scaffolds with both subtypes the speed decreases as the numbers of myosin V and VI are more evenly matched. This systematic reduction in speed alone argues for progressive engagement of additional antagonistic motors with the actin network. Fourth, experiments with photo-cleavable myosin-scaffold linkages further show that removal of the antagonistic myosin leads to either an increase in speed (release trailing motor) or a reversal in direction (release leading motor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Altogether, given these observations we propose an alternate model that emphasizes inter-motor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our model identifies the ratio of the stall forces (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>high</italic></sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>low</italic></sub>) of the antagonistic motors as the key parameter that determines the outcome of scaffold sorting on 1D or 2D actin filament tracks. For ensembles with mismatched motors (<italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> &gt; 2), the model predicts unidirectional movement led solely by the stronger motor. However, for motors of similar strength (1 &lt; <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> &lt; 2), the model predicts that either motor may lead the unidirectional motion, with the directional flux of scaffolds dependent on <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. These predictions are consistent with the unidirectional movement observed here, and in a previous report based on experiments using a single myosin V and a single myosin VI attached to a quantum dot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2011</xref>). Further, the model is in agreement with a recent report of unidirectional trajectories for DNA scaffolds linked to both kinesins and dyneins on 1D microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Derr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). However, it differs from the bi-directional movement of isolated endosomes that are driven by a combination of native kinesin and dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate, though, that bi-directional movement stems from the influence of additional regulatory elements on native endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kunwar et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, our model explains the differences in sorting observed in actin filaments vs 2D networks, and the role of the myosin lever arm in regulating sorting. In essence, motors with greater intra-motor torsional strain (rigid lever) experience a larger inter-motor tension per step and hence lose their competitive edge on 2D networks.</p><p>The lever arm of myosin is primarily regarded as a mechanical amplifier in its chemo–mechanical cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spink et al., 2008</xref>). Our study, however, suggests a broader regulatory role for the lever arm in membrane trafficking. We find that the structural properties of the myosin lever arm control the directional flux of scaffolds on our model cellular actin network, thus having implications on sorting of vesicular cargo. Beyond this observation, structural elements in myosins have been shown to influence motility on actin networks. For instance, an extension of the myosin X lever arm is necessary for its preferential processive movement on parallel actin bundles, but not on single actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brawley and Rock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nagy and Rock, 2010</xref>). Myosin VI, on the other hand, has a unique three-helix bundle in its lever arm, which can unfold to alter the motor's structural properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mukherjea et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, for groups of myosin V and VI, the flexibility of the lever arm controls trajectory shapes on 2D actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hariadi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to myosin structure, actin architecture also influences myosin function. For example, single myosin V and VI have different stepping dynamics at actin filament intersections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2007</xref>) then on actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). An in situ motility assay using detergent-extracted cells also reported that individual myosin V, VI, and X dimers show preferential motility on different actin architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brawley and Rock, 2009</xref>). Together, these studies suggest a subtler regulation of cellular processes that emerges from unique structural features in myosins that modulate either individual or collective actin-myosin interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Buffer and reagents</title><p>1× Assay Buffer (AB Buffer): 25 mM imidazole (pH 7.5), 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT; 1× AB.BSA: AB buffer + 1 mg/ml BSA; 1× AB.BSA.CAM: AB.BSA buffer + 9 µM calmodulin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Preparation of Benzyl-guanine-labeled oligonucleotide</title><p>Benzyl-guanine NHS ester (BG-GLA-NHS; NEB, Ipswich, MA) was covalently linked to the C6-amine modified oligonucleotides (BG-oligo 1 and BG-oligo 5; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) All reviewers found it difficult to evaluate this paper without reference to your recent 2014 PNAS paper. In some aspects (e.g., the flexural rigidity of the motor dimers) the new paper is almost supplementary to the PNAS paper. But in other aspects (speed and direction of movement, as opposed to trajectory) the new paper makes original points. The paper also has a compelling final model that simply explains the results over various conditions of the study yet assumes only a limited number of motor properties (ratio of motor stall forces, stepping rates, stiffness of intermotor linkage and motor lever arm stiffness). The reviewers request that you more clearly distinguish the new results from the previous ones in the Introduction and Discussion, rewriting as necessary. For example, in the last paragraph of the Introduction claim 3 findings: point 3 was clearly made in the PNAS paper and point 1 was partly addressed there before.</p><p>2) Please address the substantive concerns of Reviewers 1 and 2 below. It does not appear that any of these concerns will need new experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) In the subsection headed “Actin architecture influences cargo sorting of antagonistic motor assemblies”, why do results differ from previous results? Please explain.</p><p>2) In the same section: the track persistence is an important point that is not discussed. I understand that it discussed in the PNAS paper, but not in the same conditions of relative motor number, and it is striking from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that the tracks are sometimes very short depending on the number of motors. The absolute velocities should be given in the text at that point, compared with single motor velocities, and discussed. It seems from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that two same motors together move 3 times slower than a single one. Can this be explained? The number of different experiments should be indicated in the figure legend.</p><p>3) Model: the yellow spring <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> could be better defined. As I understand it is the spring constant of the DNA scaffold? Or is it the one of the motor tail? By the way, how much do we expect? Are we only interested in the relative value of this spring constant with the flexural rigidity? The flexural rigidity k<sub>F</sub> is not clearly defined (“as previously described [in the PNAS paper]”, in the subsection “Stochastic simulations identify key parameters that drive unidirectional movement”), whereas the spring constant k<sub>s</sub>, which is very classical, is well defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. More effort should be made in making clear to the author what k<sub>F</sub> exactly represents (although, again, this can be found in the PNAS paper).</p><p>4) Simulations: I understand that simulations are done in 1D? One question that arises is how the structure of the actin network could influence the results? How can one myosin jump on an Arp2/3 branch? Does the length of the trajectory correspond to a single branch? These questions could be addressed by a 2D simulation. Along the same line, “both motors take forward steps stochastically in opposite directions” (in the subsection “Stochastic simulations identify key parameters that drive unidirectional movement”); is that true also on 2D networks?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, it is not clear why PHI=90% when deltaT=0. Please explain.</p><p>6) In the same subsection, could the network structure explain that PHI is significantly lower than on single filaments? Could the authors compare track persistence between single filaments and 2D networks? Can the authors comment on step size compared to network mesh size?</p><p>7) In the beginning of the Discussion, it is very important that motor assemblies are in steady state motion. Since the authors have simulations, I would expect some explanation. What would change directionality? Can the authors propose a way of testing it experimentally?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>1) In the subsection “Actin architecture influences cargo sorting of antagonistic motor assemblies”, the authors mention that the plus-end biased flux differs from their findings in Hariadi et al., PNAS, 2014; why?</p><p>2) What is the physiologically relevant actin network architecture on which transport takes place? If it's the actin cortex, which is a tight meshwork of isotropically oriented filaments, then how well is it really modeled by the branched architecture of actin in the lamellipodium?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05472.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) All reviewers found it difficult to evaluate this paper without reference to your recent 2014 PNAS paper.

Individual responses to the referees’ comments are shown below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) In the subsection headed “Actin architecture influences cargo sorting of antagonistic motor assemblies”, why do results differ from previous results? Please explain</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion in the organization of the initial sections of the manuscript (see response (a)) to the Reviewing Editor). We have now extensively re-written the second section of the Results to delineate the contributions of scaffold type (quantum dot versus DNA nanostructure), motor number, and actin architecture. Further, we have clearly stated in the Introduction (paragraphs 3 and 4) the information derived from previous studies, the questions left unanswered, and subsequently the results of the current study.</p><p><italic>2) In the same section: the track persistence is an important point that is not discussed. I understand that it discussed in the PNAS paper, but not in the same conditions of relative motor number</italic>,</p><p>The run length was not a significant new finding in this manuscript. However, we agree that this is an important aspect that needs to be delineated. We have now appended a supplementary table of the mean run lengths for all experimental conditions (<italic>x</italic>V:<italic>y</italic>VI; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>And it is striking from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>that the tracks are sometimes very short depending on the number of motors</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewer astutely points out, some of the trajectories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are very short. We expect that the run length for each <italic>x</italic>V:<italic>y</italic>VI competition condition to follow an exponential distribution with PDF(x) = λ<sup>–1</sup> e<sup>–x/λ</sup>, where λ is the mean run length. As a consequence, the probability of observing very short trajectories is not negligible. As an example, for a run length distribution with mean λ = 1000 nm, the probability to observe a trajectory that is shorter than 300 nm is CDF(<italic>x</italic> = 300 nm) = 1–e<sup>–x/λ</sup> = 1–e<sup>–(300 nm)/(1000 nm)</sup> = 26%.</p><p>The relatively short mean run lengths are consistent with the previously published mean run lengths for 1V:1VI competition experiments along 1D actin filaments, albeit with quantum dot scaffolds (Ali et al.<italic>,</italic> PNAS, 2011). In that study, the mean run lengths of the plus-end and negative-end directed movements of 1V:1VI scaffolds on 1D actin filaments were measured to be 0.54 µm and 0.63 µm, respectively. Ali et al.'s measurements are similar to our results for the movement 1V:1VI scaffolds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) along 1D filaments (0.59–0.77 µm) and on 2D actin networks (0.63–0.64 µm).</p><p><italic>The absolute velocities should be given in the text at that point, compared with single motor velocities, and discussed</italic>.</p><p>We have added the absolute speed in the main text and compared the measured mixed ensemble speeds with single motor type ensemble speeds (paragraph 4 of the Results section).</p><p><italic>It seems from</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>that two same motors together move 3 times slower than a single one</italic>. <italic>Can this be explained?</italic></p><p>Multi-myosin V and VI ensembles have been shown to move at significantly slower speeds compared to single myosins (Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, JCB, 2009, Lu et al., JBC, 2012).

For two motor assemblies the effective spring constant can be modeled as three springs in series, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><sup>–1</sup> = <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>myosin1</italic></sub><sup>–1</sup> + <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>DNA</italic></sub><sup>–1</sup> + <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>myosin2</italic></sub><sup>–1</sup>, where <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>DNA</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>myosin</italic></sub> are the stiffness of the DNA nano-structure and myosin motors, respectively. Here, we assume that both myosin V and VI have similar stiffness under tension. Since DNA is more rigid polymer than the myosin molecule (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>DNA</italic></sub>&gt;&gt;<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>myosin</italic></sub>), the previous equation reduces to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> ∼ <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>myosin</italic></sub> / 2.</p><p><italic>By the way</italic>, <italic>how much do we expect?</italic></p><p>The stiffness of dimeric myosin V has been measured to be 0.18 – 0.35 pN/nm (Veigel et al., Nat Cell Bio 2001), which leads to <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> ∼ 0.09 – 0.18 pN/nm.

It was unclear in our initial submission if ∆<italic>T</italic> is sensitive to the absolute value of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> or just their ratio (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>). To answer the referee's question, we ran additional simulations of collective movement of one motor type with different <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>'s and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>'s on 2D networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplements 3</xref>). These simulations predict that the ∆<italic>T</italic> is sensitive to the absolute value of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> in addition to their relative value. Therefore, in the revised manuscript, we plotted the directional flux as a function of <italic>∆T</italic><sub><italic>high</italic></sub> <italic>/ ∆T</italic><sub><italic>low</italic></sub>, instead of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F,high</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>F,low</italic></sub>.</p><p><italic>The flexural rigidity k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>is not clearly defined (</italic>“<italic>as previously described [in the PNAS paper]</italic>”<italic>, in the subsection</italic> “<italic>Stochastic simulations identify key parameters that drive unidirectional movement</italic>”<italic>), whereas the spring constant k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub><italic>, which is very classical, is well defined in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>.

One question that arises is how the structure of the actin network could influence the results? How can one myosin jump on an Arp2/3 branch? Does the length of the trajectory correspond to a single branch? These questions could be addressed by a 2D simulation. Along the same line,</italic> “<italic>both motors take forward steps stochastically in opposite directions</italic>” <italic>(in the subsection</italic> “<italic>Stochastic simulations identify key parameters that drive unidirectional movement</italic>”<italic>); is that true also on 2D networks</italic>?</p><p>Yes, the simulations for both 1D and 2D conditions are along a 1D track. In the revision (paragraph 7 of the Results section) we now state this upfront along with the rationale for simulating both 1D and 2D conditions along a 1D track. Specifically, one major effect of stepping in 2D is that the inter-motor tension (∆<italic>T</italic>) is now dependent on the flexural rigidity (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>) of the forward stepping motor. Since we were primarily interested in the outcome of the competition, this parameter was incorporated in 1D simulations by varying (∆<italic>T</italic>) based on the relative flexural rigidity (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>). It was not our intent to simulate either a single branch or capture features such as the Arp2/3 complex that might influence myosin movement. We sincerely apologize for the confusion, as it is evident that the original submission was unclear in its description of rationale and methodology. The reviewer does raise an interesting point regarding the influence of the structure of the actin network. To address this, we ran 2D simulations with actin networks of different mesh sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). While the actin network mesh size did alter the absolute values of ∆<italic>T</italic> for a given <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>, ∆<italic>T</italic> does significantly increase with <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> <italic>/ k</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> supporting the underlying argument for approximating 2D conditions with a 1D track.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>, it is not clear why PHI=90% when deltaT=0. Please explain</italic>.</p><p>We are grateful that the referee caught this error in our simulation. As hinted by the referee, as ∆T approaches 0, all collective movements should be dominated by the stronger motor (Φ=100%). The erroneous value reported in the first submission stemmed from an error in our implementation of the software algorithm. We have thoroughly proof-read our software code, re-run the stochastic simulations, and replaced the incorrect plots with the latest simulation outputs in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5E</xref>. Although the graphs in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 5E</xref> do change as a result of this exercise, the conclusion of our model in the originally submitted paper is still valid. Because the change was made in the computer code, and not to the simulation algorithm, we did not make any revision to the simulation section in the Materials and methods. We will make the software code freely available upon request.</p><p><italic>6) In the same subsection, could the network structure explain that PHI is significantly lower than on single filaments</italic>?</p><p>The reviewer’s point is well taken. It is possible that an asymmetry in the actin architecture (looking towards the cell center or the cell periphery) could influence Φ such that myosin VI has an advantage. However, our ability to reverse directional flux by altering the myosin lever arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests otherwise. Specifically, providing myosin V with the flexible lever of myosin VI significantly biases the flux in favor of myosin V. In this experiment, the myosin still moves in the same direction but with an altered lever arm. Hence, while network structure could bias Φ relative to single actin filaments it does not appear to be a dominant effect.</p><p><italic>Could the authors compare track persistence between single filaments and 2D networks</italic>?</p><p>To address this question, we quantified the run lengths for all <italic>x</italic>V:<italic>y</italic>VI scaffolds on 1D actin filaments and 2D keratocyte actin networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). On both actin architectures, the measured run lengths are limited by the actin filament length (∼25 µm) or keratocyte width (∼5 µm). Scaffolds that reach the tip of an actin filament or keratocyte edge have to end their movement prematurely. Therefore, a direct comparison of mean run lengths in the 2 actin tracks is not very meaningful. Ignoring the finite actin effect, the mean run length for the +end and –end directed movement of 1V:1VI scaffolds along single filaments and on 2D networks are qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Can the authors comment on step size compared to network mesh size</italic>?</p><p>The mesh size (∼30 nm) is comparable to the step size of myosin V and VI along single actin filament (∼35 nm) and significantly smaller than the dimensions of the rectangular scaffolds (∼100 nm). The mean pore size of the keratocyte actin network has been measured to be ∼30 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Svitkina et al., 1995</xref>) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E and 1G</xref>. We have now added this information to the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The schematics are drawn approximately to scale.</p><p><italic>7) In the beginning of the Discussion, it is very important that motor assemblies are in steady state motion. Since the authors have simulations, I would expect some explanation</italic>.</p><p>As stated earlier, all of our simulations are conducted along 1D tracks. The simulations continue until one of the motors win. Subsequently, for motors with matched stall forces (1&lt; <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> &lt; 2) the leading motor steps to increase the inter-motor tension while the trailing motor steps to decrease it. The trailing motor is not able to take an additional forward step in this scenario. This was the intent of our statement of a ‘quasi-steady state’. We realize that we do not have direct evidence besides our simulation to back up this statement. Hence, this sentence has now been removed from the main text of the manuscript. A complete description of the outcome of the simulation is now limited to the Methods section of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>What would change directionality? Can the authors propose a way of testing it experimentally</italic>?</p><p>Our experiments involving photo-cleavable linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>) suggest that disengagement of the winning motor, even temporarily, is a simple way to change directionality. It is also plausible that an increase in the backwards force experienced by the leading motor, for instance as it moves through a viscoelastic network, can lead to its stalling. Under these circumstances, the competition will be biased towards the trailing motor. Specifically, optical tweezers can be used to temporarily apply a resistive load and ‘reset’ the competition between the motors. Also, regulatory events such as phosphorylation can be used to alter the stepping kinetics of one motor so as to bias the competition. Both of these scenarios are of interest and are a focus of future investigations in our lab.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) In the subsection “Actin architecture influences cargo sorting of antagonistic motor assemblies”, the authors mention that the plus-end biased flux differs from their findings in Hariadi et al., PNAS, 2014; why</italic>?</p><p>We apologize to the reviewer for the confusion concerning the findings of this study versus our previous work. We have now re-written the Introduction (paragraphs 3 and 4) to clearly state the information derived from previous studies and subsequently the results of the current study. Furthermore, the second section of the Results (paragraph 2) has been rewritten to clearly state the contributions of scaffold type, motor number, and actin architecture on ensemble competition and flux.</p><p><italic>2) What is the physiologically relevant actin network architecture on which transport takes place? If it's the actin cortex, which is a tight meshwork of isotropically oriented filaments, then how well is it really modeled by the branched architecture of actin in the lamellipodium</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the intent of the referee’s suggestion, in that, the keratocyte lamellipodium is a model dense, branched, actin network that facilitates careful quantitative observations of the actin-myosin interactions in two-dimensions. We understand that our original submission implied otherwise. Accordingly, the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion have been modified in accordance with the use of the keratocyte lamellipodium as a model actin network. Future studies on unconventional myosins will need to examine the influence of different actin architectures, and potentially 3D actin structures on the collective movement of unconventional myosins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
