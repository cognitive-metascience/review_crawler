We report a stress resolution pathway initiated by the nuclear receptor LRH-1 that is independent of known unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Like mice lacking primary UPR components, hepatic <italic>Lrh-1</italic>-null mice cannot resolve ER stress, despite a functional UPR. In response to ER stress, LRH-1 induces expression of the kinase <italic>Plk3</italic>, which phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor ATF2. <italic>Plk3</italic>-null mice also cannot resolve ER stress, and restoring <italic>Plk3</italic> expression in <italic>Lrh-1</italic>-null cells rescues ER stress resolution. Reduced or heightened ATF2 activity also sensitizes or desensitizes cells to ER stress, respectively. LRH-1 agonist treatment increases ER stress resistance and decreases cell death. We conclude that LRH-1 initiates a novel pathway of ER stress resolution that is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required. Targeting LRH-1 may be beneficial in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01694.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01694.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01694.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A protein can only work properly if it has been folded into the correct shape. However, it is estimated that about one third of new proteins have the wrong shape. This is a major challenge for cells because misfolded proteins are often toxic, and cause many neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, most protein folding takes place inside a part of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). If an incorrectly folded protein is detected, it is prevented from leaving the ER until it is refolded correctly, or destroyed. If too many proteins are misfolded, a process called the unfolded protein response helps the cell to cope with this ‘ER stress’ by expanding the ER and producing more of the molecules that assist protein folding. If this does not relieve the ER stress, the cell self-destructs. Neighboring cells then have to increase protein production to compensate for what would have been produced by the dead cell, thereby increasing the chance that they will also experience ER stress.</p><p>Activation of a protein called LRH-1 (short for liver receptor homolog-1) that is produced in the liver, pancreas and intestine can relieve the symptoms of the various metabolic diseases that are associated with chronic ER stress, including type II diabetes and fatty liver disease. However, researchers have been puzzled by the fact that although LRH-1 performs many different roles, its molecular structure provides few clues as to how it can do this.</p><p>Mamrosh et al. now confirm the speculated link between LRH-1 and ER stress relief in mice. LRH-1 triggers a previously unknown pathway that can relieve ER stress and is completely independent of the unfolded protein response. Targeting LRH-1 with certain chemical compounds alters its activity, suggesting that drug treatments could be developed to relieve ER stress. As similar targets for drugs have not been found in the unfolded protein response, the discovery of the LRH-1 pathway could lead to new approaches to the treatment of the diseases that result from ER stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01694.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01694.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>liver metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK059820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK085372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>United States Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6250-52000-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 DK0059820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK007696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mamrosh</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LRH-1/NR5A2 responds to ER stress by inducing a novel pathway that is required for stress resolution in mice and can be targeted by LRH-1 agonists.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been estimated that close to one-third of newly synthesized proteins cannot properly fold and are therefore subjected to rapid intracellular degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>). Both the large scale of this process and the toxicity of misfolded proteins dictate that protein folding must be tightly controlled. When cellular protein folding demands in the cell exceed capacity, misfolded proteins accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress. In many human diseases, especially metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, cellular folding capacities are overwhelmed by increased protein synthesis rates and/or accumulation of abnormal proteins, resulting in ER stress-mediated cell toxicity or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A set of highly conserved signaling pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) functions to resolve ER stress. The UPR consists of three distinct pathways, each of which is initiated by a specific ER-bound protein that acts as a sensor for misfolded proteins. Activation of these sensors elicits downstream signaling pathways that ultimately produce three transcription factors, ATF4, ATF6, and XBP-1, which are active at genes involved in protein folding, expansion of the ER, protein degradation, and, in the case of severe stress, apoptosis. In recent years, many additional components of ER stress resolution have been identified, often with roles in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis following exposure to stress.</p><p>Despite the increasing number of factors involved in the ER stress response, only a few are directly responsible for ER stress resolution. Treatment of knockout mice for any of the upstream UPR pathway components, <italic>Atf6</italic>, <italic>Ire1α</italic> (product of <italic>Ern1</italic>), or <italic>Perk</italic> (product of <italic>Eifak3</italic>), with tunicamycin, a chemical stressor that primarily affects the liver, elicits a striking phenotype. All knockouts exhibit an inability to resolve ER stress upon exposure, as well as a striking metabolic phenotype of strong and persistent accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rutkowski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Teske et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). While tunicamycin is a supraphysiological stressor, these results are important because no other mouse models have been reported to share these phenotypes following ER stress, suggesting that the canonical UPR pathways are functionally overlapping, yet non-redundant, and also that the UPR contains the only required pathways for ER stress resolution.</p><p>The orphan nuclear hormone receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; product of <italic>Nr5a2</italic>) is expressed in secretory tissues or tissues with high rates of protein production, including liver, pancreas, intestine, and reproductive tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Higashiyama et al., 2007</xref>). None of the divergent roles of LRH-1—notably bile acid production, development and maintenance of pluripotency, and local steroidogenesis—directly imply a role in ER stress resolution. However, the fact that metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes and fatty liver disease are associated with chronic ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ozcan et al., 2006</xref>), but can be alleviated by activation of LRH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), suggested a potential connection. In the present study, this connection was substantiated by our discovery that LRH-1 is indispensible for ER stress resolution. In this unexpected role, LRH-1 initiates the kinase-driven activation of a CREB-like transcription factor following exposure to ER stress, specifically through polo-like kinase 3 (<italic>Plk3</italic>) induction of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) phosphorylation. This response is absent in <italic>Lrh-1</italic> liver-specific knockout mice, but restoration of <italic>Plk3</italic> induction to <italic>Lrh-1</italic> null cells reestablishes ER stress resolution. Similarly, expression of a constitutively active <italic>Atf2</italic> restores ER stress resolution capacity to <italic>Lrh-1</italic> null cells, and reduction of ATF2 activity sensitizes control cells to ER stress. Treatment of hepatocytes with LRH-1 agonists increases the capacity for ER stress resolution and diminishes toxicity resulting from severe ER stress. Thus, we report the existence of an unexpected kinase-driven and drug-targetable pathway responding to ER stress that lies outside of the classical UPR pathways, but is equally required for ER stress resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> results in liver fat accumulation, cell death, and inability to resolve ER stress upon exposure</title><p>To test whether LRH-1 is involved in ER stress resolution, we treated <italic>Lrh-1</italic> liver-specific knockout (<italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup>) mice and control littermates (<italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>) with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (TM), which primarily affects the liver. <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice exhibited profound hepatic lipid accumulation by 48 hr following stress, as evidenced by macroscopic evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and measurement of increased hepatic triglycerides and free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Thus, we assessed the nuclear accumulation of UPR transcription factors that represent the most downstream effector of each branch. In contrast to our expectation of a UPR deficiency, we observed comparable nuclear accumulation of downstream transcription factors for all three UPR branches in response to ER stress in both control and <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice, suggesting that all three branches were functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Target genes dependent on each of the three UPR pathways were similarly induced following TM stress in both control and <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice, confirming that XBP-1, ATF6, and ATF4 were transcriptionally active in addition to being nuclear localized in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, hepatocytes from <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice exhibit a more robust initial UPR response as well as sustained signaling at later times, indicating failure to resolve these stresses.

Following ER stress, LRH-1 is recruited to the <italic>Plk3</italic> promoter and dramatically induces transcription of this atypical kinase.

Since functional redundancy with the transcription factors Atf7 and Cre-bpa (Creb5) complicates study of ATF2 function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breitwieser et al., 2007</xref>), we overexpressed a dominant negative ATF2 in hepatocytes. Transduction of wild-type hepatocytes with this construct diminishes ability to resolve ER stress, consistent with that observed following the loss of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> or <italic>Plk3</italic>. We also found that overexpression of a constitutively active ATF2 resulted in improved ability to resolve ER stress. These results indicate that ATF2 activation is sufficient for ER stress resolution, and that activation of ATF2 or its heterodimeric partners, including ATF7 and/or CRE-BPa, is necessary. Determining genome-wide binding of ATF2 and other PLK3-responsive transcription factors in the context of ER stress should enhance our understanding of the downstream targets of this essential pathway.</p><p>The induction of LRH-1 target genes following ER stress and its increased recruitment to the <italic>Plk3</italic> promoter suggests that LRH-1 is transcriptionally activated in response to TM treatment. In general, this could result from either signaling pathways that phosphorylate, or otherwise activate LRH-1 or its coregulators, or to increased production of an endogenous LRH-1 agonist. It could also result from increased expression of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> following ER stress. Unfortunately, both the very limited information on specific signaling pathways that promote LRH-1 transactivation and the absence of information on endogenous LRH-1 ligands severely limits approaches to determine whether LRH-1 is post-translationally regulated following ER stress. However, we observed that the stress-dependent induction of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> expression is dependent on the UPR components IRE1a and ATF6, and IRE1a also appears to impact LRH-1 transactivation. It is possible that transcriptional regulation of LRH-1 following ER stress is at least partially under control of the UPR in this regard. However, it is quite unlikely that IRE1a directly regulates LRH-1 protein, based on the constitutive nuclear localization of LRH-1 following ER stress. Future studies will be needed to characterize post-translational control of LRH-1 in a variety of contexts, including ER stress.</p><p>More broadly, the ligand responsiveness of LRH-1 suggests that it could become a therapeutic target in human disorders associated with chronic ER stress. Our results suggest that activation of LRH-1 by RJW100 heightens induction of <italic>Plk3</italic> and ATF2 target genes. Additionally, treatment of cells transgenic for human <italic>Lrh-1</italic> with RJW100 results in the ability to resolve high levels of ER stress and protection from cell death following stress. Therefore, targeting LRH-1 in vivo with agonists or newly developed antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rey et al., 2012</xref>) may allow selective augmentation or inhibition of ER stress resolution, which could prove beneficial in numerous human disorders. This is of particular interest since other strategies for targeting the UPR have proven to be difficult, and no chemical compounds have been successfully used in mice that directly activate downstream UPR components.</p><p>Although it has not been previously linked to the UPR, ATF2 has been associated with other cellular stress responses, including those that mitigate DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dam et al., 1995</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kurata, 2000</xref>), with these roles dependent on ATF2 phosphorylation. This raises the interesting question of whether this LRH-1 initiated pathway contributes to a broader, kinase-driven cell defense system that can be activated by diverse stresses. Highly conserved, kinase-driven pathways are increasingly being recognized for not only being activated by ER stress, but also for facilitating ER stress resolution. In mammalian cells, specific MAP kinases have been identified that are activated by ER stress and diminish cell death following stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2004</xref>). A screen for genes whose loss confers sensitivity to ER stress in <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> also uncovered twelve MAP kinase components, remarkable in scale considering that the yeast UPR only contains a single branch consisting of <italic>IRE1</italic> and substrate <italic>HAC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). We provide an additional example of such a kinase-driven ER stress resolution pathway, in which LRH-1 protects the cell through <italic>Plk3</italic> induction and subsequence ATF2 phosphorylation. While PLK3 is not a MAP kinase, it is important to note that ATF2 is otherwise phosphorylated by MAP kinases p38 and JNK. This suggests that the presence of LRH-1 adds an additional layer of control onto these MAP kinase pathways through activation of the atypical kinase. We are currently investigating the conservation of this response utilizing simpler model organisms, as well as investigating whether LRH-1 and downstream factors PLK3 and ATF2 are required for resolution of broader cell stresses.</p><p>Overall, we conclude that this novel LRH-1-<italic>Plk3</italic> pathway represents a core pathway that is required for hepatic ER stress resolution. Although it is as essential as any of the three canonical arms of the UPR, and appears to function independently of them, it cannot be considered a fourth arm because there is no evidence that it directly contributes to restoration of ER function, for example by promoting protein folding, and also because LRH-1 is not universally expressed. Nonetheless, our results open new directions for therapeutic targeting of ER stress in human disease, and suggest that this pathway, which links highly conserved kinase signaling and resolution of ER stress, is a prime example of the emerging integration of broad cell stress responses and regulation of protein homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p><italic>Lrh-1</italic> liver specific knockout (<italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup>) mice were obtained by crossing mice with an <italic>Lrh-1</italic> allele flanked by LoxP sites (<italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup>) with <italic>albumin-Cre</italic> transgenic mice. <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>f/f</italic></sup> mice were provided by the Kliewer/Mangelsdorf lab and have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2008</xref>); <italic>albumin-Cre</italic> transgenic mice were provided by Bert O’Malley’s laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was novel, well executed and potentially of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several major issues were identified that need to be addressed in order to strengthen the conclusions drawn. In particular, although it is clear that LRH-1 affects ER stress in the liver, concerns were raised as to whether it is appropriate to consider this a new branch of the UPR. Furthermore, additional data on the role of ATF-2 in the LRH-1 pathway seem to be needed as outlined below.</p><p>1) The central message of the paper, that this is a novel UPR branch, is premature and not supported with these data and do not reflect an accurate description of the findings. It would be imperative to either demonstrate that the proposed pathway is a new branch of UPR or simply change the title and the central premise of the paper to “identification of a role for LRH-1 in hepatic ER stress”. There is an important difference between these concepts.</p><p>2) In essentially all of the experiments examining the role of LRH-1 in the UPR, the authors have examined the levels of XBP1, ATF6, and ATF4, and use these measure as a direct reflection of ER stress through canonical branches. The evidence supporting that there is unresolved ER stress is primarily based on the fact that upon tunicamycin treatment or hepatectomy, the livers of knockout mice exhibit steatosis. It is important to characterize the condition of the ER with additional measures, to come closer to this interpretation. An important aspect of this is the status of the proximal sensors, such as IRE1 and PERK phosphorylation and the evidence for the emergence of maladaptive responses such as apoptotic signals, JNK activation, and others. Otherwise the possibility remains that this ER is under a new equilibrium with the boosted UPR and that LRH-1 is linked to lipid metabolism, rather than representing a bona fide novel UPR branch.</p><p>3) Does ER stress result in activation state or subcellular localization of LRH-1? Are there any other indications for direct modification of this molecule by ER stress? If so, is such effect transmitted through IRE1 or PERK?</p><p>4) The authors claim that the defective ER stress resolution in LRH-1 liver-specific knockout mice is due to the loss of ATF2 phosphorylation in response to ER stress stimuli. However, the current data do not establish that ATF2 phosphorylation is essential for the ER stress resolution. Could the authors knockdown ATF2 in mice liver and examine whether there is any defects in ER stress resolution after challenge? Alternatively, have the authors attempted to explore whether ATF2- or PLK3-deficient livers exhibit hepatosteosis and/or alterations in ER stress responses?</p><p>5) The evidence linking ATF2 activation solely to ER stress response is incomplete, as PLK3 has many other interacting and binding partners. p53, HIF1A, and c-Jun can participate in mediating both cellular stress as well as ER stress. For example, exposure of hepatocytes to toxins such as tunicamycin triggers ER stress, which then feeds into the cellular oxidative stress response. In that case, the ATF2 activation is potentially part of the redox stress response. Are there signalling cascades other than ATF2 upregulated in mice treated with either LRH-1 ligand or exogenous toxins? Comments on this would be helpful. These possibilities need to be addressed by either additional experiments looking at downstream targets of PLK3 or at least in the discussion section of the article.</p><p>6) Does LRH-1 ligand affect the phosphorylation of ATF2 in response to ER stress stimuli?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01694.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The central message of the paper, that this is a novel UPR branch, is premature and not supported with these data and do not reflect an accurate description of the findings. It would be imperative to either demonstrate that the proposed pathway is a new branch of UPR or simply change the title and the central premise of the paper to “identification of a role for LRH-1 in hepatic ER stress”. There is an important difference between these concepts</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree that the concepts are quite different, and in our initial submission we did not intend to claim that this LRH-1-initiated pathway for ER stress resolution is a fourth branch of the UPR. We have no evidence that it directly contributes to restoration of ER function, for example by promoting protein folding, and we did not observe differential expression of UPR target genes following LRH-1 agonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, LRH-1 is not universally expressed. Thus, as is now pointed out in the discussion, this pathway cannot be considered equivalent to the three canonical branches. We have also added “<italic>liver</italic> endoplasmic reticulum stress resolution” to the title, as suggested. Nonetheless, the PLK3/ATF2 axis is quite separate from the known UPR components, and we believe that the results strongly support our conclusion that this pathway “is independent of the UPR, yet equivalently required” for stress resolution.</p><p>To address the issue of functional interaction with the canonical pathways more directly, we used siRNA to knockdown <italic>Ire1a</italic>, <italic>Perk</italic>, and <italic>Atf6</italic> in primary hepatocytes and determined whether ER stress-responsive induction of LRH-1 target genes was affected. Since the metabolic LRH-1 target genes <italic>Cyp7A1</italic> or <italic>Cyp8B1</italic> are deregulated in cultured cells, we focused on <italic>Shp</italic> and <italic>Plk3.</italic> We observed that both are stress-inducible, but their induction is significantly blunted with loss of <italic>Ire1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref><italic>)</italic>. Since <italic>Ire1a</italic> expression is also critical for induction of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), however, it is possible that IRE1a primarily affects the expression of LRH-1 rather than its activity.</p><p><italic>2) In essentially all of the experiments examining the role of LRH-1 in the UPR, the authors have examined the levels of XBP1, ATF6, and ATF4, and use these measure as a direct reflection of ER stress through canonical branches.

Otherwise the possibility remains that this ER is under a new equilibrium with the boosted UPR and that LRH-1 is linked to lipid metabolism, rather than representing a bona fide novel UPR branch</italic>.</p><p>We have obtained new data to support our conclusion that ER stress is sustained and toxic in mice lacking <italic>Lrh-1</italic>. While we previously showed that <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice exhibit increased cell death following tunicamycin by TUNEL staining, we have now also investigated caspase activation following stress in our mice. As expected, we observed greater stress-induced caspase activation in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We also used thioflavin T, which fluoresces when bound to protein aggregates (Beriault and Werstuck, 2013) as an additional method to visualize and quantify ER stress. In tunicamycin treated primary hepatocytes from control and <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice, we observed strikingly increased fluorescence at later time points following tunicamycin treatment in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This indicates that loss of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> not only affects UPR signaling components, but also contributes to greater protein misfolding.</p><p>We do not believe that the ER in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice is at a new equilibrium following stress for the following reasons: 1) Thioflavin T staining indicates a much greater quantity of protein aggregates in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice following ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). 2) We do not observe any UPR activation in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice prior to treatment with ER stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). 3. We observe greater apoptosis in response to a wide range of stressors in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>While we cannot exclude that the steatosis observed <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice following ER stress could also be the cause for ER stress, we think it is important to note that this fat accumulation is only observed at later time points (48 hr and beyond) post tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The UPR responds rapidly (within a few hours) to misfolded proteins and we have shown that our pathway is maximally activated within several hours following treatment with tunicamycin. Therefore, the bulk of the ER stress response (and, one could argue, resolution) in normal mice occurs much before accumulation of significant amounts of fat in mice deficient in ER stress resolution. While it is possible that LRH-1 is critical for aspects of lipid metabolism, it is also important to note that lipids are not significantly increased in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice prior to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Therefore, we maintain that LRH-1 is critical for ER stress resolution.</p><p><italic>3) Does ER stress result in activation state or subcellular localization of LRH-1? Are there any other indications for direct modification of this molecule by ER stress? If so, is such effect transmitted through IRE1</italic> <italic>or PERK?</italic></p><p>In new results we show that ER stress does not affect subcellular localization; LRH-1 is exclusively nuclear with or without ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, LRH-1 is unlikely to be directly phosphorylated or modified by ER-bound UPR factors.</p><p>We found that induction of LRH-1 target genes is increased following ER stress, which may be due to increased expression of <italic>Lrh-1</italic> mRNA. We found (as detailed in point 1 above) that IRE1a and ATF6 may control this induction of <italic>Lrh-1</italic>. However, a more intriguing question is whether the transcriptional activity of LRH-1 is increased following ER stress, potentially via induction of an agonist ligand or post-translational modification. Unfortunately, both are very difficult to address as nothing is known regarding endogenous LRH-1 agonists, and little is known about regulation of LRH-1 activity in any context.</p><p><italic>4) The authors claim that the defective ER stress resolution in LRH-1 liver-specific knockout mice is due to the loss of ATF2 phosphorylation in response to ER stress stimuli. However, the current data do not establish that ATF2 phosphorylation is essential for the ER stress resolution. Could the authors knockdown ATF2 in mice liver and examine whether there is any defects in ER stress resolution after challenge? Alternatively, have the authors attempted to explore whether ATF2- or PLK3-deficient livers exhibit hepatosteosis and/or alterations in ER</italic> <italic>stress responses?</italic></p><p>We agree that data on the requirement for ATF2 in ER stress resolution would strengthen our story. To address this, we generated adenoviruses expressing a constitutively active ATF2 or a dominant negative ATF2 that cannot be phosphorylated at critical residues. We observed that expression of constitutively active ATF2 in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> cells increases their ability to resolve ER stress; conversely, expression of the dominant negative ATF2 in control cells diminishes their ability to resolve ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>). While it is possible that PLK3 does not exert its protective effect in ER stress resolution solely through ATF2, it is clear that ATF2 (and potentially redundant ATF-family transcription factors) do play critical roles in ER stress resolution.</p><p>In response to the later questions, we did find that <italic>Plk3</italic>-deficient livers exhibit sustained UPR signaling following tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), suggesting that they cannot resolve ER stress as efficiently. We did not observe increased hepatosteatosis due to the fact that the background of this mouse strain is more sensitive to tunicamycin than controls for the <italic>Lrh-1</italic>-deficient mice, and therefore even <italic>Plk3</italic> wild-type mice also exhibit increased hepatosteatosis following TM relative to C57/Bl6 mice. Under basal conditions, however, the PLK3 knockouts do not exhibit either activation of the UPR or significantly elevated triglycerides.</p><p><italic>5) The evidence linking ATF2 activation solely to ER stress response is incomplete, as PLK3 has many other interacting and binding partners. p53, HIF1A, and C-Jun can participate in mediating both cellular stress as well as ER stress. For example, exposure of hepatocytes to toxins such as tunicamycin triggers ER stress, which then feeds into the cellular oxidative stress response. In that case, the ATF2 activation is potentially part of the redox stress response. Are there signalling cascades other than ATF2 upregulated in mice treated with either LRH-1 ligand or exogenous toxins? Comments on this would be helpful. These possibilities need to be addressed by either additional experiments looking at downstream targets of PLK3 or at least in the discussion section of the article</italic>.</p><p>It is true that PLK3 has additional interacting partners, including other transcription factors. We have supplemented our manuscript with additional analysis of our array data to determine whether genes differentially induced by stress in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice could be targets of additional transcription factors known to be phosphorylated by PLK3. This information is summarized in Table 2 and discussed in detail in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>Following this additional analysis, the most significant overlap of our gene set (Table 1) with known transcription factor promoter binding remained that for ATF2. However, we also observed some enrichment for p53 and c-Jun target genes (as well as for LRH-1, but this is not thought to be regulated by PLK3). Interestingly, the genes in our gene set that are direct targets of p53 or c-Jun are also direct targets of ATF2. In other words, we did not identify any genes bound by p53 or c-Jun that are not bound by ATF2 in the same region (data not shown in paper for size considerations). Therefore, these studies fail to show evidence for a critical role of p53 or c-Jun in induction of these genes. The fact that expression of a constitutively active ATF2 in <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> cells facilitates ER stress resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>) argues that ATF2 is a major functional output of PLK3 in ER stress resolution. It is possible that p53 or c-Jun may be forming complexes with ATF2 in the context of ER stress to maximize gene induction. Yet ATF2 is known to bind additional genes in our list that do not appear to be p53 or c-Jun targets, suggesting that ATF2 may work alone (or at least without these transcription factors). Since HIF1a is phosphorylated by PLK3, but this phosphorylation is destabilizing (Xu D, Yao Y, Lu L, Costa M, Dai W. 2010. Plk3 functions as an essential component of the hypoxia regulatory pathway by direct phosphorylation of HIF-1alpha. The Journal of Biological Chemistry 285:38944–38950. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.160325.), we did not investigate HIF1a further.</p><p>We also investigated whether the oxidative stress response was induced in our target gene list. There are no known oxidative stress transcription factors known to be phosphorylated by PLK3 (unless you include p53), so we compared our gene list to genome wide binding of NRF2. We did not observe significant overlap. At later time points (such as 48 or 72 h) post treatment with tunicamycin, we might expect to observe oxidative stress in the <italic>Lrh-1</italic><sup><italic>LKO</italic></sup> mice resulting from their unresolved ER stress. However, we can conclude that LRH-1 does not appear to control an oxidative stress response to tunicamycin at earlier time points that constitute the primary ER stress response.</p><p>Whether additional, broader pathways are controlled by LRH-1 and/or PLK3 in response to stress remains an open question. However, we had previously performed a variety of non-biased bioinformatics analyses (motif discovery, gene ontology, etc) and have not found anything else significant beyond CRE binding factors/ATF2 (significant data in paper, some data not shown) that would suggest additional pathways dependent on LRH-1 are required for ER stress resolution.</p><p><italic>6) Does LRH-1 ligand affect the phosphorylation of ATF2 in response to</italic> <italic>ER stress stimuli?</italic></p><p>We have unfortunately not been able to address this directly, due to difficulties with later batches of the phospho-ATF2 antibody (Cell Signaling 9225S). All experiments shown were performed using batch 3 of this antibody, which detects a single clean band. However, now we can only obtain batch 4, which detects multiple bands with no clear pATF2 band. We have not been able to detect pATF2 reliably using other antibodies. We of course hope that this issue is resolved soon for the benefit of our lab and others.</p><p>That being said, we would expect the ligand to induce phosphorylation of ATF2 since it induces <italic>Plk3</italic> and also ATF2 target genes, which should be dependent on such phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
