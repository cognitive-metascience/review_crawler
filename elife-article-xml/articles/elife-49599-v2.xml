characteristics contribute to development, physiology, and disease. Here, we report a novel strategy to assess gene expression and cell physiology in single living cells. Our approach utilizes fluorescently labeled mRNA-specific anti-sense RNA probes and dsRNA-binding protein to identify the expression of specific genes in real-time at single-cell resolution via FRET. We use this technology to identify distinct myocardial subpopulations expressing the structural proteins myosin heavy chain α and myosin light chain 2a in real-time during early differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. We combine this live-cell gene expression analysis with detailed physiologic phenotyping to capture the functional evolution of these early myocardial subpopulations during lineage specification and diversification. This live-cell mRNA imaging approach will have wide ranging application wherever heterogeneity plays an important biological role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>cellular differentiation</kwd><kwd>lineage diversification</kwd><kwd>cellular heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>single-cell physiology</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship: 15PRE22220009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atmanli</surname><given-names>Ayhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) Jump Start Award: 5U01HL099997-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Atmanli</surname><given-names>Ayhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HL100408-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Domian</surname><given-names>Ibrahim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel live-cell mRNA imaging technology identifies individual living cells based on their gene expression and enables the concurrent study of their physiology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of development and disease is the cellular phenotypic diversification required for three-dimensional tissue structures. Cellular heterogeneity demonstrably contributes to the developmental dynamics of various types of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dulken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandoe and Eggan, 2013</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meacham and Morrison, 2013</xref>). In the heart, the coordinated differentiation, lineage diversification, and functional maturation of heterogeneous populations of cells is a prerequisite for the proper development of coordinated electrical and contractile function. Multiple cardiac myocyte lineages and sublineages, along with endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiac fibroblasts must interact in a cohesive program to form the mature four-chambered adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Domian et al., 2009</xref>). Advances in pluripotent stem cell (PSC) biology open unprecedented avenues for the study of human cellular differentiation, physiology, and pathophysiology in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lan et al., 2013</xref>) and also underscore the heterogeneity of clinically important cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bryant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cordeiro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lian et al., 2012</xref>). This cellular heterogeneity along with an the inherent difficulty of examining real-time gene expression of single living cells poses a major limitation in the understanding of the complex biological processes that underlie development and disease.</p><p>Single-cell transcriptional profiling initially via multiplex qPCR analysis and more recently via whole transcriptome sequencing has provided insight into how intracellular signaling is regulated at the single-cell transcriptional level during cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DeLaughter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sahara et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this progress, whole genome expression analysis does not allow for concurrent physiological assessment of single living cells and consequently, the functional significance of single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity remains unclear. The live-cell identification of distinct cell populations has most commonly been accomplished with gene expression assays that rely on the detection of fluorescent reporter proteins under the transcriptional control of the gene of interest. Accordingly, these approaches require the generation of transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Domian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) or embryonic stem cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klug et al., 1996</xref>) to isolate and study discrete subsets of cells with specific gene expression profiles. These methods are cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive and therefore allow for only a limited number of genes to be examined at a time. Technical advances have facilitated live-cell mRNA imaging by detecting gene transcripts via nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyagi and Kramer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vargas et al., 2011</xref>) or protein probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozawa et al., 2007</xref>). However, several drawbacks of these existing techniques such as genetic encoding of target mRNA and reporter protein, the necessity to target multiple binding sites, complexity of probe design and cellular delivery and low sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armitage, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagi, 2009</xref>) have prevented their widespread use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49599.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of MAGIC with other live-cell mRNA imaging technologies.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle"/><th align="left" valign="middle">Advantages</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="middle">Nucleic Acid Probes</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Most established approach</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Complexity of probe design and cellular delivery</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Single-molecule sensitivity achievable</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Need to screen many probes for specificity and sensitivity</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Cell isolation via FACS</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Probe sequestration and false-positive signals</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="middle">Protein Probes</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Single-molecule sensitivity</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Genetic encoding of target RNA and reporter protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Study of RNA dynamics</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Multiple binding sites necessary</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"/><td align="left" valign="middle">Low sensitivity</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3" valign="middle">MAGIC</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Imaging of transcription factors</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Complexity of MAGIC Probe production</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Double detection with MAGIC Factor and Probes increases specificity</td><td align="left" valign="middle">Efficient transfection of MAGIC Factor and Probes into the same cell required</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Coupling with cell physiology assays</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Herein we describe a novel Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based technology for the <italic>m</italic>ultiplex <italic>a</italic>nalysis of <underline>g</underline>ene expression in <italic>i</italic>ndividual living <italic>c</italic>ells (termed MAGIC, patent application pending; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atmanli and Domian, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

MAGIC Factor is the recombinant dsRNA-binding domain of human protein kinase R that has been fluorescently labeled and affinity purified against dsRNA. Both the probe and the protein are delivered into living cells by transfection. Upon cellular delivery, MAGIC Probes hybridize to their target gene and generate an RNA-RNA duplex. This enables MAGIC Factor to bind to the newly formed dsRNA, thereby bringing the donor fluorophore on the protein to come into close contact with the acceptor fluorophore on the RNA probe and for FRET to occur (blue arrow: excitation of the donor; green arrow: energy transfer; red arrow: emission of the acceptor). Cells expressing the gene of interest are identified by assaying the FRET signal. (<bold>B</bold>) Affinity purification of fluorescent MAGIC Factor restores its binding affinity. MAGIC Factor was fluorescently-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and then reacted with dsRNA-coupled agarose beads to separate binding, functional protein from non-binding, non-functional protein.

Second, we engineered a fluorescently-labeled dsRNA-binding protein (termed MAGIC Factor) to specifically detect MAGIC Probes that are bound to their target. The MAGIC Factor was engineered by genetically and chemically altering the dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of human protein kinase R (PKR).

In order to detect the expression of specific RNA in single living cells, MAGIC Probes and MAGIC Factor are transiently co-delivered to individual living cells. In the presence of target RNA, MAGIC Probes hybridize to generate a fluorescent dsRNA complex. The subsequent binding of MAGIC Factor to the dsRNA complex brings both fluorophores into juxtaposition and can be detected by FRET imaging.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49599.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Sequences of MAGIC probes and corresponding target sites.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle">MAGIC Probe Target</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Sequence</th><th align="left" valign="middle">Target site</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human β-actin</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGATAGCACAGCCTGGATAG</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle">507-488</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human myosin heavy chain α (MHCα)</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCACCAATGTCACGGCTCT</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5864-5845</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a)</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCCTGCTTGGTGGCTGCCA</named-content>-3’</td><td align="left" valign="middle">66-47</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human NKX2-5, Probe 1</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTGCGCTGCTGCTGTTCC</named-content>-3’</td><td align="left" valign="middle">308-289 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human NKX2-5, Probe 2</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGACGTGAGTTTCAGCACGC</named-content>-3’</td><td align="left" valign="middle">766-747</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Human NKX2-5, Probe 3</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCGTTATAACCGTAGGGATT</named-content>-3’</td><td align="left" valign="middle">984-965</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Control Probe</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGATCGTGACTAGATCGTCA</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Labeled ssRNA for EMSAs</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGATGAGTCACTGCCTAGCC</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Unlabeled ssRNA complementary to probe above</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTAGGCAGTGACTCATCC</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Labeled ssRNA for multiplex spectral FRET</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGAAGTAGCACAGTCCAGAC</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Unlabeled ssRNA for affinity purification, strand 1</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAGTCCTTCCACGATAGACC</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">Unlabeled ssRNA for affinity purification, strand 2</td><td align="left" valign="middle">5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGTCTATCGTGGAAGGACTC</named-content>-3'</td><td align="left" valign="middle"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To obtain highly fluorescent and fully functional MAGIC Factor, we expressed the MAGIC Factor in a recombinant bacterial expression system and labeled it with Alexa Fluor 488. This fluorophore serves as a robust FRET donor due to its high quantum yield, photostability and low phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>). Initial attempts at fluorescently labeling the MAGIC Factor through conjugation to its thiol or carboxylic acid groups were unsuccessful (data not shown) suggesting that these sites are not available for chemical modification. We therefore labeled MAGIC Factor at its primary amino groups via N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester chemistry using molar ratios ranging from 0:1 and 6:1 between dye and protein. While this approach yielded a highly fluorescent protein without causing chemical degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), it resulted in a reduction of the protein’s ability to bind fluorescent dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a consequence, the generation of a robust FRET signal was hindered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In order to purify functional from non-functional protein after fluorescent labeling, we affinity-purified the protein based on its ability to bind dsRNA. We linked synthetic dsRNA to agarose beads and reacted fluorescent MAGIC Factor with them. Using an increased concentration of potassium chloride, we retrieved the functional protein and then verified that the engineered protein specifically binds to dsRNA over ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Quantification of protein concentration in the individual fractions showed that only 4% of MAGIC Factor had been able to bind dsRNA after fluorescent labeling, but prior to further purification. As a result of using dsRNA-coupled beads, we were able to obtain fully functional, fluorescent MAGIC Factor. We then quantified the binding affinity of unpurified and affinity purified, labeled MAGIC Factor and found that affinity purification results in a ~ 30 fold increase in binding affinity, as shown using the corresponding K<sub>d</sub>-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Thus, we have genetically and chemically engineered a novel fluorescentlylabeled dsRNA-binding protein that binds specifically to dsRNA but not ssRNA. Binding of this engineered protein to fluorescently labeled dsRNA results in a robust FRET signal.</p><p>Our next goal was to obtain highly fluorescent and fully functional MAGIC Probes. The probes consist of 20-mer RNA generated through standard in vitro transcription using T7 phage polymerase and using aminoallyl-modified uridine bases. Fluorescent labeling of the RNA oligonucleotide was then carried out by an NHS ester reaction with Alexa Fluor dyes with high extinction coefficients to provide optimum acceptor dyes for FRET (Alexa Fluor 546, 594 and 647). Since the chemical modification of RNA has the potential to alter fluorescence and hybridization kinetics of the probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cox and Singer, 2004</xref>), we evaluated the effects of the number of fluorescent dyes on each 20-mer RNA molecule. We fluorescently-labeled the RNA and purified one-, two-, three- and four-labeled RNA from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We found a marked difference in the resulting fluorescence intensity between the differently labeled RNA probes, suggesting that over-labeling of MAGIC Probes results in fluorescence quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When we hybridized the fluorescent RNA to its complementary RNA at 37°C, we found that only the four-labeled RNA exhibited significantly reduced hybridization kinetics <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We then investigated whether the number of fluorescent dyes might affect the binding ability of MAGIC Factor and found no difference among the four RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). However, we found that the stronger labeled the RNA, the less the resulting FRET between MAGIC Factor and the RNA became, suggesting that the fluorescence quenching also affected the generation of FRET. Based on these results, we determined that one- and two-labeled MAGIC Probes are optimal for in vitro live-cell FRET imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In situ detection of transcripts in single living and fixed cells</title><p>In initial proof-of-principle experiments, we sought to visualize the β-actin mRNA in single living hPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (hPSC-CMs) using Alexa Fluor 647-labeled MAGIC Probes, similarly to previously reported live-cell mRNA detection approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagi and Alsmadi, 2004</xref>). We first turned our attention to identifying the optimal conditions for the delivery of both MAGIC Factor and MAGIC Probes into single living cells. Since the efficiency of protein and RNA delivery is dependent on the construct and cell type of interest, we tested a range of commercially available transfection reagents for DNA, siRNA and proteins for their ability to efficiently deliver both constructs into single hPSC-CMs. We optimized our transfection protocol to achieve robust intracellular fluorescence signal intensities of MAGIC Factor and MAGIC Probes while maintaining cell viability above 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–I</xref>). Importantly, we were able to achieve high transfection efficiencies for both MAGIC Factor and Probes (&gt;85% each), further minimizing the number of cells that are either not transfected or transfected with only one construct. Using our optimized transfection protocol, we delivered a novel β-actin MAGIC Probe along with MAGIC Factor into hPSC-CMs and found that our technology provides a robust FRET signal compared to a control probe that did not have an intracellular target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We quantified the FRET signal using an established method to subtract spectral bleedthrough (corrected FRET, cFRET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xia and Liu, 2001</xref>) and found a robust increase in the calculated FRET signal when using the antisense probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Of note, a number of studies have previously shown in a variety of cell lines that the β-actin mRNA is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>). To corroborate our observation, we performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) of the β-actin mRNA simultaneously with MAGIC in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Fixation resulted in significant variability in the fluorescence intensity and spectral bleed-through of Alexa Fluor dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J–K</xref>). We therefore decided to react the MAGIC Factor and MAGIC Probe in single cells after fixation. We first tested our assay in U2OS cells, an established cell line in which the β-actin mRNA has been shown to be predominantly located in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>). The smFISH and the MAGIC FRET signals overlapped and confirmed the strong cytoplasmic distribution of the β-actin mRNA in U2OS cells with little nuclear localization, as shown by the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (n/c) ratio. Of note, relative nuclear fluorescence signals were comparable between MAGIC and smFISH, demonstrating the specificity of our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Because we performed our previous live-cell mRNA imaging assay in hPSC-CMs, we hypothesized that nuclear localization of the β-actin mRNA may be a specific phenotype in developing cardiac myocytes. To investigate this hypothesis, we differentiated reporter hPSCs toward the cardiac lineage, in which eGFP marks a pure cardiac myocyte population, whereas eGFP<sup>-</sup> cells are non-cardiogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elliott et al., 2011</xref>). We first marked eGFP<sup>+</sup> and eGFP<sup>-</sup> cells and then simultaneously probed each cell type with smFISH and MAGIC probes. We found that the eGFP<sup>+</sup> cardiac myocytes had a high degree of variability with respect to the cytoplasmic distribution versus nuclear distribution of the β-actin mRNA. Strikingly, this finding was limited to the eGFP<sup>+</sup> cardiac myocytes, as eGFP<sup>-</sup> cells predominantly trafficked the β-actin mRNA to the cytoplasm. Importantly, the MAGIC FRET signal co-localized with the smFISH signal in all cell types examined, as shown by the Manders’ Overlap Coefficient (MOC). These results validate the specificity of MAGIC probes and the capacity of this technology to define the subcellular localization of specific transcripts.</p><p>We next examined if our live-cell mRNA imaging system can be used to quantitatively or qualitatively analyze the level of mRNA expression in single living cells. We first investigated whether the signal intensity in smFISH assays was linearly correlated with the MAGIC FRET signal intensity in fixed cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, there was a strong correlation between the two fluorescent assays. We then performed MAGIC on β-actin in living cells first, then fixed and performed smFISH on the same cells. Again we found a positive correlation between the two assays, suggesting that the intensity of FRET signals in MAGIC probes can be used to infer relative gene expression levels. An interesting observation was that correlating MAGIC in living cells with smFISH in fixed cells resulted in a lower Pearson’s correlation coefficient as compared with performing MAGIC and smFISH simultaneously in fixed cells. This may be due to higher autofluorescence levels in living cells, making the FRET/cell values in living cells less predictable than in fixed cells. Finally, we showed that co-transfection of MAGIC Probes and MAGIC Factor did not alter cell viability, target mRNA levels, or target protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with previous reports that unmodified RNAs result in no significant RNA interference and translation inhibition by steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kole et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that MAGIC technology enables the robust localized detection of specific mRNA transcripts in single living and fixed cells, that it enables the inference to gene expression levels, all without disrupting cell viability and gene expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptional and morphological characterization of cardiac sublineages</title><p>We next applied our live-cell mRNA imaging system to the functional analysis of different subsets of hPSC-CMs. Prior work from a number of laboratories demonstrated that transcript levels of myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a) and myosin heavy chain α (MHCα) increase during early cardiac differentiation of hPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lian et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a key role for both structural proteins for proper development of cardiac contractile function. However, it is not known how the expression of these proteins interplays with cell physiology during early hPSC differentiation. To address this gap in knowledge, we first characterized the expression of these proteins at the single-cell level after the onset of beating between days 6 and 15 of hPSC differentiation toward the cardiac lineage. We found that MHCα and MLC2a are expressed sequentially, resulting in MHCα<sup>+</sup>/MLC2a<sup>+</sup> and MHCα<sup>+</sup>/MLC2a<sup>-</sup> hPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Intriguingly, we found that while by day 15 the vast majority of hPSC-CMs were co-expressing MHCα<sup>+</sup> and MLC2a<sup>+</sup>, no cardiac myocyte expressed MLC2a without also co-expressing MHCα at any time.

We found that MLC2v expression commences at day 15 of differentiation and significantly increases as differentiation continues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Concomitantly, the expression of MLC2a starts to decrease beginning at day 15, leaving a mixed population of cells consisting of MLC2a<sup>+</sup>/MLC2v<sup>+</sup>, MLC2a<sup>+</sup>/MLC2v<sup>-</sup> and MLC2a<sup>-</sup>/MLC2v<sup>+</sup> hPSC-CMs at day 40 of differentiation. Of important note, these two markers were exclusively expressed in MHCα<sup>+</sup> cells and there were no hPSC-CMs that did not express either MLC2a or MLC2v at any time. Our results demonstrate that during early differentiation cardiac myocytes are yet unspecified with respect to cardiac chambers, as shown by the lack of MLC2v expression until day 15 of differentiation.

Intriguingly, we found that during early cardiac differentiation up to day 15 cells do not increase in their size as they differentially express MHCα and MLC2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast later in differentiation, the expression of MLC2v is accompanied with an increase in cell size consistent with prior reports that ventricular cardiac myocytes are larger than atrial cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campbell et al., 1987</xref>). Taken together, these dynamics during cardiac development demonstrate the necessity for live-cell lineage assignment to understand the cell physiology of individual types of cardiac myocytes.

A major goal of this study was the simultaneous imaging of multiple transcripts in single living cells. We have performed FRET imaging in the previous results using the sensitized emission approach, in which the emission of the acceptor fluorophore using the donor excitation is visualized in a separate channel upon FRET. We reasoned that the spectral bleed-through from multiple fluorophores would limit the capability of this imaging technique to resolve a multiplex FRET approach. For assays employing more than one FRET pair we therefore used spectral imaging to enable a robust resolution of multiple FRET pairs in single living cells. In spectral imaging, the entire fluorescence spectrum is acquired upon laser excitation to form a so called ‘lambda stack’ consisting of multiple detection windows spanning typically 10–50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2003</xref>). Using the spectral fingerprints of each fluorophore from corresponding single-labeled controls, the individual fluorophores in the experimental sample can be resolved through a process termed ‘linear unmixing’. This process is based on the assumption that each fluorophore contributes in a linear manner to the fluorescence signal recorded in any given spectral detection channel. The relative contribution of each fluorophore is then used to unmix the composite fluorescence signal into individual images of each employed fluorophore. Because all light is collected for determining which fluorophore contributes to every given fluorescence signal, even fluorophores with minute differences in their emission spectra, such as GFP and FITC whose peak emission fluorescence are separated by only 7 nm can be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haraguchi et al., 2002</xref>). Spectral imaging has been highly validated in both conventional fluorescence and FRET imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woehler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We tested whether we can faithfully image the three FRET pairs Alexa Fluor 488–546, 488–594 and 488–647. Because Alexa Fluor 488 has a quantum yield of 0.92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>), we chose to use it as a common donor for all three acceptors used in this study. We prepared 20-mer RNA probes with two labeling sites and generated a total of seven probes including all three FRET probes and four single-labeled control probes. We recovered single- and double-labeled RNA from polyacrylamide gels. To image them on a laser scanning confocal microscope, we packed the probes in lipocomplexes. We found that individual complexation and sequential loading of the probes onto a plate prevented any co-localization of the lipocomplexes, ensuring that each fluorescence signal originates from a specific probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We loaded all seven probes onto a plate and acquired spectral images ranging from 500 to 740 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and applied linear unmixing to resolve all seven distinct fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Importantly, we found using single-labeled control probes that the acceptor bleed-through remained stable with all three acceptors over a large range of fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), making the computational removal of spectral-bleedthrough after linear unmixing a reliable method.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49599.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Multiplex spectral FRET imaging in single living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Individual lipocomplexes containing only RNA labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, 546, 594, 647, 488 and 546, 488 and 594 or 488 and 647 were visualized by spectral imaging, resolving four individually labeled RNA constructs and three RNA FRET constructs.

We then investigated whether spectral imaging allows to resolve the same three FRET pairs as above in single living cells using MAGIC.

Taken together, MAGIC coupled with spectral imaging provides a powerful tool for the multiplex imaging of at least three genes pairs in single living cells and for the study of the processes of lineage commitment and diversification in single living cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we presented a novel strategy to correlate gene expression and cell physiology in a heterogeneous assembly of single living cells. Previous studies aimed at targeting specific mRNA in living cells via nucleic acid or protein probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ozawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>). Our strategy utilizes a hybrid approach comprising fluorescent RNA probes and dsRNA-binding protein to enable FRET to discern hybridized probes within single living cells. We were able to assess the cell physiology of distinct myocardial sublineages during early cardiac differentiation from hPSC. To delineate the process of functional maturation in human cardiac myocytes, we studied how the transcriptional activation of a key contractility protein, MHCα, impacts the calcium handling capacity of hPSC-CMs. This approach has the broader potential to study how the expression of specific genes regulates single-cell physiology. As more single-cell transcriptional profiling and related technologies identify new candidate lineage-specific markers, it is increasingly important to validate the functional relevance of these markers by single-cell functional assays, such as the one presented herein.</p><p>Cellular heterogeneity has been a persistent challenge in biomedical research. Pronounced cell-to-cell variation with respect to morphology and function is evident within multiple tissues and cell types, such as stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dulken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bryant et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cordeiro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Domian et al., 2009</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandoe and Eggan, 2013</xref>) and various types of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meacham and Morrison, 2013</xref>). These considerations raise the question of how cellular heterogeneity emerges during embryonic development and contributes to disease formation. Although a number of single-cell transcriptional profiling studies have examined cellular heterogeneity in various cell types, the functional significance of transcriptomic diversity remains challenging to assess. Understanding the cellular processes underlying lineage commitment, lineage diversification, and functional maturation requires the concurrent assessment of transcriptional and functional changes at single-cell resolution. Our imaging technology could therefore complement existing single-cell assays to further our understanding of how transcriptional variation between single cells translates into functional differences.</p><p>An unexpected element of heterogeneity we discovered in our study is mRNA localization. Previous studies have demonstrated that in multiple transformed cell lines the β-actin mRNA is largely localized to the cytoplasm with little nuclear presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Femino et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nelles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>). At the same time, a number of studies have suggested that nuclear translocation of the β-actin mRNA might play an important role for normal cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fallini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Concomitant application of MAGIC with the established smFISH technology confirmed the cytoplasmic nature of the β-actin mRNA in U2OS cells; however, strikingly, we found that a fraction of hPSC-derived cardiac myocytes retained the β-actin mRNA in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). What physiologic role could underlie the nuclear retention of mRNA in cardiac myocytes? Gene expression has previously been shown to be subject to stochastic fluctuations arising from short but intense bursts of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj et al., 2006</xref>). Since these bursts can result in profound gene expression noise and thus variations in proteins levels, compartmentalization of mRNA may provide an option to reduce fluctuations in cytoplasmic mRNA levels and may thus be considered a mode of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</xref>). Given the imperative role of actin filaments in cardiac myocyte contractility, it is possible that the nuclear retention of the β-actin mRNA ensures stable β-actin protein levels for the correct alignment of actin filaments during the contractility-dependent organization of actin arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skwarek-Maruszewska et al., 2009</xref>). This possibility is further supported by the interdependence between cellular maturation and contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ribeiro et al., 2015</xref>) and given that early PSC-derived cardiac myocytes still undergo the process of cellular maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), it is possible that the cells displaying marked nuclear retention of the β-actin mRNA were in the process of organizing their sarcomeric actin structures. Given the strength of our technology to provide a spatial resolution of mRNA expression, we anticipate that MAGIC will be useful for the study of the functional significance of variations in mRNA localization.</p><p>Lineage assignment in real-time also lends itself to cellular models of biology and disease. Poorly defined heterogeneous mixtures of cell cultures limit the strength of population studies in PSC disease models of specific cellular subtypes. While a number of protocols for efficient PSC differentiation toward specific cell types have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maroof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pagliuca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Protze et al., 2017</xref>), these enrichment strategies are not well suited to study the dynamics governing cellular sublineages. Hence, there is an inherent disconnect between how tissue development and pathogenesis occur in vivo and how they are recreated in PSC in vitro models. Modeling of the biology and disease of specific cell subtypes could now be facilitated using MAGIC by targeting specific cellular subsets using validated markers. Further, lineage assignment in real-time using MAGIC could also potentially be leveraged to select multiple specific cell subtypes by fluorescence activated cell sorting, as previously demonstrated using molecular beacon probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jha et al., 2015</xref>). Our technology preserves cell viability, and mRNA and protein expression after cellular delivery of MAGIC components, which altogether are prerequisites for successful longitudinal studies. Further studies are required to demonstrate the utility of MAGIC for cell sorting purposes.</p><p>While our here presented system enables the real-time detection of transcripts, some limitations still remain. Since our technology relies on the delivery of both MAGIC Factor and Probes into the same cell, variable intercellular transfection efficiency may be a limiting factor. This may further be compounded by the cell type of interest, as different cell types may be transfected with variable transfection efficiencies. Given the large number of commercially available transfection reagents, we do not anticipate that efficient transfection of MAGIC constructs poses a considerable challenge to the general applicability of our technology. Additionally, by careful selection of cells based on relative, homogeneous signal intensities, as we did in our study, these limitations could be further alleviated. Collectively, we anticipate that this technology will be useful for any application where cellular heterogeneity with respect to gene expression and cell physiology plays an important biological role.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>H7</td><td>Harvard University</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_9772">CVCL_9772</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HUES-9</td><td>Harvard University</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0057">CVCL_0057</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NKX2-5<sup>eGFP/w</sup></td><td>Dr. Stanley, Monash University, Australia</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>U2OS</td><td>This study</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0042">CVCL_0042</ext-link></td><td>Cell line can be obtained from our lab upon request</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MHCalpha (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>clone 940344</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MLC2a (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Synaptic Systems</td><td>clone 56F5</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MLC2v (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Proteintech</td><td>Cat#: 10906–1-AP</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Troponin T (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>clone 200805</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Nkx2.5 (goat monoclonal)</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>Cat#: AF2444</td><td>1:400</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning, recombinant expression and purification of MAGIC Factor</title><p>MAGIC Factor was produced by first amplifying the dsRBD coding site of human protein kinase R (PKR) by PCR and then cloned into pET-14b recombinant expression vector (Novagen) at the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The sequence was verified by standard sequencing methods. The pET-14b vector adds a polyhistidine-tag to the N-terminus of the protein to facilitate purification by affinity purification. The polyhistidine-tag was previously shown to not affect the binding affinity of the dsRBD to dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bevilacqua and Cech, 1996</xref>). Recombinant expression was performed by inoculating one clone into LB media containing 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 1% glucose and 200 μg/ml ampicillin and shaking at 37°C for 12 hr. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in the above media without glucose. The cells were shaken at 37°C until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.3 and then continued shaking at 22°C until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM IPTG.

Sulfo-SIAB was added at final 50 mM to the dsRNA and the reaction performed in 0.25M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> buffer, pH 8.5 for 2 hr in the dark at room temperature. Excess Sulfo-SIAB was removed by standard ethanol precipitation of dsRNA. In parallel, NHS-activated agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) were prepared. All steps were performed at room temperature until the addition of MAGIC Factor, after which all further steps were performed at 4°C. First, the resin was modified with 100 mM cystamine pH 8.0 for 1 hr to turn the amine-reactive group on the beads into thiol-reactive sites. Free amine-reactive sites were blocked with 200 mM Tris, pH 7.5 for 30 min. Cystamine molecules were then reduced with 50 mM TCEP and the modified dsRNA coupled to the beads in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mM NaCl overnight at room temperature.

Cells were plated onto Matrigel-coated 96-well plates with a No. 1.5 glass bottom or polydimethylsiloxane-coated glass dishes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cellular delivery of MAGIC Factor and probes</title><p>MAGIC Factor and Probes were sequentially delivered into cells. Cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and transfected at 50–60% confluency. At 0 hr, 500 ng MAGIC Factor was mixed with 0.4 μl Pepmute Transfection Reagent (SignaGen) in a total of 10 μl 1x Pepmute Transfection buffer and added to cells in Gem21 media (see above) after a 20 min incubation. At 1 hr, MAGIC Probes were mixed to 0.75 μM with 0.075 μl TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) in a total of 10 μl 1x Pepmute Transfection buffer and added to cells in Gem21 media (see above). Cells were washed and imaged at 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH)</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 70% ethanol for at least 2 hr at 4°C. After washing with wash buffer (2xSSC, 10% formamide), β-actin, MHCα or MLC2a MAGIC Probes were added at 37 nM and Stellaris β-actin, MHCα or MLC2a single-molecule FISH (smFISH) probes (Biosearch Technologies) were added at 125 nM to cells in hybridization buffer (2xSSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 μg/μl t-RNA, 0.02% BSA, 10% formamide, 40U Superase In RNase inhibitor) for 4 hr at 37°C. Cells were then washed with wash buffer and equilibrated with EMSA buffer. 50 ng purified MAGIC Factor was added to cells in EMSA buffer and reacted for 1 hr at 4°C. Cells were then washed with EMSA buffer and imaged. In RNA-FISH experiments, MAGIC Factor was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, MAGIC Probe with Alexa Fluor 546 and smFISH probe with Quasar 670 dye.</p><p>For quantification of transcript levels, 3D images of cells stained with the β-actin, MHCα or MLC2a smFISH probes were acquired and transcripts levels quantified using Volocity software (Perkin Elmer) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lifland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Laser scanning confocal Microscopy</title><p>Live-cell imaging was performed on Nikon A1R+ or Leica TCS SP8 confocal systems with live-cell chambers to maintain incubator conditions during image acquisition. For imaging of one FRET pair, the appropriate filters for the donor and acceptors were chosen for sensitized emission technique. MAGIC Factor was excited with a 488 nm laser, and MAGIC Probes were excited with 552 nm and 638 nm lasers, respectively. Single-labeled control samples were used to calculate the relative spectral bleed-through from donor and acceptor fluorophores. Control and experimental samples were imaged using the same imaging settings. For imaging of multiple FRET pairs, spectral imaging and linear unmixing using the built-in module of the microscope software were performed. The entire spectrum was first divided into multiple detection windows. Images in these windows were then acquired by illuminating a field of view subsequently with 488 nm, 552 nm and 638 nm lasers. From single-labeled controls, spectral fingerprints from corresponding fluorophores were obtained during each experiment. Images from samples containing FRET pairs were processed through linear unmixing using these fingerprints to obtain donor, acceptor and FRET images. Since linear unmixing cannot remove acceptor bleed-through signal from FRET images, they were removed manually using ImageJ or Volocity (see below). Control and experimental samples were imaged using the same imaging settings. Single living cells were imaged using a 20x CFI plan-apochromat objective with a numerical aperture of 0.75 and an additional digital zoom. Only cells that showed a homogeneous distribution of fluorescence signal within the cytoplasm were imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>FRET imaging and processing</title><p>FRET image processing was performed based on established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broussard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spiering et al., 2013</xref>). Raw FRET images were background corrected and intensity thresholded within the confocal microscope software to exclude saturated pixels from further analysis, and then aligned to correct for any shifts during acquisition. Images were exported as 12-bit tiff files and further analysis was performed using ImageJ or Volocity software. Images were then masked and a median filter applied to reduce noise during generation of corrected FRET images. The spectral bleed-through constants, calculated from single-labeled control samples, were used to quantify the corrected FRET (cFRET) intensity in co-transfected cells and to generate cFRET images. cFRET is defined as cFRET = FRET<sub>raw</sub> – (a × donor) – (b × acceptor), whereby a and b are the relative spectral bleed-through constants of the donor and acceptor, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xia and Liu, 2001</xref>). A Summary of quantified data is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table3sdata1">Table 3—source data 1</xref>. All fluorescence intensity quantifications of quantified confocal microscopy data for each channel (MAGIC Factor, MAGIC Probe, FRET) are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table3sdata2">Table 3—source data 2</xref>. When spectral imaging was used, only the acceptor bleed-through was further removed from FRET images. For visualization of FRET, a rainbow pseudocolor LUT was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed following mRNA visualization using MAGIC.

eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Live single-cell transcriptional analysis demarcates cellular functional heterogeneity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sean Wu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article describes a new technology for identifying and labeling live single cells in vitro using fluorescent reporter bound to mRNA. The strategy takes advantage of the specificity of fluorescent RNA probe for binding to mRNA transcript of interest and the illumination of bound dsRNA using the dsRNA binding domain of protein kinase R coupled to a fluorescent FRET donor molecule. By transfection into cultured cells, the authors were able to detect fluorescent signal output from single human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes expressing either MLC2a or MHCα or both. This technology addresses the lack of appropriate tools to identify live single cells by fluorescent imaging and quantification of mRNA expression in living cells.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that the experiments were well organized and professionally conducted and the findings are relatively clear and may provide new insights in identifying the cellular phenotypic diversification and understanding the complex biological processes that underlie development and disease. The results from using such tools would be potentially of significant interest to the scientific community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An advantage of this method is the ability to multiplex different probes with different fluorescence signals and use this to measure gene expression for multiple targeted genes in the same cell. A demonstration of detecting 3 different transcripts by MAGIC probe in the same cell by RNA-probe FRET would add greater utility to the technology described.</p><p>2) Another advantage of this method is to be able maintain cells alive which would enable sorting of fluorescent cells by FACS. Can the authors describe the use of this tool to do cell staining and FACS-based sorting?</p><p>3) The demonstration of the progressive increase in detection of sarcomeric genes by MAGIC during iPSC cardiac differentiation is quite nice. Can this technique also detect transcription factors that are lower in abundance?</p><p>4) What are the most significant advantages and disadvantages between the existing approaches (Introduction, second paragraph) and the authors' MAGIC approach for live-cell mRNA imaging? Please describe in a table a direct comparisons of this vs. other approaches the main advantages and disadvantages of this new approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49599.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An advantage of this method is the ability to multiplex different probes with different fluorescence signals and use this to measure gene expression for multiple targeted genes in the same cell.

We now provide a new paragraph extensively describing this imaging technique as well as proof-of-principle experiments demonstrating the validity of our approach (revised Figure 6A-C, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2). We also provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of the detection of 3 different transcripts in single living cells by our technology. We show how cells differentially express MLC2a, NKX2-5 and MHCα during hPSC differentiation in the revised Figure 6D-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another advantage of this method is to be able maintain cells alive which would enable sorting of fluorescent cells by FACS. Can the authors describe the use of this tool to do cell staining and FACS-based sorting?</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we intended to demonstrate the utility of our technology for single-cell analyses to select for individual cell lineages and to assess their physiology in real-time. While MAGIC coupled with FACS would be a powerful tool for the purification of multiple individual cell subtypes, in the current iteration of our technology we did not assess its utility for FACS assays. We do however discuss now the potential of MAGIC for cell sorting assays using FACS in the Discussion. We hope that further studies will demonstrate the utility of MAGIC for FACS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The demonstration of the progressive increase in detection of sarcomeric genes by MAGIC during iPSC cardiac differentiation is quite nice. Can this technique also detect transcription factors that are lower in abundance?</p></disp-quote><p>Transcription factors are widely recognized as key effectors of cellular identity and function and are typically expressed at much lower levels than structural proteins (such as MHCα and MLC2a). In the case of the heart, NKX2-5 controls a transcriptional hierarchy that directs cardiac differentiation and is required for normal cardiac function. Accordingly we examined the expression of this low-abundance transcription factor with MAGIC. We show that our technology is able to detect low copy mRNA and can be used to detect the longitudinal expression of transcription factor in developing cells. This set of data is included in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What are the most significant advantages and disadvantages between the existing approaches (Introduction, second paragraph) and the authors' MAGIC approach for live-cell mRNA imaging?
