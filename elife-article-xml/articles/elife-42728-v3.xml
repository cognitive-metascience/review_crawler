However, neural circuits underlying the modulation of innate defensive behavior remain not well-understood. In particular, environmental threats are commonly associated with cues of multiple sensory modalities. It remains to be investigated how these modalities interact to shape defensive behavior. In this study, we report that auditory-induced defensive flight behavior can be facilitated by somatosensory input in mice. This cross-modality modulation of defensive behavior is mediated by the projection from the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp) to the ventral sector of zona incerta (ZIv). Parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons in ZIv, receiving direct input from SSp, mediate the enhancement of the flight behavior via their projections to the medial posterior complex of thalamus (POm). Thus, defensive flight can be enhanced in a somatosensory context-dependent manner via recruiting PV neurons in ZIv, which may be important for increasing survival of prey animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zona incerta</kwd><kwd>defensive behavior</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin</kwd><kwd>escape</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC008983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Li I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY019049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Huizhong W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001717</institution-id><institution>Karl Kirchgessner Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Huizhong W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Huizhong W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parvalbumin positive GABAergic neurons in the ventral zona incerta receive input from somatosensory cortex and enhance sound-induced flight behavior, which underlies a cross-modality facilitation of defensive behavior by somatosensory input.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Defensive behaviors are critical for animal survival. They are dynamic and adaptive, as environmental contexts, properties and intensity of threats, as well as expectations from past experiences can all modulate the form as well as the magnitude of defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fanselow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Threat signals in the external environment are sensed by different sensory modalities through distinct sensory pathways to initiate appropriate defensive behaviors. Previous studies have mostly been focused on defensive behaviors initiated under stimulation of one individual sensory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). However, a danger may be associated with cues of multiple sensory modalities arriving at the same time, and the integration of information of these different modalities may profoundly influence the behavioral output. Intuitively, the presence of multisensory signals is helpful for strengthening defensive responses. However, neural circuit bases for the potential cross-modality interactions in defensive behaviors are largely unknown. In this study, we designed experiments to specifically examine whether tactile input can affect a well-established auditory-induced defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). The vibrissal system is crucial to behaviors such as navigation and exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>), and rodents frequently collect information from surroundings using their whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prigg et al., 2002</xref>). We reason that it may be common for animals to use both vibrissal and auditory systems in sensing environmental dangers.</p><p>Zona incerta (ZI) is a major GABAergic subthalamic nucleus consisting of heterogeneous groups of cells. In rodents, four (rostral, ventral, dorsal, caudal) sectors of ZI can be loosely defined based on neurochemical expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mitrofanis et al., 2004</xref>), and it has been suggested that different sectors might be involved in different circuits and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plaha et al., 2008</xref>). Our recent study has shown that GABAergic neurons in the rostral sector of ZI (ZIr) play a role in reducing defensive behavior in an experience-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2018</xref>). It also raises a possibility that ZI might play a broader role in defensive behavior. ZI receives inputs from various cortical areas including the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolmac et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shammah-Lagnado et al., 1985</xref>) as well as from the brainstem trigeminal nucleus that relays vibrissal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roger and Cadusseau, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith, 1973</xref>). A recent study has demonstrated that deflecting whiskers directly induces neuronal activity in the ventral sector of ZI (ZIv) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Urbain and Deschênes, 2007</xref>), where parvalbumin (PV) positive neurons are enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kolmac and Mitrofanis, 1999</xref>). In the present study, we investigated whether somatosensory input through whisker stimulation could modulate defensive behavior via recruiting ZIv PV+ neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test whether tactile input can affect defensive behavior, we employed a relatively simple behavioral test, sound-induced flight, following our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). Such behavior has been observed in both freely moving and head-fixed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). In our first set of experiments, animals were head-fixed and placed on a smoothly rotatable plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). Loud noise sound (80 dB sound pressure level or SPL) elicited animal running, and the running speed was recorded in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). Tactile stimulation was applied by deflecting whiskers unilaterally with a cotton stick controlled by a piezo actuator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In our control experiments, the whisker deflection per se did not elicit significant locomotion of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Trials without and with tactile stimulation were interleaved. We found that tactile stimulation enhanced the running induced by noise sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right), as demonstrated by the increased peak speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and total travel distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The temporal profile of the behavioral response was not significantly affected, as shown by the quantifications of onset latency and time to peak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Silencing the SSp contralateral to the whiskers being deflected by infusing a GABA receptor agonist, muscimol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left), removed the difference in speed between conditions without and with whisker stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), without altering the response temporal profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that the tactile enhancement of running is mediated mainly through SSp. To further demonstrate the tactile effect on flight behavior in freely moving animals, we used a two-chamber test following our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). When the mouse was exposed to noise applied in one chamber, it quickly escaped to the other chamber by crossing through a narrow channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Trimming of all whiskers of the animal significantly decreased the average speed of the flight through the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that tactile information through whiskers can indeed enhance flight behavior in a more natural condition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42728.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tactile stimulation enhances sound-induced flight response via SSp.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, illustration of the head-fixed animal behavioral paradigm.

To confirm this projection, we injected AAV1-CamKII-hChR2-eYFP into SSp of PV-<italic>ires</italic>-Cre crossed with Ai14 (Cre-dependent tdTomato) reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found profuse fluorescence-labeled axons in ZIv, but few in other ZI sectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next directly examined the effect of stimulating the SSp projection to ZIv, by placing optic fibers on top of ZIv to deliver LED light pulses (20 Hz train for 5 s) bilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The optogenetic activation of the SSp axons in ZIv enhanced noise-induced running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) without affecting the response temporal profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but by itself had no effect on the baseline locomotion speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To test whether SSp axons innervate PV+ neurons, we performed slice whole-cell recording from ZIv PV+ neurons (labeled by tdTomato expression in PV-Cre::Ai14 animals) while optically activating ChR2-expressing SSp axons in ZI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We observed that blue light pulses evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in most ZIv PV+ neurons recorded with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) present in the bath solution. The EPSC could be blocked by an AMPA receptor blocker, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>).

Optogenetic manipulation of ZI PV+ neuron activity with blue (for the ChR2 group to activate) or green (for the ArchT group to suppress) LED light was interleaved with control trials in which only sound was delivered. The efficacies of ChR2 and ArchT were confirmed by slice whole-cell recordings showing that blue LED light evoked robust spiking in ChR2-expressing neurons and green LED light induced a strong hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in ArchT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

Both SSp and ZIv PV+neurons, which receive SSp input, are necessary for this modulation, and activation of the SSp-ZIv projection is sufficient for driving the enhancement of the behavior. We also demonstrate that activation of ZIv PV+ neurons alone can enhance the flight behavior and that inactivation of the PV+ neurons or their projections to POm blocks the tactile enhancement of the flight behavior. Together, our data suggest that tactile input through whisker deflections can modulate defensive flight via the SSp-ZIv-POm pathway.</p><p>Rodents frequently use their whiskers to locate and identify objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O'Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pammer et al., 2013</xref>). In complex sensory environments, whiskers are essential for them to gather information from surroundings as to guide their behaviors during exploration and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahl, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). When escape behavior is concerned, specific somatosensory input plus loud sound may indicate the immediate proximity of a predator, and enhancement of flight at such moments will greatly increase survival chances of prey animals. In addition, information conveyed by the somatosensory system about the environment could be extremely useful for the prey animal to quickly choose an effective escape route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douglass et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the ability to integrate somatosensory input and modulate defensive flight behavior accordingly is beneficial for animals to avoid dangers. Here, we show that somatosensory input from whiskers can enhance auditory-induced flight response. Indeed, in freely moving mice, trimming of whiskers reduces the efficiency of their escape from a source of loud noise by crossing through a channel, indicating a faciliatory role of the tactile input.</p><p>The tactile-auditory cross-modality modulation relies on conveying somatosensory information primarily from SSp to ZI. ZI has been implicated in maintaining normal posture and locomotor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards and Isaacs, 1991</xref>), as it sends dense projections to motor-related thalamic and brainstem nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kolmac et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shaw and Mitrofanis, 2002</xref>). The somatosensory input to ZI thus has a potential to influence motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Périer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Supko et al., 1991</xref>). In this study, we show that SSp projections to ZI are mainly concentrated in ZIv, where PV+ neurons are a major cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitrofanis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this projection, PV+ neurons in ZIv receive direct excitatory input from SSp and respond to whisker deflections. Concurrent whisker deflections also increase their responses to sound, indicating that tactile-auditory integration takes place in ZIv PV+ neurons. Activating SSp-ZIv axon terminals or ZIv PV+ neurons directly enhances auditory-induced flight, while silencing the PV+ neurons abolishes the enhancement of flight by tactile stimulation. Therefore, our data demonstrate that via the SSp-ZIv pathway mediated mainly by ZIv PV+ neurons, somatosensory input can modulate motor functions in defensive behavior. Whether ZIv PV+ neurons are involved specifically in tactile-auditory integration or multisensory integration in general remains to be further investigated.</p><p>Different ZI sectors are dominated by distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitrofanis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ricardo, 1981</xref>). It has been suggested that different ZI cell types or sectors may exhibit different connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitrofanis, 2005</xref>), contributing to ZI’s multiplex roles in various physiological functions. For example, it has been shown that activation of GABAergic neurons in the rostral sector of ZI (ZIr), which are likely PV-negative, can induce binge-like eating via its projections to the periventricular nucleus of thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and van den Pol, 2017</xref>), while Lhx6-expressing neurons in ZIv, which are also PV-negative, can regulate sleep through their projections to hypothalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Different sectors or cell types may also play different roles in defensive behavior. Indeed, we have previously shown that activation of ZIr GABAergic neurons reduces noise-induced flight via their projections to the periaqueductal gray (PAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2018</xref>). This effect is opposite to that of activating ZIv PV+ neurons, which have few projections to PAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). More recently, using conditioned freezing response as a model, a study of ZIv PV+ neurons has shown that both silencing the PV+ neuron output and silencing the amygdala inhibitory input to the PV+ neurons disrupt fear memory acquisition as well as recall of remote fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, the behavior we examined is an innate defensive behavior. Therefore, ZIv PV+ neurons can play a role in regulating both innate and learned defensive behaviors, which are generated under different contexts and likely engage different upstream pathways. It would be interesting to investigate in the future how ZI, through interactions among its different cell-types/subdivisions, regulates behaviors in complex sensory and behavioral environments.</p><p>We have identified POm as a target of ZIv PV+ neurons that is mainly responsible for the tactile enhancement of flight behavior. Silencing of the projection from ZIv PV+ neurons to POm prevents the faciliatory effect of tactile stimulation. PV+ neurons in ZI are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barthó et al., 2002</xref>) and provide inhibition to their target neurons. To achieve the effect of enhancing the behavioral output, disinhibitory circuits may be involved. POm is known to project to the striatum to modulate locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). The inhibitory nature of striatal neurons makes them a good candidate for engaging disinhibition of distant output responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grillner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown previously that the noise-induced flight behavior depends on a pathway from the auditory cortex (AC) to the cortex of inferior colliculus (ICx) and then to PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that the ZIv-POm pathway directly or indirectly connect to midbrain areas downstream of the AC-ICx-PAG pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marchand and Hagino, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roseberry et al., 2016</xref>). As such, somatosensory information carried by the ZIv-POm pathway can modulate the auditory-induced behavior mediated by the AC-ICx-PAG pathway.

Brains were post-fixed at 4 ˚C overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and then sliced into 150 μm sections using a vibratome (Leica, VT1000s). To reveal the cytoarchitectural information, brain slices were first rinsed three times with PBS for 10 min, and then incubated in PBS containing Nissl (Neurotrace 620, ThermoFisher, N21483) and 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hr. All images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000). To quantify the relative strength of axonal projections of ZIv PV+ neurons in downstream structures, serial sections across the whole brain were collected. Regions of interest were imaged at 10X magnification across the depth of the tissue (15 μm z-stack interval). For each brain, images were taken using identical laser power, gain and offset values. Fluorescence quantifications were performed by converting the images into monochromatic so that each pixel had a grayscale ranging from 0 to 255. Intensity value of the region of interest (200 × 200 pixel) was normalized to the baseline value. For each region of interest, three or more sections were imaged and averaged.

Briefly, to optogenetically manipulate ZI neuron cell bodies, or ZI-POm, ZI-SC or SSp-ZI axon terminals, mice were implanted with fiber optic cannulas (200 µm ID, Thorlabs) two weeks after injecting ChR2 or ArchT virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chow et al., 2010</xref>). The animal was anesthetized and mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting co.). Small holes (500 µm diameter) were drilled at a 20-degree angle relative to the vertical plane above ZI (AP −2.1 mm, ML ±1.5 mm, DV −4.3 mm), POm (AP −2.0 mm, ML ±1.5 mm, DV −3.0 mm) or SC (AP −4.0 mm, ML ±1.5 mm, DV −2.0 mm). The cannulas were lowered to the desired depth and fixed in place using dental cement. In the meantime, a screw for head fixation was mounted on the top of the skull with dental cement. Light from a blue LED source (470 nm, 10 mW, Thorlabs) was delivered at a rate of 20 Hz (20 ms pulse duration) via the implanted-cannulas using a bifurcated patch cord (Ø200 µm, 0.22 NA SMA 905, Thorlabs) for ChR2 or GFP control animals. The plastic sleeve (Thorlabs) securing the patch cord and cannula was wrapped with black tape to prevent light leakage. Light from a green LED source (530 nm, 10 mW, Thorlabs) for ArchT animals was delivered continuously for 5 s. Animals were allowed to recover for one week before behavioral tests. During the recovery period, they were habituated to the head fixation on the running plate. The head screw was tightly fit into a metal post while the animal could run freely on a flat rotating plate. Following testing sessions, animals were euthanized, and the brain was imaged to verify the locations of viral expression and implanted optic fibers.

Sound stimulation, LED stimulation and data acquisition software were custom developed in LabVIEW (National Instruments). Each mouse was tested for one session per day which lasted no longer than two hours. During the behavioral session, the animal was head-fixed, and the speed of the running plate was detected with an optical shaft encoder (US Digital) and recorded in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). A 2 s or 5 s noise sound at 80 dB SPL (Scan-speaker D2905) was presented to trigger flight response as previously described. The stimulus was repeated for about 20 trials per session at an irregular interval ranging from 120 to 180 s. Little adaptation was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). Whisker stimulation (for 2 s) was delivered through a cotton stick controlled by a piezo actuator (Thorlabs). The stimulation frequency was 5 Hz and the vibration range was 4 mm. For optogenetic experiments, the blue or green LED stimulation (lasting for the entire 5 s duration of noise presentation) was randomly co-applied in half of the trials. LED-On and LED-Off trials were interleaved. The exact sequence, ‘On-Off-On-Off…’ or ‘Off-On-Off-On…”, was randomized for animals in the same group, or between different test sessions. Whisker stimulation was applied on the same side of auditory stimulation during the 2 s noise presentation without or with muscimol infusions into the contralateral SSp or bilateral ZI. For DREADDi experiments, animals infected with AAV-hM4Di(Gi)-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu and Roth, 2014</xref>) received either an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (1 mg/kg), or a local infusion of CNO (3 μM, 100 nl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) or saline (100 nl) through implanted cannulas into the POm.

Silicone adhesive (Kwik-Cast Sealant, WPI Inc) was applied to cover the craniotomy window until the recording experiment. Recording was carried out with an optrode (A1 × 16-Poly2-5mm-50 s-177-OA16LP, 16 contacts separated by 50 μm, the distance between the tip of the optic fiber and the probes is 200 μm, NA 0.22, Neuronexus Technologies) connected to a laser source (473 nm) with an optic fiber. The optrode was lowered into the ZIv region, and data were acquired with the Plexon recording system. The PV+ neurons were optogenetically tagged by injecting floxed AAV-ChR2 in PV-Cre animals. To identify PV+ neurons, 20 Hz (20 ms pulse duration, 500 ms total duration) laser pulse trains were delivered intermittently. Signals were recorded and filtered through a bandpass filter (0.3–3 kHz). The nearby four channels of the probe were grouped as tetrodes, and semiautomatic spike sorting was performed by using Offline Sorter (Plexon). Semiautomated clustering was carried out on the basis of the first three principal components of the spike waveform on each tetrode channel using a T-Dist E-M scan algorithm (scan over a range of 10–30 degree of freedom) and then evaluated with sort quality metrics. Clusters with isolation distance &lt;20 and L-Ratio &gt; 0.1 were discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Spike clusters were classified as single units only if the waveform SNR (Signal Noise Ratio) exceeded 4 (12 dB) and the inter-spike intervals exceeded 1.2 ms for &gt;99.5% of the spikes. To assess whether these units were driven directly by ChR2 or indirectly by synaptic connections, we analyzed the onset latency relative to each light stimulation. Only spikes with latency &lt;3 ms were considered as being directly stimulated in this study. The whisker, noise or LED stimulation was given in a pseudorandom order for 7 to 12 trials. The evoked firing rate was calculated within the stimulation time window, subtracting the spontaneous firing rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data processing</title><p>For the head-fixed running test, running speed was recorded at 10 Hz sampling rate.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;A Cross-modality Enhancement of Defensive Flight via Parvalbumin Neurons in Zona Incerta&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a well-conducted and interesting study, but have raised a number of important concerns. Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>It was agreed that you have not included an adequate validation of the optogenetic manipulations, particularly as the effects reported are relatively modest, and that it is important to show in vivo how tactile and auditory inputs interact to determine the responses of ZI neurons. The reviewers also raised queries about the downstream projections from these neurons and how the results reported fit with previous studies. Finally, doubts were raised about the ecological relevance of tactile facilitation of auditory behavior.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors tried to explore the role of ZI PV+ neurons in the cross-modal enhancement of defensive flight behavior. Although this appears to be an interesting study, the data at this point are rather preliminary. Several key experiments are lacking before the manuscript become convincing. This reviewer believes the authors should perform the following suggested experiments.</p><p>1) The authors have to record the activity of ZI PV+ neurons in vivo, either by fiber photometry or by single-unit recording. This type of experiment is regular and must-have for studies of neural circuits. Do ZI PV+ neurons respond to whisker deflections? Are they activated by sound that trigger flight responses? How do they integrate the sensory stimuli with different modalities?</p><p>2) The authors should expand their optogenetic experiments. For example, in Figure 2C-E, they should apply photostimulation with different light power and frequency. The phenotypes here appear to be extremely small. Would photostimulation with higher power or frequency be able to induce stronger differences between LED ON and OFF?</p><p>3) The authors need to provide a more detailed description of the projection targets of ZI PV+ neurons. The ZI project to multiple brain areas that control binge-like eating (Zhang and van den Pol, 2017) and sleep regulation (Liu et al., 2017). Considering these recent reports, this reviewer is not convinced that the ZI PV+ neurons only have two downstream targets that deserve scrutinizing.</p><p>4) As to the POm and SC as the postsynaptic targets of the ZI PV+ neurons, the authors need to answer two additional questions. What percentage of ZI PV+ neurons send collaterals to the POm and SC? If the POm-projecting ZI PV+ neurons are specifically silenced, what will happen?</p><p>5) The profiles of locomotion speed appear to be very zig-zag. This reviewer strongly suggest that the authors provide more analyses to compare the temporal properties of mouse escape behaviors in control and test groups.</p><p>6) As an essential part of data, the author need to present slice physiological data or in vivo recording data to functionally validate the ChR2, ArchT and hM4D to manipulate neuronal activity.</p><p>7) Again, as an essential part of data, the author need to provide how they validate the specificity of genetic manipulations of ZI PV+ neurons. For example, an immunohistochemical labeling of PV antibody and the fluorescent ChR2, ArchT and hM4D (Gi) are required.</p><p>8) The authors need to discuss whether the cross-modal property of ZI PV+ neurons is only specific for somatosensory-auditory integration. Alternatively, are they a bona fide node for any multisensory integration?</p><p>9) In this study, the author stated that &quot;tactile stimulation was […] controlled by a piezo actuator (see Materials and methods)&quot;. However, the description of their piezo actuator is missing in Materials and methods. The authors need to add this part in Materials and methods and provide a supplementary figure to illustrate how they provide whisker stimulation. The intensity and frequency of whisker stimulation sometimes are critical factors to determine the valence of somatosensory stimuli. Therefore, the authors should be very careful to optimize their stimulation mode.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes the results of an interesting set of experiments designed to examine somatosensory-mediated facilitation of auditory induced avoidance behavior in the mouse, and the neural circuits supporting this facilitated behavior. The authors show that vibrissal stimulation increases the speed of escape behaviors elicited by a loud sound. They go on to further show through a series of elegant experiments using anatomical, pharmacological, optogenetic and chemogenetic methods that the behavior is mediated by projections from somatosensory cortex to a subregion of zone incerta, and that parvalbumin expressing neurons in the ZI and that project to the medial posterior nucleus of the thalamus are the critical circuit elements. Overall the paper is reasonably well-written (it could use an editorial pass to improve some of the language) and experiments appear to be well-designed and well-conducted. My major questions regarding the paper have to do with the ecological validity of the behavior being examined, and how this behavior was tested.</p><p>First although I completely understand the concept of multisensory facilitation of behavior, I'm struggling to see the adaptive value of what is being measured. Under what circumstances would a loud sound and light touch to the vibrissae happen that would necessitate escape? Second, without quantifying the direction of the running, how do we know whether this is approach of avoidance? Third, why is running speed the measure of interest? From an adaptive perspective, the critical variable here would seem to be latency of response (i.e., how quickly is the escape triggered). Finally, and related to the above, without any meaningful spatial information in the stimuli (the sound appears to be very generalized – and paired with a touch to a left whisker), how can this be called escape? This is much more reminiscent of an acoustic startle paradigm, where multisensory facilitation has been well established.</p><p>As a final general comment, although the results of the ontogenetic experiments all go in the predicted direction, I am not sure of how robust the results are or of the statistical approaches that have been used to detail the differences.</p><p>The results are of interest – I am just trying to place them in a comprehensible behavioral context and am struggling without further elaboration and discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Wang et al. shows that somatosensory input enhances sound-induced flight behavior through PV+ neuron of ZIv. It is an interesting topic that flight behavior can be enhanced by multisensory input, but there are several key concerns.</p><p>1) The authors discussed that ZIv-POm can project to the striatum to influence locomotion directly. If so, they should have seen that the direct activation of this circuit enhance the locomotion. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, authors did not see the effect (although the flight speed tended to increase overall). Then, how the POm projection could enhance the flight response? In their previous paper, it was shown that a circuit projecting from ACx to ICx to PAG drives noise-induced flight response directly. The POm projection should be integrated into this ACx downstream pathway to enhance the audition-induced flight response. Projection from POm must enhance the auditory ascending pathway or strengthen ACx-to-ICx circuit. Further experiments or explanations need to clarify this to understand how the flight behavior (output of PAG) is modulated by the 'cross-modal' interaction between audition and somatosensation.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the SSp axon terminal is well observed in ZIv and can be targeted easily for optogenetic manipulation. However, the optogenetic manipulation effect actually seems very weak. The authors described in the method that they measured the noise-induced locomotion in 20 trials across 2 sessions and averaged all. In the average trace, the degree of LED light-induced improvement effect looks smaller than the variation in the control conditions (e.g. the peak speeds at LED OFF in Figure 3C and F).

This type of experiment is regular and must-have for studies of neural circuits. Do ZI PV+ neurons respond to whisker deflections? Are they activated by sound that trigger flight responses? How do they integrate the sensory stimuli with different modalities?</italic> </p><p>We have performed awake optrode recording to examine responses of ZI PV+ neurons to whisker and noise stimulation. We found that ZI PV+ neurons are responsive to both noise sound and whisker deflections. In addition, the noise responses of these neurons are enhanced by concurrent whisker deflections (Figure 3J-L). Therefore, cross-modality integration takes place in ZI PV+ neurons, in which somatosensory input has a faciliatory role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should expand their optogenetic experiments. For example, in Figure 2C-E, they should apply photostimulation with different light power and frequency. The phenotypes here appear to be extremely small. Would photostimulation with higher power or frequency be able to induce stronger differences between LED ON and OFF?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect is only moderate. For Figure 2C-E, in the revision, we have increased the animal number and the result now shows an increased significance level. There are two factors that may explain the relatively small effect. First, we have used white noise at a high intensity of 80dB SPL, which could trigger a high-magnitude (possibly close to saturation) flight response according to our previous study (Xiong et al., 2015). Second, the activation of terminals may not be highly efficient, and the axon projections may only be partially labeled.</p><p>In fact, we have used the maximum LED power available in our current system and a very high stimulation frequency (20 Hz) that ZI PV+ neurons can fire (see Figure 3L). To test whether a stronger modulatory effect can be obtained, we then applied a lower noise intensity (60dB SPL). We found a large increase (127% ± 121%, n = 4) in the probability of sound-evoked running in LED-On vs LED-Off trials, although when only running trials were analyzed the percentage increase of peak speed in LED-On trials was not significantly larger than in the 80-dB noise condition. We think this result does suggest a stronger faciliatory effect if a lower-intensity noise is used as the stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to provide a more detailed description of the projection targets of ZI PV+ neurons. The ZI project to multiple brain areas that control binge-like eating (Zhang and van den Pol, 2017) and sleep regulation (Liu et al., 2017). Considering these recent reports, this reviewer is not convinced that the ZI PV+ neurons only have two downstream targets that deserve scrutinizing.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have provided a complete summary of downstream targets of ZI PV+ neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), which shows the relative fluorescence density of axon labeling in different targets. From this figure, it is clear that POm and SC are the two strongest targets of ZI PV+ neurons. We have performed additional experiments to show that locally silencing the ZI PV+ axons in POm blocks the facilitatory effect of whisker stimulation (Figure 4I-K). This further confirms the involvement of the ZIv-POm pathway. It is worth noting that Zhang and van den Pol, 2017 paper studied ZIr neurons and Liu et al., 2017 paper studied ZIv Lhx+ neurons which are PV negative. Together, these studies support the view that different cell types in ZI may play distinct functional roles in different types of behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As to the POm and SC as the postsynaptic targets of the ZI PV+ neurons, the authors need to answer two additional questions. What percentage of ZI PV+ neurons send collaterals to the POm and SC? If the POm-projecting ZI PV+ neurons are specifically silenced, what will happen?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s concern over specificity is warranted. In the revision, we specifically silenced the axonal terminals from ZI PV+ neurons in POm by expressing DREADDi receptors in ZI PV+ neurons and injecting CNO locally in POm, following previous studies (Zhu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). This blocked the modulatory effect of whisker stimulation on the noise-induced escape behavior (Figure 4I-K), suggesting that the ZI PV-POm projection is primarily responsible for the tactile effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The profiles of locomotion speed appear to be very zig-zag. This reviewer strongly suggest that the authors provide more analyses to compare the temporal properties of mouse escape behaviors in control and test groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has raised a good point. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have analyzed the onset latency of the running behavior (determined by the time point at which the speed exceeds the baseline value by 3 standard deviations) as well as the time to peak speed. Our results did not reveal any significant differences between control and manipulation conditions in any set of experiments (see Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As an essential part of data, the author need to present slice physiological data or in vivo recording data to functionally validate the ChR2, ArchT and hM4D to manipulate neuronal activity.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we have provided electrophysiological validations of effects of activating ChR2, ArchT and hM4D on membrane potential responses, using slice whole-cell recording methods (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C, 3A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Again, as an essential part of data, the author need to provide how they validate the specificity of genetic manipulations of ZI PV+ neurons. For example, an immunohistochemical labeling of PV antibody and the fluorescent ChR2, ArchT and hM4D (Gi) are required.</p></disp-quote><p>The PV-<italic>ires</italic>-Cre mouse we used for manipulating PV neuron activity has been widely used by many labs, with previous demonstrations of PV-specific expression (Madisen et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2018). With injections of Cre-dependent viruses, the specificity of expression of opsins or DREADD receptors in PV+ neurons is not a concern. In the revision, we have provided representative images showing co-localization of ChR2-EYFP with tdTomato in PV-Cre crossed with Ai14 (Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter) mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors need to discuss whether the cross-modal property of ZI PV+ neurons is only specific for somatosensory-auditory integration. Alternatively, are they a bona fide node for any multisensory integration?</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, we only provide evidence that ZI PV+ neurons are involved in somatosensory-auditory interaction, an example of cross-modality interaction. Whether these neurons could be a bona fide node for any multisensory integration is unknown and requires more future investigations. We have clarified this point in the Discussion (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In this study, the author stated that &quot;tactile stimulation was….controlled by a piezo actuator (see Materials and methods)&quot;. However, the description of their piezo actuator is missing in Materials and methods. The authors need to add this part in Materials and methods and provide a supplementary figure to illustrate how they provide whisker stimulation. The intensity and frequency of whisker stimulation sometimes are critical factors to determine the valence of somatosensory stimuli. Therefore, the authors should be very careful to optimize their stimulation mode.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added information on the piezo as well as the frequency (5Hz) and vibration range (4 mm) of whisker deflections in Materials and methods (subsection “Head-fixed Flight Response”). We have also added a photograph of the whisker stimulation apparatus to show the detail (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] First although I completely understand the concept of multisensory facilitation of behavior, I'm struggling to see the adaptive value of what is being measured. Under what circumstances would a loud sound and light touch to the vibrissae happen that would necessitate escape? Second, without quantifying the direction of the running, how do we know whether this is approach of avoidance? Third, why is running speed the measure of interest? From an adaptive perspective, the critical variable here would seem to be latency of response (i.e., how quickly is the escape triggered). Finally, and related to the above, without any meaningful spatial information in the stimuli (the sound appears to be very generalized – and paired with a touch to a left whisker), how can this be called escape? This is much more reminiscent of an acoustic startle paradigm, where multisensory facilitation has been well established.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the insufficient background information provided in the previous manuscript. In our previous study (Xiong et al., 2015), we have demonstrated that noise sound can evoke an escape behavior in freely moving animals, manifested by their immediate running away from the chamber containing the sound source. This behavior can be much more easily quantified by using the head-fixed preparation (Xiong et al., 2015). When sound is applied on either side of the animal, it always exhibits forward running in the head-fixed condition. In the current study, the sound source is on the same side of whisker stimulation. This has now been clarified in Materials and methods (subsection “Head-fixed Flight Response”).</p><p>The reviewer has raised a good point about ecological validity. In general, whiskers are essential for rodents to gather information from surroundings. When escape behavior is concerned, loud noise plus specific tactile input may indicate the immediate proximity of a predator, and enhancement of flight at such moments will greatly increase survival chances of prey animals. In addition, tactile information during escape may help animals to quickly identify the most efficient escape route and thus facilitate the escape. We have added more discussion about these possibilities in the revised manuscript (Discussion, second paragraph). Furthermore, we have performed a new set of experiments in freely moving animals. We found that trimming of all whiskers significantly reduced the speed of the animal when it escaped from the sound source by crossing a narrow tunnel (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This suggests that tactile input through whiskers can indeed enhance the efficiency of escape in a more natural condition.</p><p>We previously showed that the peak speed can be a measure of the escape behavior as it is positively correlated with the intensity of noise sound applied (Xiong et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the efficiency of escape is determined not only by the response latency and peak speed, but also by the total travel distance within a certain time window. In the revision, we have analyzed the temporal profile of the behavioral response, including onset latency and time to peak speed, but found no significant differences between control and manipulation conditions in any set of experiments (see Supplementary file 1). However, when the total travel distance (shown as “average speed” in the previous manuscript) or peak speed is concerned, there is a significant difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a final general comment, although the results of the ontogenetic experiments all go in the predicted direction, I am not sure of how robust the results are or of the statistical approaches that have been used to detail the differences.</p><p>The results are of interest – I am just trying to place them in a comprehensible behavioral context and am struggling without further elaboration and discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors discussed that ZIv-POm can project to the striatum to influence locomotion directly. If so, they should have seen that the direct activation of this circuit enhance the locomotion. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1, authors did not see the effect (although the flight speed tended to increase overall). Then, how the POm projection could enhance the flight response? In their previous paper, it was shown that a circuit projecting from ACx to ICx to PAG drives noise-induced flight response directly. The POm projection should be integrated into this ACx downstream pathway to enhance the audition-induced flight response. Projection from POm must enhance the auditory ascending pathway or strengthen ACx-to-ICx circuit. Further experiments or explanations need to clarify this to understand how the flight behavior (output of PAG) is modulated by the 'cross-modal' interaction between audition and somatosensation.</p></disp-quote><p>That activation of the ZIv-POm projection alone does not directly induce locomotion is possibly because the ZIv output is inhibitory and only plays a modulatory role.</p><p>The reviewer has raised a good question about where the facilitatory cross-modal interaction occurs. In the revision, we carried out additional in vivo electrophysiology experiments and found that ZI PV+ neurons respond to both noise sound and whisker deflections. In addition, the response to noise can be enhanced by concurrent whisker deflections (Figure 3J-L). Therefore, the multisensory integration takes place in ZI PV+ neurons at least. Furthermore, we speculate that the ZIv-POm pathway may directly or indirectly connect to midbrain areas downstream of the AC-ICx-PAG pathway, thus the somatosensory information carried by the ZIv-POm pathway can modulate the auditory-induced behavior mediated by the AC-ICx-PAG pathway. We have discussed this possibility in the revised Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p><p>In addition, we have specifically silenced ZI PV+ neuron projections to POm using chemogenetics. This blocked the faciliatory effect of whisker deflections (Figure 4I-K), further strengthening our conclusion that the ZI-POm pathway is involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that the SSp axon terminal is well observed in ZIv and can be targeted easily for optogenetic manipulation. However, the optogenetic manipulation effect actually seems very weak. The authors described in the method that they measured the noise-induced locomotion in 20 trials across 2 sessions and averaged all. In the average trace, the degree of LED light-induced improvement effect looks smaller than the variation in the control conditions (e.g. the peak speeds at LED OFF in Figure 3C and F).

In the revision, we have increased the animal number and the result now shows an increased significance level (see new Figure 2D).</p><p>The reviewer has raised a valid point about the relatively large variations in control running speed between individual animals. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added comparisons of LED-On and LED-Off trials for each individual animal, considering trial-by-trial variations (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-G, Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B). From these plots, it is clear that the majority of animals tested showed a significant difference between control and manipulation conditions.</p><p>LED-On and LED-Off trials were interleaved. The exact sequence, “On-Off-On-Off…” or “Off-On-Off-On…”, was randomized for animals in the same group, or between different test sessions.
