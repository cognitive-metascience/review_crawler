Surprisingly, during neuronal development, a substantial proportion of Lasso is released into the intercellular space by regulated proteolysis, potentially precluding its function in synaptogenesis. We found that released Lasso binds to cell-surface latrophilin-1 on axonal growth cones. Using microfluidic devices to create stable gradients of soluble Lasso, we show that it induces axonal attraction, without increasing neurite outgrowth. Using latrophilin-1 knockout in mice, we demonstrate that latrophilin-1 is required for this effect. After binding latrophilin-1, Lasso causes downstream signaling, which leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium and enhanced exocytosis, processes that are known to mediate growth cone steering. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of axonal pathfinding, whereby latrophilin-1 and Lasso mediate both short-range interaction that supports synaptogenesis, and long-range signaling that induces axonal attraction.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37935.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is a complex mesh of interconnected neurons, with each cell making tens, hundreds, or even thousands of connections. These links can stretch over long distances, and establishing them correctly during development is essential. Developing neurons send out long and thin structures, called axons, to reach distant cells. To guide these growing axons, neurons release molecules that work as traffic signals: some attract axons whilst others repel them, helping the burgeoning structures to twist and turn along their travel paths.</p><p>When an axon reaches its target cell, the two cells join to each other by forming a structure called a synapse. To make the connection, surface proteins on the axon latch onto matching proteins on the target cell, zipping up the synapse. There are many different types of synapses in the brain, but we only know a few of the surface molecules involved in their creation – not enough to explain synaptic variety.</p><p>Two of these surface proteins are latrophilin-1, which is produced by the growing axon, and Lasso, which sits on the membrane of the target cell. The two proteins interact strongly, anchoring the axon to the target cell and allowing the synapse to form. However, a previous recent discovery by Vysokov et al. has revealed that an enzyme can also cut Lasso from the membrane of the target cell. The ‘free’ protein can still interact with latrophilin-1, but as it is shed by the target cell, it can no longer serve as an anchor for the synapse. Could it be that free Lasso acts as a traffic signal instead?</p><p>Here, Vysokov et al. tried to answer this by growing neurons from a part of the brain called the hippocampus in a special labyrinth dish. When free Lasso was gradually introduced in the culture through microscopic channels, it interacted with latrophilin-1 on the surface of the axons. This triggered internal changes that led the axons to add more membrane where they had sensed Lasso, making them grow towards the source of the signal.</p><p>The results demonstrate that a target cell can both carry and release Lasso, using this duplicitous protein to help attract growing axons as well as anchor them. The work by Vysokov et al. contributes to our knowledge of how neurons normally connect, which could shed light on how this process can go wrong. This may be relevant to understand conditions such as schizophrenia and ADHD, where patients’ brains often show incorrect wiring.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon attraction</kwd><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>teneurin</kwd><kwd>Lasso</kwd><kwd>latrophilin</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT083199M</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushkaryov</surname><given-names>Yuri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBF0083091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushkaryov</surname><given-names>Yuri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-44-00051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tonevitsky</surname><given-names>Alexander G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-19-10597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tonevitsky</surname><given-names>Alexander G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001316</institution-id><institution>University of Kent</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushkaryov</surname><given-names>Yuri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lasso and latrophilin-1 interact across the synapse, while shed Lasso binds latrophilin-1 on distant growth cones and attracts them, providing a universal mechanism for short- and long-range axonal guidance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct wiring of the nervous system critically depends on both long-range diffusible cues and short-range contact-mediated factors which can be attractive or repulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Cheng, 2009</xref>). However, the relatively small repertoire of key molecules known to be involved in axon guidance or trans-synaptic adhesion cannot fully explain the complexity and specificity of synaptic connections. Indeed, new interacting partners and signal-modulating ligands are now being found for many well-established guidance factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karaulanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leyva-Díaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Söllner and Wright, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, our novel findings demonstrate that at least one receptor pair can both mediate cell contacts and, unexpectedly, also act as a long-range signaling factor and its receptor.</p><p>This trans-synaptic receptor pair consists of presynaptic latrophilin-1 (LPHN1) and postsynaptic Lasso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>).

An array of data indicates that LPHN1 is localized on axons, axonal growth cones and nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). Activation of LPHN1 by its agonist, mutant latrotoxin (LTX<sup>N4C</sup>), stimulates vesicular exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lajus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lelyanova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tobaben et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Volynski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deák et al., 2009</xref>).

Lasso is the splice variant of TEN2 (TEN2-SS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that specifically binds LPHN1 in cell adhesion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Given also that only Lasso is isolated by affinity chromatography on LPHN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>), we will refer here to TEN2 that is able to bind LPHN1 as Lasso. All TENs possess a large C-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) containing a series of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and other repeat domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Inter-chain disulfide bridges mediate TEN homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vysokov et al., 2016</xref>).

In addition, homophilic interactions of a recombinant soluble TEN2 ECD with the cell-surface TEN2 inhibited (rather than promoted) neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, heterophilic interactions of TENs can promote synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). More specifically, heterophilic interaction between Lasso and LPHN1, its strongest ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>), consistently mediates cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and is thought to facilitate synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, our surprising finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vysokov et al., 2016</xref>) that Lasso/TEN2 is partially released from the cell surface by regulated proteolysis (at site 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right) was inconsistent with a solely cell-surface function of Lasso. On the other hand, we found that the released Lasso fragment retained its ability to bind cell-surface LPHN1 with high affinity and induce intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vysokov et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it was possible that the released, soluble ECD of Lasso/TEN2 could act as a diffusible (attractive or repulsive) factor and mediate some of the TEN2 functions in neurite pathfinding described above. Therefore, we hypothesized that the binding of soluble Lasso to LPHN1 on distant neurites could trigger important changes in their growth.</p><p>Here, we test this hypothesis using cultured hippocampal neurons. First, we show that developing neurons release a substantial proportion of Lasso ECD into the medium, while LPHN1 is concentrated on the leading edge of axonal growth cones. We then use microfluidic chambers to demonstrate that a spatio-temporal gradient of soluble Lasso attracts neuronal axons, but not dendrites, and that this process involves LPHN1 that is present on axonal growth cones. Using model cells expressing functional LPHN1, and mouse neuromuscular preparations, we also show that LPHN1 activation by soluble Lasso causes intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which leads to increased exocytosis. This suggests a plausible cellular mechanism causing axons to turn in the direction of a gradient of soluble Lasso. Moreover, the LPHN1-Lasso pair illustrates a novel principle of chemical guidance whereby cell-surface receptors engage not only in short-range interactions, but also in long-range signaling, which can further contribute to the formation of complex neuronal networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neurons partially cleave and release lasso</title><p>We previously showed in model cell lines and in adult brain that Lasso is cleaved at several sites (sites 1, 2, three in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and is released into the extracellular environment in a regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vysokov et al., 2016</xref>). To test whether Lasso undergoes the same processing and release during neuronal development, we followed Lasso expression at different stages of neuron maturation in hippocampal cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaech and Banker, 2006</xref>). Soon after plating, embryonic (E18) rat hippocampal neurons produced Lasso, which was detectable at 3 days in vitro (DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). A large proportion of Lasso (~90%) was constitutively cleaved at site 1 during neuronal development in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Increasing amounts of cleaved fragment also appeared in the medium at 7 and 14 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, green), indicating a slow cleavage at site 3. Thus, Lasso is fully cleaved at site 1 and partially released by regulated cleavage at site 3 not only in transfected immortalized cells, but also in developing neurons and in the postnatal rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vysokov et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the neuronal structures that could release soluble Lasso ECD. We found that large amounts of Lasso were present on dendrites and dendritic growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while it was practically absent from axons and axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since about 80% of Lasso was not normally released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), these data suggested that the compartments rich in Lasso, that is dendrites and dendritic growth cones, were the main source of the soluble Lasso fragment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LPHN1 is expressed on growth cones of developing neurons</title><p>As early as 3 DIV, the developing neurons also expressed LPHN1, the high-affinity receptor for soluble Lasso ECD, and the amounts of LPHN1 continued to increase through all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in parallel with the increasing amounts of soluble Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This correlation between the soluble Lasso and cell-surface LPHN1 further supported the idea of their likely interaction during neuronal development.</p><p>Interestingly, in developing hippocampal neurons, LPHN1 was found concentrated in axons and especially in axonal growth cones, where it co-localized with synapsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, arrowheads). LPHN1 was also enriched in axonal varicosities, which were identified as <italic>en passant</italic> synapses by immunostaining for PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, asterisks).</p><p>We then studied the expression of LPHN1 in growth cones in more detail by transfecting hippocampal neurons with GFP, which greatly simplified the identification and tracking of axons and axonal growth cones. All GFP-labeled axonal growth cones showed a clear enrichment of endogenous LPHN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G,I</xref>). Conversely, when LPHN1 expression was knocked down by shRNA (delivered together with GFP in the same bicistronic vector), it clearly disappeared from the growth cones of transfected neurons, while the growth cones of non-transfected cells were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, arrow and arrowhead, respectively).</p><p>We also discovered that endogenous LPHN1 expression within axonal growth cones was polarized in relation to the cone’s symmetry axis, such that one side of each growth cone contained on average 1.88 ± 0.22 fold more LPHN1 than the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). To assess whether this LPHN1 enrichment correlated with the direction of axonal growth, we traced the growth trajectories of a number of symmetrical growth cones and compared these with the distribution of LPHN1. This analysis clearly demonstrated that LPHN1 polarization within the growth cones very strongly positively correlated with the direction of their turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Moreover, in non-symmetrical growth cones, which had clearly started turning prior to fixation, LPHN1 expression had a bimodal distribution, being enriched not only near the ‘neck’ of a turning cone, but also close to its leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Such leading-edge enrichment also extended into fine growth cone protrusions. Thus, filopodia and lamellipodia located on the leading edge of a growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, left, arrowheads) showed a much higher amount of LPHN1 than the processes on the trailing edge of the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, right).</p><p>We concluded that LPHN1 expression within growth cones correlated positively with the global directionality of growth and with the fine structures that underpin the growth cone’s extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Soluble Lasso binds to cell-surface LPHN1</title><p>Next, we tested the interaction between soluble Lasso and cell-surface LPHN1.

When co-cultured at high density, these cells formed clusters, held together by LPHN1/Lasso-A intercellular adhesion complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, panel 1). In more sparsely plated co-cultures, the Lasso-A fragment was released into the medium, where it diffused and bound to cells expressing LPHN1, but not to the wild type (WT) neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, panel 2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

These experiments suggest that (i) when Lasso is released into the medium as a result of its regulated cleavage, it retains its affinity for LPHN1 and (ii) on reaching distant LPHN1-expressing cells by diffusion, Lasso causes LPHN1 redistribution on the cell surface.</p><p>We then asked whether the soluble Lasso ECD could similarly bind to LPHN1 in neurons and, more specifically, on axonal growth cones.

Also, to unequivocally distinguish between the soluble and cell-surface Lasso, we used exogenous Lasso-D, which was detected using anti-FLAG antibody.

To investigate this, hippocampal cultures from LPHN1 KO or WT mice (genotyping shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were exposed to a gradient of Lasso-D added to the Axonal Compartment. The total amounts of neurites and cells in both compartments were quantified using the lipophilic membrane tracer DiO (see Materials and methods for details). The results clearly demonstrated that the neurites from LPHN1-expressing (WT) hippocampal neurons crossed into the Lasso D-containing Axonal Compartment 5.5-fold more readily than the neurites from neurons lacking this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left).

To test whether Lasso also causes a redistribution of the CTF required for intracellular signaling, we applied Lasso-D to LPHN1-expressing cells and followed the fate of both NTF and CTF. We observed a dramatic rearrangement of both LPHN1 fragments in the membrane, leading to the formation of large molecular aggregates also containing Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar clustering of both LPHN1 fragments was also induced by LTX<sup>N4C</sup>, a strong LPHN1 agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). On the other hand, an antibody recognizing the V5 epitope at the N-terminus of NTF only caused NTF clustering, but did not affect the distribution of CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, soluble Lasso ECD, which causes the association of the LPHN1 fragments, might be a functional agonist of LPHN1, similar to LTX<sup>N4C</sup>.

We predicted, therefore, that the rearrangement of the NTF and CTF induced by soluble Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) should prepare the signaling machinery for stimulation by the toxin. To test this idea, we first treated the LPHN1-expressing cells with Lasso-D and then with LTX<sup>N4C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When Lasso-D was applied in the presence of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it induced relatively short-lived intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right, prior to the blue arrowhead). However, when LTX<sup>N4C</sup> was then added, it triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling after a shorter delay (~14 min), instead of the usual ~23 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This additivity of effects is consistent with soluble Lasso inducing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via the same molecular mechanism as LTX<sup>N4C</sup>.</p><p>Another well-known effect of LTX<sup>N4C</sup> is the burst-like release of neurotransmitters, linked to the elevated levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lelyanova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Volynski et al., 2003</xref>). As Lasso-D likewise increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, it might also trigger such transmitter exocytosis. To test this hypothesis, we applied a previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>), soluble, short C-terminal Lasso construct (Lasso-G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to mouse neuromuscular preparations and recorded the spontaneous miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs), which correspond to individual exocytotic events. We found that incubation with Lasso-G significantly increased MEPPs frequency from 1.61 ± 0.27 Hz in control to 3.83 ± 0.79 Hz in the presence of Lasso-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). However, this was much less than the effect of LTX<sup>N4C</sup>, which triggered massive secretion of neurotransmitter reaching 29.5 ± 4.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). To ascertain that both these effects were mediated by LPHN1, we used neuromuscular preparations from LPHN1 KO mice. Interestingly, unstimulated LPHN1 KO motor neurons showed an increased MEPPs frequency compared to synapses from WT animals (3.33 ± 0.79 Hz in KO synapses). However, neither Lasso-G, nor LTX<sup>N4C</sup> had any effect on exocytosis in preparations lacking LPHN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>; 3.4 ± 0.68 Hz with Lasso-G and 3.8 ± 1.4 Hz with LTX<sup>N4C</sup>). In all the recordings, the mean <italic>amplitudes</italic> of MEPPs under any condition did not differ significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which indicated a purely presynaptic effect of the two LPHN1 agonists and of LPHN1 ablation. These results show that the soluble Lasso fragment can increase exocytosis at nerve terminals, and confirm the importance of LPHN1 in the observed effects of LTX and the ECD of Lasso.</p><p>From the results reported here, we hypothesize that the soluble Lasso fragment, released by developing neurons, interacts with LPHN1 on axonal growth cones and nerve terminals. It then induces clustering of LPHN1 fragments and activation of downstream signaling, causing an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and subsequent exocytosis. The latter two processes are known to be key regulators of axonal attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tojima et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the ability of soluble Lasso to activate these processes on axonal growth cones could underpin the mechanisms by which it attracts axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study provides evidence that Lasso (a splice variant of TEN2 lacking a 7-residue insert in the β-propeller domain, TEN2-SS) functions specifically as an attractant for axons expressing LPHN1, and proposes a molecular mechanism for this effect. By using microfluidic devices to create long-term gradients of soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we demonstrate that a gradient of soluble ECD of Lasso can act as an attractant for axons from hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–E</xref>). Importantly, growing hippocampal neurons in a medium containing a uniform concentration of Lasso had no effect on the length of their axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This shows that Lasso plays an instructive role in the directionality, rather than the amount, of axonal growth. This is consistent with the effect of other axon attractants acting via similar mechanisms. For example, short-term exposure of axonal growth cones to gradients of BDNF stimulates IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (IICR) that causes axonal attraction without an overall effect on neurite extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>One interesting observation from this project was the fasciculation of neurites in response to soluble Lasso/TEN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,F</xref>). Fasciculation of axons is one of the major mechanisms of axonal navigation, for example in limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastiani et al., 1986</xref>). While axonal fasciculation has not been previously linked to a soluble ECD of TEN, neurite bundling was actually observed in hippocampal cultures in response to TEN1 C-terminal peptide (TCAP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Chawaf et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of TEN1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> resulted in de-fasciculation of the axons in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drabikowski et al., 2005</xref>). Potential mechanisms of axonal bundling include actin reorganization induced by an LPHN1-mediated rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, other unknown interactions with cell adhesion molecules, or it could also be due to the divalent Lasso/TEN2 fragment crosslinking adjacent axons, thus promoting their parallel elongation.</p><p>The soluble Lasso/TEN2 fragment could potentially have two membrane-anchored receptors: (i) TEN2 itself, as a homophilic ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagutti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rubin et al., 2002</xref>), or (ii) LPHN1, as a heterophilic ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). However, we have not observed TEN2 expression in growth cones of hippocampal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but found it to be abundant on dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also did not detect any appreciable binding of the released Lasso ECD to membrane-anchored Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, homophilic interaction of Lasso/TEN2 actually has been reported to inhibit neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckmann et al., 2013</xref>), while we saw an opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, the potential Lasso/TEN2 homophilic interaction could not explain the observed axonal attraction. On the other hand, we found strong expression of LPHN1 on the axonal growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silva et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the released soluble ECD of Lasso strongly bound to LPHN1 that was expressed on neuroblastoma cells or neuronal growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Furthermore, we found that deletion of LPHN1 precluded axonal attraction by Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), while it had no effect on neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in the Somal Compartment. These data strongly implicate LPHN1 in mediating Lasso-induced axon attraction.</p><p>Our studies also reveal the likely mechanism that underlies the Lasso/LPHN1-induced axonal attraction. LPHN1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that physically and functionally links to Gα<sub>q/11</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rahman et al., 1999</xref>). Activation of LPHN1 by its non-pore-forming agonist, LTX<sup>N4C</sup>, leads to aggregation of the NTF and CTF of LPHN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volynski et al., 2004</xref>). This results in assembly of a functional GPCR, with subsequent activation of the downstream signaling cascade, which includes Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, phospholipase C, production of IP<sub>3</sub> and IP<sub>3</sub>-receptor-mediated release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capogna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lajus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volynski et al., 2004</xref>), thus inducing IICR.</p><p>IICR is also regulated and enhanced by increased cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tojima et al., 2011</xref>), and we previously demonstrated that activation of LPHN1 expressed in COS7 cells induces an increase in cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lelianova et al., 1997</xref>). In line with this, the recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al. (2018)</xref> confirmed the ability of LPHN1 to regulate cAMP signaling. In that work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>), the cAMP signaling interference system was based on HEK293 cells expressing exogenous β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor (β2AR). Activation of β2AR by its agonist led to an increase in cAMP production, while a large excess of co-expressed LPHN1 interfered with β2AR signaling. This clearly suggests that LPHN1 uses the same cAMP signaling machinery as β2AR, and that when LPHN1 is not stimulated, it can titrate components of this machinery, decreasing their availability to β2AR.</p><p>In agreement with the role of Lasso as a functional LPHN1 agonist, the binding of the released Lasso fragment to LPHN1 similarly causes the re-association of LPHN1 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). A rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, in turn, can increase the rate of exocytosis, and we indeed observed enhanced acetylcholine release in mouse neuromuscular junctions in response to soluble Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). This response to Lasso was clearly mediated by LPHN1, as it was not detected in neuromuscular preparations from LPHN1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). On the other hand, the effect of soluble Lasso on vesicular exocytosis was much weaker – and probably more physiological – than the massive effect of LTX<sup>N4C</sup>.</p><p>In addition to Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, Lasso binding to LPHN1 can induce cAMP signaling. Indirect evidence for this is provided by the cAMP signaling interference experiments mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>). When LPHN1 co-expressed with β2AR was stimulated for 24 hr with Lasso/TEN2 (expressed on the same or opposite cells), this strongly decreased cAMP levels induced by β2AR activation. The most likely reason could be that, following an initial Lasso-induced LPHN1 activation, which normally subsides within 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the continued LPHN1 stimulation led to massive heterologous receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>) and inhibition of β2AR-mediated effect.</p><p>Intriguingly, the effects of soluble Lasso resemble the well-known mechanism that underpins axonal attraction and consists of IP<sub>3</sub> receptor-mediated local release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, coupled with an increase in cAMP levels, that leads to increased exocytosis at the advancing edge of a growth cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tojima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tojima and Kamiguchi, 2015</xref>). Thus, when a gradient of soluble Lasso ECD approaches one side of an axonal growth cone, it may cause local activation of LPHN1 and its downstream signaling, ultimately leading to IICR. Local IICR in growth cones can induce an increase in vesicular exocytosis (as observed in our experiments with Lasso-G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and the remodeling of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tojima et al., 2011</xref>). The resulting augmented membrane delivery and actin-driven extension of filopodia at the edge facing a Lasso gradient would support the growth cone’s advance in this direction. Thus, based on all our data, we propose this chain of events (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) as a likely mechanism for axonal attraction by soluble Lasso observed in this study.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37935.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A proposed scheme of the mechanism of axonal attraction by released Lasso ECD.</title><p>When Lasso binds the NTF of LPHN1, it causes its re-association with the CTF. This activates Gα<sub>q/11</sub> and triggers the PLC signaling cascade. Downstream of this cascade, the local IP<sub>3</sub>-induced calcium release (IICR) from intracellular stores stimulates exocytosis and may also stimulate reorganization of actin through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), thus mediating axonal attraction. The dashed line represents LPHN1-mediated activation of neuronal adhesion molecules via an unknown mechanism that may lead to axonal fasciculation observed in the presence of soluble Lasso (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, F</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37935-fig8-v1"/></fig><p>While TEN2 has been implicated in axon guidance in the visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2013</xref>), here we report that it can also trigger axonal steering in developing hippocampal neurons, which is consistent with the strong expression of both Lasso/TEN2 and LPHN1 in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davletov et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otaki and Firestein, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, both proteins are expressed throughout the CNS, suggesting that this mechanism of soluble Lasso/LPHN1-mediated axonal attraction may apply widely across the brain, especially in such areas as the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus and spinal cord.</p><p>Interestingly, the splice variant of TEN2 (TEN2+SS), which contains the 7-amino acid insert in the β-propeller domain and cannot mediate cell adhesion via LPHN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>), might attract dendrites instead of axons, in contrast to Lasso (TEN2-SS). Thus, in an artificial synapse formation experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>), HEK293 cells expressing TEN2+SS were seen covered by neurites from co-cultured hippocampal neurons that contained GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. However, these processes did not show a proportionate accumulation of PSD-95 and thus probably represented <italic>en passant</italic> dendrites that were attracted to TEN2+SS cells, but unable to form mature inhibitory synapses with them. This could be a mechanism by which TEN2+SS could provide a substrate for the growth of dendrites searching for their ultimate target/s. Although the relative abundance of Lasso and TEN2+SS in the brain is unknown, these data suggest that various TEN isoforms could participate in distinct interactions, possibly with opposite results.</p><p>High expression of LPHN1 and Lasso/TEN2 throughout the CNS, combined with their fundamental role in axon guidance, is consistent with lethal phenotypes observed in simpler organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langenhan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). In knockout mice, however, the phenotype is less severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tobaben et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Young et al., 2013</xref>) (Ushkaryov, to be published elsewhere) suggesting that LPHN1 deletion is not completely penetrant, likely due to a compensatory effect of multiple LPHN and TEN homologs expressed in the mammalian brain. Indeed, LPHN1 can also weakly interact with TEN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>), and LPHN3 can interact with TEN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O'Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, LPHN and TEN isoform expression patterns overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oohashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sugita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). This predisposition to compensation further raises the possibility that the mechanism of axonal guidance involving the interaction of soluble TEN2 with LPHN1, described in this study, may occur between different members of the LPHN and TEN families. These observations provide evidence of further diversity of interactions and local specificity of developmental pathways for more accurate and plastic patterning of neural networks within the mammalian CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Briefly (details to be published elsewhere), the LPHN1 gene was isolated from a BAC clone containing a 36-kbp fragment of mouse genomic DNA. This was used to design a transfer vector for homologous recombination, containing a 13-kbp gene fragment of the LPHN1 gene, in which the intron between exons 1 and 2 was replaced with a neomycin gene/promoter cassette flanked by two loxP sequences. This insert disrupted the open reading frame in the mRNA transcribed from the resulting mutated LPHN1 gene. The transfer vector, carrying also a negative selection marker (diphtheria toxin A-chain), was used to generate stably transfected 129Sv/J ES cell lines and chimeric mice, using standard transgenic techniques. Mice transmitting the inactivated LPHN1 gene through the germline were selected, inbred, back-crossed onto C57BL/6J background, and maintained at Charles River UK. LPHN1 gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting, PCR amplification using multiple primer pairs and Western blotting. The genotype of all animals used for breeding and tissue extraction was determined by PCR. All procedures (breeding and Schedule 1) were approved by the University of Kent Animal Welfare Committee and performed in accordance with Home Office regulations and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes.</p><p>E18 hippocampi were obtained from rats (BrainBits UK, Rhp).

In control, only the fluorescent secondary antibody was added for the last 20 min. The cells were then fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA in PBS, blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS, and subsequent procedures were designed to reveal the distribution of the three components of each assay (NTF, CTF, and ligand). First, in all experiments, the V5 epitope on LPHN1 NTF was detected with a rabbit anti-V5 antibody (1 hr in blocking solution), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and fixation. Subsequent staining depended on the ligand used: (1) Lasso-D was stained using a mouse anti-FLAG mAb and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. For LPHN1 CTF detection, the cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with a chicken anti-myc antibody, fixed, blocked, and stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-chicken antibody. (2) With LTX<sup>N4C</sup>-induced patching, the cells were permeabilized, incubated with a mouse anti-myc mAb, fixed, blocked, and stained with an Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Hugo J Bellen (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ushkaryov et al. show that latrophilin-1 and Lasso/teneurin-2 interact with one another at axonal growth cones and that Lasso/teneurin-2 is capable of stimulating axonal outgrowth. Binding of Lasso/teneurin-2 to latrophilin-1 induces rearrangement of latrophilin-1 fragments that triggers a signaling cascade, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and subsequent exocytosis. These downstream effects likely mediate the chemoattractant effect of Lasso/teneurin-2 on axons. Ushkaryov et al. address an intriguing question that is explored using sophisticated assays to investigate characteristics of axonal growth and guidance. The authors use known signaling mechanisms of latrophilin-1 to guide their experimental design and nicely characterize the role of the novel interacting partner, Lasso/teneurin-2 within this signaling cascade. Overall, the paper is strong and illustrates a mechanism for Lasso/tenuerin-2 mediated axonal outgrowth but additional studies would further strengthen the work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2D, panel 2, Results (subsection “Soluble Lasso binds to cell-surface LPHN1”, first paragraph) – Lasso-Lasso interactions are only illustrated for Lasso-A with Lasso-D. Are there Lasso-Lasso interactions between Lasso-A and Lasso-A as well as between Lasso-D and Lasso-D?</p><p>2) Figure 2C, Results (subsection “Soluble Lasso binds to cell-surface LPHN1”, first paragraph) – The claim that binding of Lasso to latrophilin-1 alters latrophilin-1 is not evident in the presented images. Better representative images that demonstrate this reported difference are required or quantification of the difference in concentration of patches should be provided. This difference in latrophilin-1 staining, following Lasso binding is more apparent in Figure 6B-C.</p><p>3) Figure 4E – It is not clear why the authors combined WT and heterozygous mice to report data. Clarify why these two genetically different groups were presented together and report data for homozygous WT mice and heterozygous mice, separately.</p><p>4) Figure 7D – Authors neglect to show heterozygous and WT mice separately, so it is unclear if a phenotype is present in the heterozygous mice. Report homozygous WT as additional control for data interpretation.</p><p>5) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – There is a difference in cell morphology in experiments with NB2a cells. Is this mutation-dependent, due to a difference in cell lines, or density of cells plated? Clarify the cause of this difference in cell morphology. When comparing staining between groups, select representative images with similar cell morphology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37935.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2D, panel 2, Results (subsection “Soluble Lasso binds to cell-surface LPHN1”, first paragraph) – Lasso-Lasso interactions are only illustrated for Lasso-A with Lasso-D.

Structurally, Lasso-D is indistinguishable from Lasso-A within the domains involved in LPHN1 binding, so we used Lasso-D as a model of Lasso-A. As shown in Figure 2, we did not see any interaction of Lasso-D with cell-surface Lasso-A in our conditions.</p><p>We also conducted some experiments with the medium containing released Lasso-A fragment and cells expressing Lasso-FS. Lasso-FS has exactly the same extracellular structure as Lasso-A, but lacks the C-terminal tag. Again, we did not see any discernible interaction of Lasso-A with cell-surface Lasso. This result is now included in a new Figure 2D, panel 3.</p><p>These data are indirectly supported by Boucard et al., 2014 and Li et al., 2018, who do not see homophilic cell adhesion between Ten-2 or Lasso-A expressing cells.</p><p>In contrast, in the same paper, Boucard et al. did observe Lasso-B (ECD of Lasso-FS) binding to Lasso-A (both are gifts from our lab). However, this binding was only seen after an overnight incubation of cells with soluble Lasso, and a long incubation of dimeric proteins with dimeric targets would lead to cell surface rearrangements, creating multi-molecular complexes, which could include not only cell-surface Lasso, but also other proteins. In addition, the washes were conducted after cross-linking, i.e. under non-equilibrium conditions, so any weak and short-lived interactions were artificially preserved, likely leading to overestimation of affinity. Indeed, electron microscopy of TEN2 ECD (Lasso-B) or ECRdelta1 does not demonstrate any appreciable tetramer formation (Li et al., 2018). Moreover, size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200, 10/300 GL (Li et al., 2018) indicates that the major form of Lasso-A is a dimer (~550 kDa) rather than a tetramer (&gt;1000 kDa).</p><p>Thus, if there is any Lasso-Lasso interaction, it is weak and probably unable to persist under the usual conditions of binding protocols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2C, Results (subsection “Soluble Lasso binds to cell-surface LPHN1”, first paragraph) – The claim that binding of Lasso to latrophilin-1 alters latrophilin-1 is not evident in the presented images. Better representative images that demonstrate this reported difference are required or quantification of the difference in concentration of patches should be provided. This difference in latrophilin-1 staining, following Lasso binding is more apparent in Figure 6B-C.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of the soluble fragment of Lasso on redistribution of LPH1 on the membrane was quantified in Figure 6F, where the images were also taken at higher magnification. When the image in Figure 2C, panel 2 is blown up, it also shows a characteristic patchy LPHN1 distribution caused by Lasso-D.</p><p>The impression that Lasso does not always redistribute LPHN1 on the cell surface is possibly based on Figure 2E, panel 2. The exposure, brightness and contrast of the image (in line with the methods described) were such as to show clearly the lack of LPHN1 on the Lasso-expressing cell (arrowhead) and the binding of Lasso to the LPHN1 expressing cell (arrow), but not to control cells. When the contrast is decreased (new Figure 2E, panel 2), it is now obvious to see that LPHN1 is unevenly distributed on the cell surface, in line with our claim and the images in Figure 6.</p><p>Generally speaking, Lasso-induced patching of LPHN1 is particularly apparent in high magnification images, but we thought that including zoom-ins would unnecessarily complicate Figure 2, which only highlights the fact of interaction between Lasso and LPHN1. In addition, we now also provide an additional panel (Figure 2C, panel 3), which even at a low magnification shows LPHN1 patching on the cell surface by soluble Lasso-A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4E – It is not clear why the authors combined WT and heterozygous mice to report data. Clarify why these two genetically different groups were presented together and report data for homozygous WT mice and heterozygous mice, separately.</p></disp-quote><p>Our electrophysiological and neuronal cell culture experiments demonstrate that heterozygous and WT mice show equal responses to LPHN1 agonists (e.g. αlatrotoxin and the anti-LPHN1 scFv A1) and to depolarizing stimuli (KCl). In all experiments described here, heterozygous mice also did not display a phenotype statistically different from that of WT mice. Therefore, for statistical purposes and in this experiment only, we initially counted WT and HET mice together. However, since then we carried out experiments with WT mice, and have now included these data in the new Figures 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. In this experiment, we do not have a sufficient number of data for HET neurons and only show KO and WT data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 7D – Authors neglect to show heterozygous and WT mice separately, so it is unclear if a phenotype is present in the heterozygous mice. Report homozygous WT as additional control for data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question. However, it requires a more detailed analysis and should be addressed in a separate paper. Here, we didn’t want to complicate the message and only showed a difference between LPHN1-lacking and LPHN1-expressing neurons. We compared KO to HET samples because, given the similarity of WT and HET phenotypes, if the difference between KO and HET neurons is statistically significant, that would provide unequivocal evidence for the critical role of LPHN1. In other words, if statistical significance can be achieved when comparing neurons lacking LPHN1 (KO) with neurons expressing some LPHN1 (HET), then neurons expressing the maximal amount of LPHN1 (WT) would show a similar or better difference. However, we agree that not showing the WT data may be confusing. Therefore, we now include WT and KO data in the new Figure 7 (as well as in Figures 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – There is a difference in cell morphology in experiments with NB2a cells. Is this mutation-dependent, due to a difference in cell lines, or density of cells plated? Clarify the cause of this difference in cell morphology. When comparing staining between groups, select representative images with similar cell morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>Neuroblastoma NB2a cultures show two types of cell morphology: spindle-like proliferating cells and neuron-like rounded cells. The former with time differentiate into the latter. However, there is no difference in LPHN1 expression between these cell types. The cells shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 were selected to demonstrate both transfected and WT cells with no regard to cell morphology. We have now included a statement in the paper to reflect this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
