This chemical is transported from cell to cell, and its flow though the plant is redirected continuously as the plant is developing. Auxin is pumped out of cells by proteins in the cell membrane called ‘auxin efflux carriers’. These proteins are usually found on one side of each cell and this is what gives the direction to auxin transport.</p><p>Zourelidou, Absmanner et al. now report that being positioned on the correct side of a plant cell is not enough to enable an efflux carrier to do its job—it must also be turned on by kinases before it can pump auxin out of cells. Kinases are enzymes that add phosphate groups to specific sites on other proteins, and plants without certain kinases are unable to transport auxin.</p><p>When Zourelidou, Absmanner et al. produced the efflux carrier and a plant kinase—which turns the efflux carrier on—in immature egg cells from frogs, auxin was rapidly pumped out of the cells. However, cells that contained the efflux carrier but not the kinase could not transport the hormone. Importantly egg cells from frogs do not normally transport auxin, but these cells are commonly used in experiments because they are large, which makes them easier to work with in the lab.</p><p>One of at least two kinases must tag a number of sites on the efflux carrier to ensure that it is switched on. It was already known that some of these sites are involved in making sure that the efflux carrier is located on the correct side of the cell. Zourelidou, Absmanner et al. also found that auxin itself encourages the addition of phosphate groups onto the efflux carrier.</p><p>Though it was thought that knowing where the auxin transporters are was enough to explain the direction of auxin transport in plants, it is now clear that activation by the kinases needs to be taken into account too. And since these kinases may activate the transporters to different extents, identifying how these proteins are controlled, for example by auxin itself, will be the next challenge in the field.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02860.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02860.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>AGC kinase</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>auxin transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHW751/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwechheimer</surname><given-names>Claus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft    (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammes</surname><given-names>Ulrich Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two protein kinases are required to activate auxin efflux transporters from plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The synthesis and proper distribution of the hormone auxin within the growing plant body is essential for basically all differentiation processes throughout plant development as well as for the plant's tropic responses. As such, proper plant development and morphology strictly require the directed cell-to-cell transport of auxin, which is achieved by a system of auxin influx and efflux transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Teale et al., 2006</xref>). AUXIN RESISTANT1 (AUX1)/LIKE-AUX1 (LAX) proteins are auxin influx transporters and PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins, which have been proposed to act in concert with ABC transporters, are the proposed auxin efflux transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galweiler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friml et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bainbridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peret et al., 2012</xref>). The directed transport of auxin throughout the plant is critically determined by the—in many cells–asymmetric plasma membrane distribution of PINs and plant developmental processes have been successfully modeled based on the knowledge of PIN distribution and PIN protein behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wisniewska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blakeslee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grieneisen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We have previously identified and studied Arabidopsis protein kinases of the AGCVIII family designated D6 PROTEIN KINASE (D6PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>). The D6PK family is comprised of four functionally redundant members, namely D6PK, D6PK-LIKE1 (D6PKL1), D6PKL2 and D6PKL3. Although D6PKs are devoid of any sequence features indicative for an association of these protein kinases with the plasma membrane, D6PKs colocalize with PIN proteins at the basal (rootward) plasma membrane in cells of the root cortex and stele, the hypocotyl and main inflorescence stem as well as the shoot apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). D6PKs phosphorylate PIN proteins in vitro and PIN phosphorylation is reduced in <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants in vivo without affecting PIN distribution or strongly affecting PIN abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). Just as the PINs, D6PK constitutively cycles intracellularly between endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane but both, PINs and D6PK, traffic via distinct intracellular routes and seemingly encounter each other only at the basal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). Since PIN phosphorylation, as assessed by evaluating overall PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation levels, rapidly reacts to the presence and absence of D6PK at the plasma membrane, we postulated that D6PKs directly activate auxin transport by PIN phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). This hypothesis has, however, never been tested.</p><p>Another subfamily of AGCVIII kinases comprises the proteins PINOID (PID), WAG1, and WAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Santner and Watson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galvan-Ampudia and Offringa, 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation of PINs by PID/WAGs has previously been proposed to control PIN polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). PID/WAGs phosphorylate PINs at three highly conserved phosphosites, designated S1–S3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). Modulating PIN phosphorylation either by PID or WAG overexpression or by introducing phosphorylation-mimicking mutants in PIN1 seemingly results in a basal-to-apical shift in PIN polar distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2010</xref>). The proposed loss of PIN phosphorylation in the <italic>pid</italic> mutant has been used to explain the phenotypic similarity between <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> mutants: <italic>pin1</italic> mutants, on the one side, have a pin-formed inflorescence because they are devoid of the central auxin efflux protein required for shoot meristem differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galweiler et al., 1998</xref>); <italic>pid</italic> mutants, on the other side, are deficient in PIN1 phosphorylation, which seemingly prevents the essential basal-to-apical polarity switch required to redirect auxin fluxes during differentiation at the shoot meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friml et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The PID/WAG-mediated repolarization of PIN proteins is also important for phototropic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2011</xref>). During phototropic bending of the hypocotyl, the polarity of the relevant PIN3 protein changes upon light exposure and this polarity switch is required for auxin redistribution in the hypocotyl and for efficient phototropism. This PIN3 polarity change requires the activity of PID/WAG protein kinases and it has been proposed that PID/WAG-dependent PIN3 phosphorylations directly control this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2011</xref>). We showed previously that D6PKs also play a critical role in this process: <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants are strongly impaired in phototropic hypocotyl bending and the inability of <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants to efficiently transport auxin from the cotyledons to the hypocotyl may be responsible for this tropism defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, the light-induced and PID/WAG-dependent PIN3 polarity changes required for hypocotyl bending can still take place in the absence of <italic>D6PKs</italic> suggesting that the function of PID/WAGs in auxin transport and phototropism can be uncoupled from that of the D6PKs and that both kinases may control PINs independently and differentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). While the differential biological function of D6PK and PID/WAGs in the context of phototropism may be explained by the two kinases being active in different tissues or during different stages of the phototropism response, there is also evidence that the two kinases have differential biochemical activities. While the overexpression of PID and WAG kinases results in a basal-to-apical PIN shift, the overexpression of D6PKs does not affect PIN distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>). Inversely, the loss of <italic>PID</italic> function results in strong differentiation defects of the primary inflorescence, which are not apparent in the <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants. Thus, there is evidence for a differential biochemical activity of D6PKs and PID/WAGs but the molecular basis of this differential activity remains to be determined.</p><p>The auxin efflux activity of PINs has previously been demonstrated by passive loading of yeast, plant, or mammalian cells with radiolabeled auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petrasek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wisniewska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mravec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang and Murphy, 2009</xref>). In these experiments, the auxin efflux activity of PINs was deduced from the reduced amount of radiolabeled auxin that accumulated in cells (over-)expressing certain PIN proteins in comparison to control samples. Because these experiments used passive loading of auxin, it is unclear if the differences in intracellular auxin accumulation observed in these experiments are truly a result of differences in auxin efflux or a consequence of differences in auxin uptake. In other studies, auxin efflux was shown based on differences in auxin retention after passive loading and subsequent transfer to auxin-free medium, thereby reversing the electrochemical gradient. In these studies, background transport activities could not be ruled out and differences became apparent only at endpoint steady-state levels. To date, there has been no report of a heterologous expression system that allows measuring auxin export directly in the linear phase.</p><p>Here, we report the results from direct auxin efflux experiments with radiolabeled auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) injected into <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. We find that PINs are unable to promote auxin efflux in this system unless PINs become activated by specific protein kinases of the Arabidopsis AGCVIII family. We map the phosphosites of these kinases in the PINs and further show that phosphorylation of conserved phosphosites is required for the efficient activation of PIN1 and PIN3. Our study strongly suggests that the activation of PIN-mediated auxin efflux by protein kinases is a crucial component of auxin transport control that must be taken into account to understand auxin distribution within the plant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>D6PK is required for basipetal auxin transport in inflorescence stems</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, the four AGCVIII kinases of the D6PK subfamily D6PK, D6PK-LIKE1 (D6PKL1), D6PKL2 and D6PKL3 redundantly control auxin transport-dependent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we established a heterologous test system for measuring auxin efflux using Xenopus <italic>laevis</italic> oocytes. In this assay, in vitro transcribed cRNAs for the proteins under investigation were injected into the oocytes 4 days prior to the experiment to allow for protein synthesis. At the beginning of the experiment, radiolabeled IAA was injected and the amount of residual radiolabel was measured in the oocytes after incubation for up to 30 min. PIN as well as D6PK protein accumulated at the plasma membrane also in oocytes as shown by immunoblots for PINs and confocal microscopy for D6PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). An inherent feature of this assay system was the gradual loss of the injected radiolabeled IAA from the oocytes over time–in the absence of exogenous proteins–which we attributed to the leakiness of the plasma membrane for IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). Interestingly, when we tested PIN1 or PIN3 alone, we did not observe any measurable auxin efflux that differed from the background, suggesting that the PINs are inactive auxin transporters in the oocyte system. However, when we co-expressed D6PK with the PINs we observed a significant and kinase activity-dependent activation of auxin efflux. This activation correlated with the appearance of high molecular weight bands for PIN1 and PIN3 that appeared in anti-PIN immunoblots only in the presence of the active D6PK kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In line with an activation of PINs by D6PK through direct PIN phosphorylation, a kinase-dead variant of D6PK could not activate auxin efflux in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). In summary, these experiments showed that D6PK is an activator of PIN-mediated auxin efflux in the oocyte expression system.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02860.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>D6PK activates PIN-mediated auxin efflux in Xenopus oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal microscopy images of oocytes expressing YFP:D6PK (D6PK) and YFP:D6PKin (D6PKin) reveals localization of the proteins at the plasma membrane.

In the experiments with the synthetic peptides, we could confirm the identity and phosphorylation of the novel S4 and S5 phosphosites using mutant peptides as negative controls where the respective S had been replaced by an alanine (A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since S5 from PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 corresponded to D215 in PIN1 and since D215 was embedded in an otherwise highly conserved part of the protein, we were also interested in testing whether a serine (S) in a PIN1 D215S variant could be phosphorylated by D6PK. Indeed, while a synthetic peptide comprising PIN1 D215 could not be phosphorylated by D6PK in vitro, the D215S peptide variant was efficiently phosphorylated indicating that, although the respective S5 phosphosite was not conserved, the sequence conservation in this region was sufficient for phosphorylation by D6PK. This was suggestive for an overall structural conservation of this PIN1 protein domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, PIN2-specific peptides corresponding to the S4 or S5 phosphosites could not be phosphorylated by D6PK despite the fact that their sequences also contained serine residues. Phosphorylation of the corresponding peptides also failed when an asparagine (N) at the respective position was replaced by a serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, S4 and S5 are novel PIN protein phosphosites that are differentially conserved in the five plasma membrane-resident PIN proteins with a role in promoting auxin efflux.</p><p>When we examined the contribution of the individual phosphosites to PIN1 phosphorylation in the context of the PIN1 cytoplasmic loop (CL) fragment, we found that PIN1 CL phosphorylation by D6PK was already strongly reduced (40% of wild type levels) in a mutant variant where only PIN1 S4 was replaced by an alanine (S4A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In turn, mutations of the phosphosites PIN1 S1, PIN1 S2 or PIN1 S3 alone impaired phosphorylation by D6PK to a lesser extent (ca. 80%) and only mutation of all three sites in PIN1 S1A S2A S3A led to a clear reduction of PIN1 CL phosphorylation (58%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Finally, the mutation of all four PIN1 phosphosites under investigation in PIN1 S1A S2A S3A S4A abolished phosphorylation by D6PK almost completely (2.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on these analyses, we concluded that S4 is a major phosphosite for D6PK in PIN1.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02860.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>In vitro phosphorylation of PIN1 and PIN3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)–(<bold>D</bold>) Representative experiments with recombinant purified GST:D6PK (D6PK) or GST:PID (PID) and wild type or mutant PIN1 (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) or PIN3 (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) CL fragments in the presence of radiolabeled [©-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP.

Thus, D6PK and PID have an overlapping but also differential preference for specific phosphosites in PIN1. When we examined the effects of S4 and S5 site mutations in the context of PIN3, we detected a similar phosphosite preference. Whereas a PIN3 CL S4A S5A variant was still efficiently phosphorylated by PID its phosphorylation by D6PK was severely impaired (28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

We reasoned that PIN1 D215S might show a differential behavior in the auxin efflux experiments in the absence and presence of D6PK because the D215S mutant variant could show a stronger dependency on kinase activation. However, we found that the auxin efflux (activation) of the wild type PIN1 protein was indistinguishable from the behavior of the PIN1 D215S mutant in these oocyte experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We therefore rejected this hypothesis.</p><p>To examine the biological significance of S4 and S5 for PIN function, we introduced wild type and mutant transgenes for the expression of <italic>PIN1</italic> and <italic>PIN3</italic> under the control of their respective promoters into <italic>pin1</italic> and <italic>pin3 pin4 pin7</italic> (<italic>pin347</italic>) mutants, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In support of an important but not exclusive role of S4 phosphorylation for PIN1 function, we detected only a partial rescue of the auxin transport defect in inflorescence stems of <italic>pin1</italic> mutants transformed with PIN1 S4A compared to a full rescue with the wild type PIN1. While the mutant and the wild type transgene were able to complement the PID-dependent inflorescence differentiation defect of the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), D6PK-dependent basipetal auxin transport in the stem was compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Since the mutation of the S4 phosphosite may potentially interfere with the polar distribution or the intracellular transport of the constantly trafficking PIN1 protein, we analyzed the polar distribution of PIN1 S4A and its sensitivity to the trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since PIN1 S4A showed an identical behavior to wild type PIN1 in these experiments, we concluded that changes in PIN1 polarity, PIN1 trafficking or PIN1 abundance at the plasma membrane may not be causal for the observed differences in basipetal auxin transport. We also evaluated the effects of PIN3 phosphosite mutations using the ability of <italic>PIN3</italic> transgenes to complement the strong phototropism defect of the <italic>pin3 pin4 pin7</italic> (<italic>pin347</italic>) triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). When we measured the ability of wild type PIN3 and mutant PIN3 S4A S5A to complement the <italic>pin347</italic> mutant when expressed from a <italic>PIN3</italic> promoter fragment, we found that the phototropism defect of the <italic>pin347</italic> mutant was only partially complemented by the PIN3 S4A S5A transgene while it was fully complemented by wild type PIN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This finding was in line with the hypothesis that D6PK-dependent PIN3 S4 and S5 phosphorylations are required for efficient basipetal auxin transport in the hypocotyls of dark-grown seedlings, which is a prerequisite for efficient hypocotyl bending. Consistent with the predominant role of the PID phosphosite phosphorylation at S1–S3, we found that the mutation of the PIN3 S1–S3 phosphosites as well as mutation of all five PIN3 phosphosites, S1–S5, fully impaired the ability of the PIN3 transgene to complement the <italic>pin347</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This finding can be explained by the essential role of PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes in the hypocotyl that take place after light exposure and that are required for phototropic hypocotyl bending. As we had previously shown, the PID-dependent PIN3 polarity change after phototropic stimulation is a distinct process that is independent from the regulation of basipetal auxin transport in the dark-grown seedling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>).

To this end, we employed selected reaction monitoring (SRM), a mass spectrometry technique that allows detection and quantification of specific peptides and their phosphorylated variants in total protein preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Picotti and Aebersold, 2012</xref>).

This decrease in S4 phosphorylation could not be explained by changes in the overall abundance of PIN proteins as shown by quantitative SRM analyses of the unphosphorylated PIN1 and PIN3 S4 peptides and analyses of internal control peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>).

Inversely, the PIN1 S4A mutation that strongly affected activation by D6PK did not significantly affect activation by PID.

However, in contrast to the strong defects in PIN S4 phosphorylation that we observed in the <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants, neither <italic>pid</italic> nor <italic>wag1 wag2</italic> mutants showed a clear reduction in PIN phosphorylation at the S4 phosphosite suggesting that PID and WAG1/WAG2 do not contribute to PIN S4 phosphorylation in this tissue. We also aimed to conduct the complementary SRM analysis experiment of the PIN1 and PIN3 S1, S2, and S3 phosphosites but, for technical reasons, had to restrict our efforts to SRM measurements of PIN1 S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>) and PIN3 S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>): Whereas the peptides comprising the S3 phosphosites of PIN1 and PIN3 were unsuitable for chemical peptide synthesis as predicted based on their primary amino acid sequence, we repeatedly failed to obtain synthetic peptides for the PIN1 and PIN3 S2 phosphosites. Our analysis of PIN1 and PIN3 S1 phosphorylations, however, showed that the phosphorylation at the S1 phosphosites was not affected when comparing the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant with the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant expressing a complementing <italic>D6PK</italic> transgene suggesting that D6PK does not contribute to the phosphorylation of S1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4 fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplements 4 and 5</xref>).</p><p>Since our phosphosite analyses indicated that D6PK and PID share their PIN target but display differential preferences for these phosphosites, we analyzed the functional redundancy of these two kinases in promoter swap experiments by expressing them under the control of the genes' promoter fragments in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> and the <italic>pid</italic> mutant background, respectively. These experiments demonstrated that D6PK and PID cannot functionally replace each other when expressed from the promoter of the respective other gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Whereas the expression of <italic>PID</italic> from a <italic>PID</italic> promoter fragment was sufficient to complement the phenotypes of a <italic>pid</italic> mutant, the expression of <italic>D6PK</italic> under control of the <italic>PID</italic> promoter fragment failed to complement <italic>pid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

In summary, these genetic experiments supported our conclusion that D6PK and PID/WAGs are functionally divergent and these findings and conclusions are in line with previous observations on the differential effects of these two kinases in PIN polarity control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>).

This cycling is highly sensitive to the trafficking inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) and in selected BFA-treatment conditions D6PK can be depleted from the plasma membrane without significantly affecting the plasma membrane abundance of PIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). The differential BFA-sensitivity of D6PK and PIN allowed us testing the contribution of plasma membrane-resident D6PK to PIN phosphorylation. For this purpose, we generated a phosphosite-specific antibody for PIN1 S4 that efficiently detected S4 phosphorylated PIN1 at the plasma membrane but failed to detect PIN1 S4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found that PIN1 S4 phosphorylation was strongly decreased already minutes after BFA treatment when D6PK had become dissociated from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Thus, PIN1 S4 phosphorylation depended on the presence of D6PK or other BFA-sensitive protein kinases at the plasma membrane.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02860.031</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>PIN1 pS4 is dependent on D6PK presence at the plasma membrane.</title><p>Representative confocal images of root stele cells after immunostaining highlighting (arrowheads) the presence of YFP:D6PK (D6PK), S4-phosphorylated PIN1 (PIN1 pS4) and PIN1 at the plasma membrane before and the absence of D6PK and PIN1 pS4 after BFA treatment.

We showed that <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants are impaired in basipetal auxin transport in inflorescence stems and postulated that PINs may be directly activated by D6PKs. This hypothesis was supported by the facts that D6PK colocalized with the basally localized PIN1 and PIN3 proteins in various cell types, that D6PKs phosphorylated PINs in vitro and that D6PKs influence PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we tested this hypothetical functional relationship by examining PIN1 or PIN3 activity and auxin transport at various levels. We showed that basipetal auxin transport was reduced in inflorescence stems of <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants and that PIN-mediated auxin efflux was activated by D6PK in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Furthermore, we could rule out that the decreases in auxin transport as measured in inflorescence stems are the consequence of changes in PIN abundance as demonstrated using confocal imaging, immunoblotting, and SRM analyses of PIN proteins. We furthermore demonstrated that D6PK-dependent PIN activation was dependent on specific phosphosites in PIN1 and PIN3. Taken together, all our findings support the conclusion that D6PKs are major regulators of PIN-mediated auxin transport in inflorescence stems. Since <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants have a number of phenotypes such as gravitropism defects in the root, negative gravitropism defects in the hypocotyl, phototropism defects in the hypocotyl as well as defects in lateral root initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>), we are tempted to speculate that these other <italic>d6pk</italic> mutant phenotypes are also the consequence of reduced auxin transport activity of PINs in the absence of the PIN-activating D6PK kinases.</p><p>The detailed analysis of the S1–S5 phosphosites in in vitro phosphorylation experiments and in oocyte auxin transport experiments revealed that PIN1 S4 as well as PIN3 S4 and S5 are major target sites for D6PK. This conclusion found support also in the analysis of the in vivo phosphorylation levels at these sites since phosphorylation at S4 and S5 was strongly reduced in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant. Interestingly, the preferential D6PK phosphosites S4 and S5 are not conserved in PIN2 and it is striking that the respective domains in PIN2 carry small insertions when compared to the other PIN proteins. Thus, the activation of PINs by phosphorylation may be regulated by the presence and abundance of activating kinases such as D6PK but also by the availability and conservation of phosphosites in their PIN targets.</p><p>Besides S4 and S5, PINs must have other phosphosites that are targeted by D6PK since auxin transport defects in <italic>pin</italic> mutants expressing the respective PIN S4A and S5A mutant variants are partially complemented and not as severe as those observed in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Besides phosphorylations at S1, which are not affected in <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutants, S2 and S3 would be other possible target sites since their mutation further impairs D6PK-dependent PIN phosphorylation in vitro and auxin transport in the oocyte system. In this respect, it is unfortunate that we were unable, for technical reasons, to measure phosphorylation at S2 and S3 in the <italic>d6pk</italic> and <italic>pid</italic> mutants.</p><p>Our study also addressed the functional role of PID and the PID-related WAG1/WAG2 kinases in the control of auxin transport. While we found that PID and WAG2 activate PIN-mediated auxin efflux in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, we showed at the same time that PID has different phosphosite preferences when compared to D6PK. We observed these phosphosite preferences when analyzing PIN phosphorylation at S1–S5 in in vitro phosphorylation experiments, auxin transport in oocytes, and PIN phosphorylation by quantitative mass spectrometry in the <italic>d6pk012</italic>, <italic>pid</italic> and <italic>wag1 wag2</italic> mutants. Whereas D6PK appeared to have a preference for the S4 and S5 sites in PIN1 and PIN3, PID preferentially phosphorylated the previously identified S1–S3 phosphosites. S1–S3 are highly related to each other and also highly conserved among all five plasma membrane-resident PIN auxin efflux carriers including PIN2.</p><p>Although D6PK had a preference for S4 and S5 phosphorylation, our in vitro phosphorylation experiments as well as the auxin transport experiments in oocytes further suggested that the phosphorylation of S1–S3 also contributes to full PIN phosphorylation and activation by D6PK. The respective inverse observations were made with PID. Whereas PID phosphorylation and activation of PIN1 was strongly impaired when S1–S3 were mutated, full impairment of phosphorylation and activation could only be achieved after S4 mutation. In this respect, we consider the complementation experiments of the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant with the wild type PIN1 and the mutant PIN1 S4A transgenes particularly insightful. Here, we found that basipetal auxin transport in the inflorescence stem was partially impaired when PIN1 S1 was mutated whereas the strong inflorescence differentiation phenotype of the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant was rescued. The partial complementation of the <italic>pin1</italic> auxin transport defect indicates that PIN1 S4 is not the only phosphosite required for D6PK-dependent PIN1 activation and basipetal auxin transport. As such, this result is in agreement with the results of our in vitro phosphorylation and oocyte auxin transport experiments, which showed that D6PK can also activate PIN1 through S1–S3 phosphorylation. On the other side, the rescue of the differentiation defect can be explained because the PIN1 S4A protein still contained the preferential phosphorylation sites for PID. As shown in the in vitro phosphorylation experiment as well as in the oocyte auxin transport experiment, the PIN1 S4A mutant variant is neither strongly impaired in its phosphorylation by PID nor in its activation by PID. Thus, the essential phosphosites required for PID-dependent PIN activation and PIN polarity changes are retained in PIN1 S4A. Therefore, the selective functionality of this mutant PIN1 in the context of inflorescence development indirectly supports the findings of our other analyses.</p><p>Along the same lines, we also studied the ability of a PIN3 S4A S5A transgene to rescue the strong phototropism defect of the <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutant. We had previously shown that <italic>d6pk d6pkl1</italic> double mutants as well as <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutants are severely compromised in phototropic hypocotyl bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). We had shown that this phenotype could be explained by a strong defect in basipetal auxin transport and the apparent accumulation of auxin in the cotyledons of dark-grown seedlings, which, in turn, correlated with the absence of an auxin maximum in the bending zone of the hypocotyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). At the same time, PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes could still take place in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant indicating that PID can function independently from D6PK on PIN3. Our observation that the PIN3 S4A S5A transgene could only partially rescue the <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutant phenotype supports the notion that phosphorylation at these sites is important for PIN3 activation but suggests further that other phosphosites, such as S1–S3, may also be targeted by D6PK. This partial inactivation of an S4A S5A mutated PIN3 as observed <italic>in planta</italic> is in agreement with the partial impairment of PIN3 S4A S5A phosphorylation in in vitro phosphorylation experiments with D6PK as well as the fact that there is still a residual activation when PIN3 S4A S5A is activated with D6PK in the oocyte system. With regard to the relevance of S1–S3 for PIN3 function, we found that mutation of PIN3 S1–S3 or S1–S5 rendered this PIN3 non-functional when introduced as a transgene into <italic>pin347</italic>. Since these mutant PIN3 variants would be expected to be impaired in D6PK-dependent basipetal auxin transport as well as in PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes, it is difficult based on the present depth of analysis to judge whether the non-functionality of PIN3 S1A–S3A or PIN3 S1A–S5A is primarily caused by a defect in basipetal auxin transport, a defect in changing PIN3 polarity or a combination of both.</p><p>In our experiments, PIN phosphorylation led to a direct activation of auxin efflux in oocytes. The analysis of auxin transport in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems suggested that this might indeed be the primary function of this modification since auxin transport was strongly impaired in <italic>d6pk</italic> loss-of-function mutants while PIN abundance at the plasma membrane was not altered. This observation does, however, not rule out that PIN phosphorylation has other regulatory roles such control of PIN polarity by PID or WAG-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friml et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>). Changes in PIN polarity as they are observed after <italic>PID</italic> or <italic>WAG2</italic> overexpression are not observed after <italic>D6PK</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhonukshe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). The differential effect of D6PK and PID/WAGs on PIN may have its molecular basis in the differential phosphosite preferences of the two kinases. Common to both kinases seems, however, the fact that their phosphorylation activity is antagonistically regulated by phosphatases. While the phenotypic effects of PID can be antagonized by PP2A phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michniewicz et al., 2007</xref>), removal of the D6PK from the plasma membrane through BFA treatment resulted in an almost immediate decrease in PIN1 phosphorylation. Thus, it can be speculated that also D6PK-dependent PIN phosphorylation is antagonized by phosphatases, the identities of which remain to be determined.</p><p>Our data also suggest that PIN1 and PIN3 phosphorylation is not only controlled by the presence of D6PK at the plasma membrane but also by auxin itself. Using quantitative SRM analyses, we could show that PIN1 S4 as well as PIN3 S4 and S5 phosphorylation increases in response to auxin treatment in the wild type. In the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant, the loss of phosphorylation at these preferential D6PK phosphosites could not be compensated by auxin application suggesting that these auxin-dependent phosphorylations are D6PK-dependent and may be mediated either directly by D6PK or by D6PK acting as an indirect auxiliary factor. Although we observed a minor increase in PIN phosphorylation at the D6PK phosphosites in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> triple mutant, these increases were comparatively minor and may be attributed to phosphorylation through D6PKL3, which is still expressed in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant. Alternatively, they may be attributed to the activity of other PIN-regulatory kinases such as the PID/WAGs or other as yet uncharacterized protein kinases. Theoretically, it could be envisioned that the auxin-dependent increases in PIN phosphorylation are the consequence of the previously reported inhibitory effects of auxin on PIN endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paciorek et al., 2005</xref>). In this case, PIN phosphorylating kinases would encounter their PIN targets simply for a longer period of time thereby increasing the chances for phosphorylation. Unraveling the identity of the underlying auxin-sensory mechanism and its molecular details will be an interesting avenue for future investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Parry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that auxin treatment led to a transient dissociation of D6PK from the plasma membrane in root cells There, this auxin response correlates with a slight decrease in PIN1 phosphorylation as judged by immunoblots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, we report here that auxin promotes PIN phosphorylation in inflorescence stems as determined by quantitative mass spectrometry of PIN1 S4, PIN3 S4 and PIN3 S5. It is at present difficult for us to reconcile these two apparently contrasting observations. We can therefore only argue that PIN phosphorylation is controlled by different auxin-dependent regulatory mechanisms in different tissues.</p><p>In summary, our study provides evidence that PIN-mediated auxin efflux requires activation by PIN phosphorylating kinases such as D6PK and PID/WAGs. Several of our findings point at a differential biochemical activity of these two AGCVIII kinase representatives on PINs that may explain their differential effects in controlling PIN polarity, auxin transport, and plant growth. The differential PIN-dependent distribution of auxin within the plant is of pivotal importance for the regulation of a multitude of processes in plant growth and development. It is our view that the activation of PINs by D6PKs and PID/WAGs is a crucial component of the control of auxin transport that must be taken into account to understand auxin transport within the plant and to ultimately understand plant growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological material</title><p>The following mutant alleles were used for this study: Single, double and triple mutants of <italic>d6pk-1</italic> (<italic>d6pk0</italic>; SALK_061847), <italic>d6pkl1-1</italic> (<italic>d6pk1</italic>; SALK_056618), <italic>d6pkl2-2</italic> (<italic>d6pk2</italic>; SALK_086127) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>d6pk012</italic> triple mutants with a complementing <italic>D6PKp:YFP:D6PK</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>); DR5:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonsson et al., 2006</xref>); <italic>pid-14</italic> (SALK_049736); <italic>pin1</italic> (SALK_047613); <italic>pin3-3 pin4-101 pin7-102</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>); PIN1:GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grieneisen et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>wag1 wag2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Santner and Watson, 2006</xref>). <italic>D6PKp:GUS</italic> transgenic lines expressing the ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter under control of <italic>D6PK</italic> promoter (<italic>D6PKp</italic>) fragments as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>PIN1p:GUS</italic>, <italic>PIN3p:GUS</italic>, <italic>PIN4p:GUS</italic> and <italic>PIN7p:GUS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vieten et al., 2005</xref>) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (NASC) or are a gift from Christian Luschnig (Vienna, Austria).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>Primer sequences for cloning, insert amplification and site-directed mutagenesis are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.</p><p>For in vitro transcription prior to protein translation in oocytes, <italic>PIN1</italic> and <italic>PIN3</italic> were inserted into the expression vector pOO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broer, 2010</xref>).

Oocytes were injected with ∼50 nl of a 1:1 mixture of cRNAs for PIN and protein kinase. If only PIN or protein kinase cRNA was injected, the cRNA was mixed 1:1 with water (mock control). Following injection, oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution containing 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) supplemented with 50 µl gentamycine at 16°C for 4 days to allow for protein synthesis. An outside medium buffer at pH 7.4 was chosen to prevent passive rediffusion of IAA into the oocytes, which would take place at acidic pH. At the beginning of the oocyte experiment, 10 oocytes were injected for each time point with 50 nl of a 1:5 dilution (in Barth's solution) of [<sup>3</sup>H]-IAA, 25 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml (ARC, St. Louis, MO) to reach an intracellular oocyte concentration of ∼1 µM [<sup>3</sup>H]-IAA based on an estimated oocyte volume of 400 nl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broer, 2010</xref>).

We would like to ask you to pay particular attention to the comments regarding the apparent disconnect between the macroscopic phenotype of pin mutants complemented by phosphosite variants and the importance of those sites in the transport assays.</p><p>Auxin efflux carriers of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family are the principal determinants of polar auxin transport in plant development. In this paper, you present a detailed account on the regulation of their activity through differential phosphorylation. There is conclusive evidence that PIN proteins are phosphorylated by PINOID (PID) and related (WAG) kinases as well as D6 protein kinases (D6PKs) at specific sites. You show that these phosphorylations not only affect, as previously shown, the polarity of PINs (i.e. through PID/WAG), but also plainly the capacity of PINs to transport auxin across the plasma membrane. These findings fit with your previous molecular genetic analyses of D6PKs and force us to rethink the notion that auxin flux can be solely predicted from PIN localization, an assumption that underlies various models in this area of investigation.</p><p>There are a few suggestions that could improve this otherwise high quality manuscript:</p><p>1) Given that you provide evidence for a role of D6PKs in hypocotyl phototropism, could you please also provide images of D6PK reporter construct expression in hypocotyl(s) (and) cells?</p><p>2) The biochemical part and auxin efflux assay in oocytes seems very well done to me. Still, one is wondering whether you could provide raw data of the phosphoproteomic analysis (i.e. what peptides where found, how many, etc.)?</p><p>3) There is one genetic experiment that the reviewers had a hard time interpreting: the PIN1S4A variant can rescue a <italic>pin1</italic> null mutant, yet basipetal transport is compromised. However, from a phenotypic perspective, one could argue then that S4 does not matter, the plants look wild type. This disconnect between biochemical/physiological results and genetic results merits some more attention. Given the strong <italic>pin1</italic> phenotype, one would expect at least some type of intermediate phenotype in the lines complemented by the S4A variant if this site matters. Did you try to complement the mutant with a PIN1 S4A D215A double point mutant and if so, did this rescue only partially?</p><p>4) Also with respect to the above, can PIN3 expressed under PIN1 promoter rescue the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant, and if so, what about the PIN3 S4A S5A variant?</p><p>5) Finally, was the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant used a true null allele, and could you quantify the rescue in terms of, e.g., perfect floral meristems or overall branch number to eventually detect intermediate phenotypes?</p><p>6) With regard to complementation again, the reviewers had a hard time finding a clear description of <italic>pin347</italic> triple mutants in the literature. You focus on this triple mutant's phototropism defect in your assays, but are there other phenotypes that could be monitored?</p><p>7) Given the speed of the phosphorylation induced by auxin, it seems surprising that it is supposedly under control of the TIR1/AFB auxin receptors. Does this suggest that these receptors have a non-transcriptional activity in this? Then, does auxin-induced phosphorylation still occur when transcription is blocked?</p><p>8) Has it been addressed whether S4 and S5 phosphorylation are specific to activity changes of PINs or whether they also play a role in localization? Finally, do they affect the kinetics of endocytic PIN recycling?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and accompanying text: if there were no difference in total abundance of PIN proteins in the <italic>dp6k</italic> mutants, shouldn't the sum of PIN_pS4 and PIN_S4 be the same in WT and mutants?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and accompanying text: if the S4 of PIN1 is not a target of PID/WAG kinase function, why does the S4A mutation further impair activation by PID?

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>On a side note, you might consider to remove the part describing the TIR1 pathway-dependence of PIN phosphorylation. Although, as you indicate, the data are solid, they remain unexplored with respect to the mechanism and they might distract from the main message of the paper. However, let us emphasize that it is your decision whether to keep those data in or not.</p><p>More importantly, an issue was arising regarding genetic background. In your assays with the <italic>abp1</italic> mutant, you were using the weak <italic>abp1-5</italic> allele, and it appears that you match it to a Ler wild type control. However, the originally described <italic>abp1-5</italic> (Xu et al., Cell, 2010; Robert et al., Cell, 2010) was a TILLING allele obtained in the Col-0 background and cross backed to Col-0 four times. Could you please clarify the origin and nature of your allele? Finally, if the allele you used should be the described one in Col-0 background, does this change the interpretation of the results?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02860.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Auxin efflux carriers of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family are the principal determinants of polar auxin transport in plant development.

As can be seen from these two supplementary files, almost full coverage was achieved in these mass spectrometric analyses and phosphorylations at the sites S1–S5 were observed in almost all cases for all PINs and later confirmed for all PINs, PIN1–PIN4 and PIN7 in the peptide phosphorylation experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) There is one genetic experiment that the reviewers had a hard time interpreting: the PIN1S4A variant can rescue a</italic> pin1 <italic>null mutant, yet basipetal transport is compromised. However, from a phenotypic perspective, one could argue then that S4 does not matter, the plants look wild type.

Did you try to complement the mutant with a PIN1 S4A D215A double point mutant and if so, did this rescue only partially?</italic></p><p>As stated above, we noted based on this comment that we have not paid sufficient attention to discuss in detail the results from the complementation experiments (<italic>pin1</italic> mutant rescue experiment; phototropism experiment with PIN3 in <italic>pin3 pin4 pin7</italic> mutants). For the revised manuscript, we have paid particular attention to providing a better introduction into the roles of D6PK and PID in controlling PINs in the context of shoot differentiation and auxin transport in the shoot as well as their roles in the control of phototropism.</p><p>The key to understanding these data is to realize that D6PK and PID do not regulate auxin transport in an additive manner but control distinct processes in the inflorescence and during phototropism. In brief, <italic>pin1</italic> mutants are defective in basipetal auxin transport in the stem and they are unable to form local auxin maxima required for lateral organ differentiation. The latter process requires a PIN1 polarity change that is mediated by PIN1 phosphorylation at the preferential PID phosphosites S1–S3. In the PIN1 S4A mutant, the phosphorylation at the S1–S3 phosphosites can still take place and, therefore, PIN1 polarity changes can still occur, local auxin maxima can form and the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant phenotype is rescued. At the same time, we find that <italic>pin1</italic> with the PIN1 S4A transgene is impaired in auxin transport. This finding is in line with the observations in the oocyte experiment where mutation of S4 also partially impairs auxin efflux. According to the oocyte experiments, additional mutations of S1 – S3 would be needed to fully impair basipetal auxin transport but such an experiment would not allow us judging the importance of the previously uncharacterized S4 phosphosite.</p><p>The results obtained with the PIN3 S4A S5A transgene can be interpreted in a similar manner. The oocyte experiments would predict that this mutant variant is only partially impaired in its activation by D6PK and basipetal auxin transport. The PIN3 S1A – S3A mutations affect PID-dependent PIN3 polarity changes, which are essential for lateralization of auxin and possibly also for PID-dependent activation of PIN3 auxin transport and they are therefore more severe. Goal of this particular experiment was to demonstrate the functional importance of the novel S4 and S5 phosphosites of PIN3.</p><p><italic>4) Also with respect to the above, can PIN3 expressed under PIN1 promoter rescue the</italic> pin1 <italic>mutant, and if so, what about the PIN3 S4A S5A variant?</italic></p><p>This is in fact an interesting experiment, which we have however not conducted yet. When designing the already very complex set of experiments on PIN phosphorylation presented in this paper, we were very much interested to be able to provide an as complete, as in complementary, set of data for selected phosphosites. Already the analysis of four or five different phosphosites of a single PIN gives rise to 24 or even 120 possible combinations of phosphosite mutations. At least for us, it is impossible to evaluate such a large number of mutants in three different assay systems (in vitro phosphorylation, oocyte experiments, and mutant complementation). We have therefore decided after the initial characterization of the four and five phosphosites in PIN1 and PIN3, respectively, to concentrate on aspects of S4 and S5 in the context of the native proteins. We ask for your understanding.</p><p><italic>5) Finally, was the</italic> pin1 <italic>mutant used a true null allele, and could you quantify the rescue in terms of, e.g., perfect floral meristems or overall branch number to eventually detect intermediate phenotypes?</italic></p><p>Yes, the <italic>pin1</italic> mutant used in our studies is a true null. The mutant displays all phenotypes that were previously reported for <italic>pin1</italic> null mutants, it has a strongly impaired basipetal auxin transport as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and quantitative mass spectrometric analyses indicates that at least the selected peptide regions for SRM analysis are not present in the <italic>pin1</italic> allele. Furthermore, immunoblots using polyclonal anti-PIN1 antibodies indicate that also the full length PIN1 protein or fractions of it are not present in the mutant.</p><p>Although it is not explicitly phrased here, we feel that also this comment refers to the interpretation of the PIN1 S4A data and the apparent weak phenotype of this transgene when introduced into the pin1 background. We hope that the additional information that we are now providing helps to clarify that the observed phenotype is exactly the phenotype that would be expected for such as transgene since PID-dependent PIN1 phosphorylation and PIN1 polarity changes required for shoot differentiation can still take place in the case of PIN1 S4A.</p><p><italic>6) With regard to complementation again, the reviewers had a hard time finding a clear description of</italic> pin347 <italic>triple mutants in the literature. You focus on this triple mutant's phototropism defect in your assays, but are there other phenotypes that could be monitored?</italic></p><p>The phototropism defect of the <italic>pin3 pin4 pin7</italic> mutant is described in the paper on the regulation of phototropism by D6PK (Willige et al., Plant Cell, 2013). We are not aware of other phenotypes of this mutant but should state at the same time that this mutant was generated in the Fankhauser laboratory (coauthors of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref> paper) and we have agreed not to characterize this mutant further to avoid conflicts of interest with the Fankhauser lab. As already outlined in our reply to the previous comment, our main focus in the context of our manuscript was to provide evidence for a defect in auxin transport in these mutants in the presence and absence of a PIN3 wildtype or mutant transgene. This evidence is obtained by revealing the partial impairment of phototropic hypocotyl bending with the PIN3 S4A S5A variant.</p><p><italic>7) Given the speed of the phosphorylation induced by auxin, it seems surprising that it is supposedly under control of the TIR1/AFB auxin receptors. Does this suggest that these receptors have a non-transcriptional activity in this? Then, does auxin-induced phosphorylation still occur when transcription is blocked?</italic></p><p>Yes, the speed of changes in PIN phosphorylation is surprising, taking into account that the data at present suggest that this is mediated by TIR1/AFB. We had intuitively expected that this response would be mediated by ABP1, which is seemingly not the case. Since responses downstream of TIR1/AFBs are expected to be transcriptional responses, it would be expected that there is a delay of approximately one or two hours before auxin can efficiently interfere with signaling via TIR1/AFBs. The auxin effect through TIR1/AFBs must thus be explained by another as yet unknown mechanism. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have paid particular attention to carefully word our interpretation of this result since it cannot be explained by currently known signaling mechanisms. This definitely deserves further investigations because it may point at the existence of a novel auxin sensing signaling pathway.</p><p>We have been unable to perform the experiments with cycloheximide as suggested by the reviewer although we also consider them very important and insightful. The performance of the SRM experiments as presented in the current manuscript was already severely time-limiting experiments because the expertise in data analysis and access to the mass spectrometry equipment for these analysis is limiting. With the high qualitative standards that were applied to the experiments presented in the present manuscript, these experiments would frequently take close to a year from the moment of experimental planning, sample preparation, and sample analysis. We personally see a great potential in extending these analyses to further the understanding of auxin transport regulation per se that can give a resolution of signaling events at the protein molecular levels that is comparable to DNA sequencing. We must say that for the reasons mentioned above also many questions that could have been approached with this technology had to remain unanswered. We have therefore to excuse the omission of this critical experiment.</p><p>Should the editors and reviewers feel that the data as presented in the paper are not significant enough or too preliminary we can offer to remove these data them from the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and the corresponding supplement). At the same time, we would like to argue that this an extremely interesting, valuable and high quality data set that has already allowed us excluding some working hypotheses for ongoing further experiment, notably with regard to the regulation of this signaling event through ABP1.</p><p><italic>8) Has it been addressed whether S4 and S5 phosphorylation are specific to activity changes of PINs or whether they also play a role in localization? Finally, do they affect the kinetics of endocytic PIN recycling?</italic></p><p>We have examined the role of the PIN1 S4 site for PIN1 polarity, BFA-sensitivity and plasma membrane-abundance. The respective results are now presented as part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>. In brief, we have not obtained any evidence that PIN1 localization is altered in the case of the PIN1 S4A variant</p><p>In addition, we have presented related information in the original (and revised) manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) where we show by immunostaining with the anti-GFP antibody that the polarity and abundance of the wild type and S4A mutant protein are comparable. Furthermore, we have previously shown that PIN protein abundance is not altered in the <italic>d6pk</italic> mutants: We demonstrated that the loss of <italic>D6PK</italic> genes in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> triple mutant does not alter the abundance or localization of the PINs PIN1, PIN2, and PIN4 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zourelidou et al., 2009</xref>). And, we had performed quantitative PIN3 immunoblots in a <italic>d6pk</italic> mutant series as part of our study on the role of D6PK in phototropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Willige et al., 2013</xref>). There, we showed that there is only a slight (but at the same time reproducible) decrease in PIN3 abundance in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> triple and quadruple mutants. Importantly, in the <italic>d6pk01</italic> double mutant, which is severely impaired in phototropic hypocotyl bending and basipetal auxin transport, PIN3 levels are comparable to those of the wild type. Thus, changes in PIN3 abundance cannot explain the decrease in basipetal auxin transport in this tissue and experimental setting.</p><p>For the revised version of the manuscript, we have now discussed these different pieces of evidence more explicitly that all indicate that a reduction in PIN abundance is not sufficient to explain the reduction in PIN activity in the <italic>d6pk</italic> loss-of-function mutants or in lines expressing PINs that are mutated at specific PIN phosphorylation sites.</p><p><italic>9)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>and accompanying text: if there were no difference in total abundance of PIN proteins in the</italic> dp6k <italic>mutants, shouldn't the sum of PIN_pS4 and PIN_S4 be the same in WT and mutants?</italic></p><p>The detection of a peptide by mass spectrometry is strongly dependent on its chemical composition, and even closely related peptides like PIN_pS4 and PIN_S4 may behave differentially in the mass spectrometer, as can be seen by the large differences in ion intensity values for pS and S peptides. Therefore, quantitative differences observed for a specific peptide can only be directly compared to data obtained with the same peptide in different conditions or genoyptes. It is therefore in this case not appropriate to add up quantitative data obtained with different peptides.</p><p><italic>10)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>and accompanying text: if the S4 of PIN1 is not a target of PID/WAG kinase function, why does the S4A mutation further impair activation by PID? (compare PIN1_S1A-S3A</italic> <sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> <italic>PID with PIN1_S1A-S4A</italic> <sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> <italic>PID)</italic></p><p>This apparent discrepancy should be the consequence of the different assay systems used for the analysis of D6PK and PID function. On the one side we are using (most likely) an excess of D6PK and PID for the in vitro phosphorylation studies and in the oocyte experiments and this may affect the results of these analysis. This is why the SRM analyses as well as the analyses with the PIN1 S4A and PIN1 S4A S5A lines are particularly valuable, because they do show that in agreement with the in vitro phosphorylation experiments and the oocyte experiments, S4 and S5 do not exclusively contribute to PIN activation by D6PK (or PID). A “weakness” of the SRM analysis is that it cannot correct for the respective amount of kinase, D6PK or PID, in the sample thus the non-reduction in S4 phosphorylation in the pid sample may reflect the fact that few cells express PID in the tissue under investigation. On the other side, the strong reduction in S4 phosphorylation in the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant may be the consequence of the kinases being expressed in most of the cells in the sampled tissue. Thus, the fact that PID is expressed in comparatively few cells in the sampled tissue (or expressed at a much lower level than D6PKs) could be the cause for S4 phosphorylations not being affected in the <italic>pid</italic> mutant.</p><p>It is inversely also apparent from the SRM analysis of the <italic>d6pk012</italic> mutant where S4 and S5 phosphorylations are strongly decreased that S1 phosphorylations are not affected. Since the transgenic experiments as well as the oocyte experiments and the in vitro phosphorylation experiments all support the notion that there must be other phosphorylation sites in addition to S4 and S5 which should be S1 – S3, we must argue that S2 or S3, which we unfortunately could not analyze by SRM, are targeted by D6PKs. We have discussed this in the revised version of the paper.</p><p><italic>11) The reviewers are wondering whether it is true that Ler and Col behave differently from each other and that</italic> abp1-5 <italic>behaves differently from Ler: it seems that in all genotypes, the amount of PIN1_pS4 doubles in the presence of auxin</italic>.</p><p>Yes, it is correct that the Ler auxin response is stronger than that observed in Col.
