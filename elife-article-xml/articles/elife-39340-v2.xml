ENaCs assemble as heterotrimeric channels that harbor protease-sensitive domains critical for gating the channel. Here, we present the structure of human ENaC in the uncleaved state determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The ion channel is composed of a large extracellular domain and a narrow transmembrane domain. The structure reveals that ENaC assembles with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of α:β:γ subunits arranged in a counter-clockwise manner. The shape of each subunit is reminiscent of a hand with key gating domains of a ‘finger’ and a ‘thumb.’ Wedged between these domains is the elusive protease-sensitive inhibitory domain poised to regulate conformational changes of the ‘finger’ and ‘thumb’; thus, the structure provides the first view of the architecture of inhibition of ENaC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39340.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bodies of humans and other animals contain many different fluids that play vital roles in the body, such as blood, saliva and the fluids that surround cells in organs. These fluids all contain particles called ions, which can affect the flow of water into and out of cells and alter the activity of proteins. Therefore, in order to survive, an animal must tightly regulate the levels of ions in its body.</p><p>Epithelial cells line the surface of organs, and the inside of the digestive system and other cavities in the human body. A channel known as ENaC is found on the surface of epithelial cells and controls the volume of the fluid surrounding cells, blood pressure and the volume of liquid in the airways. This channel spans the membrane surrounding each epithelial cell and allows sodium ions to pass into the cell. To promote the opening of the channel, enzymes remove portions of the ENaC called extracellular domain, which sits on the outside surface of an epithelial cell. Three components (or ‘subunits’) called alpha, beta and gamma are needed to form an ENaC, but it is not clear how they fit together to form a single working unit.</p><p>Noreng et al. used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the three-dimensional structure of the human ENaC. This revealed that a single channel contains one alpha, one beta and one gamma subunit, which sit next to each other to form a narrow tube through the membrane and a large extracellular domain. When viewed from the outside of the cell the subunits form a narrow ring in a counter-clockwise manner.</p><p>Further analysis of the structure suggested that when enzymes remove pieces of the extracellular domain of ENaC, it becomes easier for the rest of the channel to adopt a shape that allows sodium ions to move through the pore. A next step will be to study the three-dimensional structure of ENaC when it takes on different shapes to better understand how it works.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ion Channel</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>heterotrimer</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5OD017871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baconguis</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first structure of the human epithelial sodium channel provides vital insight into the assembly, stoichiometry and molecular mechanism of the ion channel central to sodium homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fine-tuning of Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is largely mediated by epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) that are related in amino acid sequence to acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) found in eukaryotes, degenerin channels (DEG) of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and the FMRF-amide peptide-gated channels (FaNaCh) of mollusk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driscoll and Chalfie, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chalfie and Wolinsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waldmann et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waldmann et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krishtal and Pidoplichko, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chelur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garty and Palmer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cottrell et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lingueglia et al., 1995</xref>).

Amino acid sequence alignments and biochemical analyses in the ECD have so far revealed that only the β subunit lacks the characteristic motifs for protease recognition.

Indeed, the complexities of ENaC function involving the requisite heteromeric subunit assembly and asymmetric subunit modification via differential proteolytic processing are critical to ion channel gating.

This construct provided a homogeneous and highly-expressing population. However, the inherent pseudosymmetry from common secondary and tertiary structures between the α, β, and γ subunits of human ENaC hindered particle alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate biochemical integrity and to facilitate cryo-EM three-dimensional reconstruction of ΔENaC, we generated subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to three-dimensional epitopes in ΔENaC and FL-ENaC.

While these antibodies were raised against ΔENaC<sub>ASIC</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>), both Fabs bind to both ΔENaC expressed in HEK 293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> and FL-ENaC expressed in HEK293T/17, which indicates that ΔENaC is properly folded and that the Fabs do not bind to the ASIC segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a,b</xref>).

Together, the knuckle and finger domains of all three subunits form a ‘collar’ at the top of the ECD. Sequence alignment of the three subunits demonstrate divergence in amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end of both α1 and α6 in all three subunits, which results in distinct types of molecular interactions at each subunit interface that are, perhaps, associated with assembly and stability of the ENaC. The contact between the finger and thumb domains is mediated by long antiparallel helices α1 and α2, which form a barrier between the thumb domain and the β6-β7 loop with α2 making the primary contacts with the thumb domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The domain arrangement observed in the ΔENaC structure agrees with the functional study probing Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites in the α subunit of ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kashlan et al., 2015</xref>). The α2 helix makes an almost 90° turn towards the palm domain breaking the helix. This architecture marks another departure from ASIC, in which contacts between the finger and thumb domains are largely mediated by α1, α3, α5, and the α4-α5 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39340.028</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Intersubunit interactions in ΔENaC in the finger and knuckle domains.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The finger and knuckle domains forge intersubunit interactions forming a ‘collar’ at the top of the ECD.

The γ subunit lacks two residues preceding the palm domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f</xref>).

Furthermore, an additional disulfide bond in the loop near the β-γ interface stabilizes the GRIP domain of the β subunit. We suspect that this additional disulfide bond contributes to the well-ordered behavior of the β GRIP domain, allowing the resolution of nearly the whole segment between α1 and α2 in the β subunit. Moreover, the 10D4 Fab binds the β GRIP domain, allowing us to resolve two additional antiparallel β strands. In the α and γ subunits, we can only identify one stretch of residues that adopt an extended conformation. Based on the shared features observed in all three subunits, it is plausible that the α and γ subunits also contain a fourth β strand. With four possible β strands in the GRIP domains, each strand or stretch of peptides is referred to here as P1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Structural insight gleaned from the β GRIP domain reveals the possible positions of the functionally well-characterized but structurally elusive inhibitory tracts and furin and other protease sites in the α and γ GRIP domains. Studies by the Kleyman group have identified 8- and 11-mer peptide tracts within the α and γ GRIP domains, respectively, which are implicated in channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Passero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carattino et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kashlan et al., 2010</xref>). Sequence comparison between the three subunits suggests that the inhibitory tracts contain the P1 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b – d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on this configuration, the first furin site lies at the N-terminal side of P1 whereas the second protease site (furin for α and other protease sites for γ) is likely located at the C-terminal side of P2. The anti-parallel organization of P1 and P2 strands places the two protease sites in close proximity to each other. We speculate that this arrangement allows for efficient proteolysis, especially for the cleavage of the α subunit by furin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Aromatic pocket</title><p>The first crystal structure of ASIC identified the finger and the thumb domains as major players in ion channel gating. Rearrangements of these domains are coupled to the TMD via the wrist. Additionally, the crystal structure provided insight into the domain essential for fine-tuning ASIC pH-response, deemed the acidic pocket, formed by the β-ball, finger, and thumb domains of one subunit, and the palm domain of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). While the acidic pockets in ASIC are lined with negatively charged residues, the equivalent crevices in ENaC are replete with aromatic residues. In fact, aside from Ser428 of Δβ (Asp346 in ASIC), the equivalent sites in the thumb domain that are acidic in ASIC are occupied by tyrosines in all three subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>).

In all three ENaC subunits, the α2 forms contacts with the thumb, α1 helix, the β6-β7 loop and the GRIP domain, and with the knuckle and the upper palm domains in the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, studies using synthesized 8-mer (LPHPLQRL) and 11-mer peptides (RFLNLIPLLVF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Passero et al., 2010</xref>), the inhibitory peptides of α and γ subunits, respectively, have identified residues in α2 to be critical to the binding of the inhibitory peptides. These peptides pack against α2 and form a wedge between the thumb domain and α1 in the ΔENaC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). These inhibitory peptides contain prolines that introduce a kink within the tract that may serve as a point that divides P1 into two segments: the N-terminal side, which interacts with the finger and thumb; and the C-terminal side, which interacts primarily with α2 and P3. The observed orientation of the P1 segment is consistent with the cross-linking experiments by Kashlan et al., which provided two major findings: (1) the inhibitory tracts adopt an extended conformation and ﻿(2) the N-terminal side of the peptide binds near the thumb/finger interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kashlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kashlan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The potential map for α-P1 suggests that the N-terminal side mirrors that of β-P1 forging contacts with the α1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).

the full length α, β and γ subunits of human ENaC were cloned into pEG BacMam expression vector harboring an N-terminal eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>). The Δα was generated by removing both N- and C-terminal segments and modifying the furin sites obtaining a mutant variant of the α subunit lacking 42 and 89 residues at N- and C- termini, respectively. While the Δβ was designed to possess truncations of 30 and 79 residues at the N- and C-terminal regions, Δβ<sub>ASIC</sub> has the same truncated regions as Δβ but contains an additional N-terminal 2 – 22 residues of cASIC upstream of Δβ. Lastly, Δγ lacks 20 and 79 residues at the N- and C-terminal domains, has modified furin and prostasin sites, and includes a Strep-tag II, an octa-histidine tag, eGFP, and Thrombin cleavage site at the N-terminus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation and isolation of Fabs</title><p>Mouse monoclonal antibodies 7B1 and 10D4 were generated using standard procedure by Dan Cawley at the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute (OHSU). Liposomes containing asolectin:cholesterol:lipidA:brain polar lipid extract (BPLE) (16:4.6:1:5.3) were prepared in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 at a concentration of 40 mg/ml. The mixture was subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through a 200-nm filter. Purified ΔENaC<sub>ASIC</sub> (Δα, Δβ<sub>ASIC</sub>, Δγ) protein was added to the liposome mixture in the presence of 400 mM NaCl and 0.8% Na-cholate and passed through a PD-10 desalting column to remove excess salt and detergent. Mice were immunized with approximately 30 μg of the reconstituted ΔENaC<sub>ASIC</sub> for generation of hybdridoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies were screened by FSEC and BioDot blot to identify clones that recognize tertiary or primary epitopes. The 7B1 and 10D4 mAbs were selected because they recognize tertiary epitopes of ENaC. The mAbs were purified, and their Fabs were generated by papain cleavage. Fab 7B1 was isolated by anion exchange using HiTrap Q HP column while Fab 10D4 was eluted using Protein A column to remove Fc. After isolation, both Fabs were dialyzed in 200 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Expression and purification of ΔENaC-Fab complexes</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells) were grown in suspension at a density of 2−4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells / ml in Freestyle medium with 2% FBS and transduced with the virus (Δα, Δβ and Δγ) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37°C. Eight hours post-transduction, sodium butyrate and phenamil mesylate were added to 10 mM and 500 nM, respectively, and cells were incubated at 30°C. After 36 hr, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4790 xg for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl and followed by a second round of centrifugation at 4790 xg for 15 min. Cells were homogenized with a dounce homogenizer and sonicated in 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 μg/ml DNase I and protease inhibitors. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 9715 xg for 20 min; the resulting supernatant containing the membrane fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 1 hr. Membrane pellets were resuspended and solubilized in 20 mM TRIS pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 3 mM cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, protease inhibitor and 25 U/mL nuclease for 1 hr at 4°C. The solubilized fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation 100,000 xg for 1 hr, and ΔENaC was bound to streptactin resin packed into an XK-16 column. The column was washed with 20 mM TRIS, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DDM, 75 μM CHS and 25 U/mL nuclease, followed by an additional wash of the same buffer containing 2 mM ATP, and eluted with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The eluted fractions were concentrated and then incubated with either one Fab 10D4 (monoFab complex) or two Fabs 7B1 and 10D4 (diFab complex) in a 1:3 molar ratio of ENaC:Fab for 10 min, and clarified by ultracentrifugation 100,000 xg for 1 hr. The supernatant was injected onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 20 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DDM, 75 µM CHS and 1 mM TCEP to isolate the protein complex by size-exclusion chromatography. Monodispersed fractions were pooled and concentrated to 2.2 mg/mL.</p><p>For FSEC experiments analyzing peak shifts of the ΔENaC and FL-ENaC with 7B1 and 10D4, ΔENaC was expressed in HEK 293S GnTI<sup>-</sup>, as described above, while FL-ENaC was expressed in HEK 293T/17. The HEK 293T/17 cells were grown in suspension at a density of 2−4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells / ml in Freestyle medium with 2% FBS and transduced with the virus (FL-α, FL-β and FL-γ) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37°C. Eight hours post-transduction, 500 nM phenamil mesylate was added, and cells were incubated at 30°C. After 36 hr post-transduction, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4790 xg for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl and followed by a second round of centrifugation at 4790 xg for 15 min.

These samples were then run through 4 – 20% Criterion SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes according to manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). After blocking overnight in 5% non-fat milk in TBS, membranes were incubated in primary antibody (ENaC α subunit, 6 µg/blot SC-21012; ENaC β subunit, 6 µg/blot SC-21013; ENaC γ subunit, 10 µg/blot abcam ab133430) for 2 hr. The membranes were then incubated in 1 µg/blot IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG (Licor) for 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image acquisition and processing</title><p>Purified ΔENaC-Fab complexes were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon grids (Au 1.2 µm/1.3 µm hole space/hole separation, 300mesh), blotted using a Vitrobot Mark III (FEI) with the following conditions, 7 s wait time, and 5 s blot time at 100% humidity, and then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. All images were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV at the Multiscale Microscopy Core (OHSU). Images were recorded by a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector operating in super-resolution mode, and the images were collected using the automated acquisition program SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mastronade, 2003</xref>). Magnification of the recorded images corresponded to a pixel size of 1.33 Å in counting mode (0.665 Å in super-resolution mode). For the ∆ENaC-10D4 complex, two data sets were acquired and were initially processed separately, and subsequently combined for 3D reconstruction. Each image in the first dataset was dose-fractionated to 30 frames with 0.5 s per frame and a total exposure time and dose of 15 s and 54 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The second dataset was collected in counting mode, and was therefore not binned when combined with the first where each image was dose-fractionated to 60 frames with 0.25 s per frame and a total exposure time and dose of 15 s and 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Similarly, two separate datasets were obtained for ∆ENaC-7B1/10D4 complex in super-resolution mode. Like in the monoFab complex, each data set was processed separately and later combined for further analysis and 3D reconstruction. The images of the first dataset of the diFab complex were dose-fractionated to 40 frames with 0.25 s per frame and a total exposure time and dose of 10 s and 62 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively, while the images of the second dataset were dose-fractionated to 48 frames with 0.25 s per frame and a total exposure time and dose of 12 s and 71 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p><p>The ∆ENaC-10D4 data set collected in super-resolution mode was binned 2 × 2 while the ∆ENaC-10D4 data set collected in counting mode was left unbinned. Both data sets were motion corrected using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), and automated particle selection was performed using DoGPicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2009</xref>). Defocus values for individual particles were estimated using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang, 2016</xref>), and particles belonging to low-abundance classes were removed via 2D classification and 3D classification in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scheres, 2012</xref>). The final set of particles was further analyzed in cryoSPARC and refined to a nominal resolution of 5.4 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For the ∆ENaC-7B1/10D4 data sets, super-resolution counting images were 2 × 2 binned, and motion corrected using MotionCor2. Manual and automated particle selections were performed where DoGPicker was utilized for the latter resulting in a total of 667,984 particles. Defocus values for individual particles were estimated using Gctf, and particles of low-abundance classes via 2D classification in RELION were removed. For 3D classification in RELION, a reference model of a low-resolution map of ENaC-7B1/10D4 obtained from a data set (14.4 Å) was low-pass filtered to 50 Å, and particles were classified into two classes where the major class contained 385,997 particles. Duplicates (as a result of RELION2.0 re-centering particles after 2D classification) and particles close to micrograph edges were removed, resulting in 329,180 particles that were subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> 3D classification in cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>), and 3D classification and refinement in cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). Particles belonging to the low abundance class in cryoSPARC and cisTEM were discarded yielding 244,223 and 290,007 particles, respectively. Using default settings in cryoSPARC, particles with class probability of &gt; 0.9 were used for refinement; thus, final reconstruction and refinement used 244,223 particles. For cisTEM, initial 3D classification and refinement was done using a refinement threshold of 8 Å and applying a mask during the last few iterations that excluded the constant domain (Fc) of the Fabs. During this process, we noticed that extraneous features, such as the micelle, were having a strong influence on alignment and classification, so the cisTEM particles were then re-processed using a mask that excluded both the micelle and the Fc of the Fabs, and aligned with a 5.4 Å limit. This dataset consisted of 302,263 particles and improved the resolution, as determined by the FSC = 0.143 criterion (~3.9 Å). More importantly, the electrostatic potential map was notably improved in the regions of interest. The resolutions reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> are based on the FSC = 0.143 criterion (gold-standard in the case of RELION and cryoSPARC). Final resolution reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> are solvent adjusted FSC = 0.143 criterion.

We found that the potential map in the β subunit had the best-defined feature demonstrating four β strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Based on the cryo-EM map, the P1 segments in α and γ adopt β strand-like conformations, like in the β subunit, which is also supported by the secondary structure prediction servers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). The regions between P1 and P3 in the α and γ subunits, however, are disordered in the cryo-EM map. We built stretches of residues into the P1 potential maps in the α- and γ-GRIP domains using sequence alignment with the β-GRIP domain and cryo-EM potential map features as guides.</p><p>For validation, FSC curves were calculated between the final model and the EM map as well as the two half maps generated by cisTEM.

includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure of the human epithelial sodium channel by cryo-electron microscopy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Lawrence Palmer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers are in general agreement that this is an important study that reports the first ENaC structure and provides a framework for future work on this protein. It also addresses a specific topic of interest in the field, namely the location of fragments cleaved from the α and γ subunits during proteolytic activation of the channel. Overall the work is impressive, but there are concerns that important gaps remain on technical and biological fronts.</p><p>All three reviewers were concerned about the accuracy of the current model, particularly in the membrane-spanning regions, where no glycosylation sites can be used to guide the chain fitting. However, given the significance of the structure to this field, and the potential value of having structural findings available to biochemists and physiologists working on these channels, there was consensus that the authors should have an opportunity to submit a revised version. The authors should make an attempt to include in the revised version either additional mutagenesis data, or rigorous local comparisons of the model with the density, or perhaps better 3D classification, or at least address in some depth the limitations of the atomic model reported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The TMD of the structure is poorly resolved, preventing analysis of the ion selectivity and permeation path in this region. The authors state that &quot;The TMD is not very well ordered, hampering our ability to model the TMD and assign a functional state of the channel&quot;. However, in the Abstract the authors concluded that the reported structure was in a resting state. While this conclusion may be inferred from the functional study, this statement should be tempered or removed from the Abstract. On the other hand, the 2D class average result in Figure 1E suggests that the TMD is not disordered. Based on Figure 3——figure supplement 1, the final reconstruction is from about 250k particles, which is large enough for a further 3D classification. Another round of 3D classification with a local mask on the TMD may further improve the resolution of TMD.</p><p>2) Disease-related mutations should be discussed. Since gain or loss of function mutations of ENaC are associated with severe diseases, the study will be of more general interest if the authors provide some structure-based mechanistic analysis for at least some of the disease related mutations that can be mapped onto the structure.</p><p>3) Does the ΔENaC construct localize to the plasma membrane of the oocytes? It is possible that deletion of the N- and C-termini of all the subunits eliminates important trafficking signals and prevents the protein from reaching the surface. On the other hand, if the protein does get to the surface it suggests that the structure is of a closed state of the channel. This would be nice to know.</p><p>4) The use of glycosylation sites to disambiguate the subunits in the cryo-EM map is sensible, and seems well done. However, given the modest resolution of some of these residues in the map, did the authors use an orthogonal approach to disambiguate the subunits? For example, a Western blot against the heterotetramer using 7B1 as the primary antibody would reveal to which subunit it binds, and the same could be done for 10D4.</p><p>5) It is evident that the single Fab was essential to break the pseudo-symmetry and make particle alignment possible. However, could the authors clarify why a second Fab was used in the final structure? While two Fabs in combination would have been useful for identifying the subunits, it does not seem that the Fabs were used for this purpose; rather, the glycosylation sites were used.</p><p>6) Figure 4—figure supplements 2-5 show very nice high-resolution features in the map. These features are presumably taken from the fully B-factor sharpened maps shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and not from the lower B-factor map presented in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. To orient the reader, perhaps the authors could show a larger zoomed view of the full, final sharpened map to accompany these high-resolution sub-regions. This would also help give the reader a better impression of the final map.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39340.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The TMD of the structure is poorly resolved, preventing analysis of the ion selectivity and permeation path in this region.

Nevertheless, we made great effort to resolve the transmembrane segments, including 3D classification with a local mask on either the entire TMD or the TMD segment near the intracellular side of the membrane-spanning domain. We also performed focused classification of the TMD region and signal subtraction of the ECD. Despite these efforts, we did not obtain improved resolution in the TMD region consistent with unresolvable conformational heterogeneity. We have also revised the text to state “The TMD is not well ordered, hampering our ability to model the entire TMD region and assign a functional state of the channel.” We are committed to resolving the TMD region of ENaC to understand the mechanism of ion selectivity that is vital for its role as the rate-limiting step of Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39340.036</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Selected 2D class averages of ΔENaC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The 2D class averages of ΔENaC do not show clear and continuous features representative of membrane-spanning domains.

The revised text now states, “Underscoring the importance of the wrist region and the critical roles that disulfide bridges play in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of ENaC, alterations of a conserved cysteine, α-Cys479 to an Arg, causes Liddle Syndrome due to a missense mutation that not only eliminates a disulfide bridge located at the juncture of the thumb and palm domains but also introduces a bulky positively charged residue (Salih et al., 2017) (Figure 5A).” We note that other disease-associated mutations are in regions of the channel that are not resolved or are not present in the structure reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does the ΔENaC construct localize to the plasma membrane of the oocytes?

This would be nice to know.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have carried out several experiments to define the function and localization of ΔENaC. First, we note that extensive experimentation has found no evidence for ΔENaC ion channel activity in either GnTI<sup>-</sup> HEK cells or in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. By contrast, we have measured robust Na<sup>+</sup>-selective and amiloride-sensitive current when FL-ENaC is expressed in GnTI<sup>-</sup> HEK cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B). Because HEK cells are better suited to defining whether ΔENaC trafficks to the plasma membrane, we carried out the following experiments on ΔENaC and FL-ENaC expressed in GnTI<sup>-</sup> HEK cells using confocal microscopy. To ensure robust expression, we transduced the HEK cells with baculovirus encoding the ΔENaC and FL-ENaC proteins, taking advantage of the N-terminal eGFP in the Δγ subunit and the N-terminal eGFP in all three FL subunits to visualize expression, respectively. We used wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 to label the plasma membrane of cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D). Based on eGFP fluorescence, we observed robust expression of both ΔENaC and FL-ENaC (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D). We next employed tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-labeled 10D4 mAb, an antibody that we know binds to the extracellular domain of ENaC, to probe the plasma membrane localization of ENaC channels. Indeed, we observed overlapping signals from both eGFP and TRITC-10D4 mAb in cells expressing FL-ENaC but not in cells expressing ΔENaC. Based on the confocal imaging results, we show that ΔENaC is not trafficked to the plasma membrane. We have included these results in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. We have also included text describing the results of the live confocal microscopy in the– first paragraph of the subsection “Functional characterization of ∆ENaC”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of glycosylation sites to disambiguate the subunits in the cryo-EM map is sensible, and seems well done. However, given the modest resolution of some of these residues in the map, did the authors use an orthogonal approach to disambiguate the subunits? For example, a Western blot against the heterotetramer using 7B1 as the primary antibody would reveal to which subunit it binds, and the same could be done for 10D4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made multiple, distinct efforts to identify ENaC subunits. We have used 12 sites of glycosylation and 16 Phe, Tyr and Trp residues, in addition to 11 well ordered Arg residues, all of which are subunit specific, to conclusively identify subunits in this trimeric complex. We have provided examples of differences in the palm domain between the three subunits and the corresponding positions of the aromatic and basic residues (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-F).</p><p>In addition, we have used our mAbs to independently identify the subunits. Even though the mAbs 7B1 and 10D4 recognize tertiary epitopes and thus are not robust probes for Western blotting, as described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Design and expression of ΔENaC” in the Results section and in the subsection “Generation and isolation of Fabs” in the Materials and methods section, the 10D4 antibody is weakly Western positive. By Western blot analysis we show that the 10D4 mAb recognizes a band near the 75 kDa MW marker, at a position that we have previously shown corresponds to the β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), thus providing evidence that the 10D4 mAb binds to the β subunit. We next tested whether 7B1 and 10D4 bind to homomeric FLα by FSEC and found that only 7B1 binds to homomeric FLα based on the peak shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). Together, our Western blot and FSEC results confirm our previous conclusion that 7B1 and 10D4 bind to α and β subunits, respectively. In combination with our analysis of the density maps, we have evidence to unambiguously identify the subunits in the complex.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39340.037</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The mAbs 7B1 and 10D4 bind to the α and β subunits, respectively.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blot of purified ∆ENaC probed with the 10D4 mAb.

However, could the authors clarify why a second Fab was used in the final structure? While two Fabs in combination would have been useful for identifying the subunits, it does not seem that the Fabs were used for this purpose; rather, the glycosylation sites were used.</p></disp-quote><p>Two Fabs were used because the best particle distributions and ice quality were obtained with the di-Fab complex. We nevertheless appreciate this comment and have revised the text to clarify that the use of two different Fabs versus one Fab was due to differences in grid conditions and the resulting data quality. Most importantly, we obtained superior density maps using ΔENaC in complex with Fabs 7B1 and 10D4. The revised text now states, “We monitored and compared grid conditions and the resulting data quality between the monoFab and the diFab complexes of ENaC which include ice thickness, sample quality, particle distribution, and orientation, and discovered that the diFab complex was a more promising complex for cryo-EM analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4—figure supplements 2-5 show very nice high-resolution features in the map. These features are presumably taken from the fully B-factor sharpened maps shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and not from the lower B-factor map presented in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. To orient the reader, perhaps the authors could show a larger zoomed view of the full, final sharpened map to accompany these high-resolution sub-regions. This would also help give the reader a better impression of the final map.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and provided additional figure panels in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-O as well as a video to help orient the reader.</p></body></sub-article></article>
