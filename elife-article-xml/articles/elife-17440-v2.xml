Adhesion induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, including Cas (Crk-associated substrate/p130Cas/BCAR1). However, Cas phosphorylation stimulates adhesion turnover. This raises the question of how adhesion assembly occurs against opposition from phospho-Cas. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6) and Cullin 5, two components of the CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> ubiquitin ligase, inhibit Cas-dependent focal adhesion turnover at the front but not rear of migrating epithelial cells. The front focal adhesions contain phospho-Cas which recruits SOCS6. If SOCS6 cannot access focal adhesions, or if cullins or the proteasome are inhibited, adhesion disassembly is stimulated. This suggests that the localized targeting of phospho-Cas within adhesions by CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> and concurrent cullin and proteasome activity provide a negative feedback loop, ensuring that adhesion assembly predominates over disassembly at the leading edge. By this mechanism, ubiquitination provides a new level of spatio-temporal control over cell migration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17440.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17440.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17440.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells can move in the body, for example to heal a wound, by protruding a leading edge forwards, attaching it to the surroundings and then pulling against these new attachments while disassembling the older ones. Mechanical forces regulate the assembly and disassembly of these attachments, known as focal adhesions, and so do signals from outside the cell that are transmitted to the adhesions via specialized proteins. However, it was not clear how the assembly and disassembly of adhesions is coordinated.</p><p>CRL5 is a ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme that can mark other proteins for destruction. Cells migrate more quickly if CRL5 is inhibited, and so Teckchandani and Cooper set out to uncover whether CRL5 affects the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions. The experiments showed that human cells lacking a crucial component of the CRL5 complex, SOCS6, disassemble adhesions faster than normal cells, but only at their leading edge and not at the rear.</p><p>Teckchandani and Cooper also found that SOCS6 localizes to the leading edge by binding to a focal adhesion protein called Cas. Shortly after the attachments assemble, the Cas protein becomes tagged with a phosphate group and then acts to promote the adhesion to disassemble. Further experiments indicated that Cas was marked by the CRL5 complex and possibly destroyed while in or very close to the leading edge adhesions, slowing their disassembly.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that by binding Cas, SOCS6 regulates the turnover of adhesions, specifically by inhibiting disassembly and allowing adhesions to grow at the leading edge. Since SOCS6 is not present in adhesions outside of the leading edge, this may help explain how the older adhesions are disassembled. Future studies could next focus on the exact sequence of events that occur in focal adhesions after the CRL5 complex binds to Cas as the cell migrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17440.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17440.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM109463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A ubiquitin E3 ligase localizes to focal adhesions at the front of migrating human cells where it regulates cytoskeletal dynamics by targeting a focal adhesion protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, wound healing and cancer invasion, migrating cells need to move between other cells and through the dense extracellular matrix (ECM). Cells can attach to and pull on the ECM by using integrins ‒ transmembrane receptors that link ECM outside the cell to focal adhesions (FAs) and the actin cytoskeleton inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pelham and Wang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petrie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Puklin-Faucher and Sheetz, 2009</xref>). FAs are dynamic assemblies containing many proteins held together by dense networks of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2007a</xref>). Nascent FAs (often called focal complexes) initiate when talin and other proteins associate with β integrin tails to stabilize an active integrin conformation and stimulate binding to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calderwood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>). Talin then binds actin and vinculin and actin flow exerts forces that create additional binding sites for vinculin, which in turn recruits more FA proteins and more actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>). In this way, the force generated by actin flow, resisted by the ECM, creates a positive feedback loop to stabilize and grow the adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>). In concert, force from the FA acts on actin filaments to induce the formation of contractile stress fibers and actin arcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burridge and Wittchen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Livne and Geiger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2013</xref>). The contraction of stress fibers and actin arcs provides motive power to advance the cell body. As the cell body moves forwards over an FA, the force vector is redirected and the FA remodels or disassembles, allowing the FA proteins to recycle through the cytosol for reuse at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</xref>). Inhibition of Rho kinase or myosin relaxes actomyosin tension and induces rapid FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Volberg et al., 1994</xref>). These findings support a mechanical model in which increased force drives FA assembly and reduced force stimulates disassembly.</p><p>FA dynamics are also regulated by signaling through protein kinases and small GTPases. ECM binding stimulates integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src-family kinases (SFKs). These tyrosine kinases phosphorylate several FA proteins, helping to build the FA by creating phosphotyrosine (pY) sites that bind to the SH2 domains of additional FA proteins, as well as by activating RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">2007b</xref>). Thus, FA size increases when endogenous SFKs are activated, consistent with a positive role for SFKs during FA assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>). However, other evidence suggests that SFKs stimulate FA disassembly. For example, FA size increases and FA turnover is inhibited in fibroblasts with mutations in Src, FAK, or a variety of Src/FAK substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ilic et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Volberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, FAs grow when kinase-inactive Src is over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fincham and Frame, 1998</xref>), and activated mutant Src weakens integrin-cytoskeletal interactions and accelerates FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsenfeld et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fincham and Frame, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fincham et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galbraith et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, SFKs may regulate both FA assembly and disassembly, perhaps by phosphorylating different substrates.</p><p>Cas (p130Cas, BCAR1) is an FA protein that is phosphorylated by Src when integrins engage the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fonseca et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nojima et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1995</xref>). Cell motility and invasion are stimulated when Cas is over-expressed and inhibited when Cas is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cary et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honda et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patwardhan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanders and Basson, 2005</xref>). At the molecular level, phosphorylation of Cas by SFKs induces binding to adaptor proteins Crk/CrkL and activation of the Rac1 and Rap1 GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasegawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sakai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vuori et al., 1996</xref>). Forced relocalization of CrkL to FAs stimulates migration via DOCK1 and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2003</xref>). A SFK/Cas pathway stimulates protrusive activity, inhibits stress fibers, and stimulates FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, Cas presents a paradoxical case where phosphorylation is induced by integrin engagement but stimulates FA disassembly and migration.</p><p>Interestingly, Cas is mechanosensitive. Cytoskeletal tension induces Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janostiak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tamada et al., 2004</xref>). Mechanical extension of purified Cas promotes its phosphorylation by SFKs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). Thus integrin signaling and cytoskeletal tension may increase the level of phosphotyrosine Cas (pYCas) and stimulate FA disassembly whilst simultaneously unfolding talin to promote FA assembly. This raises the question of how FA assembly and disassembly are balanced in such a way that assembly predominates near the leading edge and disassembly occurs under the cell body. Here we provide evidence that CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>, a cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase composed of cullin-5 (Cul5), Rbx2, elonginBC and suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6), inhibits pYCas-dependent FA turnover at the front of migrating epithelial cells. We find that SOCS6 is recruited to pYCas in FAs at the leading edge, and that localization of SOCS6 to leading edge FAs slows their disassembly, dependent on cullin and proteasome activity and on binding of SOCS6 to Cas and CRL5. SOCS6 is not present in adhesions under the cell body, and sustained Cas signaling may facilitate their disassembly. The results suggest that CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> targets pYCas within adhesions at the front of the cell, thereby allowing FAs to grow and provide anchorage for stress fibers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously reported that Cul5 inhibits the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent migration of MCF10A epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). Cul5-depleted cells migrate considerably faster than control cells and have an exaggerated leading lamellipodium bearing tiny FAs, few stress fibers and dynamic membrane ruffles. The increased migration requires Src, suggesting that CRL5 may negatively regulate pY proteins. CRL5 targets pY proteins through the SH2 domains of SOCS substrate receptors. Knock-down experiments suggested that different SOCS proteins regulate different aspects of migration, with SOCS6 targeting pYCas and inhibiting ruffling. We proposed that other SOCS proteins may target additional pY proteins to CRL5 for ubiquitination, and each different target may contribute to a distinct aspect of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cul5 inhibits adhesion dynamics at the leading edge</title><p>To investigate FA dynamics, we wounded monolayers of MCF10A cells that express low levels of EYFP-vinculin and allowed the cells to migrate in the absence of EGF.

We previously noted that migrating MCF10A cells contained large FAs and prominent stress fibers along the leading edge, which were lost following Cul5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>). TIRF microscopy of migrating EYFP-vinculin-expressing cells also revealed large FAs at the cell front, but also detected many much smaller FAs all across the ventral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left). Large FAs were absent from migrating cells that had been treated with Cul5 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref> for knockdown efficiency).

This software does not distinguish FAs from the smaller focal complexes, so we refer to all EYFP structures larger than 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup> (two pixels) as FAs. We extracted first-order rate constants for the assembly and disassembly phases of each FA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). The rate constants for assembly and disassembly were generally lower for front FAs of control cells than front FAs of Cul5-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). However, as expected, individual FAs were very heterogeneous. To control for technical or biological variation between experiments, we determined the median assembly and disassembly rate constants of many FAs in each of four to six experiments and then averaged these parameters across independent experiments. We found that FAs at the front and back of control cells assembled and disassembled with similar rate constants (0.012–0.013 min<sup>−1</sup> for assembly; 0.008–0.009 min<sup>-1</sup> for disassembly), suggesting that the front FAs were not larger because of increased assembly or decreased disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, there was no correlation between mean FA area and assembly or disassembly rate constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected for first-order reactions. Removing Cul5 had no effect on the assembly or disassembly of back FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). At the front, however, removing Cul5 stimulated both assembly and disassembly approximately two-fold, to ~0.029 min<sup>−1</sup> for assembly and ~0.021 min<sup>−1</sup> for disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Similar assembly and disassembly rates were measured in cells in which Cul5 was stably knocked down with shRNA targeting a different sequence, so the effect is unlikely to be off-target (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The increase in disassembly of leading edge FAs was also apparent from histograms of disassembly rate constants: the percentage of FAs with disassembly rates &lt;0.02 min<sup>−1</sup> shifted from &gt;60% to &lt;10% when Cul5 was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). While we were unable to directly measure the lifetimes of the large FAs at the front of control cells, most persisted for longer than the 3 hr duration of the movies, suggesting lifetimes exceeding 3 hr. In contrast, front FAs of Cul5-deficient cells had an average 24 min half time for assembly, 36 min stable phase, and 33 min half time for disassembly, for a total 93 min average lifetime. The longer persistence of FAs at the front of control cells may contribute to their increased size.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bershadsky et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaverina et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

We tested whether CRL5-regulated FA disassembly requires MTs. We treated cells with nocodazole to disrupt MTs and then removed nocodazole and assayed adhesion disassembly during MT regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ezratty et al., 2005</xref>). We found that nocodazole stabilized FAs in both control and Cul5-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, FAs disappeared more rapidly from Cul5-deficient cells than control cells upon nocodazole removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Stress fibers also disappeared more rapidly from Cul5-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Accelerated FA disassembly in Cul5-deficient cells was not due to faster MT regrowth after nocodazole removal because the MT cytoskeleton fully recovered in less than 15 min whether or not Cul5 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Indeed, MT plus ends, tracked with fluorescent plus-end binding-protein EB1, reached FAs in the ventral membrane within minutes of removing nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Therefore, Cul5 slows the disassembly of FAs after MTs have regrown, implying that Cul5 controls the speed of disassembly after MT targeting.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17440.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cul5 regulates microtubule-dependent FA disassembly.</title><p>Control and Cul5-deficient HeLa cells were plated on collagen IV-coated coverslips, serum-starved overnight, and incubated with nocodazole for 3 hr to induce microtubule disassembly and stabilize FAs.

However, CHC depletion only partly inhibited the more rapid FA disassembly in Cul5-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), suggesting that Cul5 inhibits a distinct mechanism of disassembly that is clathrin-independent.

Moreover, expression of CasFF, a mutant that does not bind SOCS6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>), stimulated FA disassembly regardless of the presence or absence of Cul5, while wildtype Cas only stimulated FA disassembly when Cul5 was absent and Cas15F, a mutant that cannot signal downstream, did not stimulate FA disassembly even when Cul5 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). These results suggest that SOCS6 inhibits FA disassembly dependent on binding to both Cas and CRL5. However, unlike Cul5, SOCS6 did not impact FA assembly rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting that, while an increase in pYCas (and other SOCS6 targets) is sufficient to stimulate disassembly, increased pYCas does not accelerate assembly. Other SOCS proteins may target different pY substrates for ubiquitination by CRL5 to regulate FA assembly.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17440.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>FA disassembly in migrating cells is regulated by SOCS6.</title><p>Focal adhesion dynamics of MCF10A cells migrating into a scratch wound in EGF-deficient medium, monitored using EYFP-vinculin and TIRF microscopy.

Unfortunately, stable expression of mChSOCS6WT down-regulated Cas and, perhaps as a consequence, mChSOCS6WT was not detected in FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref> and data not shown). We attempted to express the mChSOCS6LCQQ mutant, which does not stimulate Cas degradation. However, this mutant was only expressed at low level in MCF10A cells, perhaps due to instability or toxicity of the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether treating mChSOCS6WT-MCF10A cells with MLN4924, which inhibits the neddylation process required for CRL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enchev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petroski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>), might allow recovery of Cas levels and localize mChSOCS6WT to FAs. We found empirically that incubation with 5 µM MLN4924 for 6 hr followed by normal media for 2 hr allowed Cas levels to recover without disturbing FA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Under these conditions, mChSOCS6WT co-localized with vinculin in FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Remarkably, mChSOCS6WT was approximately 1.6-fold more abundant in FAs in the front 6 µm than FAs in the rest of the cell. We tested whether leading edge FAs are also enriched for pYCas. The ratio of pYCas to vinculin was approximately 3-fold higher in FAs in the front 6 µm than back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fonseca et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These results suggest that pYCas is enriched in FAs at the front of migrating cells and that SOCS6 preferentially associates with these FAs, as expected if SOCS6 binds to pYCas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SOCS6 needs access to FAs to regulate their turnover</title><p>Since both Cas and SOCS6 exchange between the cytosol and adhesions, SOCS6 could regulate Cas levels or activity in either location. Inhibition of SOCS6 or Cul5 expression slows Cas turnover, causing a 2–3-fold increase in the steady-state level of Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Accordingly, phosphorylated Cas levels in FAs increased approximately 3-fold when Cul5 expression was inhibited, especially in FAs in the front 6 µm of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since Cas exchanges rapidly between the cytosol and FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janostiak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Machiyama et al., 2014</xref>), the increase in pYCas in FAs could be secondary to the increased Cas in the cytosol. Moreover, the chronic increase in pYCas in adhesions could accelerate adhesion turnover regardless of whether SOCS6 targets Cas in the cytosol or in FAs. We therefore tested whether SOCS6 could regulate FA turnover if it was sequestered away from adhesion sites. To this end, we constructed mChS6mito, a fusion of mCherry, SOCS6 and a sequence that targets the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bear et al., 2000</xref>). mChS6mito still bound to Cul5 and to Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>), but localized to mitochondria instead of FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In the nocodazole washout assay, mChS6 rescued FA disassembly in SOCS6-depleted cells but mChS6mito did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). These results suggested that SOCS6 needs to access FAs in order to inhibit their disassembly.</p><p>We used two approaches to test whether CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> represses Cas during FA disassembly. First, we used an optogenetic approach. We used the light-regulated association between the CIBN and CRY2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>) to sequester SOCS6 away from adhesion sites during the disassembly process. We introduced two plasmids into HeLa cells from which endogenous SOCS6 had been removed with siRNA. One plasmid encoded CRY2 fused to mCherry-tagged SOCS6 (CRY2mChS6), and the second encoded CIBN fused to GFP and the mitochondrial targeting sequence (CIBNGFPmito) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In the dark, CRY2mChS6 co-localized with FAK in FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> left). In the light, however, CRY2mChS6 co-localized with CIBNGFPmito at the mitochondria and was not detected in FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> right). We then tested whether CRY2mChS6 could rescue FA disassembly using the nocodazole washout assay. Transfected cells were kept in the dark during growth and nocodazole treatment, so that CRY2mChS6 could diffuse and maintain normal levels of Cas. We then subjected the cells to light or dark conditions and removed nocodazole. The results showed that light inhibits FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). This implies that SOCS6 must have access to FAs during the disassembly process, and that the steady state level of Cas in the cytoplasm only plays a minor role.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17440.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SOCS6, Cullin and proteasome activity are required during FA disassembly</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Light-regulated localization of SOCS6.

MT-dependent FA disassembly was stimulated when MLN4924 was added an hour before and during 30 min of nocodazole removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

The results suggest that one or more CRLs and the proteasome need to be active during the disassembly process. Moreover, two hours of treatment with MLN4924 also increased FA assembly and disassembly rates at front but not back of migrating MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref>). This short exposure to MLN4924 increased pYCas levels in front but not back FAs and had no effect on total Cas levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Even though the turnover of many cell proteins is altered by MLN4924 and epoxomicin, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activities of Cullins and the proteasome are required during the process of FA disassembly. Combined with the optogenetics results, we suggest that SOCS6 regulates FA turnover locally by direct interaction with pYCas in or near FAs, and not by binding to or altering the steady state concentration of Cas or other proteins in the cytosol.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17440.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>FA turnover is inhibited by Cullin and proteasome activity.</title><p>(<bold>a,b</bold>) Focal adhesion dynamics of control and MLN4924-treated MCF10A cells migrating into a scratch wound in EGF-deficient medium, monitored using EYFP-vinculin and TIRF microscopy. 5 µM MLN4924 was added to cells 2 hr before imaging.

We find that Cul5, SOCS substrate receptors, and the proteasome regulate FA dynamics in epithelial cells. While Cul5 regulates both assembly and disassembly, one of the CRL5 substrate receptors, SOCS6, is required for disassembly but not assembly, implying that other SOCS proteins are involved in FA assembly. SOCS6 inhibits FA disassembly by binding to the FA protein Cas and to the rest of the CRL5 complex. Our results suggest that CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>, in conjunction with the proteasome, locally inhibits the SFK-Cas pathway in leading edge FAs to regulate their stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). We hypothesize that Cas ubiquitination and degradation occurs close to or in the FA, although we have not shown this directly. Without CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> or proteasome activity, FAs become unstable, stress fibers are lost and the lamellipodium becomes unstable. Therefore, feedback control through CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> organizes FA and actin dynamics at the wound edge and ensures a normal leading lamellipodium. The environment may further regulate SOCS6, CRL5 or proteasome levels or activity, providing additional inputs to modulate the mode and speed of migration. This mechanism may be important in some cancers, where decreased SOCS6 expression has been associated with aggressive disease and increased metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Letellier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In migrating fibroblasts, FA turnover depends on Src and various Src substrates, including FAK, paxillin and Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fincham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). However, this mechanism has not been reported in other cell types. We found that the SFK-Cas pathway is also required for the rapid FA turnover at the leading edge of epithelial cells in which CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup>-dependent ubiquitination has been inhibited. This suggests that removing restraints imposed by CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> from migrating epithelial cells unveils a latent mechanism more similar to that in migrating fibroblasts, in which Src and Cas, and potentially also FAK and paxillin, stimulate FA turnover.</p><p>We and others have observed that Cas phosphorylation is greatest in the large FAs at the front of normal cells and around the edge of spreading cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fonseca et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sawada et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, SOCS6 is specifically recruited to the leading edge adhesions by binding to pYCas, and our optogenetics and inhibitor experiments imply that CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> and the proteasome act at the FAs to counteract pYCas and to slow disassembly. Towards the rear, Cas is less highly phosphorylated, there is less SOCS6, and disassembly is slow regardless of SOCS6 or Cul5 activity. This suggests that the regulation of SOCS6 localization is critical for selective stabilization of FAs at the leading edge as cells migrate forwards.</p><p>Inhibition of SOCS6-CRL5 did not induce FA disassembly in cells that lack MTs. This suggests that MTs trigger disassembly by a pathway that is inhibited by SFKs and Cas. MT-induced FA disassembly requires the MT motor kinesin-1, presumably to mediate anterograde traffic along MTs towards the FA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krylyshkina et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, MTs deliver a protein complex including IQSEC1, an activator of the Arf6 small GTPase, to FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). Arf6, together with clathrin, dynein, and clathrin adaptors such as Dab2 and Numb, stimulates integrin β1 endocytosis and MT-dependent adhesion turnover in keratinocytes and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ezratty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ezratty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that MTs deliver endocytic machinery and that integrin endocytosis stimulates FA disassembly. MTs are also involved in weakening the integrin-ECM connection by delivering matrix metalloproteases to FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). However, our evidence suggests that MT-dependent integrin endocytosis is not involved in the SFK-Cas FA disassembly pathway. Clathrin-coated pits are absent from the ventral surface of the leading edge of motile glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kural et al., 2015</xref>) and were absent from the long leading lamellipodium of Cul5-deficient MCF10A cells. Moreover, clathrin knockdown inhibited the slow FA disassembly in normal HeLa cells but not the rapid FA disassembly in Cul5-deficient HeLa cells. Therefore, the MT-dependent signal for FA disassembly in Cul5-deficient cells is unlikely to involve clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The exact nature of the MT trigger for Cas-CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> regulated disassembly remains to be determined.</p><p>Other studies have implicated ubiquitination in cell migration and FA dynamics. RING protein XRNF185, which destabilizes paxillin via the proteasome, stimulates mesodermal cell migration during convergent extension in Xenopus embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iioka et al., 2007</xref>). It is not clear whether paxillin ubiquitination occurs locally in this system. On the other hand, paxillin ubiquitination is also stimulated by ubiquitin ligase RNF5, but RNF5 does not induce paxillin degradation and it slows, rather than stimulates, cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Didier et al., 2003</xref>). Other authors reported that TRIM5 stimulates paxillin turnover and increases FA disassembly. This is the opposite of the effect of CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> in inhibiting disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uchil et al., 2014</xref>). Ubiquitination may also be involved in an autophagy (ATG) pathway for FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenific et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibiting autophagy slows FA assembly and disassembly and increases FA lifetime and size. While it is unclear how autophagy stimulates FA assembly, the evidence suggests that an ATG cargo receptor, NBR1, recruits autophagosomes to FAs to stimulate FA disassembly. Interestingly, NBR1 contains a ubiquitin-binding domain, suggesting that ubiquitination may localize NBR1 to FAs during disassembly.</p><p>Perhaps our most surprising finding is that SOCS6 needs to be present in FAs, and cullins and the proteasome need to be active, to regulate FA dynamics. This implies that the localized ubiquitination and degradation of pYCas regulates FA disassembly. Localized degradation of talin by the protease calpain also triggers FA disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhatt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franco et al., 2004</xref>). However, calpain is an endopeptidase that creates specific cleavage products, and the talin fragments remain in the FA and regulate FA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis typically requires translocation of the ubiquitinated protein into the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ravid et al., 2008</xref>). Removal of Cas by this mechanism would be expected to open up sites in the FA where other Cas molecules could bind. It is known that most of the Cas in a FA exchanges with Cas from the cytosol with a very rapid (~20 s) rate constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janostiak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Machiyama et al., 2014</xref>). It seems remarkable that ubiquitination and degradation of pYCas would affect the kinetics of FA disassembly if new Cas molecules could replace degraded molecules with such speed. New approaches will be required to measure the exact sequence of events – Cas binding, phosphorylation, SOCS6 binding, ubiquitination and proteolysis – in FAs during cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>PCR amplification utilized proof-reading Phusion or Herculase enzymes and PCR amplified regions and junctions were sequenced.</p><p>pMSCVpuroEYFP-vinculin was made by amplifying murine vinculin with NotI and EcoRI primers from pLenti-H1_CAG_EYFP_C2_mVinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoku et al., 2008</xref>) and insertion into pMSCVpuroEYFP-C1.</p><p>T7-tagged SOCS and Cul5 constructs have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Teckchandani et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study that builds upon prior work by these authors that identified a role for CUL5/SOCS6 in negative regulation of cell migration by targeting phosphotyrosine proteins in focal adhesions, including Cas. Here the authors report that CUL5/SOCS6 binding to pY-Cas at the leading edge of cells promotes stability of focal adhesions. The data presented support this conclusion. The authors show that CUL5-SOCS6 functions to inhibit Cas-dependent turnover of focal adhesions at the leading edge but not the rear of migrating epithelial cells. The rates of disassembly are modestly altered ~2-fold with depletion of CUL5. These data were obtained from a number of different cell biology approaches, including image analysis, mitochondrial sequestration, and optogenetic methods. In summary, this study is potentially interesting, but the study could be strengthened by the inclusion of additional control studies and experiments to strengthen the mechanistic understanding of the role of CUL5-SOCS6.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the studies rely on the use of siRNA pools. Consequently, information about off-target actions of the siRNA is not available. It is important that key observations are replicated with 2 independent single siRNA to confirm the findings presented. Complementation studies using RNAi-resistant mutants would also be helpful.</p><p>2) The authors employ MLN4924 which inhibits all cullin-ring E3s. These studies do not establish specificity for the CUL5-SOCS6 RNAi experiments.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The selection of 200 pixels as the cut-off seems arbitrary. Is it possible to do image analysis in order to look at the distribution of puncta size across a wide range of pixel distributions?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show that depleting Cas blocks the ability of CUL5 depletion to affect focal adhesion disassembly. However, the mechanism by which Cas is involved is not elucidated in the paper. There are a number of open questions related to mechanism. What is the evidence that CUL5-SOCS6 can ubiquitinate pYCas either in vitro or in vivo? CUL5-SOCS6 can bind pYCas, but what is the evidence that it is pYCas rather than a different protein in the pYCas neighborhood that is the relevant substrate.</p><p>5) The authors show that MLN4924 does not stabilize total levels of Cas; consequently, there may only be a small pool of pYCas at the focal adhesions that is ubiquitinated and degraded.

Complementation studies using RNAi-resistant mutants would also be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concerns about possible off-target effects. We have now repeated experiments using stable knockdown with shRNA or independent pools of siRNA (sequences added to Materials and methods as <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and rescue experiments where possible.</p><p>An experiment with shRNAs against Cul5 and Cas is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Cas rescue experiments are shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>. These results suggest that the effects of Cul5 and Cas knockdown are not due to off-target actions of the siRNA.</p><p>We do not have an effective shRNA against SOCS6 at this time. However, the increase in FA disassembly but not assembly that was observed with one pool of siRNAs against SOCS6 was also detected with an independent pool of siRNAs against SOCS6 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, shows that transient transfection of mChSOCS6 rescues normal FA disassembly in the nocodazole washout assay. This rescue has been repeated as a control for transfection of a T7 SOCS6 mutant that does not bind elonginB (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). For these reasons, we believe that the SOCS6 siRNA effects are unlikely to be off-target. All the new measurements of FA assembly and disassembly rates have been added to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The authors employ MLN4924 which inhibits all cullin-ring E3s. These studies do not establish specificity for the CUL5-SOCS6 RNAi experiments.</italic> </p><p>We agree that MLN4924 inhibits all cullins and does not establish that Cullin5 is involved. We used MLN4924 as an alternative to the optogenetic approach to assess the time interval during which CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> needs to be active. MLN4924 enters cells and acts rapidly to inhibit Cullin neddylation (within 5 min in HCT116 cells, Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of Soucy et al., 2009). By using MLN4924 we could show that Cullin5 (and perhaps other cullin) activity is only needed during the FA disassembly process, and no change in the steady-state level of Cas is needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A-C</xref>). To avoid confusion regarding the use of MLN4924, we have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“As an independent approach to assess the timing of CRL5<sub>SOCS6</sub> action, we again used the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, which inhibits CRL5 and other cullin-RING E3s (Soucy et al., 2009). MT-dependent FA disassembly was stimulated when MLN4924 was added an hour before and during 30 min of nocodazole removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A similar result was obtained with epoxomicin, a proteasome inhibitor (Meng et al., 1999) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The results suggest that one or more CRLs and the proteasome need to be active during the disassembly process.”</p><p>The specificity controls for Cul5 and SOCS6 siRNA have now been added, as described in our response to point 1.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. The selection of 200 pixels as the cut-off seems arbitrary. Is it possible to do image analysis in order to look at the distribution of puncta size across a wide range of pixel distributions?</italic> </p><p>We have reworded the text associated with the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> to clarify the distribution of puncta size. The number of large puncta in the leading edge of control cells is sufficiently small (approximately 4% of the puncta) that the mean and median puncta size is not significantly affected. Instead, we show a histogram, binning puncta by size ranging from 2-25, 26-50, 51- 100, 101-150, 151-200, 201-250, and &gt;250 pixels. (These sizes are converted to μm<sup>2</sup> in the</p><p>figure: 0.05-0.625, 0.625-1.25, 1.25-2.5, 2.5-3.75, 3.75-5.0, 5.0-6.25, and &gt;6.25 μm<sup>2</sup>). This histogram reveals that &gt;60% of puncta are smaller than 25 pixels (0.625 μm<sup>2</sup>) in both cell types, and the size distributions are very similar up to ~200 pixels (5 μm<sup>2</sup>). However, above ~200 pixels there is a clear subpopulation of large puncta in control cells that is absent from Cul5- deficient cells. As the reviewer says, the cut off is arbitrary, but based on what we see. We could calculate a P value for the difference, but the hypothesis is based on the data so we prefer not to.</p><p>We assume that the larger puncta are those that attach the stress fibers we saw in fixed cells using phalloidin. As we explain in the paper, we have not distinguished focal complexes from focal adhesions in the analysis. Staining for zyxin, commonly used as a marker for focal adhesions, was uninformative in these cells.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors show that depleting Cas blocks the ability of CUL5 depletion to affect focal adhesion disassembly. However, the mechanism by which Cas is involved is not elucidated in the paper. There are a number of open questions related to mechanism. What is the evidence that CUL5-SOCS6 can ubiquitinate pYCas either in vitro or in vivo? CUL5-SOCS6 can bind pYCas, but what is the evidence that it is pYCas rather than a different protein in the pYCas neighborhood that is the relevant substrate.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise important points. We can detect Cas ubiquitination when Cas and ubiquitin are over-expressed in HEK293T cells. There is a small decrease in Cas ubiquitination (but not total ubiquitination) when Cul5 is inhibited, suggesting Cul5-dependent and –independent ubiquitination. However, this result does not address whether Cul5-dependent ubiquitination occurs in focal adhesions, which likely only contain a small subset of total Cas molecules. Perhaps, by mapping the ubiquitination site, we will be able to generate site-specific reagents that will allow us to localize Cas ubiquitination in the cell. We therefore prefer to leave this figure for a future paper. Instead, we frankly acknowledge that our model is an interpretation of the data in the modified first paragraph of the Discussion: “[…] Our results suggest that CRL5SOCS6, in conjunction with the proteasome, locally inhibits the SFK-Cas pathway in leading edge FAs to regulate their stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We hypothesize that Cas ubiquitination and degradation occurs close to or in the FA, although we have not shown this directly.…”.</p><p><italic>5) The authors show that MLN4924 does not stabilize total levels of Cas; consequently, there may only be a small pool of pYCas at the focal adhesions that is ubiquitinated and degraded. Replacement of Cas with a non-Y phosphorylatable Cas mutant might help clarify the mechanism. What is the phenotype of cells overexpressing a SOCS6 protein that does not interact with elongin B?</italic> </p><p>We tested whether Cas mutants could rescue microtubule-dependent FA disassembly when Cas was knocked down. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, wildtype mouse Cas behaves like endogenous Cas, only activating FA disassembly when Cul5 is absent. A Cas mutant that cannot signal downstream (Cas15F) does not activate FA disassembly whether Cul5 is present or absent. However, the SOCS6-binding mutant of Cas, CasFF, stimulates FA disassembly even when Cul5 is present. This suggests that a direct Cas-SOCS6 interaction is required for CRL5<sup>SOCS6</sup> to inhibit FA disassembly in migrating cells.</p><p>We also tested whether transiently-expressed point mutant SOCS6 that cannot bind ElonginB is able to rescue microtubule-stimulated FA disassembly in SOCS6-deficient HeLa cells. As shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, exogenous wildtype SOCS6 suppresses FA disassembly but the LCQQ mutant does not. These studies confirm that SOCS6-CRL5 interaction is required for suppression of FA disassembly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
