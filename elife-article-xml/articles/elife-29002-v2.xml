Aberrant expression or mutation of RasGRPs results in disease. An analysis of RasGRP1 SNP variants led to the conclusion that the charge of His 212 in RasGRP1 alters signaling activity and plasma membrane recruitment, indicating that His 212 is a pH sensor that alters the balance between the inactive and active forms of RasGRP1. To understand the structural basis for this effect we compared the structure of autoinhibited RasGRP1, determined previously, to those of active RasGRP4:H-Ras and RasGRP2:Rap1b complexes. The transition from the autoinhibited to the active form of RasGRP1 involves the rearrangement of an inter-domain linker that displaces inhibitory inter-domain interactions. His 212 is located at the fulcrum of these conformational changes, and structural features in its vicinity are consistent with its function as a pH-dependent switch.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29002.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Complex chain reactions between many kinds of molecules regulate every process in the body. For example, the signaling molecule Ras helps the cell to grow and divide. However, abnormally high levels of Ras signals can cause cancer.</p><p>Ras is activated by proteins called exchange factors. One of the families of Ras exchange factors – RasGRP – plays important roles in immune and bleeding disorders, and certain cancers. In 2013, researchers studied the structure of one of these exchange factors, called RasGRP1, while it was inactivated. Inactive RasGRP proteins have a ‘closed’ structure, which must ‘open up’ when they are activated.</p><p>Vercoulen, Kondo, Iwig et al. – who include several of the researchers involved in the 2013 study – have now investigated the regulation of various RasGRP family members. The protein structures of the active forms of two family members were determined and compared with the structure of inactive RasGRP1. In parallel, Vercoulen et al. analyzed how genetic mutations that alter some of the amino acids that make up RasGRP1 affect Ras signaling in cells. This revealed that a particular amino acid, histidine 212, plays a key role in activating RasGRP1.</p><p>Histidines can be in a positively charged or neutral form depending on other surrounding amino acids and on the acidity of the cell’s interior. The interiors of cells that receive an external signal often decrease in acidity, and cancer cells tend to have less acidic interiors than normal cells. Vercoulen et al. reveal that a change in the charge on histidine 212 from positive to neutral opens up the RasGRP1 protein. Histidine 212 therefore acts as an acidity sensor that activates RasGRP1 when the inside of the cell becomes less acidic as external signals are received.</p><p>Since RasGRP proteins play important roles in many diseases, understanding how cell acidity regulates RasGRPs has wide medical relevance. In the future, the protein structures of the RasGRP family members and the method developed in this study could be used to explore how they contribute to disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>small GTPases</kwd><kwd>RasGRP</kwd><kwd>Signaling</kwd><kwd>Structure</kwd><kwd>Lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>RasGEFs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuriyan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Roose</surname><given-names>Jeroen P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Katharine A</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vercoulen</surname><given-names>Yvonne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Ras activator RasGRP1 that impacts Ras signals in immune cells, leukemias, and colorectal cancer, switches to an active conformation aided by a pH-sensitive histidine residue in a central location of the RasGRP1 molecule.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Ras family of small G-proteins, including Ras and Rap, are molecular switches that transmit signals when bound to GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). Ras-family members are activated by specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (that we term GEFs for simplicity here), such as Son of Sevenless, that activates Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998</xref>), and Epac1 and Epac2, that activate Rap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rehmann et al., 2006</xref>). GEFs activate Ras-family members by triggering the release of GDP and its replacement by GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>). These GEFs, of which there are several distinct families in humans, activate Ras-family members in response to a variety of signals, and thereby initiate downstream kinase signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>). One family of these GEFs is comprised of the Ras guanine-nucleotide releasing proteins (RasGRPs) that can activate Ras or Rap, of which there are four in humans. RasGRP1 is most extensively studied in T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dower et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Priatel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roose et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daley et al., 2013</xref>), RasGRP2 in neutrophils and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lozano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stone, 2011</xref>), RasGRP3 in B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teixeira et al., 2003</xref>), and RasGRP4 in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). However, RasGRPs can be found in other cell types as well, including epithelial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Depeille et al., 2015</xref>). T cell receptor (TCR) or B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation leads to an increase of diacylglycerol at the membrane, protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and increases in intracellular calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myers and Roose, 2016</xref>). RasGRP1 is recruited to the plasma membrane, where it binds diacylglycerol to enable interaction with Ras. Upon receptor stimulation, RasGRP1 is phosphorylated by PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roose et al., 2007</xref>), which enhances RasGRP1’s GEF activity through unknown mechanisms. RasGRP1 contains a calcium-binding EF hand domain and calcium binding to RasGRP1 induces allosteric changes that release autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulated RasGRPs can cause aberrant signaling and result in disease.

A polymorphism (Arg 519 Gly) in <italic>Rasgrp1</italic> in mice results in T cell abnormalities and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daley et al., 2013</xref>).

Complete RasGRP1 deficiency in a patient leads to a novel primary immunodeficiency, with impaired activation and proliferation of the patient's T- and B- cells and defective killing by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roose, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salzer et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Rasgrp2</italic> deficiency in mice results in excessive bleeding, caused by defective platelets aggregation and degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crittenden et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, polymorphisms in <italic>RasGRP2</italic>, either converting Arg 113 into a stop codon, or missense mutations (Gly 248 Trp or Ser 381 Phe), cause a platelet disorder in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lozano et al., 2016</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canault et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The N-terminal portion of the RasGRPs contains the catalytic module that is common to other GEFs that operate on Ras-family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Once activated, SOS requires multiple plasma membrane-anchoring mechanisms to signal efficiently to Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Findlay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christensen et al., 2016</xref>), and SOS signaling is terminated in part via endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christensen et al., 2016</xref>). The regulation of the Rap-specific GEF Epac2 is also well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rehmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rehmann et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Much less is known about the regulation and activation of any of the four RasGRP proteins. We had previously analyzed the structural basis for the autoinhibition of RasGRP1, which is very different from that of SOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In SOS, the active site is open in the autoinhibited form, and inactivation appears principally to be the result of the blockage of allosteric Ras binding. Allosteric Ras binding causes a conformational change at the active site in SOS. In contrast, in RasGRP1, the active site is blocked by the linker connecting the Cdc25 domain to the EF domain (the Cdc25-EF linker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we proposed that dimerization of RasGRP1 through the C-terminal coiled-coil domain results in blockage of the membrane-interacting surface of the C1 domain. In the structure of autoinhibited RasGRP1, the EF and C1 domains are docked on the base of the Cdc25 domain, and this interaction steers the Cdc25-EF linker through the Ras-binding site of the Cdc25 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>). Calcium binding to the EF-hand of RasGRP1 promotes a conformational change that is likely to result in displacement of the Cdc25-EF linker from the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the EF domain plays both autoinhibitory and activating roles in regulating RasGRP1, and a point mutation in the EF domain leads to an autoimmune phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daley et al., 2013</xref>). Sequence comparisons suggest that this autoinhibitory mechanism is conserved in the three other RasGRP proteins.</p><p>By scanning and testing human single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from genome databases, we uncovered that a conserved histidine residue in the Cdc25 domain of RasGRP1 (His 212) is critical for autoinhibition. We show that the activity of RasGRP1 is sensitive to cellular pH, and that His 212 is critical for this pH sensitivity. Stimulation of lymphocytes results in an increase in intracellular pH (pHi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 1988</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mills et al., 1985</xref>), which can lead to deprotonation and conversion of histidine residues from positively charged to neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schönichen et al., 2013</xref>). We find that increasing pHi synergizes with receptor stimulation to activate the cellular RasGRP1-Ras-ERK pathway. Conversely, replacing His 212 by a positively charged lysine residue (H212K) prevents the recruitment of RasGRP1 to the membrane, presumably by stabilizing the autoinhibited form.</p><p>In order to understand the role of His 212 in regulation of RasGRP1 we sought to compare the structure of autoinhibited RasGRP1, determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>), to that of the active form in complex with Ras. We have been unable to crystallize a RasGRP1:Ras complex. Instead, we determined the structures of the catalytic modules of two other members of the family, RasGRP4 and RasGRP2, bound to nucleotide-free HRas and Rap1B, respectively. These structures reveal a key role for the REM-Cdc25 linker in determining the switch from the autoinhibited to the active states. The structure of this linker is fully resolved in the RasGRP2:Rap1B complex, and the linker conformation is incompatible with the inhibitory docking of the EF domain on the Cdc25 domain. The sequence of the REM-Cdc25 linker is conserved between RasGRP1 and RasGRP2, and we infer that the activation of the RasGRP1 involves correlated movements in the REM-Cdc25 linker and the Cdc25-EF linker. The structures show that the location of His 212 is such that the charge on this residue could alter the balance between the active and inactive states of RasGRP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human missense variants of RasGRP1</title><p>Single nucleotide variants that cause amino acid substitutions (missense variants; SNVs) are frequent and generate human genetic variation: most people inherit ∼12,000 missense gene variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecasis et al., 2010</xref>).

The docking of the EF domain maintains RasGRP1 in an inactive state in two ways. First, the Cdc25-EF linker physically blocks the active site. Second, in the autoinhibited dimer, interactions between the EF domain of one RasGRP1 molecule and the C1 domain of the other block the membrane-interacting face of the C1 domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>]).

Support for this idea is provided by experiments in which we disrupted ion-pairing hydrogen bonds formed between Arg 131 in the REM-Cdc25 linker and Asp 177 in helix B of the Cdc25 domain, in the RasGRP2:Rap1B structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We used our cellular assay to test whether mutation of the corresponding residues in RasGRP1, Arg181 and Asp228, has any effect on GEF activity. Upon mutation of the ion-pairing residues, only Arg 181 mutation to alanine (Arg 181 Ala) resulted in somewhat lower levels of basal RasGRP1 signals to P-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These mutations did not significantly impact the RasGRP1-p70S6 kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), possibly because RasGRP1 signals to S6 are relatively active in the basal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Taken together, our results indicate that formation of the ion pair between Arg 181 and Asp 228 is necessary for robust activation of RasGRP1.</p><p>Another observation that points to the relevance of this linker conformation is that PMA- or antigen receptor-induced phosphorylation of RasGRP1 at Thr 184 in the REM-Cdc25 linker, or RasGRP3 at the corresponding residue (Thr 133), is correlated with increased RasGRP activity. Mutation of these threonine residues to alanine results in reduced, but not eliminated, RasGEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aiba et al., 2004</xref>), whereas introduction of a negative charge to mimic a phosphorylated threonine results in higher activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roose et al., 2005</xref>). The corresponding residue in RasGRP2 is Thr 134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and is phosphorylated in lymphocytes analyzed by total phospho-proteomics (Dr. Doreen Cantrell, set of 11 phospho-peptides from RasGRP2, personal communication). The positioning of the REM-Cdc25 linker in the RasGRP2:Rap1B complexes places the side chain of Thr 134 close to the side chains of the positively charged Lys 172 and Arg 195 in the Cdc25 domain, which provides a possible explanation for the activating effect of phosphorylation of the threonine residue, which adds a negative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The location and environment of His 212 is consistent with a role as pH sensor</title><p>The cellular signaling results with variants of His 212, including the human SNV His 212 Tyr, and the findings that His 212 is a pH sensor, prompted us to investigate how His 212 may impact the transition between the autoinhibited and active states of RasGRP1.

In both RasGRP1 and talin the glutamate network could be part of the pH sensor with histidine.

As noted earlier, mutation of His 212 to non-titratable residues abrogates pH sensitive activation, which is also consistent with a role for this residue in pH sensing.</p><p>We propose that the configuration of residues seen in the autoinhibited RasGRP1 structure is stable when His 212 is protonated, because the concentration of negative charge in this region would favor a positively charged histidine. Neutralization of the histidine may favor disruption of the clustering of negative charge, most likely by movement of Glu 404, in the loop leading into helix J (the other four acidic residues are on the same helix as His 212, and are less likely to move away). In the active structure, the loop bearing Glu 404 packs against the REM-Cdc25 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the autoinhibited RasGRP1 structure, the REM-Cdc25 linker positions two hydrophobic sidechains (Leu 199 and Leu 200) against the hydrophobic interface formed between helix J and the EF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Release of the leucine residues, due to destabilization of the conformation of the REM-Cdc25 linker, would weaken the interface with the EF domain and help initiate a transition towards the active conformation. Consistent with this idea, we found that mutation of Glu 404 resulted in altered RasGRP1 activity, while mutation of Glu 208, located within helix A, had no effect. Replacement of Glu 404 by either alanine or arginine both resulted in increased signals to S6 but not to the less basally active RasGRP1-ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In unstimulated cells, RasGRP1 is in an inactive conformation, in which the Cdc25-EF linker prevents Ras binding to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>). In dimeric and autoinhibited RasGRP1, the EF domains from each molecule in a RasGRP1 dimer block the DAG-binding sites on the C1 domains of the dimer partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Lymphocyte receptor stimulation results in increased pHi, increased DAG levels, and increased intracelluar calcium levels, and we propose that these three signals coordinately induce a conformational change in RasGRP1. The structure of the RasGRP2:Rap1B complex that we have now determined establishes an important role for the REM-Cdc25 linker in the transition to the active state. A prominent feature in the active RasGRP2 structure is the formation of an ion-pair between Arg 131, in the REM-Cdc25 linker and Asp 177 in the Cdc25 domain (Arg 181 and Asp 228 in RasGRP1). This salt bridge and the position of the REM-Cdc25 linker reinforces the active conformation of RasGRP and is incompatible with the autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29002.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of RasGRP1 regulation.</title><p>(Left) In resting cells, RasGRP1's basal activity is autoinhibited through a dimer; the Cdc25-EF linker (red) blocks the Ras binding site, and the EF hands (purple) prevent C1 domains (cyan) from binding diacylglycerol (DAG), and thus block membrane recruitment. (Middle) Upon receptor stimulation, DAG- and intracellular calcium- levels are induced and the intracellular pH (pHi) increases, which we propose leads to deprotonation of His 212, calcium binding to the EF-hand, and initiation of a conformational change that allows for binding to DAG at the membrane.

The sequence of the REM-Cdc25 linker is divergent in RasGRP4, however, and the sequence of the EF domain indicates that RasGRP4 is unlikely to be regulated by calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reuther et al., 2002</xref>). Thus it appears that the regulation of RasGRP4 is likely to be different from that of the other three members of the family.</p><p>Our analysis of SNPs in the RasGRP proteins led to the finding that His 212 in RasGRP1 functions as a pH sensor. Receptor signaling-induced increases in pHi is expected to convert His 212 to the deprotonated and neutral form, which destabilizes the autoinhibited conformation and potentiates the activation of RasGRP1 by calcium flux and DAG formation at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). His 212 is predicted to have an increased pKa value, which is likely influenced by the adjacent cluster of glutamate residues. Supporting this idea, experimental work has shown that histidines with coordinating glutamate residues have upshifted pKa values when determined experimentally by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tishmack et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hiebler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baran et al., 2008</xref>). At this point we cannot formally rule out the possibility that other histidines in RasGRP1 also function as pH sensors. However, the fact that mutation of His 212 to non-titratable residues abrogates pH sensitive activation, strongly suggests that His 212 is essential for the pH-sensitive function of RasGRP.</p><p>Most studies describing pHi changes upon receptor stimulation in lymphocytes have been published roughly 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 1988</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mills et al., 1985</xref>). Experiments in those studies were performed under different conditions with variable outcomes. The exact effects of receptor stimulation on pHi changes in lymphocytes, and the time scales and subcellular localization of these pHi changes remain largely unknown. Likewise, many questions remain unanswered on the subcellular localization of changes in intracellular calcium and the roles of various ion channels in both resting and stimulated lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feske et al., 2015</xref>). At this point, tools to measure <italic>local</italic> changes in pHi or calcium levels are not available and how pHi and calcium may regulate signaling proteins locally is not known.

RasGRP1 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> with low micromolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwig et al., 2013</xref>), which suggest that RasGRP1 will not bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the cell is stimulated and calcium levels rise substantially. Debye-Hueckel and Gouy-Chapman models from the early 1900's proposed that ions in an aqueous environment are not evenly distributed. Local entry of calcium through channels in the plasma membrane and local increases in pHi leading to deprotonation of His 212 may provide an interesting interplay in the regulation of RasGRP1. The connection between deprotonation of His 212 and increases in pHi in stimulated lymphocytes we uncovered here motivates us to revisit these studies on pHi in lymphocytes.</p><p>More clear is the notion that increased pHi is a hallmark of cancer cells and promotes cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Webb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">White et al., 2017</xref>).

When we biochemically characterized these T-ALL cell lines with an increased level of RasGRP1 expression we noted that RasGRP1 is constitutively recruited to the membrane where it constantly exchanges the nucleotide on Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ksionda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartzell et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement, RasGRP1 demonstrates constitutive phosphorylation on Thr 184 in these T-ALL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ksionda et al., 2016</xref>) arguing that RasGRP1 spontaneously adopts an active conformation. We speculate that an elevated pHi in these cancerous T-ALL cells facilitates opening up of the overexpressed RasGRP1 leading to the constitutively high level exchange activity that we observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ksionda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartzell et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Jurkat and low level RasGRP1 expressing JPRM441 cells were previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roose et al., 2005</xref>) and described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roose et al., 2007</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Histidine pH Sensor Regulates Activation of the Ras-specificGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor RasGRP1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Lambright (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. As you see, all reviewers see the importance of this study. However, with respect to the significance of some of the measured effects questions were raised. One particular topic that was discussed among the reviewers is the issue of the pKa of His212 and effects of local pH variations within the cell. The comments were:</p><p>1) What effect does the local environment (e.g. glutamate cluster, solvent exposure) have on the pKa of HIs 212? Is its pKa likely to be different from the usual solvent-exposed value (ca. 6, which is well below the pH range manipulated in the cell-based experiments) and, if so, how might this relate to the proposed pH-sensor mechanism?</p><p>2). Related to the question above: do other histidine residues potentially contribute to the observed pH effect?</p><p>3) The intracellular pH can be quite different from the bulk intracellular pH depending on the organelle and location. For example, the nucleus is thought to have a higher pH. Likewise it is discussed that the high amount of negative charge at the membrane results in a locally lower pH by having a locally higher H<sup>+</sup> concentration according to Debye-Hueckel and Gouy-Chapman models. This could inhibit activation under normal conditions. However, release of calcium might replace the H<sup>+</sup> near the membrane, resulting in the required rise in pH. Calcium release might therefore have a dual role. It is difficult to measure such localized pH values but such effects should be discussed.</p><p>In principle all the reviewers think that determining the pKa of His212 and investigating the effect of local pH values would be important to validate the proposed mechanism. However, the reviewers also realize that this would be very difficult or even impossible with the techniques currently available. Nevertheless the reviewers think that these issues should be discussed and the proposed model be adapted.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>RasGRPs are highly regulated GEFs that exist in 'inactive' and 'active' conformations. Activation of RasGRPs requires release of autoinhibitory interactions, including the rearrangement of an inter-domain linker. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are a common genetic variation, giving rise to differences in single nucleotide changes. In this study, the authors analyzed RasGRP1 SNP variants and identified a conserved histidine (212) in the Cdc25 catalytic domain that appears critical for RasGRP1 autoinhibition. Biochemical and cell biology experiments are conducted to evaluate whether the activity of RasGRP1 is sensitive to cellular pH via modulation of the charge state of His 212. The previously published structure of autoinhibited RasGRP1 combined with new X-ray structures of active RasGRP4 complexed to HRas and RasGRP2 complexed to Rap1b, aided in delineating the role of this histidine in RASGRP1 autoinhibition in vitro and in cells. Based on results from these studies, the authors propose that His212 acts as a pH sensor that controls conformational changes important for activation of RasGRP1.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the y-axes for panels E and F are ambiguous, and it is unclear what is being measured. Is this a ratio of phospho-signal relative to untransfected readings? Or an absolute measurement/count based on flow cytometry? If a ratio, why are the WT signals not starting at a 1.0 ratio? Additionally, panel E would suggest much higher signal for p-S6 over p-ERK, yet panel F shows a range of 0-25 for p-ERK but only 0-3 for p-S6. Was a Western blot done on cell lysates to confirm that the flow cytometry signals correspond increased p-ERK and p-S6?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>, it is not convincing that H212T/A mutants show increased signaling over WT, even at &quot;high&quot; expression levels.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the opposite trend in signaling induction from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is observed, in which p-ERK levels increase 7-9 fold, yet p-S6 only increases 2-3 fold. Some discussion is needed here, considering that p-ERK was indicated as being less potent for this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Further, the shift observed in the flow signal for p-ERK seems very large for just an increased induction of MAPK signaling, perhaps indicating non-specific effects. Western blot analysis may help to clarify this concern. The range of changes seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B-E</xref> are very modest at best. What do these signaling outputs look like in cells expressing &quot;high&quot; levels of RasGRP1?</p><p>Images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> indicating RasGRP localization are not of high quality, so it remains questionable whether there is potent membrane localization. Were these images acquired on &quot;low&quot; expressing RasGRP1 cells? If so, the expression already seems extremely high. Matching images are not provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. It is unclear how the binning is done for plasma membrane vs. cytoplasmic RasGRP. Supporting images are needed.</p><p>4) The importance of ion pairs is typically analyzed by mutating both amino acids individually (as the authors have done) and by a charge swap experiment in which the two amino acids are exchanged in a double mutant (with the expectation that the active is not changed compared to wild type). Has such a charge swap experiment been done?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, why was NH4Cl dosage used as a standard for increasing pHi over PMA + ionomycin treatment? As intracellular pH lowering can lead to induction of cell death pathways, it is unclear why markers of cell death/apoptosis were not used, especially given the flow cytometry-based platform that is in place. While much of the data in this paper do not show statistically significant changes, panels 4H and 4I do show increases and decreases respectively across H212 mutation status -/+ EIPA pre-treatment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and 4C</xref> may be more suitable for supplemental materials.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The SNVs results are reported for the RasGRP1 isoform. Are structures for autoinhibited states of RasGRP2 or RasGRP4 available that can be compared to RasGRP1, or are the assumptions/predictions primarily made off of sequence homology? While a paper is cited to address the high similarity between different RasGRP isoforms, a careful sequence alignment and comparison of RasGRPs would be helpful.</p><p>7) Given the data for the phospho-mimetic mutation at T134 in RasGRP1, was this mutation made in the RasGRP2/4 GEFs being crystallized in this paper?</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, the changes in phospho-protein levels do not appear to significantly change with E404A/R mutation. Further, why just E404? Based on earlier statements, mutation-scanning at the other Glu residues mentioned should be considered. Have such mutations been investigated?</p><p>Regarding the negatively charged patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-E</xref>), E211 may have significant contribution considering its positioning before H212.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29002.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comments were:</p><p>1) What effect does the local environment (e.g. glutamate cluster, solvent exposure) have on the pKa of HIs 212?

In the original version we already made the comparison between RasGRP1 and talin, which both have clusters of glutamate around the Histidine pH sensor.</p><p>Since RasGRP1CEC construct has molecular weight of 64 kDa, and 18 histidine residues, NMR approaches would be too ambitious to take. Instead, we used a web server to calculate the estimated pKa of His212 in RasGRP1. We estimated the pKa values of the histidine sidechains in RasGRP1, using continuum electrostatics as implemented in a web-based server for the program DELPHI. Using the crystal structure of the cdc25 domain of RasGRP1, the pKa value of His 212 is calculated to be 6.90, i.e., increase by almost 1 pH unit above the pKa value of an isolated histidine (6.0). His 212 has the highest calculated pKa value among the nine histidines in the cdc25 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the pKa value of His 212 is reduced significantly when one or more of the four glutamate sidechains located nearby, in helix A, are substituted by alanine.</p><p>We have now included this table as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. These analyses support the notion that protonation state of His212 in RasGRP1 is sensitive to pH change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2). Related to the question above: do other histidine residues potentially contribute to the observed pH effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot formally rule out the possibility that other histidines in Rasgrp also function as a pH sensor. However, His 212 has the highest calculated pKa value among the nine histidines in the cdc25, indicating that it is primed to convert from positive to neutral when the intracellular pH increases beyond a neutral value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the cellular experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H and 4I</xref> that show that mutation of His212 to non-titratable residues abrogates pH sensitive activation combined with the newly added table demonstrating that His212 likely has an upshifted pKa, strongly suggest that His 212 is the major pH sensor and alterations in pH do not lead to Rasgrp1-dependent signaling effects when His 212 is mutated. We added a few sentences regarding this point to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The intracellular pH can be quite different from the bulk intracellular pH depending on the organelle and location.

Indeed, influx of calcium may replace the protons and serve a dual role in activating RasGRP1 by (i) binding to the EF hands and (ii) resulting in a local increase in pH. It’s also been postulated that there is an enrichment of calcium ions near the negatively charged polar headgroups of phospholipids in the plasma membrane. This is however all very speculative and we have no data to support these ideas.</p><p>We have added a more neutral paragraph to the Discussion that it will be of interest in the future to understand the balance between protons, local pH, and local influx of calcium ions and what impact these make in the regulation of RasGRP1 (and other signaling molecules).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the y-axes for panels E and F are ambiguous, and it is unclear what is being measured.

We attempted to see the activating effect of the mutation with in vitro nucleotide exchange experiments. However, we could not see clear difference in the activities between wildtype and the mutant. The lack of clear phenotype is possibly caused by our truncated construct of RasGRP1, but we have not been able to prepare full-length proteins of RasGRP1 to test the activity yet. Also, we have not been able to produce RasGRP2 and RasGRP4 CEC constructs. Because of these technical problems, we have not been able to test the phospho-mimetic mutation in RasGRP2 and RasGRP4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, the changes in phospho-protein levels do not appear to significantly change with E404A/R mutation. Further, why just E404? Based on earlier statements, mutation-scanning at the other Glu residues mentioned should be considered. Have such mutations been investigated?</p></disp-quote><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> (P-ERK) indeed there were no significant changes, possibly due to the fact that basal PERK is very low in these cells in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> we see significantly increased levels of phosphorylated S6, indicated by asterisks. To improve clarity, we now show the ratios for only RasGRP1-EGFP low expressing cells, and moved the current figures to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> supplement (A and B). We also tested Glu208 mutants. However, this did not show any significant changes.
