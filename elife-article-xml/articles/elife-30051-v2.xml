These obligatory structures exposed to the host immune system provide important targets for rational vaccine design. Here, we use a systematically designed series of multi-domain constructs in combination with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine the structure of the main immunoreactive region from a major antigen from <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic>, LigB. An anti-LigB monoclonal antibody library exhibits cell binding and bactericidal activity with extensive domain coverage complementing the elongated architecture observed in the SAXS structure. Combining antigenic motifs in a single-domain chimeric immunoglobulin-like fold generated a vaccine that greatly enhances leptospiral protection over vaccination with single parent domains. Our study demonstrates how understanding an antigen’s structure and antibody accessible surfaces can guide the design and engineering of improved recombinant antigen-based vaccines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30051.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Vaccines encourage the immune system to develop a protection against disease-causing bacteria and viruses. Some types of immune cells release antibodies, which recognize particular proteins on the surface of the invading microbe. A vaccine that contains these surface proteins allows immune cells to develop the antibodies that can help to fight off an infection at a later date. Studying the shape and structure of the surface proteins can reveal how they are detected by our immune systems and can further be used to design more effective vaccines.</p><p>Leptospirosis is the most common bacterial disease to affect both humans and animals. The symptoms of the disease include fever, muscle pain and bleeding from the lungs. New vaccines against leptospirosis are desperately needed because current ones have severe side effects and do not fully protect against the disease. The most promising new vaccine candidates are the Lig proteins, which are found on the surface of leptospirosis causing bacteria cells, but little was known about their molecular structure.</p><p>The region of the Lig protein that is recognized by the immune system consists of a series of twelve connected ‘immunoglobulin-like’ domains. Hsieh, Ptak et al. used X-ray scattering to determine the structure of this region and found that the protein is highly elongated. Additional experiments showed that the individual domains provoke immune responses to different extents. Antibodies that can interact more strongly with the Lig protein were also better able to kill the bacteria. Based on this information, Hsieh, Ptak et al. combined parts of the individual domains that bind strongly to antibodies to design a new protein that, when used as a vaccine, protected hamsters against leptospirosis much better than other Lig protein-based vaccines.</p><p>Further engineering and testing are required to develop an optimized, commercial leptospirosis vaccine, but the work of Hsieh, Ptak et al. shows the effectiveness of structure-based vaccine design methods. In the future, similar methods could be used to develop better vaccines and treatments for other infectious diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LigB structure</kwd><kwd>mAb accessibility</kwd><kwd>vaccine design</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Advanced Technology (CAT) program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>478-3400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yung-Fu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biotechnology Research and Development Corporation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>478-9355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yung-Fu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The antibody accessibility of the leptospiral surface protein, LigB, provides a guide for the rational design of improved recombinant chimeric vaccine antigens displayed on a single domain scaffold.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular details of how surface antigens of a pathogen are exposed to the host’s defenses are highly relevant to rational vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rappuoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dormitzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dormitzer et al., 2008</xref>). The structural context of immunologically accessible epitopes allows for the redesign of recombinant vaccine scaffolds to display the most antigenic surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Correia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malito et al., 2014</xref>). The exploration of recombinant strategies can be particularly fruitful when classical vaccine strategies provide weak protection. Currently available inactivated vaccines against leptospirosis, the most common bacterial zoonosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Picardeau, 2017</xref>), are inadequate because of the severe side-effects and lack of cross-protection among pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grassmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2015</xref>). Because the estimated worldwide burden of leptospirosis is over 1 million severe cases and ~60,000 deaths per year, advances in recombinant leptospiral vaccines are desperately needed and are likely to benefit from a structure-based antigen design strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Picardeau, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While several leptospiral antigens have been explored for use in vaccines, the most promising candidates have been derived from the <italic>Leptospira</italic> immunoglobulin-like (Lig) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grassmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). Lig proteins are present in only pathogenic species with LigB (but not LigA or LigC) being found in all pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McBride et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsunaga et al., 2003</xref>), LigB’s expression during host invasion further suggests an important role in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lessa-Aquino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choy et al., 2007</xref>). To promote infection, LigB can bind multiple blood factors and extracellular matrix molecules (ECMs) to facilitate immune system evasion and tissue colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vieira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figueira et al., 2011</xref>). The persistence and exposure of LigB on the leptospiral outer membrane during infection leaves an exploitable vulnerability. Recently, a hamster immunization study has suggested that LigB-derived vaccines have the potential to confer sterile immunity against leptospiral challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>). The new study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>) is inconsistent with earlier LigB vaccine studies which only confer partial protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2007</xref>) and raises the possibility of further improvements in LigB-derived vaccine efficiency through rational design.</p><p>Our understanding of the LigB structure is limited to the NMR structure of the individual Lig protein Ig-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ptak et al., 2014</xref>). LigB is attached to the leptospiral outer surface by a short N-terminal anchor, which is followed by a stretch of twelve consecutive Ig-like domains, and flanked at its C-terminus by an additional non-Ig-like domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Most host interactions with Lig protein have been identified within the Ig-like domain regions and previously reported LigB-based vaccines have targeted the Ig-like domain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2009a</xref>). A more comprehensive understanding of the domain arrangement would provide a picture of the most accessible antigenic regions and a guide for structure-based vaccine design.</p><p>In this study, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skou et al., 2014</xref>) was used to obtain a low-resolution solution structure of the Ig-like domain region’s architecture. The full LigB Ig-like domain region’s extended arrangement with notable bends encouraged the exploration of the highly-exposed surface for immunoreactivity with a library of anti-LigB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The capability of these mAbs to bind antigen and to adhere to the surface of pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> was then correlated with their ability to kill these bacteria in the presence of serum complements. Finally, the identified mAb-reactive domains and previously obtained LigB12 (LigB 12th Ig-like domain) NMR structure informed the generation of chimeras on single Ig-like domain scaffolds capable of eliciting an immune response with either side of the β-sandwich domain. To illustrate the potential for rationally engineered antigens, a vaccine containing the chimera LigB10-B7-B7, which displays identified mAb-interacting surfaces from LigB7 and LigB10, offered greatly improved protection over LigB7 and LigB10 against leptospiral lethal challenge in hamsters. These findings provide a blueprint for combining immunoreactivity mapping from an mAb library and high-resolution structural information from NMR to engineer epitopes and improve the efficacy of LigB vaccines as well as recombinant vaccines from other pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extended structure of the LigB Ig-like domain region</title><p>To determine the architecture of the twelve Ig-like domain stretch in LigB, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to generate low-resolution solution structures along a sliding multi-domain window.

The last two structures (LigB7-11 and LigB8-12) have scores of 1.7 and 1.4 respectively, which indicates the potential for shape ambiguity. Each of the eight 5-domain SAXS envelopes exhibited distinct structures with a variety of domain-domain angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). A significant degree of bending is present between the first three domains. The stretch of domains between LigB3-6 is particularly straight. Slight bending in the angle between domains in the final five domain stretch produces a gentle spiral shape. By aligning the bends in the four shared domains of neighboring 5-domain regions, a best fit structure was generated for the full twelve Ig-like domains of LigB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall the LigB1-12 structure is only 16% shorter than a fully extended model structure of twelve folded domains. The SAXS-derived structure of LigB1-12 demonstrates that most of the individual Ig-like domains exhibit a high degree of exposed surface area and suggests a high degree of accessibility to host interactions. The extensive exposed surface area is a consequence of the unexpected rigid, rod-like structure, with several well-defined kinks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Creation of mAb libraries against LigB</title><p>To explore the exposure of the LigB Ig-like domain region to a host immune response, two purified LigB truncations, LigB1-7 and LigB7-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), were used to generate two sets of hybridoma cell lines for mAb production: library C (24 mAbs) and library V (36 mAbs), respectively.

The broad mAb accessibility of LigB Ig-like domains supports the extended organization of the LigB1-12 SAXS structure. The LigB structure’s domain-domain arrangement is summarized in 3-domain segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The properties for each mAb have been correlated in plots of K<sub>D</sub> vs. LD<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) or FACS cell binding vs. LD<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Additionally, the mAb data points are colored to signify the mAb’s LigB segments binding specificity. A trendline for K<sub>D</sub> vs. LD<sub>50</sub> scatter plots using all data and excluding the two statistically-determined outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) yields correlations with R²=0.508 and R²=0.773, respectively. Antibodies specific to each of the four LigB segments are near the trendline. Thirteen anti-LigB mAbs were also tested for <italic>Leptospira</italic> surface binding ability. When plotted against LD<sub>50</sub>, FACS-derived cell binding values fit to a trendline with an R²=0.312 and the single outlier-adjusted trendline of with an R²=0.466 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In both plots, near-trendline mAbs with specificity to the LigB1-3 and LigB4-6 segments have a relatively high binding ability and low LD<sub>50</sub> and correlated mAbs with specificity to the LigB7-9 segment have a relatively low binding ability and high LD<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>Because mAbs that do not fit the predicted correlation between binding affinity and bactericidal activity have the potential to inform vaccine studies, the bases for outlier discrepancies were examined further. Only one outlier, C12, displays enhanced bactericidal activity above what would be expected based from binding correlations. While C12 displays some specificity for the straightest segment (LigB4-6), it can bind to two single domains (LigB4 and LigB6) as well as a double domain in the segment LigB1-3. Further, an additional ELISA assay found that C12 is the only library C mAb that can also bind to LigB7-12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ability of C12 to bind to multiple Ig-like domains covering a large range of the Ig-like domain regions suggests a reason for the increased bactericidal activity relative to C12’s binding affinity. The only outlier with bactericidal activity below expected is C23 which binds to LigB2-3. These domain neighbors exhibit the sharpest interdomain bend suggesting that steric limitations can differentially effect LigB binding and bactericidal activity. Indeed, the kinked structure of C23’s target domain may decrease the rate for C23 to initiate bacterial killing relative to its K<sub>D</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Overall, the link between antigen binding and bactericidal activity complements the highly accessible extended structure of LigB with highly accessible regions having the potential to yield high bactericidal mAbs. The high degree of correlation between antigen-mAb binding and bactericidal activity supports the hypothesis that a mAb’s ability to kill a pathogen can be determined by its antigen-specific binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LigB Ig-like domain chimeras identify epitopes on each side of the 3-D fold</title><p>To provide proof that a single Ig-like domain can act as a scaffold to display multiple protective epitopes, the binding epitope for anti-LigB mAbs was more specifically mapped to a surface within individual Ig-like domains.

The chimera LigB10-B7-B7 (β-strands A-C: B10 and β-strands C′-F and G-G′: B7) was chosen as the best candidate for animal studies because the chimeric domain possesses the ability to bind highly bactericidal mAbs specific to each parent domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The immunized hamsters were further examined for histopathologic changes of livers, kidneys and lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Except for one apparently normal hamster from PBS group, all other hamsters from PBS, LigB7 and LigB10 immunization groups presented severe clinical signs and prominent macroscopic lesions on spirochete-targeted organs (e.g. multifocal pulmonary ecchymoses, icteric liver and enlarged kidney). Lung lesions included thickening of alveolar septa due to edema, interstitial leukocytes infiltration, endothelial cell swelling, and extensive hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Leptospira-infected livers were infiltrated by various inflammatory cells, indicating moderate to severe hepatitis.

In addition, Ig-like domains from LigB are currently some of the strongest recombinant protein-based vaccine candidates in protecting hamsters from lethal challenges although discrepancies in effectiveness suggest that vaccine redesign efforts could help to create an improved vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 2015</xref>). This study provides new information regarding the architecture and accessibility of the main host-interacting region of LigB. The elongated structure presents insight into the mechanism of Lig protein adhesion, but, more importantly, an analysis of the mAb exposed regions and lack of long range inter-domain interactions has provided guidance for the optimization of recombinant leptospirosis vaccines using homologous Lig protein domains.</p><p>The domain arrangement of the LigB1-12 Ig-like domain region was determined using low resolution SAXS structures. The SAXS-derived LigB1-12 structure provides a visual depiction that complements the more therapeutically applicable information from mAb accessibility. The domain accessibility predicted by the LigB architecture also suggested that including the full set of Ig-like domains as antigens for mAb library generation was likely to be worthwhile. While previous SAXS studies have generated composite multi-domain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffries et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>), the full LigB structure is the first example of using a sliding window of medium length, 5-domain constructs to generate a much longer 12-domain structure. The advantage of using a sliding window is that the high level of redundancy within the 5-domain structures allows for an increased accuracy in orienting and positioning the segments relative to each other. The sequence of domains LigB1-6 is identical to LigA domains 1–6 so the SAXS structure provides a partial structure of the LigA Ig-like domain region. While LigA is not present in all pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> species, LigA-based vaccines, like LigB-based vaccines, enhance immunity to leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palaniappan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faisal et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant antigen-based vaccine technologies are the most promising avenue for the development of optimized protective strategies against leptospirosis. In recombinant antigen design, the basic antigen scaffold must present a native and well-folded epitope to the immune system while a minimized antigen can eliminate nonessential, disruptive features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kulp and Schief, 2013</xref>). Examples of vaccines against different variants of <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> and Lyme disease <italic>Borreliae</italic> have been generated from chimeric recombinant antigens and have been capable of inducing broad spectrum bactericidal mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Earnhart and Marconi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scarselli et al., 2011</xref>). Ig-like domains are found in a variety of prokayotic and eukaryotic extracellular proteins and readily fold to their native structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodelón et al., 2013</xref>). By incorporating various epitopes onto a homologous scaffold, the overall structural integrity of the antigenic surface can be maintained on the chimeric LigB Ig-like domain construct. Based on the high resolution LigB12 structure, each of the three chimeric segments encompassed a 900 to 2000 Å<sup>2</sup> surface and could potentially make a full conformational epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ptak et al., 2014</xref>). While only two of three LigB chimeric segments were able to present as a full epitope experimentally, the third segment was required for binding by several of the mAbs. Indeed, initial experiments suggest that a redesigned chimera can harbor three separate epitopes on a single LigB Ig-like domain scaffold. Interestingly, the single domain LigB10-B7-B7 provides better protection to hamsters than two longer constructs, LigB7-12 (which provided poor protection) and LigB1-7 (which provided good protection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) were constructed on the vector pET28-His-Sumo between BamHI and HindIII (or XhoI) restriction enzyme sites as previously

The constructed plasmids containing LigB genes were transformed to <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta strain and the protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20 ˚C for 16 hr. After the cells were lysed using a high-pressure cell disruptor, the cell lysates were spun down and the supernatants were purified by Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The His-Sumo tagged LigB proteins were eluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, 1.8 mM potassium phosphate) containing 300 mM imidazole and then digested with Sumo protease Ulp-1 while dialyzing against PBS buffer at 4 ˚C overnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manford et al., 2010</xref>). Afterwards, the digested proteins were applied to a second Ni-NTA resin to remove the His-Sumo tag, and the untagged proteins were collected in the flow-through fraction. To gain higher protein purity, the untagged Lig proteins were further separated from other contaminates by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) Superdex75 (GE Healthcare), resulting in only one major species migrating on SDS-PAGE. For secondary structure analysis, circular dichroism (CD) spectra of LigB proteins were measured on an Aviv 202–01 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) and predicted secondary structure composition was obtained using BeStSel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Micsonai et al., 2015</xref>). Chimeric LigB5/LigB12 and LigB7/LigB10 constructs were created by overlapping extension PCR to produce all six possible swapped genes from three protein segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The three segments, strand A-C, strand C′-F and strand G-G′, and specific residue boundaries were identified based on the high-resolution NMR structure of LigB12 (PDB ID 2MOG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ptak et al., 2014</xref>) and the sequence alignment of parent domains. The percent identity matrix for the set of Ig-like domains was obtained using the EMBL-EBI web service Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McWilliam et al., 2013</xref>). After ligation into pET28-Sumo vectors, the selected positive constructs were isolated from kanamycin resistant colonies and confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>SAXS construct window optimization</title><p>Constructs corresponding to two, five and eight domains were generated to identify the optimal domain number required to obtain useful SAXS-derived envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The 8-domain long construct (LigB5-12) failed to generate envelopes with distinct domain regions representative of possible 8-domain structures. High average normalized spatial discrepancy (NSD) values for a reconstruction indicate increased variability among the trial models used to build the final envelope. Increasing average NSD with longer constructs may reflect a wider range of conformations expected with longer chains but additional factors could influence NSD statistics for longer constructs. The maximum diameter of a model is limited by the minimum q value measured in the scattering profile, as dictated by the Shannon Limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Putnam et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, for these experiments, q_min = 0.1 implies that models can be no longer than pi/0.1 = 314 Å, under ideal conditions. In reality, minor aggregation and noise at low q may also place additional limits on model length. Mylonas and Svergun have also shown that reconstructions of long rods are not as reliable as more compact structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mylonas and Svergun, 2007</xref>). For these reasons, we have chosen to assemble a full-length model from shorter overlapping constructs. SAXS envelopes derived from two or five sequential domains were generally comprised of distinct domain regions and accurately reflected the number and size of expressed domains. Of the 2- and 5-domain structures, only the envelopes of five sequential domains provided the relative orientation of multiple neighboring domains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Small angle X-ray scattering</title><p>LigB-derived proteins were exchanged into PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and concentrated to 12–20 mg/ml as assessed by absorption at UV<sub>280</sub>. SAXS data for individual samples was measured for 15 scans at 1×, 2/3×, and 1/3 × protein concentrations after dilution with PBS buffer and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Capillary cells were robotically loaded with 30 μL samples from a 96 well-plate maintained at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>). Between each sample, the capillary cell was thoroughly washed with detergent and water and then dried with air. All SAXS experiments were collected at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)’s F2 or G1 beamline using a dual Pilatus 100 K-S SAXS/WAXS detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acerbo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skou et al., 2014</xref>).

The GNOM program from the ATSAS suite was used to determine P(<italic>r</italic>) plots. Optimal Rmax was determined by screening at 5 Å intervals and the P(<italic>r</italic>) plots were normalized to the first peak. Profiles best representing the dilute (ideal) solution limit were used to generate <italic>ab initio</italic> models with DAMMAVER and DAMMIF programs from the ATSAS suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petoukhov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volkov and Svergun, 2003</xref>). 10 initial models were used to calculate the final model. Models with a normalized spatial distribution &gt; mean + 2*standard deviation were treated as outliers and not included in determining the final model. No more than one model was excluded for each structure. Model uniqueness was evaluated using the AMBIMETER program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petoukhov and Svergun, 2015</xref>). AMBIMETER score ranges &lt; 1.5 indicate a unique ab initio shape determination, 1.5–2.5 indicate some potential for alternate solutions, and &gt;2.5 indicate that multiple shape solutions will fit the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Monoclonal antibody (mAbs) production</title><p>A 5 mg total of LigB1-7, and separately 5 mg of LigB7-12, was used to immunize and boost the antibody production from five BALB/c mice. Hybridoma clone generation was conducted in the laboratory of Dr. William Davis (fee-for-service) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Standard ELISA assays were used for in-house screening of the hybridoma clones for positive supernatants. A total of 24 clones of IgG-type mAbs against LigB1-7 (library C; Lig protein <underline>C</underline>onserved region) and 36 clones of IgG-type mAbs against LigB7-12 (library V; Lig protein <underline>V</underline>ariable region) were generated. Each library produced 9 mAbs which were found to be of moderate to high binding efficiency and utilized for further characterization. Purification of mAbs was conducted by protein A/G chromatography (Pierce) using the manufacturer-recommended procedure with minor modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eliasson et al., 1989</xref>). Briefly, the hybridoma supernatant was dialyzed against the binding buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.0) overnight at 4 ˚C. The dialyzed sample was applied to a protein A/G column (pre-equilibrated with binding buffer). After washing with 10–15 ml of binding buffer to remove the unbound fraction, the bound mAb was eluted with 100 mM glycine at pH 3.0 and neutralized immediately with 1 M Tris at pH 9.0. The eluate containing mAb was dialyzed against PBS buffer at pH 7.0, concentrated to 3–4 mg/ml, and stored at −80 ˚C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ELISA binding assay</title><p>LigB-binding mAbs were selected using an ELISA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp, ThermoFisher Scientific) were coated with 1 μg of LigB1-7 or LigB7-12 in coating buffer (0.2 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.4) at 4˚C overnight. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS buffer for 1 hr, hybridoma supernatants were prepared at 1/500 dilutions and individually applied to LigB-coated wells for initial screening. To obtain dissociate constants, selected mAbs with moderate to high binding affinity to LigB were serially diluted in PBS (0.00686, 0.0137, 0.0412, 0.123, 0.370, 1.11, 3.33 and 10 µM) and then individually applied to LigB-coated wells. Between each step, PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) was used to wash the plates for three times. Subsequently, anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with HRP (1:5000, Invitrogen) was added to detect the binding of mAbs presented in hybridoma supernatants. Finally, 100 μl of TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL) was applied to each well, the optical density of which was recorded at 630 nm by ELx808 Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek). OD<sub>630</sub> values represent the mean of three independent trials ± the standard deviation. For each trial, samples were assayed in two replicates.</p><p>For examining the domain specificities of mAbs, single domain LigB fragments (LigB1 to LigB12), double domain LigB fragments (LigB1-2 to LigB11-12, excluding LigB5-6), positive control (LigB1-7, LigB7-12), or negative control (BSA) were coated with a fixed concentration (1 μg/well) on the ELISA plates. Each mAb against LigB1-7 or LigB7-12 was then added to corresponding single-domain or double-domain LigB coated wells. For binding analysis of each chimera, the set of six chimeric LigB proteins plus the two parent LigB proteins were coated on the ELISA plates (1 μg/well). Each mAb with activity against either of the two parent LigB proteins was screened for binding activity on the LigB coated wells. For measuring the antibody responses triggered by LigB-based recombinant vaccines, sera from hamsters immunized with LigB7, LigB10 and LigB10-7-7 were collected at different time points (pre-immunization, post-immunization and post-booster). Then, these serum samples (1:500) were added to corresponding LigB Ig-like domain coated wells (1 μg/well), and also applied to LigB12 coated wells (negative control). Finally, anti-hamster IgG or IgM antibody conjugated with HRP (1:1000, KPL or SouthernBiotech) was used to detect the LigB-bound antibodies from hamster sera. All single and double domain ELISA experiments including single chimeric domain experiments were conducted in three trials, the mean ±S.D. of which were shown in bar charts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Surface binding of mAbs to live leptospira by flow cytometry</title><p><italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> freshly harvested from hamsters challenged with serovar Pomona or overnight NaCl-treated low passage <italic>Leptospira</italic> were prepared in PBS buffer containing 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extended structure of a <italic>Leptospira</italic> antigen offers high bactericidal antibody accessibility amenable to vaccine design&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic bacterial infection that can cause serious disease in both animals and humans and can be refractory to treatment. Prevention is hampered by the fact that current vaccines are only partially effective. The work by Hsieh, et al., uses structural information of the immunoglobulin-like domains of a common <italic>Leptospira</italic> coat protein, LigB, to rationally design a recombinant multi-epitope antigen that appears to provide superior protection that either the full-length proteins or its individual domains. The present manuscript represents a dizzying amount of work, including comprehensive SAXS analysis of the multi-domain LigB protein and generation and characterization of two mAb libraries against LigB domains. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and easy to parse. Some questions, however, should be clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors make a point of highlighting the importance of the SAXS data to their design efforts, in reading the paper, it seems that the NMR structures of the individual domains were really the drivers (i.e., it really seems that the recombinant antigen could have been designed with only the NMR structure and the ELISA data). If the authors are presenting this as a roadmap to others, they might either better explain how the SAXS data really were critical, or change their language a bit.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, is it really appropriate to arbitrarily pick data in order to get a decent R<sup>2</sup> for a linear fit? The authors briefly discuss the outlying mAbs – C12 and C23, but it seems that authors missed a huge opportunity in understanding what drives a much worse than expected and much better than expected activity vs. affinity, which has the potential to inform other rationally designed vaccination efforts.</p><p>3) While potentially outside of the scope of the present work, it seemed odd that the authors did not compare or even mention differences in memory response when using different vaccination strategies.</p><p>4) The main text does not state where the 60 antibodies are coming from. Why where there only 60? How many hybridomas have been screened in total? An explanation is only given in the Materials and methods. Additionally, the data for the screening of the antibodies should be presented in its entirety and not buried in the supplement. Only then the reader can fully appreciate how the lead antibodies have been identified. Perhaps a heatmap indicating the binding would be better suited to represent the data.</p><p>5) The positive control for bactericidal activity is a polyclonal hamster antibody, while the authors test mouse antibodies. Is it possible to discuss the lack of efficiency of the hamster polyclonal in greater detail? Why not use a mouse polyclonal as control?</p><p>6) When describing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and supplements the bactericidal activity of the antibodies the authors leave binding affinity completely out of the picture. Without the knowledge of affinity, the authors cannot be sure if the bactericidal activity is due the recognized epitope or affinity of individual antibodies.</p><p>7) In the vaccination experiment the authors describe that hamsters vaccinated with the chimera B10/7/7 have a better chance of survival when infected with <italic>Leptospira</italic> than hamsters vaccinated with B10 or B7, respectively. The better control would have been hamsters simultaneously vaccinated with a mixture of B10 and B7. Also, the ELISA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> lacks controls. The authors should add to the LigB7 and LigB10 sera ELISA the same controls as for the chimera. Additionally, the result should be added to main figure in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30051.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the authors make a point of highlighting the importance of the SAXS data to their design efforts, in reading the paper, it seems that the NMR structures of the individual domains were really the drivers (i.e., it really seems that the recombinant antigen could have been designed with only the NMR structure and the ELISA data).

Specifically, we have changed the impact statement, the final sentence of the Abstract, and the final sentence of the Introduction. We agree that, in hindsight, the immunoreactivity mapping experiments could have been designed to inform the accessible features of the antigen without the SAXS data. Still, the initial SAXS study yielded a low-resolution structure that suggested generating monoclonal antibodies would be worth the expense for both LigB1-7 and LigB7-12 regions. This is now noted in the Discussion section. If the SAXS study had revealed that some domains were clearly buried, then these regions could have been excluded from the generation of the mAb library. The SAXS data and immunoreactivity data offer complementary views of the overall structural architecture which also creates elements of redundancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, is it really appropriate to arbitrarily pick data in order to get a decent R<sup>2</sup> for a linear fit?

We now use a statistical method to determine the outliers in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and 5E</xref> correlation plots. A supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) has been added to show the Cook’s distance for the data in the correlation plots. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> in particular, the outliers greatly influence the regression line so the R<sup>2</sup> is reported for both the total dataset and the dataset without the statistically-determined outliers.</p><p>Additionally, we have included further discussion with regard to the identified outliers, C12 and C23. Please note that we have changed the Y-axis of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> from a relative ELISA binding measurement to a K<sub>D</sub> based on ELISA. While C12 was determined to be a statistical outlier in both the original and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> plots, the K<sub>D</sub> value of C12 is closer to the expected value from the fitted correlation. We note that C12 binds to two double and two single LigB Ig-like domains within LigB1-7 (not LigB7) and therefore may bind to a conserved region of the domains. To test if C12 was promiscuous enough to also bind to LigB7-12, an additional ELISA was performed to assess the possibility of interactions between library C mAbs and LigB7-12. C12 was the only mAb with significant binding to LigB7-12 suggesting that the ability to bind to several LigB Ig-like domains allows C12 to more effectively kill bacteria. A supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) has been added to show C12 binding to LigB7-12.</p><p>The other statistically identified outlier, C23, is less effective in bactericidal activity than expected based on both antigen binding and cell surface binding experiments. We suggest that the kinked structure of the LigB domains at the C23-binding site may play a role in decreasing its ability to initiate the cell death inducing cascade. The steric restriction combined with the target domain’s proximity to the leptospiral surface could slow mAb accessibility. Assays for antigen and cell surface binding are less dependent on time as incubation times were long enough to reach equilibrium. The bactericidal activity assay was inherently dependent on time which is compounded by time delays imposed by activation of the downstream complement cascade. We analyzed the correlation between LD<sub>50</sub> vs. LT<sub>50</sub> in the bactericidal assay using Cook’s distance and found C23 to be the only statistical outlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In a plot of K<sub>D</sub> vs. LT<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), C23 displays even weaker bactericidal activity relative to other mAbs than in the K<sub>D</sub> vs. LD<sub>50</sub> plot. The effect of time on the bactericidal activity of C23 is larger than for other mAbs. One possible reason, the LD<sub>50</sub> measurement was assessed at the longer time point of 90 minutes while LT<sub>50</sub> is also influenced by measurements at 60 minutes. The comparison of bactericidal activity measurements suggests that the bactericidal activity of C23 could be impaired by conformationally inhibited binding leading to slower than expected bacterial killing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While potentially outside of the scope of the present work, it seemed odd that the authors did not compare or even mention differences in memory response when using different vaccination strategies.</p></disp-quote><p>We include a figure to illustrate the relative IgG and IgM response to LigB10-B7-B7 immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected, a larger secondary immune response is observed for IgG only. The additional data is now mentioned in the Results section titled “Chimera LigB10-B7-B7 confers enhanced protection against <italic>Leptospira</italic> lethal challenge”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The main text does not state where the 60 antibodies are coming from.

Only then the reader can fully appreciate how the lead antibodies have been identified. Perhaps a heatmap indicating the binding would be better suited to represent the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a Results section specifically for the description of the mAb library creation and screening. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (previously a supplement) has become a main text figure and subsequent figures have been renumbered accordingly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> depicts the ELISA screen and cutoff used to select hybridomas for detailed analysis. For each library, two sets of 12 hybridoma supernatants were tested in the initial screen. An additional 12 hybridomas were needed to be screened in library V (LigB7-12) to identify 9 total mAbs with the desired ELISA cutoff (OD<sub>630</sub> = 1). The screening data is presented in its entirety. We now provide more detail on how the antibodies were obtained in both the added Results section and the Materials and methods. A heatmap of the data was unable to depict the ELISA cutoffs so we are presenting the data as a bar graph. An additional supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) was added to show the distribution of relative binding efficiencies. This histogram helps to illustrate how the lead mAbs were identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The positive control for bactericidal activity is a polyclonal hamster antibody, while the authors test mouse antibodies. Is it possible to discuss the lack of efficiency of the hamster polyclonal in greater detail? Why not use a mouse polyclonal as control?</p></disp-quote><p>In the serum bactericidal assay, the no antibody and isotypic mouse IgG groups are the true controls for the assay. We now do not refer to the hamster anti-LigB polyclonal antibodies as a control in the manuscript. We agree with the reviewers that the mouse pAb would have been a better control; Unfortunately, mouse pAbs were not retained during the mAb library creation and are therefore not readily available. Hamster anti-LigB pAb were retained from vaccine trials and was easily included in the bactericidal assay. Because the result suggests that the mAbs generated in this study are more effective at killing <italic>Leptospira</italic> than hamster anti-LigB pAb that would be generated using the conventional leptospirosis animal model, we felt the data should be included but we are willing to remove the data if the reviewers would prefer taking it out. There are three possible explanations for the lack of hamster pAb efficiency. First, the pAbs are likely to include both high affinity and low affinity anti-LigB antibodies and also background antibodies with no affinity for LigB. The effectiveness of pAbs are likely to be reduced because the concentration of high affinity anti-LigB antibodies is lower for a pAb solution of the same overall concentration as for a solution the purified mAbs. Second, pAbs contain a mixture of IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3). The ability of the different hamster-derived IgG subclasses to effectively activate the complement system is unknown; however, different IgG subclasses from both mouse and human exhibit variability in their effectiveness at activating the complement system. Third, while the ability of mouse antibodies to activate the human complement cascade is known, the relative ability of hamster antibodies to activate the same cascade has not been described. Because we do not know if mouse and hamster antibodies are equally efficient at eliciting the killing response, we cannot rule out the possibility that hamster antibodies are less effective in the assay. We now discuss the possible reasons for the lack of hamster pAb efficiency in the Results section of the manuscript (titled “Bactericidal activity of anti-LigB mAbs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) When describing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and supplements the bactericidal activity of the antibodies the authors leave binding affinity completely out of the picture. Without the knowledge of affinity, the authors cannot be sure if the bactericidal activity is due the recognized epitope or affinity of individual antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) is a more accurate measurement of mAb-antigen interactions than the ELISA-derived relative antigen binding measurement. We have replaced the relative binding measurements with K<sub>D</sub> values. K<sub>D</sub> values for purified mAbs were determined by fitting concentration-dependent ELISA measurements. We have replaced the relative binding measurements with the concentration-dependent ELISA curves and K<sub>D</sub> values (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). K<sub>D</sub> values have also replaced the relative binding measurements in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and the correlation plot with LD<sub>50</sub> for bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Overall, the LD<sub>50</sub> correlation plot using K<sub>D</sub> is similar to the plot using relative ELISA binding measurements with C12 and C23 being identified as the only two statistical outliers in both plots. The K<sub>D</sub> vs. LD<sub>50</sub> shows a high enough correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.773) to suggest bactericidal activity is dependent on binding affinity for most mAbs. The outliers, C12 and C23, were explored further in the three added supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to understand the basis for their non-conformity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the vaccination experiment the authors describe that hamsters vaccinated with the chimera B10/7/7 have a better chance of survival when infected with Leptospira than hamsters vaccinated with B10 or B7, respectively.

Also, the ELISA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> lacks controls. The authors should add to the LigB7 and LigB10 sera ELISA the same controls as for the chimera. Additionally, the result should be added to main figure in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the requested controls for Anti-LigB7 and Anti-LigB10 sera ELISA to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. A reference to the figure supplement was added to the main figure legend.</p><p>There are several reasons why we feel that the benefits of the additional control would not be an ideal control and do not warrant significantly delaying the publication of this manuscript. From a manufacturing standpoint, purification and subsequent mixing of domains would be costlier than purification of a single domain. This control would not generate a useful result in and of itself. Additionally, we show a robust gain in vaccine efficiency and the importance of a positive control would be minimal. Also, since all of the vaccines used in the trial were single domain proteins from a single purification, the inclusion of a mixed protein solution would not be a direct comparison. While a vaccine trial that included another control with a mixture of LigB7 and LigB10 could have been added, the additional vaccine trial would require 3-4 months to complete. Again, we argue that the small benefit of the additional vaccine trial control does not warrant the time commitment and delay that it would require.</p></body></sub-article></article>
