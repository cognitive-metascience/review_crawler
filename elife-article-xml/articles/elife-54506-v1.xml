neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles requires mechanisms both to prevent un-initiated fusion of vesicles (clamping) and to trigger fusion following Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx. The principal components involved in these processes are the vesicular fusion machinery (SNARE proteins) and the regulatory proteins, Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin. Here, we use a reconstituted single-vesicle fusion assay under physiologically-relevant conditions to delineate a novel mechanism by which Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin act synergistically to establish Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated fusion. We find that under each vesicle, Synaptotagmin-1 oligomers bind and clamp a limited number of ‘central’ SNARE complexes via the primary interface and introduce a kinetic delay in vesicle fusion mediated by the excess of free SNAREpins. This in turn enables Complexin to arrest the remaining free ‘peripheral’ SNAREpins to produce a stably clamped vesicle. Activation of the central SNAREpins associated with Synaptotagmin-1 by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to trigger rapid (&lt;100 msec) and synchronous fusion of the docked vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>vesicle fusion</kwd><kwd>synaptotagmin</kwd><kwd>complexin</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>027044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothman</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cooperative action of synaptotagmin and complexin is needed to arrest all SNARE complexes on a vesicle, and the reversal of the synaptotagmin clamp is sufficient to achieve fast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-synchronized fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The controlled yet rapid (sub-millisecond) release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs) is central to all information processing in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizo, 2018</xref>). Synaptic release of neurotransmitters relies on the efficient coupling of SV fusion to the triggering signal – action potential (AP)-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the pre-synaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Südhof, 2013</xref>). SV fusion is catalyzed by synaptic SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins, VAMP2 on the vesicles (v-SNAREs) and Syntaxin/SNAP25 (t-SNAREs) on the pre-synaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). On their own, SNARE proteins are constitutively active and intrinsically trigger fusion in the range of 0.5–1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To achieve the requisite speed and precision of synaptic transmission, the nerve terminals maintain a pool of docked vesicles that can be readily released upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). The prevailing theory is that in a ‘release-ready’ vesicle, multiple SNARE complexes are firmly held (‘clamped’) in a partially assembled state. These ‘SNAREpins’ are then synchronously released by Ca<sup>2+</sup> to drive fusion dramatically faster than any one SNARE alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that two synaptic proteins, Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) and Complexin (Cpx) play a critical role in establishing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Synaptotagmin-1 is a SV-localized protein with a large cytoplasmic part containing tandem C2A and C2B domains that bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sutton et al., 1995</xref>). It is well established that fast AP-evoked synchronous release is triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to Syt1 C2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brose et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). Genetic analysis shows that Syt1 also plays a crucial role in ‘clamping’ spontaneous release and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked asynchronous release to ensure high fidelity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coupled synchronous transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). Recently it has been demonstrated that C2B-driven self-oligomerization of Syt1 provides the structural basis for its clamping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tagliatti et al., 2019</xref>). Syt1 is also involved in initial stages of docking of SVs to the plasma membrane (PM), in part mediated by its interaction with the anionic lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Honigmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parisotto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Besides the membrane interaction, Syt1 also binds the neuronal t-SNAREs on the PM, both independently (primary binding site) and in conjunction with Complexin (tripartite binding site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>). The Syt1-SNARE interactions are important for Syt1 role in SV docking, clamping fusion and triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Complexin is a cytosolic α-helical protein that binds and regulates SNARE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Biochemical analyses reveal that Cpx catalyzes the initial stages of SNARE assembly, but then blocks complete assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Physiological studies show that Cpx indeed clamps spontaneous fusion in invertebrate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wragg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2014</xref>), but its importance as a fusion clamp in mammalian neurons is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Courtney et al., 2019</xref>). However, under all conditions, Cpx has been shown to facilitate vesicle priming and promote AP-evoked synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is broadly accepted that Syt1 and Cpx are both involved in clamping spurious or delayed fusion events and synchronize neurotransmitter release to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx. However, there is presently no coherent understanding how these proteins assemble and operate together. To gain mechanistic insights into this process, a reductionist approach where the variables are limited, and components can be rigorously controlled is required. We recently described a biochemically-defined fusion system based on a pore-spanning lipid bilayer setup that is ideally suited for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). This reconstituted setup is capable of precisely tracking individual vesicle docking, clamping (delay from docking to spontaneous fusion) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggered release at tens of milliseconds timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). Critically, this setup allows us to examine these discrete sub-steps in the vesicular exocytosis process, independent of alterations in the preceding or following stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using the in vitro fusion system, we recently reported that under artificially low-VAMP2 conditions (~13 copies of VAMP2 and ~25 copies of Syt1 per vesicle), Syt1 oligomerization is both necessary and sufficient to establish a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive fusion clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). Here we extend this study to more physiologically-relevant conditions, using SV mimics reconstituted with ~25 copies of Syt1 and ~70 copies of VAMP2. We report that under these conditions, both Cpx and Syt1 oligomers are needed to stably clamp all SNARE complexes and the reversal of the Syt1 clamp is sufficient to achieve fast, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synchronized fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptotagmin and complexin co-operate to clamp vesicle fusion</title><p>With the goal of approximating the physiological context, we chose a reconstitution condition for small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) resulting in an average of 74 copies and 25 copies of outward-facing VAMP2 and Syt1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We employed pre-formed t-SNAREs (1:1 complex of Syntaxin1 and SNAP-25) in the planar bilayers (containing 15% PS and 3% PIP2) to both simplify the experimental approach and to bypass the requirement of SNARE-assembling chaperones, Munc18 and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizo, 2018</xref>).

These results taken together with the known structural and biochemical properties of Syt1 and Cpx prompts a novel ‘synergistic clamping’ mechanism.</p><p>We posit that the Syt1 C2B domain binds PIP2 (via the poly-lysine motif) on the PM and assembles into ring-like oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zanetti et al., 2016</xref>).

The Syt1-t-SNARE interaction, which likely precedes the engagement of the v- and the t-SNAREs, positions the Syt1 such that it sterically blocks the full assembly of the associated SNAREpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>). The Syt1 oligomers in addition to creating a stable steric impediment could also radially restrain the assembling SNAREpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>). It is worth noting in this configuration the helical extension of Syt1 C2B that forms the ‘tripartite’ interface with Cpx and SNAREs contacts the PM and is thus unavailable for tripartite binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Syt1 oligomers can bind and clamp only a small sub-set of SNAREpins (which we refer to as ‘central SNAREpins’) as the number of potential SNAREpins per SV far exceeds the Syt1 density (~70 copies of VAMP2 vs. ~20 copies of Syt1). We suggest that the remaining ‘peripheral’ SNAREs would then be unrestrained and can fully zipper to catalyze vesicle fusion, though at an impeded rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the limited set of Syt1-clamped ‘central’ SNAREpins correspond physiologically to the six symmetrically organized protein densities that underlie each docked synaptic-like vesicle visualized by cryo-electron tomography analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, this symmetrical organization depends on Syt1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cpx potentially binds the SNARE complex only when the Syntaxin and VAMP2 are partially-assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>) and competitively blocks the complete zippering of the C-terminal portion of the VAMP2 SNARE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kümmel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>). It is well-established that the C-terminal portion of VAMP2 assembles with extraordinarily high energy and rate acting as the major power stroke to drive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, Cpx, on its own, is ineffective in clamping SNARE-driven vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We envision that under physiological conditions, Syt1 sets the stage for Cpx to bind and clamp the ‘peripheral’ SNARE complexes. Syt1, in addition to fully-arresting the central SNAREpins, also kinetically hinders the assembly of the peripheral SNAREpins enabling Cpx to effectually arrest their complete zippering. In this manner, the sequential action of Syt1 and Cpx on different populations of SNAREpins would be involved in the generation of the stably docked, release-ready vesicles. Under each vesicle, Syt1 oligomers bind and clamp a small sub-set of available SNAREpins at the early stages of docking, which in turn enables Cpx to block the remainder of the SNAREpins. This molecular model would readily explain the importance of both Syt1 and Cpx in establishing the fusion clamp as evidenced in several genetic deletion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also report that the reversal of the Syt1 clamp is sufficient to drive rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion of the docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It involves Syt1 C2B domain binding both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Syt1 C2 domains induce a large-scale conformational rearrangement of the Syt1-SNARE complex on the lipid membrane surface, disrupting the pre-fusion clamped architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grushin et al., 2019</xref>). This, in effect, reverses the Syt1 clamp, allowing the associated SNAREs to complete zippering and drive fusion. This implies that only a small fraction of available SNAREpins per vesicle (i.e. only those associated with Syt1) are involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation process. This is consistent with the earlier reports that 2–3 SNARE complexes can be sufficient to facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked synchronous neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohrmann et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, recent modeling studies considering the concept of mechanical coupling have predicted that an optimum of 4–6 SNAREpins is required to achieve sub-millisecond vesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manca et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There is a long-standing debate over the role of Cpx in establishing a fusion clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López-Murcia et al., 2019</xref>). We find that Cpx is an integral part of the overall clamping mechanism and Syt1 and Cpx play distinct roles in clamping different pools of SNAREpins. However, Cpx requires a kinetic delay (likely introduced by Syt1) to block vesicle fusion and this inhibition is not released by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This raises the intriguing possibility that the Cpx clamp is not necessarily reversed during the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation process. The molecular details of the observed Cpx ‘clamp’ and its physiological relevance remains to be determined.</p><p>Overall, our data are in alignment with the emerging view that Syt1 plays a pivotal role in orchestrating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated neurotransmitter release. Syt1 functions both as a fusion clamp and the principal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor to establish Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulation of vesicular fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, Syt1, by virtue of self-assembling into oligomeric structures, also provides the molecular framework to organize the exocytic machinery into a co-operative structure to enable ultra-fast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We have articulated the simplest hypothesis, considering discrete ‘central’ and ‘’peripheral’ SNAREpins associated with Syt1 and Cpx, respectively. However, it is easy to imagine that Cpx also binds the central SNAREpins. Indeed, recent X-ray crystal structure revealed that both Syt1 and Cpx can bind the same pre-fusion SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Cpx binding is also predicted to create a new Syt1 binding site (i.e. tripartite interface) on SNAREs. In our reconstituted setup, we find that this SNARE-Cpx-Syt1 ‘tripartite’ interface is not required to produce the fusion clamp but is likely involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of fusion from the clamped state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Since the SNARE-Syt1-Cpx tripartite interface is created only when the SNAREs are partially-assembled (i.e. when Cpx binds), it is possible that this interaction plays an auxiliary role in establishing the fusion clamp. As such, it can be bypassed in our biochemically-defined experimental setup. The tripartite interface might become more relevant in the pre-synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) where ~ 30% of Syt1 is present in the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wienisch and Klingauf, 2006</xref>) and other Synaptotagmins could also participate in the tripartite interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, we have postulated that such a ‘dual-clamp’ arrangement with Syt1 (from SV) occupying the ‘primary’ site and with Syt1 and Syt7 (from PM) competing for the ‘tripartite’ site (in conjunction with Cpx) could potentially explain the synergistic regulation of neurotransmitter release by different Syt isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volynski and Krishnakumar, 2018</xref>). Such an arrangement could also potentially explain how Cpx could regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked synchronous neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Physiologically, all three synaptic SNAREs (Syntaxin, SNAP-25 and VAMP2) are assembled into a SNAREpin in a concerted reaction involving chaperones Munc13 and Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Hughson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizo, 2018</xref>), the need for which is by-passed in our system by pre-assembled t-SNARE complexes. We imagine that these chaperones also function in a concerted manner with Syt1 and Cpx and have recently advanced a speculative model outlining how these proteins can co-operate to template SNAREpin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rothman et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, lipid membranes may contribute to synergism or cooperativity between Syt1 and Cpx in both clamping the un-initiated fusion events and triggering rapid and synchronous fusion in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx.</p><p>As such, further studies with high temporal resolution involving detailed mutational and topological analysis of Syt1 and Cpx, along with the chaperones Munc13 and Munc18, is needed to establish pointillistic details of fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered SV fusion. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that Syt1 and Cpx, along with SNARE proteins, form the minimal protein machinery that is necessary and sufficient to establish rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>The following cDNA constructs, which have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krishnakumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahal et al., 2002</xref>), were used in this study: full-length VAMP2 (VAMP2-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 1–116); full-length VAMP2<sup>4X</sup> (VAMP2-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 1–116 with L70D, A74R, A81D, L84D mutations), full-length t-SNARE complex (mouse His<sup>6</sup>-SNAP25B, residues 1–206 and rat Syntaxin1A, residues 1–288); soluble cytoplasmic domain of the t-SNAREs (CDT, mouse His<sup>6</sup>-SNAP25B, residues 1–206 and rat Syntaxin1A, residues 1–265); Synaptotagmin (rat Synaptotagmin1-His<sup>6</sup>, residues 57–421); and Complexin (human His<sup>6</sup>-Complexin 1, residues 1–134).

Lipids, 1,2-dioleoyl -snglycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- (phospho-L-serine) (DOPS), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-DOPE), phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). ATTO647N-DOPE was purchased from ATTO-TEC, GmbH (Siegen, Germany) and lipophilic carbocyanine DiD (1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-Tetramethylindodicarbocyanine Perchlorate) was purchased from Thermofisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Calcium Green conjugated to a lipophilic 24-carbon alkyl chain (Calcium Green C24) was custom synthesized by Marker Gene Technologies (Eugene, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>All proteins (v- and t-SNAREs, Cpx, Syt1 wild type and mutants) were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krishnakumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). In brief, proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>strain Rosetta2(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) using 0.5 mM IPTG for 4 hr. Cells were pelleted and lysed using a cell disruptor (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) in HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, 400 mM KCl, 4% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphinehydrochloride (TCEP), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Samples were clarified using a 45Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Atlanta, GA) at 40 K RPM for 30 min and subsequently incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) overnight at 4°C. The resin was washed with HEPES buffer (for Cpx) or HEPES buffer supplemented with 1% octylglucoside (Syt1 and SNAREs). Protein was eluted using 350 mM Imidazole and the concentration was determined using a Bradford Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with BSA as a standard. Syt1 was further treated with Benzonase (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by ion exchange (Mono S, AKTA purifier, GE) to remove DNA/RNA contamination. The purity was verified using SDS-PAGE analysis and all proteins were flash frozen and stored at −80°C with 10% glycerol without significant loss of function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Liposome preparation</title><p> t-SNAREs and VAMP2 (±Syt1) containing SUV were prepared using rapid detergent (1% Octylglucoside) dilution and dialysis method as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ji et al., 2010</xref>). VAMP2 (±Syt1) containing SUVs were subjected to additional purification on the discontinuous Nycodenz gradient. The lipid composition was 80 (mole)% DOPC, 15% DOPS, 3% PIP2% and 2% NBD-PE for t-SNARE SUV and 88% DOPC, 10% PS and 2% ATTO647-PE for VAMP2 (±Syt1) SUVs. To mimic physiological copy numbers of protein, we used an input of protein: lipid ratio as 1: 400 for t-SNARE, 1:100 for VAMP2 for physiological density, 1: 500 for VAMP2 at low copy number, and 1: 250 for Syt1. This was based on well-established parameters namely that the reconstitution efficiency for SNAREs and Syt1 is roughly 40–50% (densitometry analysis of the proteoliposomes) and only approximately 50–60% of the proteins are externally oriented (chymotrypsin protection analysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Based on the densitometry analysis of Coomassie-stained SDS gels, we estimated vesicles at physiological density, contained 74 ± 4 and 26 ± 6 copies of outward-facing VAMP2 and Syt1 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and vesicles at low copy number of VAMP2 contained 13 ± 2 and 26 ± 6 copies of outward-facing VAMP2 and Syt1 respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single vesicle fusion assay</title><p>All the single-vesicle fusion measurements were carried out with suspended lipid bilayers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, t-SNARE-containing giant unilamellar vesicles as prepared using the osmotic shock protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Motta et al., 2015</xref>) were busted on freshly plasma-cleaned Si/SiO2 chips containing 5 µm diameter holes in presence of HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The bilayers were extensively washed with HEPES buffer containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the fluidity of the t-SNARE containing bilayers was verified using fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching using the NBD fluorescence. In some experiments, we labeled the t-SNAREs with Alexa-488 and confirmed protein mobility as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Vesicles (100 nM lipids) were added from the top using a pipette and allowed to interact with the bilayer for 10 min. We used the ATTO647-PE fluorescence to track vesicle docking, post-docking diffusion, docking-to-fusion delays and spontaneous fusion events. Fusion was attested by a burst and then rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity as the fluorescent PE from the vesicle diffuses away. The time between docking and fusion corresponded to the fusion clamp and was quantified using a ‘survival curve’ whereby delays are pooled together, and their distribution is plotted in the form of a survival function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After the initial 10 min interaction phase, the excess vesicles in the chamber were removed by buffer exchange (3x buffer wash) and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added from the top to monitor the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the docked vesicles. The number of fused (and the remaining un-fused) vesicles was estimated (end-point analysis)~1 min after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition.</p><p>All experiments were carried out at 37°C using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica-SP5) equipped with a multi-wavelength argon laser including 488, diode lasers (532 and 641 nm), and a long-working distance 40X water immersion objective (NA 1.1). The emission light was spectrally separated and collected by photomultiplier tubes. To cover large areas of the planar bilayer and simultaneously record large ensembles of vesicles, the movies were acquired at a speed of 150 ms per frame. Accurate quantification and fate of each vesicles were analyzed using our custom written MATLAB script described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>). The files can be downloaded from MATLAB Central at the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66521-fusion-analyzer-fas">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66521-fusion-analyzer-fas</ext-link>. Note: We excluded vesicles bound to the edge of the holes as they may not be representative of vesicles bound to the free-floating membrane. We thus used only the centrally-docked vesicles for analysis. We did not observe any change in ATTO-647-PE fluorescence for the vesicles that remain docked and un-fused during the observation period or post Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition. Thus, we can rule out hemi-fusion diaphragm formation as a possible explanation for the observed ‘clamped’ or ‘un-fused’ state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-vesicle docking analysis</title><p>To get an accurate count of the docked vesicles, we used VAMP2 protein with mutations in the C-terminal half (L70D, A74R, A81D and L84D; VAMP2<sup>4X</sup>) that eliminates fusion without impeding the docking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krishnakumar et al., 2013</xref>). For the docking analysis, VAMP2<sup>4X</sup> containing SUVs (vSUV<sup>4X</sup>) were introduced into the chamber and allowed to interact with the t-SNARE bilayer. After a 10 min incubation, the bilayer was thoroughly washed with running buffer (3x minimum) and the number of docked vesicles were counted. For an unbiased particle count, we employed a custom-written algorithm to count particles from top-left to bottom-right that ensures every spot is counted only once.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium dynamics </title><p>To quantify the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion, we used a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor dye, Calcium Green conjugated to a lipophilic 24-carbon alkyl chain (Calcium Green C24) introduced in the suspended bilayer to directly monitor the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Calcium green is a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor (K<sub>d</sub> of ~75 nM) and exhibits a large fluorescent increase (at 532 nm) upon binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To accurately estimate the arrival of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to/near the vesicles docked on the bilayer, we used confocal microscopy equipped with resonant scanner focused at or near the bilayer membrane and acquired movies at a speed of up to 36 msec per frame. We typically observed the fluorescence signal increase at the bilayer surface between about three frames (~100 msec) after Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore used 100 msec as the benchmark to accurately estimate the time-constants for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion reaction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Frederic Pincet for critical inputs during the design and development of this project.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that current manuscript is not acceptable, but we encourage you to consider a resubmission after addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>While the reviewers and editors found the new reconstitution method and the data presented very interesting, there appears to be a large gap between the experiments and the model/interpretation presented. Further experiments and a substantial revision of the paper could improve the work and increase its impact.</p><p>One of the most compelling new results suggests that combination of complexin and synaptotagmin clamps much more than the simple sum of both their clamping functions. This observation may suggest that the two molecules (complexin and synaptotagmin) act cooperatively in their clamping function. For example, the tripartite interface observed in the crystal structures by Zhou et al., 2017, may produce this cooperativity, but there could be other explanations. Additional mutations should be tested to correlate the various interactions (observed in structures and by the author's previous experiments) with functional studies with their reconstituted assay. We note that while the DA and Q mutants have been tested extensively in different contexts (these mutants primarily interfere with calcium binding and formation of the primary interface, respectively) the F349A mutation is less clearly defined since it may also affect (positively or negatively) the tripartite interface (it is an integral part of largely hydrophobic interactions between Syt1 C2B and the SNARE complex through the tripartite interaction, please consult the crystal structure of this complex). Mutations should be designed that more precisely test the oligomeric Syt1 interactions and the tripartite interface.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic>The authors have used a pore-spanning lipid bilayer setup to study the functional interplay between small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) bearing both the v-SNARE VAMP2 and synaptotagmin (Syt1) and target membranes bearing pre-formed t-SNAREs, with or without complexin (Cpx). Previously (Ramakrishnan, 2019), the authors showed that the presence of Syt1 on the VAMP2-bearing SUVs led to 'clamped' vesicles – that is, vesicles that docked and remained immobile, without fusing, for at least ten minutes. In Figure 4 of this manuscript, they reproduce the experiments shown in Figure 3 of the earlier manuscript, albeit with two additional Syt1 mutants. Most of the current manuscript, however, is founded on the new observation that using a five-fold higher – and more physiologically realistic – number of VAMP2 per SUV dramatically alters the results. Instead of Syt1 being sufficient for clamping, its presence now merely delays fusion modestly. Strikingly the addition of Cpx, which in the absence of Syt1 has no effect, leads to an increase in the number of docked vesicles, and &gt;90% of them (as opposed to 20% without Cpx) are securely clamped. The clamp so formed is efficiently reversed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>This leads to a model in which some SNARE complexes are clamped by Syt1 and others are clamped by Cpx. Since, in these experiments, Syt1 is outnumbered by VAMP2 by about 3:1, it stands to reason that it can't do all of the needed clamping on its own. (In Ramakrishnan, 2019, there was twice as much Syt1 as VAMP2). When the authors washed out Cpx the vesicles, presumably using the excess SNAREs, fused; when the Cpx was washed out in the presence of a reagent that trapped the liberated SNAREs in an inactive state, fusion was not observed until the Syt1 clamp was released by Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition.</p><p>The authors' results imply that Syt1 is somehow required for Cpx to function as a fusion clamp, since Cpx alone shows no discernable clamping activity. Their model to explain this is that Syt1 forms a ring-like oligomer that impedes full zippering of the other 'peripheral' SNARE complexes, giving Cpx the opportunity to bind and clamp them. The problem with this model is that the only experiment that might be considered to be a critical test – using the F349A mutant to destabilize the Syt1 oligomers – not only doesn't abrogate Cpx-mediated clamping, but renders Cpx clamping irreversible. I don't know how to make sense of this. More generally, since Syt1:Cpx 'synergy' is quite central to the manuscript, one could argue that the authors need to investigate further; for example, by testing Syt1 mutations that disrupt the tripartite complex.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>Ramakrishnan and colleagues follow up on a study of theirs published earlier this year (FEBS Letters 2019) examining synaptic vesicle (SV) clamping mechanisms using a minimal reconstituted liposome fusion system comprising SNAREs, Syt1, and Cpx1. The current results indicate separate clamping functions for Syt1 and Cpx1, and both are required to produce calcium-sensitive stably docked vesicles in the context of physiological VAMP2 and Syt1 copy numbers. Disruption of a binding interface between the tSNAREs and C2B prevents Syt1-mediated clamping but also reveals an apparently irreversible clamping function of Cpx1. I am generally enthusiastic about the work, but I do have some questions on data interpretation and the proposed model.</p><p>From a technical perspective, this is a nice study that further develops a powerful in vitro docking/fusion model sufficient for detailed exploration of Syt1/Cpx1/SNARE mechanisms. Several of the interpretations put forward by the authors could use some clarification. In particular, the conclusion that Cpx1 acts independently of Syt1 on a distinct set of peripheral SNAREpins to clamp fusion is emphasized throughout the manuscript but not strongly supported by the data. On its own, Cpx1 does not provide a stable (ie 10's of seconds to minutes time scale) clamping function in this assay. But mutations in the 'primary' C2B-tSNARE interface eliminate Syt1 clamping function while somehow permitting an unexpected and potent Cpx1 stable clamping function. Also, previous work has suggested two distinct binding interfaces between C2B and the tSNAREs: the primary and tripartite interfaces (Zhou et al., 2017). The tripartite interface involves Cpx1 and may provide an explanation for the stable clamping by Cpx1 when the primary C2B interface is disrupted. Since C2B domains may interact with SNAREpins in these two distinct interfaces, changing the VAMP2:Syt1 ratio may alter the relative fraction of primary vs tripartite binding interactions and provide another explanation for the dose-dependence of VAMP2 on sufficiency of Syt1 for clamping versus the requirement for Cpx1 in the face of excess VAMP2. These scenarios may not be consistent with the picture of a central set of SNAREpins harboring Syt1 surrounded by Cpx1-bound SNAREpins as promoted by the authors. And no direct evidence for these central/peripheral SNAREpin arrangements is provided here. Thus, such a strong emphasis on independence of Syt1 and Cpx1 mechanisms in the Abstract, Results section and Discussion section is not warranted in my opinion.</p><p>In the high VAMP2:Syt1 experiments, the authors elegantly demonstrated the reversible nature of the Cpx1 clamping function by washing out Cpx1 and competing away excess SNAREpins with soluble tSNARE complexes. Did the authors attempt to wash out Cpx1 in the Syt1(Q)+tSNARE(Q) experiments where Cpx1 appeared to drive an irreversible clamp? And given the possible contribution of the tripartite C2B-SNARE interaction, did the authors attempt to disrupt this interface with mutations published in the Zhou et al., 2017 study? I do not think additional experiments would be required for publication of the current study, but could help bolster the proposed model.</p><p>The authors emphasize the importance of physiological copy number for the VAMP2 and Syt1 used in this study. How important is it to have 25 copies of (outwardly facing) Syt1 per vesicle? Work from Jahn put the number at around 15 copies per glutamatergic SV and possibily even fewer for GABAergic SVs. Does the clamping efficiency gradually go down as the copy numbers are reduced or is there a minimal requirement for any clamping to be observed? Perhaps other sources of C2 domains could contribute in synapses, but I was anticipating some comment on this 25 copy number given the Jahn work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>This manuscript explores the functional interactions between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, Synaptotagmin1 (Syt1) and Complexin (Cpx) in clamping of neuronal SNARE complexes preceding Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and rapid fusion. They use a version of an in vitro single molecule fusion assay, which uses v-SNARE containing SUVs, with Si/SiO2 chips with t-SNARE containing membranes spread across the holes. Here, the authors examine membrane fusion between VAMP2-SUVs w/ and w/o Syt1, +/- Cpx, with t-SNARE complex membranes. Using a series of different protein combinations and concentrations, and various Syt1 mutant proteins, the authors suggest that two types of clamped SUVs occur: a small central &quot;core&quot; that is clamped by Syt1, and the rest that are clamped by Cpx, but only when facilitated by Syt1. Furthermore, they suggest that addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> facilitates fusion of only the Syt1-clamped SUVs, and that Cpx-clamped SUVs are blocked from fusion. It is an interesting hypothesis, but not well supported by the data presented.</p><p>A substantial amount of the data in the paper is basically validating their assay under &quot;physiological conditions&quot; of ~70 VAMPs and ~25 Syt1s per SUV, +/- Cpx (2uM), with the number of t-SNARE complexes unknown. The authors build on previous data from their lab, as well as others, related to the idea that Syt1 and Cpx work both independently as well as synergistically. The logic of the conclusions is based on a number of assumptions based on previous work, especially with regard to oligomerization of Syt1, interactions with Cpx and SNAREs, and whether washing 40x only serves to displace Cpx. This is particularly an issue in assays that are quite sensitive to the amount of protein used, but the extent of complex formation is only inferred indirectly. The authors present a hypothesis to try and explain the complicated findings, yet it is unclear whether the data fully support such a hypothesis. One particular example is the finding in Figure 1 that SUVs with Cpx alone fuse relatively quickly, yet the conclusion from Figure 4 is that &quot;in the absence of the Syt1 clamp, Cpx blocks SNARE assembly irreversibly&quot;.</p><p>For most experiments, only a representative curve is shown, or the data (late time point?) summarized in bar graphs, with little detail of kinetics or binding shown. In many cases, data are &quot;normalized,&quot; but it is unclear what the data are normalized to. It is also unclear if contents mixing experiments are performed for each of the different assay conditions, or only a representative experiment was done. These issues make many of the experiments tricky to interpret, and it is quite possible that alternative hypotheses could explain the data.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a lack of sufficient discussion (and referencing) of a number of other studies in the field. The authors need to try to reconcile their data with that of other groups, in order for their new hypothesis of Syt1-Cpx to be at all convincing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Independent Yet Synergistic Roles of Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin in Calcium Regulated Neuronal Exocytosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The hypothesis that there are distinct roles for Cpx and Syt1 in clamping two populations of SNAREs on a single vesicle is interesting and novel. However, this revised manuscript will benefit from substantial further revisions, clarifications, and discussion of other models and explanations. Moreover, rigorous statistical analyses of the survival times are requested. Our chief concerns are centered on the proposed model, interpretations, and analysis of the data, and no new experiments are requested. Below we detail several revisions required by the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We are not convinced that the interpretation of their data is consistent with regard to the 'independent' roles of Cpx and Syt1 as stated in the title. Cpx on its own cannot clamp vesicles whereas in the presence of even a defective version of Syt1 (either the oligomer mutation or the quintuple Syt1+quintuple SNAP-25 mutation), Cpx now permanently inhibits vesicles from fusing. Thus, Cpx still clearly depends on Syt1 in a way that is not consistent with either the oligomer assembly or the primary Syt1-SNARE interface. One is left with the puzzle of how precisely synaptotagmin is creating this delay. Whatever this kinetic effect is, Cpx is not functioning independently of Syt1. Please revise the Results section and Discussion section to clarify your hypothesis and to better define independence in this context.</p><p>2) The notion of &quot;clamping&quot; suggests that an underlying molecular mechanism involving the synaptic proteins that have been included in this study. Yet, the measurements are assessing the survival of docked vesicles which is not a direct measure of molecular clamping. While molecular clamping could indeed be a possible explanation for the observations, there could be other explanations as well that involve the interplay between molecules and membranes. For example, it is possible that synaptotagmin or SNARE-induced hemifusion diaphragm formation (a long-lived metastable state) could affect the time of survival. Another possibility is that the membrane itself is the conduit for synergism. For example, it is known that synaptotagmin bends membranes and complexin preferentially binds to curved membranes, and thus, the membrane may introduce apparent synergism or cooperativity between the proteins. Please revise the Abstract, Results section and Discussion section accordingly.</p><p>3) The discussion in the text leaves one with the impression that the Syt1 C2B LLQQ mutant has no effect in their assay. Actually, it does have a significant effect, see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 panel B – the effect is somewhere between the quintuple mutant and wildtype after calcium addition. Please discuss.</p><p>4) The &quot;survival percentage&quot; plots are not quantitative. Please provide bar charts with error bars (along with significance tests) of the survival percentages after some defined time period(s). Another suggestion is to provide survival statistics (such as Kaplan Meier estimators).</p><p>5) Please promote some of the supplemental figures (especially the supplements to Figure 4) to primary figures, to in order to avoid 'burying' some of the most important results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Synergistic Roles of Synaptotagmin-1 and Complexin in Calcium Regulated Neuronal Exocytosis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We thank the authors for addressing the concerns of the reviewers and reviewing editor. The manuscript has much improved. However, there is a remaining point on statistical analysis that needs to be addressed before final acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors still do not provide some statistical statement of significance in the data presented in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5. They do provide info on the Kaplan Meier estimator of survival probability, but the reader is left to assume that all the differences shown are significant. They are very likely to be significant because the effects are quite large, but one usually expects a statistical test with either a p value or confidence interval to bolster the claim that an experimental manipulation did or did not have an effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54506.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the reviewers and editors found the new reconstitution method and the data presented very interesting, there appears to be a large gap between the experiments and the model/interpretation presented. Further experiments and a substantial revision of the paper could improve the work and increase its impact.</p><p>One of the most compelling new results suggests that combination of complexin and synaptotagmin clamps much more than the simple sum of both their clamping functions. […] Mutations should be designed that more precisely test the oligomeric Syt1 interactions and the tripartite interface.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess if the SNARE-Cpx-Syt1 ‘tripartite’ interaction<sup>1</sup> could explain the observed cooperative function of Syt1 and Cpx, we tested the effect of the previously described Syt1 mutations (L387Q/L394Q) that disrupt this tripartite interface<sup>1</sup> in our reconstituted assay. The LLQQ mutation had very little to no effect on the Syt1 clamp or the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion under both the low-copy VAMP2 (without Cpx) and the normal VAMP2 (with 2 µM Cpx) conditions. This suggests that the tripartite interface likely plays an auxiliary role in establishing the Syt1 clamp and cannot explain the observed synergistic effect of Syt1 and Cpx in clamping SNARE-mediated fusion.</p><p>These data are now included in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. Additionally, we have now expanded the Discussion section as follows: “We find that the SNARE-Cpx-Syt1 ‘tripartite’ interface, which has been shown to be physiologically-relevant <sup>1</sup>, is not absolutely required to produce the Syt1 clamp or for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation process under reconstituted conditions (Figure 4). […] Nonetheless, our data demonstrates that Syt1 and Cpx, along with SNARE proteins, form the minimal protein machinery that is necessary and sufficient to establish rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis”.</p><p>With regards to the F349A mutation, we have previously shown that this mutation specifically disrupts Syt1 oligomerization without affecting other molecular properties, including overall SNARE binding<sup>7</sup>. However, its effect on the ‘primary’ or the ‘tripartite’ SNARE binding sites has not been resolved. Nonetheless, considering that the LLQQ mutation has no effect on Syt1 clamping or activation function, it is unlikely that the F349A mutation exerts its effect via the tripartite interface. We thus conclude that Syt1 oligomerization is a key element of the Syt1 clamp.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors' results imply that Syt1 is somehow required for Cpx to function as a fusion clamp, since Cpx alone shows no discernable clamping activity. Their model to explain this is that Syt1 forms a ring-like oligomer that impedes full zippering of the other 'peripheral' SNARE complexes, giving Cpx the opportunity to bind and clamp them. The problem with this model is that the only experiment that might be considered to be a critical test – using the F349A mutant to destabilize the Syt1 oligomers – not only doesn't abrogate Cpx-mediated clamping, but renders Cpx clamping irreversible I don't know how to make sense of this.</p></disp-quote><p>Survival analysis shows that the Syt1<sup>Q</sup> (SNARE ‘primary’ interface) and Syt1<sup>F349A</sup> (oligomerization) mutants destabilize the Syt1 clamp and abrogate the formation of central SNAREpins but still introduce a meaningful delay in the overall fusion process. This kinetic delay is sufficient for Cpx to arrest the assembly of all available SNAREs. Thus, we observe an irreversible clamped state under these conditions. This implies that the kinetic delay introduced by Syt1, irrespective of the Syt1 clamp, is adequate for Cpx clamping function.</p><p>These data are now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and we have revised the relevant Results section as follows: “We also tested the effect of the Syt1 mutants using vesicles containing physiological VAMP2 and Syt1 copy numbers in the presence of 2 µM Cpx.

We are currently systematically testing the importance of the Syt1 and VAMP2 copy number. Preliminary analysis indicates that Syt1 clamping and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered fusion is related to the Syt1 copy number and the Syt1:VAMP2 ratio.

We advance the ‘synergistic clamping’ model as it best explains all available data (both in vitro and physiology) and is consistent with well-established structural and biochemical properties of Syt1, Cpx and SNAREs.

Thus, t-SNARE concentration is not a limiting factor in these experiments. It is worth noting that the t-SNARE concentration on the pre-synaptic membrane is not well-defined and is predicted to be in excess and thus, freely available. As noted, in most experiments, we use physiological copy numbers of Syt1and VAMP2 per vesicles. We chose 2 µM of soluble Cpx in our assay, considering its affinity to pre-fusion SNARE complexes (K<sub>d</sub> ~ 0.5 µM) and the typical concentration (2-5 µM) used in previous studies (Malsam et al., 2012; Diao et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2014).

For example, we observe the fusion clamp <italic>only</italic> in the presence of Syt1 and Cpx and the fusion clamp is altered by disruption of specific molecular properties of Syt1 (i.e. SNARE primary binding, oligomerization). It is quite possible other factors, including membranes, play a role in augmenting the observed synergistic effect of Syt1 and Cpx. This is a very interesting possibility, with wideranging implication and will be focus of our future work. As such, this is beyond the scope of the current work. We have now highlighted this possibility in the Discussion section and included the following statement: Moreover, lipid membranes may contribute to synergism or cooperativity between Syt1 and Cpx in both clamping the un-initiated fusion events and triggering rapid and synchronous fusion in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx.</p><p>Nevertheless, we wish to point out that we do not believe that synaptotagmin or SNARE-induced hemi-fusion diaphragm formation is a likely explanation for the observed clamped state. Hemi-fusion would result in partial-lipid mixing and this can be readily verified by reduction of the vesicle fluorescence (ATTO647-DOPE) and spreading of fluorescence in the outer ROI. We do NOT observe any change in vesicle fluorescence signal for the docked/un-fused vesicles. Thus, we can rule out this possibility. We have explicated this in the revised Materials and methods section as follows: We did not observe any change in ATTO-647-PE fluorescence for the vesicles that remain docked and un-fused during the observation period or post Ca<sup>2+</sup>-addition. Thus, we can rule out hemi-fusion diaphragm formation as a possible explanation for the observed ‘clamped’ or ‘un-fused’ state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discussion in the text leaves one with the impression that the Syt1 C2B LLQQ mutant has no effect in their assay.

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards to the LLQQ mutational analysis, we observe very little to no effect of LLQQ mutation on the fusion clamp under both the low-copy VAMP2 (without Cpx) and the normal VAMP2 (with 2 µM Cpx) conditions.

However, this effect was observed only under physiological VAMP2 conditions (Figure 5), but not under low copy VAMP2 conditions (Data not shown). This <italic>does</italic> suggest that the Syt1-Cpx-SNARE tripartite interaction might be important for calcium triggering mechanism, but it is not conclusive. Indeed, we are investigating this in further detail, including testing the effect of Syt1LLQQ and Syt1 quintuple mutation under varying calcium concentrations and VAMP2/Syt1 ratio with higher temporal resolution.</p><p>We do agree that we had not adequately highlighted/discussed the effect of LLQQ mutation on calcium triggering of fusion in the current manuscript. In addition to moving the relevant data into the primary figures (Figure 5), we have revised the Results section as follows: “However, the clamped Syt1Q and Syt1F349A vesicles were insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and did not fuse following Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM) addition as opposed to the rapid and synchronous fusion observed with the majority of the Syt1WT and Syt1LLQQ vesicles (Figure 5). Notably, a significant partial fraction (~25%) of the Syt1LLQQ vesicles remained un-fused even following Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition (Figure 5). This suggests that while the Syt1- Cpx-SNARE tripartite interface is not essential for establishing the fusion clamp, it is likely important in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activation mechanism”.</p><p>In addition, we have updated the relevant section in the Discussion section as follows: “We have articulated the simplest hypothesis, considering discrete ‘central’ and ‘’peripheral’ SNAREpin associated with Syt1 and Cpx, respectively. […] The tripartite interface might become more relevant in the pre-synaptic terminals (Zhou et al. 2017) where ~ 30% of Syt1 is present in the plasma membrane (Wienisch and Klingauf 2006) and other Synaptotagmins could also participate in the tripartite interface (Rothman et al. 2017; Volynski and Krishnakumar 2018; Zhou et al. 2017)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The &quot;survival percentage&quot; plots are not quantitative.

They do provide info on the Kaplan Meier estimator of survival probability, but the reader is left to assume that all the differences shown are significant. They are very likely to be significant because the effects are quite large, but one usually expects a statistical test with either a p value or confidence interval to bolster the claim that an experimental manipulation did or did not have an effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We now submit a revised manuscript incorporating the statistical test (log-rank test) of the survival curves shown in Figure 1B, Figure 4A and Figure 5A as recommended by the reviewer.</p><p>The statistical significance (p-values) for the pairwise comparison of the survival curves are shown in Table 2, Table 4 and Table 6 of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
