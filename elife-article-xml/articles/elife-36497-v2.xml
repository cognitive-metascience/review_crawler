essential for neurotransmitter release and other membrane trafficking processes. We developed a single-molecule FRET assay to monitor repeated rounds of NSF-mediated disassembly and reassembly of individual SNARE complexes. For ternary neuronal SNARE complexes, disassembly proceeds in a single step within 100 msec. We observed short- (&lt;0.32 s) and long-lived (≥0.32 s) disassembled states. The long-lived states represent fully disassembled SNARE complex, while the short-lived states correspond to failed disassembly or immediate reassembly. Either high ionic strength or decreased αSNAP concentration reduces the disassembly rate while increasing the frequency of short-lived states. NSF is also capable of disassembling anti-parallel ternary SNARE complexes, implicating it in quality control. Finally, complexin-1 competes with αSNAP binding to the SNARE complex; addition of complexin-1 has an effect similar to that of decreasing the αSNAP concentration, possibly differentially regulating cis and trans SNARE complexes disassembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic vesicle recycling</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>complexin</kwd><kwd>protein complex disassembly</kwd><kwd>single molecule FRET</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37MH63105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunger</surname><given-names>Axel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NSF is part of a membrane trafficking quality control system that disassembles both properly formed and off-pathway SNARE complexes, and the disassembly activity may be regulated by complexin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins are essential for cellular processes including membrane trafficking, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rothman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wickner and Schekman, 2008</xref>). While many of the molecules involved in these processes are known, the mechanistic details of many steps remain unclear. Here, we primarily focus on the neuronal SNAREs, synaptobrevin-2, SNAP-25A, and syntaxin-1A. SNAREs from opposing membranes assemble into a <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complex and provide the energy for membrane fusion upon zippering into a <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Subsequently, the <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complex is disassembled by the ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Block et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Malhotra et al., 1988</xref>) in combination with SNAP (<underline>s</underline>oluble <underline>N</underline>SF <underline>a</underline>ttachment <underline>p</underline>rotein) adapter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weidman et al., 1989</xref>). While there are three SNAP isoforms—αSNAP, βSNAP, and γSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clary et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Söllner et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whiteheart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>)—most in vitro studies have been carried out with αSNAP. Prior to ATP hydrolysis and together with SNAPs and the SNARE complex, NSF forms the so-called 20S complex; the structural details of the starting point for this process have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 2018</xref>). NSF and the SNAPs also disassemble other configurations of the SNARE complex, such as the binary complex consisting of the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Combined with the essential synaptic proteins Munc13 and Munc18, these four proteins comprise an essential system that produces and maintains a pool of fusogenic <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to NSF and SNAPs, several proteins interact with SNAREs, including complexin (Cpx – we primarily focus on the complexin-1 isoform), synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Misura et al., 2000</xref>), and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lai et al., 2017</xref>). Among these proteins, Cpx has by far the highest affinity for the full-length ternary SNARE complex (K<sub>D</sub> ≈ 10–100 nM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pabst et al., 2002</xref>), higher than that of αSNAP for the SNARE complex (K<sub>D</sub> ≈ 1.5 μM, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vivona et al., 2013</xref>). Functionally, Cpx plays a critical role in neurotransmitter release by activating synchronous release upon the arrival of action potential in the synaptic terminal and by regulating spontaneous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mohrmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</xref>). Structurally, Cpx forms a bipartite complex with the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), and, together with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor synaptotagmin, it forms a tripartite complex that represents a primed prefusion state of these synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). The high affinity of Cpx for the SNARE complex relative to αSNAP raises the question as to whether Cpx is involved in regulating the disassembly activity of NSF.</p><p>A variety of bulk assays have been developed to study NSF-mediated SNARE complex disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cipriano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Söllner et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2009</xref>). While informative and relatively easy to carry out, these assays provide only limited information about the reaction mechanism of a multicomponent system such as the 20S complex. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments overcome this limitation by revealing complex dynamics hidden in bulk measurements, enabling identification of individual dynamics of components or domains of the proteins as they participate in the global reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roy et al., 2008</xref>). Such smFRET experiments are thus a powerful tool to study the dynamics of NSF-mediated disassembly, as the reaction involves many moving parts undergoing large conformational changes over the course of the reaction. A previous single-molecule study monitored at most one disassembly event per individual SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>). We developed an new single-molecule approach using a linked SNARE complex where the three SNARE proteins are fused by long, flexible linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>) to enable monitoring of multiple rounds of SNARE complex disassembly and reassembly.</p><p>Here, we present results that fall into two categories. First, with respect to the development of the smFRET disassembly assay with linked SNAREs, we validate the structure of the 20S particle with linked SNAREs by cryo-EM and demonstrate that measured kinetic parameters are consistent with those obtained previously. Factors known to influence the disassembly reaction, such as ionic strength and αSNAP concentration, are explored. Second, having validated the assay, we then use it to characterize the disassembly process under new conditions. Critically, we find that off-target, anti-parallel SNARE complexes and binary (t-SNARE) complexes are disassembled at a faster rate than properly assembled ternary SNARE complexes. Finally, the addition of the high-affinity binding factor Cpx partially interferes with NSF-mediated disassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The linked SNARE complex does not interfere with 20S complex formation</title><p>We expressed synthetically-linked SNARE complex (L-SNARE) as a single polypeptide with all endogenous cysteines mutated to serines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and introduced specific cysteine mutations for labeling purposes (Materials and methods).

This reduction of the number of αSNAP molecules bound to the 20S complex was also confirmed by a gel-based assay, where the 20S complex was formed in the presence and absence of the native linker of SNAP-25A (amino acid range 86–119) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

Photobleaching events were discarded by inspection of the individual traces and omitted from the subsequent analysis of transitions in the smFRET efficiency time traces (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is an advantage over a previous smFRET assay as performed with unlinked SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>), which provides no means to readily distinguish photobleaching from disassembly. Moreover, our method does not require precise synchronization of the initiation of the disassembly process as we discard the first section of the observed smFRET efficiency time traces (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of 1 µM NSF, along with 10 µM αSNAP, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (referred to as ‘disassembly factors’), multiple transitions typically occurred between high and low FRET efficiency states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panels). Multiple rounds of NSF-mediated disassembly and reassembly can be monitored for the same L-SNARE-CC molecule due to the presence of the synthetic linkers Sp1 and Sp2. The distribution of FRET efficiencies in the time traces (referred to as point-wise FRET) for the molecules that undergo transitions reveals two major populations, referred to as high FRET and low FRET, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These two populations are well-approximated by Gaussian distributions, so we inferred two distinct conformational states for the molecules. The high FRET efficiency state corresponds to the properly assembled configuration of the L-SNARE-CC molecule, while the low FRET efficiency state corresponds to the disassembled state following NSF action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As control, if any or all the disassembly factors are omitted, constant high FRET efficiency is observed for all molecules (excluding photobleaching events) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panels, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the timescales and populations of the different L-SNARE-CC molecule states, we performed hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of the smFRET efficiency time traces of the molecules with transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McKinney et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). This particular method interprets the observed point-wise (i.e., time-binned) FRET efficiency traces in terms of as a hidden Markov process with the specified number of states. This method produces the most likely FRET values (based on a maximum likelihood approach) for these states for each individual molecule, and it also determines their interconversion rates and dwell times.</p><p>We assumed two states based on the observed point-wise FRET efficiency histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), resulting in two fitted FRET efficiencies from HMM for each of the individual molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, red line). The resulting probability distribution of the fitted FRET efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, black line) reveals two major populations (high FRET and low FRET), which are inferred from the point-wise FRET efficiency distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The dwell times of the fitted FRET efficiencies are well-distributed in the two states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To characterize the timescales of the different states, we plotted histograms of the high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) FRET efficiency dwell times. There are two distinct populations of dwell times in both histograms representing short- (&lt;0.56 s for high FRET efficiency and &lt;0.32 s for low FRET efficiency) and long-lived (≥0.56 s for high FRET efficiency and ≥0.32 s for low FRET efficiency) states. We thus calculated the populations for the four states and found that the long-lived states to be in the majority.

To overcome these limitations, we monitored the behavior of surface-tethered single SNARE complexes using FRET pairs that were covalently attached to different positions within the SNARE complex. Additionally, we studied a linked form of the SNARE complex, allowing us to observe multiple rounds of NSF-mediated disassembly and reassembly of the same molecule. This approach also distinguishes between true molecular events and events that are due to photophysics, such as photobleaching. As expected, the disassembly rates of the tethered and linked SNARE complexes (L-SNARE-CC molecules) obtained from our smFRET assay are similar to those measured in solution by other assays.</p><p>For the first time, our smFRET assay reveals two temporal states for both SNARE complex disassembly and reassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>), with the large majority of the SNARE complexes found in the long-lived states. With respect to disassembly, these long-lived states represent complete NSF-mediated disassembly, while the short-lived states are failed disassembly or disassembly followed by immediate reassembly. As for assembly, the short-lived state may correspond to a partially assembled SNARE complex (e.g., with one or more of the SNARE motifs not being fully incorporated) that reverts to the disassembled state.</p><p>High ionic strength, low αSNAP concentration, mutation of charged residues of αSNAP involved in SNARE complex binding, or addition of Cpx all have similar effects.

At a ratio of ~18:1, Cpx had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>), whereas at a ratio of ~3:1, Cpx had a substantial effect on NSF-mediated disassembly of the soluble SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2009</xref>). The presence of a membrane reduced the inhibitory effect by Cpx, presumably due to an effective local concentration increase of αSNAP as a result of its interaction with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2009</xref>). All these results point to a critical role of αSNAP and its precise stoichiometry in the NSF-mediated disassembly activity, as discussed below.</p><p>A recent EM structure of the 20S complex allowed unique assignment of the positions of the individual SNARE components and their interactions with αSNAP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 2018</xref>) revealing that two αSNAP molecules bind primarily to a portion of the surface formed by syntaxin-1A and synaptobrevin-2 in the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The EM structure of the L-20S complex reported here is similar to that of the recent EM structure of both the neuronal 20S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 2018</xref>) and the V7-20S complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, this intermolecular interaction has also been observed in another structure of the 20S complex that contained four αSNAP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). While there is at present no evidence that a 20S complex cannot form with only one αSNAP molecule, all structures of 20S complex determined thus far contain a conserved structural motif consisting of two αSNAP molecules that interact with a portion of the surface formed by syntaxin-1A and synaptovrevin-2 in the ternary SNARE complex.</p><p>How might Cpx interfere with NSF-mediated disassembly considering the available structural information? Structurally, Cpx binds to the groove between syntaxin-1A and synaptobrevin-2 helices in the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Superposition of the structure of the αSNAP/L-SNARE subcomplex of the L-20S complex with that of the SNARE/Cpx complex suggests that Cpx competes with one of the two αSNAP molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), as corroborated by a competition assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because Cpx interferes with binding of only one of the two αSNAPs to the SNARE complex, this suggests that at least two αSNAPs are required for a key step of productive disassembly. If only one αSNAP is present, disassembly might not proceed to completion, as suggested by the presence of the low FRET efficiency spikes in our smFRET experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref>). Moreover, a third αSNAP molecule may be engaged during the hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shah et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How can disassembly occur in vivo in the presence of Cpx, which is such a strong inhibitor? In the neuron, there are approximately similar expression levels of Cpx, αSNAP, γSNAP, and to a lesser degree, βSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clary et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nishiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Söllner et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whiteheart et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>). At a 1:1 molar ratio of Cpx to αSNAP, there is little NSF-mediated disassembly of the SNARE complex in our smFRET experiments (see 10 μM Cpx, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, because the concentration of SNAPs in the neuron is roughly three times higher than that of Cpx, some disassembly would take place assuming similar affinities and activities of all SNAP isoforms. Moreover, membrane binding of αSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winter et al., 2009</xref>) might further increase the local SNAP concentration at the plasma membrane where <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complexes are present, thus mitigating a possible inhibitory effect of Cpx on NSF-mediated <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complex disassembly. On the other hand, sequestration of Cpx to the synaptic vesicle via its curvature sensing C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) may increase the local Cpx concentration, effectively decreasing the local SNAP:Cpx molar ratio and leading to inhibition of unwanted NSF-mediated disassembly of <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>NSF disassembles improperly assembled SNARE complexes</title><p>In addition to disassembling ternary SNARE complexes, NSF also disassembles incomplete or improperly formed SNARE complexes. For example, by using anti-parallel reporting FRET label pairs, we observed disassembly of improper SNARE complex configurations by NSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Such anti-parallel configurations are often disassembled within one second. Interestingly, an atomic force microscopy study reported that the stability of an anti-parallel ternary SNARE complex is three-fold lower than the properly assembled parallel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We speculate that the fast disassembly rate observed for anti-parallel configurations is related to their lower stability.</p><p>Using the binary t-SNARE (syntaxin-1A/SNAP-25A) complex as an example, we also studied the disassembly of incomplete SNARE complexes. Our experiments revealed the presence of relatively long-lived intermediate states during NSF-mediated disassembly of the binary t-SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Occasionally, the system reverted to the previous state instead of proceeding to full disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similarly, we observed such intermediates during spontaneous reassembly. Although we did not observe intermediate states during NSF-mediated disassembly of the ternary SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), they may occur on a faster timescale (i.e., faster than 100 msec) than is currently observable with our apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our single-molecule experiments revealed two temporal states (short- and long-lived) of SNARE complexes for both NSF-mediated disassembly and spontaneous reassembly that are influenced by various conditions, such as αSNAP and Cpx concentration. The long-lived states represent stable assembled and disassembled states of the SNARE complex, while the short-lived states represent incomplete or improper states. Future technical improvements may expand the accessible timescales of the assay, enabling further dissection of the short-lived transitions. Furthermore, our approach could be useful not only in the study of the effect of other accessory proteins in the disassembly process, but also in the study of the motions of NSF correlated with disassembly through analysis of intermolecular FRET between labeled SNARE complex and NSF. Together with the static structures from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, the dynamics extracted from these smFRET studies will ultimately provide a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of NSF-mediated disassembly of the SNARE complex, an essential process in the membrane fusion cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Proteins: plasmids, expression, and purification</title><p>The linked SNARE complex (L-SNARE) is composed of the cytoplasmic domain of rat syntaxin-1A (residues 181 to 262), mouse full-length SNAP-25A, and the cytoplasmic domain of rat synaptobrevin-2 (residue 25 to 96) linked by two synthetic linkers, Sp1 (<named-content content-type="sequence">GGSNRSGGSDSGGSGSQGSSGAGGSLNSKSSGGSGGSANSTASNSGQGSGGIEGLSGG</named-content>) and Sp2 (<named-content content-type="sequence">SGGSGNRGGSDSGGSGGIEGLGGQSSGASGGLKNSGSGGSGGSNATSASNSGQGSSGGG</named-content>), and terminated with an Avi-tag sequence (<named-content content-type="sequence">GSGGGSGGSGGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE</named-content>) at the C-terminus of synaptobrevin-2 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zorman et al., 2014</xref>).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NSF-mediated disassembly of on and off-pathway SNARE complexes, and inhibition by complexin&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, a Reviewing Editor, and by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor and Reviewer #2. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yongli Zhang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Your manuscript has been evaluated by three experts and after extensive consultation, we have decided to invite a revision that addresses the following major issues. Most of the issues require rewriting the text to highlights the caveats and means to address them experimentally, if possible.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the assay provides new insight into the life time of the assembled and disassembled states of SNARE proteins under NSF action, the paper often omits a molecular explanation for the individual states and their transition events or draws conclusions that are not directly supported by the presented data. For example, it remains unexplained why αSNAP affects not only the disassembly but also the kinetics of the assembly process (Figure 3I,J). This issue should be clarified and discussed. Is there an experiment that can address this issue? If not, then please clarify?</p><p>2) Furthermore, the authors show that addition of complexin specifically shortens the lifetime of the low FRET efficiency state without changing the high FRET dwell time. The latter one reflects the life time of the assembled SNARE complex. Yet, the authors conclude that complexin inhibits the NSF-mediated disassembly kinetics of the SNARE complex, which seems to be at odds to the presented data. They furthermore suggest that complexin action may lead to incomplete SNARE disassembly but provide no evidence for states of intermediate FRET efficiency as observed for binary complex disassembly (e.g. Figure 7). Indeed, the results rather favour the view that complexin specifically facilitates the assembly of ternary SNARE complexes without changing disassembly kinetics. Please explain.</p><p>3) In this context, the exemplary trace shown in Figure 6B (10 µM Cpx WT) shows a high FRET state that is frequently interrupted by spike-like low FRET deflections without having an impact on the frequency distribution of the high FRET dwell time (Figure 6E). Here, it is also important to note that the manuscript provides no information regarding important constraints used in the analysis like thresholding of the transition states, signal-to-noise ratio etc. Please explain.</p><p>4) In the context of the observed competition between complexin and the SNAP variants for binding to the ternary SNARE complex, the authors suggest that curvature sensing C-terminal domain of complexin may sequester the protein to vesicles, thus effectively increasing the SNAP:complexin molar ratio – a favorable scenario for SNARE complex disassembly. However, previous studies have shown that vesicle association of complexin increases its 'effective' concentration at the site of action (Wragg et al., 2013) and that the vesicular localization of the protein is a prerequisite for its inhibitory action (e.g. Gong et al., 2016). Thus, it is not clear why the authors now propose that it is membrane binding of complexin that facilitates αSNAP-mediated SNARE disassembly and fusion. Please clarify this point.</p><p>5) In their manuscript the authors consistently cite White et al., 2018, manuscript in preparation, even for some of their major conclusions. While it is often helpful to mention corroborating evidences to strengthen conclusions drawn in the paper, it is impossible for reviewers or readers to determine the significance of this citation as it is yet to be published. Please limit the citation of this unpublished work.</p><p>6) The manuscript is entirely devoid of any statistical analysis. Furthermore, it remains often unclear whether averages were determined over the entire number of life time states, recording epochs or over the number of independent experiments, the latter would be most valid. For normally distributed parameters the naturally occurring scatter (determined as SD/mean=coefficient of variation) increases with increasing amplitude of the signal, which is not found in Figure 3C, H. Please explain this phenomenon. New statistics should be presented in the corresponding figure legends or the main body of the text.</p><p>7) Short-lived low-FRET states are frequently observed under many experimental conditions: at high NaCl concentrations, at low αSNAP concentrations, and in the presence of mutant αSNAP or 10 μm complexin. The authors interpreted these states to be partially disassembled SNARE states or failed disassembly. Although this interpretation is reasonable, an alternative explanation is possible. Are these short-lived states simply caused by fast SNARE reassembly upon full SNARE disassembly? Please explain this.</p><p>8) The authors speculated that, at a low αSNAP concentration, &quot;the unproductive low FRET efficiency spikes may be a consequence of an only partially occupied second α-SNAP site&quot; (subsection “Lowering the αSNAP concentration decreases the disassembly activity”). Are the spikes caused by binding of only one αSNAP? The authors have clearly shown that SNARE complexes contain multiple binding sites for αSNAP. αSNAP binding to different sites and different binding stoichiometry may lead to different disassembly pathways and kinetics. Please rewrite the text to better explain the data with caveats that help will resolve this issue.</p><p>9) Regarding t-SNARE disassembly, Figure 7B shows fast t-SNARE conformational transitions. It is not obvious how much NSF contributes to these transitions, because t-SNARE complexes alone exhibits fast transitions (Weninger et al., 2008). It may be useful to compare the FRET traces with and without NSF-dependent disassembly activity. In addition, NSF does not seem to significantly increase the populations of the low FRET states (the unfolded t-SNARE states), especially for the CC2 construct (compare Figure 7E and Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). In contrast, the intermediate state appears to be a distinct state caused by NSF. Does NSF only partially disassemble the t-SNARE complex? Can this be tested experimentally?</p><p>10) The SNARE disassembly assay was carried out at the membrane surface. It is known that αSNAP binds membranes, which can greatly accelerate the rate of SNARE disassembly by NSF (Winter et al., 2009). However, the Discussion section seems to suggest that membrane binding does not play an important role in this assay. Does membrane binding contribute to the NSF activity reported in this work? If membrane binding is important, it may be illustrated in some of the diagrams, such as Figure 6A. Please address this by better explanation and redoing Figure 6A.</p><p>11) The authors showed evidence that two αSNAP molecules bind to the interface between syntaxin and VAMP2, which is very interesting. The evidence is consistent with recent observations that αSNAP stabilizes zippered SNARE complex (Ma et al., 2016) and Sec17 promotes membrane fusion (Zick et al., 2015). However, the fact that NSF disassembles all SNARE complexes, mis-assembled SNARE complexes, and t-SNARE complexes (with a broken interface) indicates certain plasticity in binding between αSNAP and SNARE complexes, including binding stoichiometry and site (Vivona et al., 2013). Please discuss this feature.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is one of the most interesting papers I have ever read on the kinetics of SNARE disassembly by NSF. In this paper, Brunger et al. reported a new assay to accurately detect dynamic SNARE disassembly by NSF and spontaneous SNARE reassembly. Using a SNARE construct that joins three neuronal SNARE proteins into one polypeptide, they could detect repetitive NSF-dependent disassembly of a single SNARE complex by single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer (smFRET). This assay revealed many important findings: (1) Two αSNAP molecules binds to each SNARE complex, as opposed to four αSNAP molecules previous reported for a SNARE complex containing SNAP-25 without its linker region. (2) High NaCl and low αSNAP concentrations reduce the disassembly rate. (3) Complexin attenuates SNARE disassembly. (4) NSF efficiently disassembles t-SNARE complexes and mis-assembled SNARE complexes. The data are elegant, well presented, clearly described, and support the main conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors present a quantitative assay to measure dynamics of SNARE assembly and disassembly. The data are of high quality and important for a comprehensive understanding of the SNARE mediated membrane fusion. The authors findings clarify an important issue pertaining to the function of complexins in SNARE assembly reaction. The authors data show nicely that complexins compete with one of the two αa-SNAP molecules in the SNARE complex and compete with NSF mediated disassembly.</p><p>The findings are relatively straightforward and merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Choi et al. addresses the role of the ATPase NSF in ternary and binary SNARE complex disassembly, using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. The authors have devised a new experimental set up to observe multiple rounds of SNARE assembly and their NSF-mediated disassembly by covalently linking the individual SNARE proteins with flexible linkers. By this, the manuscript lines up in a row of important contributions over the last years studying the mechanism of NSF mediated SNARE complex recycling (Ryu et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015).</p><p>The manuscript by Choi et al., shows that disassembly of single ternary SNARE complexes is sensitive to ionic strength of the milieu, concentration of the NSF co-factor αSNAP and to mutations in αSNAP that mask its electrostatic interaction with negative surface charges on the SNARE complex. (See also Zhao et al., 2015.)</p><p>Furthermore, the authors report that complexin 1 decreases the disassembly activity of NSF in a concentration dependent manner, with very short-lived low FRET spikes (reflecting the dissociated state of the SNARE proteins) at high complexin 1 concentration (10µM). Comparing the superimposed structures of α-SNAP/SNARE complex with those of complexin/SNARE complexes the authors posited that complexin may compete with αSNAP for SNARE complex interaction.</p><p>While the majority of experiments are well done, I still have substantial concerns that should be addressed before consideration for publication.</p><p>1) Although the assay provides new insight into the life time of the assembled and disassembled states of SNARE proteins under NSF action, the paper often omits a molecular explanation for the individual states and their transition events or draws conclusions that are not directly supported by the presented data.

The particular method (McKinney et al.) interprets the observed point-wise (i.e., time-binned) FRET efficiency traces in terms of as a hidden Markov process with the specified number of states. This method produces the most likely FRET efficiency values (based on a maximum likelihood approach) for these states for each individual molecule, and also determines their interconversion rates and dwell times. The apparent increase in low-FRET dwell time that we reported in our original submission is due to a redistribution of long-lived (i.e., lasting many seconds) and short-lived (lasting ≲ sec) low-FRET states. The HMM analysis is described in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we analyzed the number of SNARE complexes that do not undergo any disassembly event during their respective observation periods.</p><p>At low αSNAP concentration, the fraction of molecules that do not undergo any disassembly increases, and mostly short-lived states are observed, whereas at higher αSNAP concentration, many long-lived low-FRET (i.e., disassembled) states are observed. We interpret the short-lived states as failed disassembly attempts or assembly with immediate reassembly. At a low level of αSNAP concentration, the assembly rate of the SNARE complex is difficult to measure because few instances of long-lived, low-FRET efficiency exist, thereby preventing assessment of αSNAP on SNARE complex assembly. In other words, the convolution of the non-productive disassembly spikes as well as the full disassembly events in the previous version of the manuscript gave the false impression of an increase in the reassembly rate. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><p>Possible molecular explanations for our observed single molecule results have been added to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, the authors show that addition of complexin specifically shortens the lifetime of the low FRET efficiency state without changing the high FRET dwell time.

Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. As mentioned above, we reanalyzed our data with HMM and also analyzed the fraction of SNARE complex molecules that do not undergo any disassembly events. The analysis shows that at higher complexin concentration, the fraction of molecules without disassembly events increases, and the short-lived, low-FRET efficiency states dominate over long-lived low-FRET efficiency states, (i.e., complexin has a similar effect as lowering the αSNAP concentration). While we cannot rule out an additional effect of complexin on SNARE complex reassembly, the competition experiment (Figure 6 – —figure supplement 1) clearly shows that complexin displaces αSNAP, which in turn will lower the efficiency of NSF-mediated SNARE complex disassembly. These results explain the apparent increase in reassembly rate in the previous version of the manuscript, as discussed in the previous point. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In this context, the exemplary trace shown in Figure 6B (10 µM Cpx WT) shows a high FRET state that is frequently interrupted by spike-like low FRET deflections without having an impact on the frequency distribution of the high FRET dwell time (Figure 6E).

We made initial guesses for FRET efficiency states for HMM by inspecting the point-wise FRET histograms. The algorithm then refines these estimates to fit the data using a maximum likelihood approach. Additionally, HMM was used to distinguish between processes with short- and long-lived dwell times of instances of high and low FRET efficiency. We determined the partition between the short- and long-lived processes by identifying local minima of the dwell-time distributions.

Our EM structures suggests that between 2 and 4 αSNAPs are bound in the initial state (Zhao et al., 2015; White, et al., 2018). Even if initially only two αSNAPs are bound in the 20S complex, an additional αSNAP molecule may be engaged during the disassembly process (Shah et al., 2015). It is possible, or even likely, that the short-lived low-FRET states at low αSNAP concentration correspond to the presence of one αSNAP, which would be insufficient for complete disassembly.

We do not intend to suggest that membrane binding does not play a role in NSF/αSNAP mediated SNARE complex disassembly.

However, for SNARE complexes that do not contain a SNAP-25 linker such as the SNARE complex involved in vacuolar membrane fusion, the αSNAP number in the initial 20S complex may be higher (Lobingier et al., 2014). Moreover, additional αSNAP molecules may be engaged during the hydrolysis cycle (Shah et al., 2015).”</p><p>Additionally, charged surfaces of the SNAPs (positive) and SNARE complex (negative) likely underlie binding. Unlike a lock-and-key style model for binding specificity, an electrostatic model could accommodate a wide variety of SNARE complexes in various combinations and orientations. This model is supported by the charge mutations in αSNAP presented here as well as by detailed structural analysis of the electrostatic surfaces as presented in the White et al., (2018) manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
