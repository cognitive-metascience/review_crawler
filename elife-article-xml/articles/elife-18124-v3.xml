dynamic microtubules and integrin-based adhesions to the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cell polarity and migration. Microtubules regulate the turnover of adhesion sites, and, in turn, focal adhesions promote the cortical microtubule capture and stabilization in their vicinity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that cortical microtubule stabilization sites containing CLASPs, KIF21A, LL5β and liprins are recruited to focal adhesions by the adaptor protein KANK1, which directly interacts with the major adhesion component, talin. Structural studies showed that the conserved KN domain in KANK1 binds to the talin rod domain R7. Perturbation of this interaction, including a single point mutation in talin, which disrupts KANK1 binding but not the talin function in adhesion, abrogates the association of microtubule-stabilizing complexes with focal adhesions. We propose that the talin-KANK1 interaction links the two macromolecular assemblies that control cortical attachment of actin fibers and microtubules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18124.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18124.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells are organized into tissues and organs. A scaffold-like framework outside of the cells called the extracellular matrix provides support to the cells and helps to hold them in place. Cells attach to the extracellular matrix via structures called focal adhesions on the cell surface; these structures contain a protein called talin.</p><p>For a cell to be able to move, the existing focal adhesions must be broken down and new adhesions allowed to form. This process is regulated by the delivery and removal of different materials along fibers called microtubules. Microtubules can usually grow and shrink rapidly, but near focal adhesions they are captured at the surface of the cell and become more stable. However, it is not clear how focal adhesions promote microtubule capture and stability.</p><p>Bouchet et al. found that a protein called KANK1 binds to the focal adhesion protein talin in human cells grown in a culture dish. This allows KANK1 to recruit microtubules to the cell surface around the focal adhesions by binding to particular proteins that are associated with microtubules. Disrupting the interaction between KANK1 and talin by making small alterations in these two proteins blocked the ability of focal adhesions to capture surrounding microtubules. The next step following on from this work will be to find out whether this process also takes place in the cells within an animal’s body, such as a fly or a mouse.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

matrix support epithelial integrity and cell migration, and also provide signaling hubs that coordinate cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hynes, 1992</xref>). Integrin-based adhesions (focal adhesions, FAs) are large macromolecular assemblies, in which the cytoplasmic tails of integrins are connected to the actin cytoskeleton. One of the major components of FAs is talin, a ~2500 amino acid dimeric protein, which plays a key role in adhesion formation by activating integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthis et al., 2009</xref>), coupling them to cytoskeletal actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2015</xref>), regulating adhesion dynamics and recruiting different structural and signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wehrle-Haller, 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the major cytoskeletal element associated with FAs is actin, microtubules also play an important role in adhesion by regulating the FA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaverina et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krylyshkina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Small and Kaverina, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stehbens and Wittmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). The recent proteomics work showed that microtubule-FA cross-talk strongly depends on the activation state of the integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byron et al., 2015</xref>). Microtubules can affect adhesions by serving as tracks for delivery of exocytotic carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>), by controlling endocytosis required for adhesion disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezratty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Theisen et al., 2012</xref>) and by regulating the local activity of signaling molecules such as Rho GTPases (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaverina and Straube, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stehbens and Wittmann, 2012</xref>]).</p><p>In contrast to actin, which is directly coupled to FAs, microtubules interact with the plasma membrane sites that surround FAs. A number of proteins have been implicated in microtubule attachment and stabilization in the vicinity of FAs. Among them are the microtubule plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) CLASP1/2 and the spectraplakin MACF1/ACF7, which are targeted to microtubule tips by EB1, and a homologue of EB1, EB2, which binds to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drabek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kodama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>). The interaction of CLASPs with the cell cortex depends on the phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-interacting protein LL5β, to which CLASPs bind directly, and is partly regulated by PI-3 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>). Other components of the same cortical assembly are the scaffolding proteins liprin-α1 and β1, a coiled-coil adaptor ELKS/ERC1, and the kinesin-4 KIF21A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). Both liprins and ELKS are best known for their role in organizing presynaptic secretory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hida and Ohtsuka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spangler and Hoogenraad, 2007</xref>); in agreement with this function, ELKS is required for efficient constitutive exocytosis in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2011</xref>). LL5β, liprins and ELKS form micrometer-sized cortical patch-like structures, which will be termed here cortical microtubule stabilization complexes, or CMSCs. The CMSCs are strongly enriched at the leading cell edges, where they localize in close proximity of FAs but do not overlap with them ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</xref>]). They represent a subclass of the previously defined plasma membrane-associated platforms (PMAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</xref>), which have overlapping components such as liprins, but may not be necessarily involved in microtubule regulation, as is the case for liprin-ELKS complexes in neurons, where they are part of cytomatrix at the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundelfinger and Fejtova, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the importance of the CMSC-FA cross-talk. In migrating keratinocytes, LL5β and CLASPs accumulate around FAs and promote their disassembly by targeting the exocytosis of matrix metalloproteases to FA vicinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, liprin-α1, LL5α/β and ELKS localize to protrusions of human breast cancer cells and are required for efficient cell migration and FA turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astro et al., 2014</xref>). In polarized epithelial cells, LL5β and CLASPs are found in the proximity of the basal membrane, and this localization is controlled by the integrin activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hotta et al., 2010</xref>). CLASP and LL5-mediated anchoring of MTs to the basal cortex also plays a role during chicken embryonic development, where it prevents the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakaya et al., 2013</xref>). LL5β, CLASPs and ELKS were also shown to concentrate at podosomes, actin-rich structures, which can remodel the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proszynski and Sanes, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, LL5β-containing podosome-like structures are also formed at neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Proszynski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proszynski and Sanes, 2013</xref>), and the complexes of LL5β and CLASPs were shown to capture microtubule plus ends and promote delivery of acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While the roles of CMSCs in migrating cells and in tissues are becoming increasingly clear, the mechanism underlying their specific targeting to integrin adhesion sites remains elusive. Recently, we found that liprin-β1 interacts with KANK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>), one of the four members of the KANK family of proteins, which were proposed to act as tumor suppressors and regulators of cell polarity and migration through Rho GTPase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kakinuma et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2009</xref>). KANK1 recruits the kinesin-4 KIF21A to CMSCs, which inhibits microtubule polymerization and prevents microtubule overgrowth at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakinuma and Kiyama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, KANK1 participates in clustering of the other CMSC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found that KANK1 is required for the association of the CMSCs with FAs. The association of KANK1 with FAs depends on the KN domain, a conserved 30 amino acid polypeptide sequence present in the N-termini of all KANK proteins. Biochemical and structural analysis showed that the KN domain interacts with the R7 region of the talin rod. Perturbation of this interaction both from the KANK1 and the talin1 side prevented the accumulation of CMSC complexes around focal adhesions and affected microtubule organization around FAs. We propose that KANK1 molecules, recruited by talin to the outer rims of FA, serve as 'seeds' for organizing other CMSC components in the FA vicinity through multivalent interactions between these components. This leads to co-organization of two distinct cortical assemblies, FAs and CMSCs, responsible for the attachment of actin and microtubules, respectively, and ensures effective cross-talk between the two types of cytoskeletal elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of talin1 as a KANK1 binding partner</title><p>Our previous work showed that the endogenous KANK1 colocalizes with LL5β, liprins and KIF21A in cortical patches that are closely apposed to, but do not overlap with FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed these results both in HeLa cells and the HaCaT immortal keratinocyte cell line, in which CMSC components CLASPs and LL5β were previously shown to strongly cluster around FAs and regulate their turnover during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Inhibition of myosin-II with blebbistatin, which reduces tension on the actin fibers and affects the activation state of FA molecules, such as integrins and talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>), caused not only FA disassembly but also a strong reduction in clustering of CMSC components at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate this effect in more detail, we partially inhibited contractility using a Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibitor, Y-27632 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>). In these conditions, the number of FAs was not affected although their size was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). This treatment was sufficient to diminish CMSC clustering at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,F</xref>). Interestingly, at the same time we observed a very significant increase in the overlap of KANK1 with FA adhesion markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,G</xref>). Live imaging of KANK1 together with the FA marker paxillin showed a gradual redistribution of KANK1 into the areas occupied by FAs upon ROCK1 inhibitor-induced attenuation of contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). These data indicate that the organization of CMSCs at the cell cortex might be controlled by interactions with tension-sensitive components of FAs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The KN motif of KANK1 interacts with the R7 domain of talin1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of KANK1 and the deletion mutants used in this study, and the summary of their interactions and localization.

KANK1 comprises an N-terminal KANK family-specific domain of unknown function, the KN domain (residues 30–68) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakinuma et al., 2009</xref>), a coiled coil region, the N-terminal part of which interacts with liprin-β1, and a C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, which binds to KIF21A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>), while the rest of the protein is predicted to be unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, the KN domain alone strongly and specifically accumulated within FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A similar localization was also seen with a somewhat larger N-terminal fragment of KANK1, Nter, as well as the Nter-CC1 deletion mutant, which contained the first, liprin-β1-binding coiled coil region of KANK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). However, an even larger N-terminal part of KANK1, encompassing the whole coiled coil domain (Nter-CC) showed a pronounced enrichment at the FA rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The KANK1 deletion mutant missing only the C-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (△ANKR) was completely excluded from FAs but accumulated in their immediate vicinity, similar to the full-length KANK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). A tight ring-like localization at the outer rim of FAs was also observed with a KANK1 mutant, which completely missed the coiled coil region but contained the ankyrin repeat domain (△CC), while the mutant which missed just the KN domain showed no accumulation around FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To test whether the exclusion of larger KANK1 fragments from the FA core was simply due to the protein size, we fused GFP-tagged KN domain to the bacterial protein β-D-galactosidase (LacZ), but found that this fusion accumulated inside and not around FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since GFP-KN-LacZ and GFP-KANK1-△ANKRD have a similar size (1336 and 1400 amino acids, respectively), but one accumulates inside FAs, while the other is excluded to their periphery, this result suggests that features other than the mere protein size determine the specific localization of KANK1 to the FA rim. We conclude that the KN domain of KANK1 has an affinity for FAs, but the presence of additional KANK1 sequences prevents the accumulation of the protein inside FAs and instead leads to the accumulation of KANK1 at the FA periphery.</p><p>To identify the potential FA-associated partners of KANK1, we co-expressed either full-length KANK1 or its N-terminal and C-terminal fragments fused to GFP and a biotinylation (Bio) tag together with biotin ligase BirA in HEK293T cells and performed streptavidin pull down assays combined with mass spectrometry. In addition to the already known binding partners of KANK1, such as KIF21A, liprins and LL5β, we identified talin1 among the strongest hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Talin2 was also detected in a pull down with the KANK1 N-terminus though not with the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The interaction between KANK1 and talin1 was confirmed by Western blotting, and subsequent deletion mapping showed that the talin1-binding region of KANK1 encompasses the KN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>), while liprin-β1 binds to the N-terminal part of the coiled coil domain, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analysis of the KN domain showed that it is predicted to form a helix and contains a completely conserved leucine aspartic acid-motif (LD-motif) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>). The LD-motifs in RIAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goult et al., 2013</xref>), DLC1 and Paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>) have recently been identified as talin-binding sites that all interact with talin via a helix addition mechanism. Alignment of the KN domain of KANK with the LD-motif of DLC1, RIAM and Paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>) revealed that the hydrophobic residues that mediate interaction with talin are present in the KN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Using deletion analysis, we mapped the KANK1-binding site of talin1 to the central region of the talin rod, comprising the R7-R8 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This R7-R8 region of talin is unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gingras et al., 2010</xref>), as the 4-helix bundle R8 is inserted into a loop of the 5-helix bundle R7, and thus protrudes from the linear chain of 5-helix bundles of the talin rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). This R8 domain serves as a binding hub for numerous proteins including vinculin, synemin and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>). R8 also contains a prototypic recognition site for LD-motif proteins, including DLC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), Paxillin and RIAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the presence of the LD-binding site, we anticipated that KANK1 would also interact with R8. However, deletion mapping revealed that KANK1 in fact binds to the talin1 rod domain R7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), suggesting that KANK1 interacts with a novel binding site on talin1.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biochemical and structural characterization of the Talin-KANK interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Talin1, with F-actin, β-integrin and vinculin binding sites highlighted.

The addition of the KANK1(30–60) peptide resulted in large spectral changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), most of which were in the slow exchange regime on the NMR timescale indicative of a tight interaction. In agreement with the pull down data, the signals that shifted in slow exchange upon the addition of KANK1(30–60) mapped largely onto the R7 domain with only small progressive shift changes evident on R8. To validate R7 as the major KANK1-binding site on talin, we repeated the NMR experiments using the individual domains, R8 (residues 1461–1580) and R7 (residues 1359–1659 Δ1454–1586). Addition of KANK1(30–60) induced small chemical shift changes on the R8 domain indicative of a weak interaction (most likely due to the interaction of LD with the LD-recognition box on R8). However, the addition of a 0.5 molar ratio of KANK1(30–60) to R7 induced large spectral changes with many of the peaks displaying two locations, corresponding to the free peak position and the bound peak position. This is indicative of slow-exchange and confirms a high affinity interaction between R7 and KANK1. The KN peptide is the first identified ligand for the R7 domain.</p><p>NMR chemical shifts also provide information on the residues involved in the interaction, as the peaks in the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum pertain to individual residues in the protein. To map these chemical shift changes onto the structure of R7-R8, it was first necessary to complete the backbone chemical shift assignments of the R7 domain. This was achieved using conventional triple resonance experiments as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banno et al., 2012</xref>), using <sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N labeled R7. The chemical shift changes mapped predominantly onto one face of R7, comprised of helices 2 and 5 of the 5-helix bundle (talin rod helices 29 and 36), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>.</p><p>Our recent elucidation of the interaction between the LD-motif of DLC1 and talin R8 has generated insight into how LD-motifs are recognized by helical bundles (PDB ID. 5FZT, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>]). In the DLC1:talin R8 complex the DLC1 peptide adopts a helical conformation that packs against two helices on the side of the helical bundle. It is becoming increasingly clear that other LD-motif proteins bind to talin through a similar interaction mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zacharchenko et al., 2016</xref>). The surface of α2 and α5 on R7 forms a hydrophobic groove that the KANK1 helix docks into. A striking feature of this KANK1 binding surface is that the two helices are held apart by the conserved aromatic residues, W1630 at the end of α5 and Y1389 at the end of α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,E</xref>). W1630 and Y1389 thus essentially serve as molecular rulers, separating helices α2 and α5 by ~8Å (compared with ~5–6Å for the other bundles in R7-R8). The spacing between the two helices is enhanced further as the residues on the inner helical faces, S1400, G1404, S1411 on α2 and S1637 and S1641 on α5, have small side chains which have the effect of creating two conserved pockets midway along the hydrophobic groove of the KANK1-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>The talin-binding site on KANK1 is unusual as it contains a double LD-motif, LDLD. The structure of R7 revealed a potential LD-recognition box with the positive charges, K1401 and R1652 positioned on either side to engage either one, or both, of the aspartic residues. Using the docking program HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Zundert et al., 2016</xref>), we sought to generate a structural model of the KANK1/R7 complex, using the chemical shift mapping on R7 and a model of KANK1(30–60) as a helix (created by threading the KANK1 sequence onto the DLC1 LD-motif helix). This analysis indicated that the KANK-LD helix can indeed pack against the sides of α2 and α5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, all of the models, irrespective of which way the KANK1 helix ran along the surface, positioned the bulky aromatic residue, Y48 in KANK1, in the hydrophobic pocket created by G1404. This raised the possibility that mutation of G1404 to a bulky hydrophobic residue might block KANK1 binding by preventing Y48 engagement. We also noticed that S1641, one of the small residues that create the pocket, has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ratnikov et al., 2005</xref>) and might have a regulatory function in the KANK1-talin1 interaction.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we generated a series of point mutants in talin R7 and also in the KANK1 KN-domain, designed to disrupt the talinR7/KANK1 interaction. On the KANK1 side, we mutated the LDLD motif to AAAA, (the KANK1-4A mutant), while on the talin1 side, we generated a series of R7 mutants. These included G1404L, in which a bulky hydrophobic residue was introduced instead of glycine to occlude the hydrophobic pocket in R7, S1641E, a phosphomimetic mutant aimed to test the role of talin phosphorylation in regulating KANK1 binding, and W1630A, a substitution that would remove one of the molecular rulers holding α2 and α5 helices apart at a fixed distance. These mutants were introduced into talin1 R7-R8 and the structural integrity of the mutated proteins confirmed using NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The relative binding affinities were measured using an in vitro fluorescence polarization assay. In this assay, the KANK1(30–60) peptide is fluorescently labeled with BODIPY and titrated with an increasing concentration of talin R7-R8, and the binding between the two polypeptides results in an increase in the fluorescence polarization signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The KANK1-4A mutant abolished binding to talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). The S1641E mutant had only a small effect on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that either talin1 phosphorylation does not play a major role in modulating the interaction with KANK1 or that the S-E mutation is not a good phosphomimetic, possibly because phosphorylation might also affect helix formation integrity, an effect not mimicked by a single aspartate residue. However, strikingly, both the W1630A and the G1404L mutants abolished binding of KANK1 to talin R7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), confirming the validity of our model. Finally, we also tested whether the KN-R7 interaction is conserved in talin2 and KANK2, and found that this was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that the conserved KN domain of KANKs is a talin-binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Talin1-KANK1 interaction controls cortical organization of CMSC components</title><p>Next, we set out to test the importance of the identified interactions in a cellular context by using the KANK1-4A and the talin G1404L mutants. We chose the G1404L talin mutant over W1630A for our cellular studies, because removing the bulky tryptophan from the hydrophobic core of the R7 might have the off target effect of perturbing the mechanical stability of R7, and our recent studies showed that the mechanostability of R7 is important for protecting R8 from force-induced talin extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). As could be expected based on the binding experiments with purified protein fragments, the 4A mutation reduced the interaction of the full-length KANK1 with talin1 in a pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). An even stronger reduction was observed when KANK-△CC or the KN alone were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Rescue experiments were performed using GFP-KANK1, resistant for the used siRNAs due to several silent mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>), or its 4A mutant. We also included in this analysis a KANK1 mutant lacking the liprin-β1-binding coiled coil domain (the △CC deletion mutant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and the 4A-version of the KANK1-△CC deletion mutant. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)-based live imaging showed that, consistent with our previous results, the GFP-tagged wild type KANK1 strongly accumulated in cortical patches that were tightly clustered around FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The KANK1-△CC mutant, which lacked the liprin-β1-binding site but contained an intact KN motif, showed highly specific ring-like accumulations at the rims of FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In contrast, KANK1-4A was not clustered anymore around FAs but was dispersed over the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The KANK1-△CC-4A mutant, lacking both the liprin-β1 and the talin-binding sites, and the KN-4A mutant were completely diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>To test the impact of the talin1-G1404L mutant, we depleted both talin1 and talin2, which are co-expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and rescued them by introducing mouse GFP-talin1, which was resistant to used siRNAs. The depletion of the two talin proteins resulted in a dramatic loss of FAs and cell detachment from coverslips (data not shown), in agreement with the well-established essential role of talin1 in FA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calderwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, in this experiment only cells expressing GFP-talin1 displayed normal attachment and spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The GFP-talin1-G1404L mutant could fully support cell attachment and spreading, although the cell area was slightly increased compared to cells rescued with the wild type GFP-talin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). The number and size of focal adhesions were not significantly different between the cells rescued with the wild type talin1 or its G1404L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), indicating that the mutant is functional in supporting FA formation. Strikingly, while in cells expressing the wild-type talin1, KANK1 was prominently clustered around FAs, it was dispersed over the plasma membrane in cells expressing talin1-G1404L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that perturbing the KANK1-talin interaction, including the use of a single point mutation in the ~2500 amino acid long talin1 protein, which does not interfere with the talin function in FA formation, abrogates KANK1 association with FAs.</p><p>We next tested whether mislocalization of KANK1 due to the perturbation of KANK1-talin1 binding affected other CMSC components. The localization of GFP-KANK1 and its mutants relative to FAs labeled with endogenous markers was very similar to that described above based on live imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Co-depletion of KANK1 and KANK2 abolished clustering of CMSC components, such as LL5β and KIF21A at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Wild type GFP-KANK1 could rescue cortical clustering of these proteins in KANK1 and KANK2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). However, this was not the case for the KANK1-4A mutant, the KANK1-△CC mutant or the KANK1 version bearing both mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Importantly, the dispersed puncta of the KANK1-4A mutant still colocalized with LL5β, as the binding to liprin-β1 was intact in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), while the FA-associated rings of KANK1-△CC, the mutant deficient in liprin-β1 binding, showed a mutually exclusive localization with LL5β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, KIF21A, which binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of KANK1, could still colocalize with KANK1-△CC at FA rims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The overall accumulation of KIF21A at the cell periphery was, however, reduced, in line with the strongly reduced KANK1 peripheral clusters observed with the KANK1-△CC mutant. The diffuse localization of the KANK1-4A-△CC mutant led to the strongly dispersed distribution of the CMSC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Furthermore, only the full-length wild type KANK1, but neither the 4A nor △CC mutant could support efficient accumulation of CLASP2 at the peripheral cell cortex in KANK1 and KANK2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), in line with the fact that cortical recruitment of CLASPs depends on LL5β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>KANK1-talin interaction is required for recruiting CMSCs to FAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Widefield fluorescence images of HeLa cells depleted of KANK1 and KANK2 and expressing the indicated siRNA-resistant GFP-KANK1 fusions (rescue), stained for the FA marker phospho-tyrosine (pY).

These data indicate that in addition to binding to talin1, the localization of CMSC clusters depends on the KANK1-liprin-β1 connection. This notion is supported by the observation that the overexpressed coiled coil region of KANK1 (CC1), which can compete for liprin-β1 binding but cannot interact with talin1, acted as a very potent dominant negative, which suppressed accumulation of LL5β at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). We conclude that the core CMSC protein LL5β as well as the microtubule-binding CMSC components KIF21A and CLASP2 depend on the KANK1 interaction with both talin1 and liprin-β1 for their efficient clustering in the vicinity of focal adhesions at the cell periphery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disruption of KANK1-talin1 binding perturbs microtubule plus end organization at the cell periphery</title><p>We next investigated the impact of the disruption of KANK1-talin1 interaction on microtubule organization.

In this cell line, microtubules grow rapidly in the central parts of the cell, while at the cell margin, where CMSCs cluster in the vicinity of peripheral FAs, microtubule plus ends are tethered to the cortex and display persistent but slow growth due to the combined action of several types of microtubule regulators, including CLASPs, spectraplakins and KIF21A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drabek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>).

In the KANK1/2 depleted cells expressing KANK1 mutants, the velocity of microtubule growth in central cell regions was not affected, but the growth rate at the cell periphery increased, and microtubules were growing at oblique angles to the cell margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). The increase of the microtubule growth rate observed with the GFP-KANK1-ΔCC mutant was less strong than with the two 4A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that GFP-KANK1-ΔCC was strongly clustered at FA rims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and, through its ankyrin repeat domain, could still recruit some KIF21A, a potent microtubule polymerization inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The results with rescue of talin1 and talin2 co-depletion with GFP-talin1 or its G1404L mutant fully supported the conclusions obtained with the KANK1-4A mutant: while in GFP-talin1-expressing cells microtubule growth at the cell edge was three fold slower than in the cell center, only a 1.5 fold difference was observed in GFP-talin1-G1404L expressing cells, and the proportion of microtubules growing parallel rather than perpendicular to the cell edge greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). We conclude that a single point mutation in talin1, which does not interfere with FA formation, is sufficient to perturb CMSC clustering and, as a consequence, induce microtubule disorganization in the vicinity of peripheral FAs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the conserved KN motif of KANK1 represents an LD-type ligand of talin, which allows this adaptor protein to accumulate in the vicinity of integrin-based adhesions. This function is likely to be conserved in the animal kingdom, as the KANK orthologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Vab-19, in conjunction with integrins, plays important roles in a dynamic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion developmental process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihara et al., 2011</xref>). The exact impact of KANK1-talin binding likely depends on the specific system, as the loss of KANK proteins was shown to reduce motility of HeLa cells and podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>), but promote insulin-dependent cell migration in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kakinuma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>An important question is how KANK-talin1 binding mediates the localization of KANK1 to the rim but not the core of FAs. One possibility, suggested by our deletion analysis of KANK1, is that while the KN peptide alone can penetrate into FAs, larger KN-containing protein fragments are sterically excluded from the dense actin-containing core of the FA. However, our experiment with the KN-LacZ fusion did not support this simple idea, indicating that the underlying mechanism is likely to be more complex and might involve specific disordered or ordered domains and additional partners of KANK1, or other regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, we found that reducing contractility with a ROCK1 inhibitor caused an increase in overlap of KANK1 with FA markers, suggesting that the interaction between KANK1 and talin might be mechanosensitive. An exciting possibility is that full length KANK1 can efficiently interact only with talin molecules at the periphery of focal adhesions because they are not fully incorporated into the focal adhesion structure and are thus less stretched. The KANK1 binding site on talin R7 overlaps with the high affinity actin binding site in talin (which spans R4-R8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2015</xref>) and it is possible that different conformational populations of talin exist within adhesions and link to different cytoskeletal components.</p><p>Another important question is how KANK1 binding to the rim of focal adhesions can promote CMSC accumulation around these structures, a spatial arrangement in which most of the CMSC molecules cannot be in a direct contact with FAs. Previous work on CMSC complexes showed that they are formed through an intricate network of interactions. The 'core' components of these complexes, which can be recruited to the plasma membrane independently of each other, are LL5β (and in some cells, its homologue LL5α), liprins and KANKs (of which KANK1 seems to predominate in HeLa cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hotta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The clustering of CMSC components is mutually dependent and relies on homo- and heterodimerization of liprins α1 and β1, the association between KANK1 and liprin-β1, the scaffolding protein ELKS, which binds to both LL5β and liprin-α1, and possibly additional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astro and de Curtis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>), while the microtubule-binding proteins, such as CLASPs and KIF21A, seem to associate as a second 'layer' with the membrane-bound CMSC-assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The CMSC 'patches' can remain relatively stable for tens of minutes, while their individual components are dynamic and exchange with different, characteristic turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of talin-directed assembly of cortical microtubule stabilizing complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-step CMSC clustering around focal adhesion: <italic>1)</italic> KANK1 binds talin rod domain R7 via the KN motif, <italic>2)</italic> KANK1 initiates a cortical platform assembly by binding liprin-β1 via its CC1 domain, <italic>3)</italic> completion of CMSC assembly by further clustering of liprins, ELKS, LL5β, CLASP and KIF21A around FA.

The formation of such structures, which can be compared to liquid droplets, can be triggered by local concentration of CMSC components. It is tempting to speculate that by concentrating KANK1 at the FA rims, talin1 helps to 'nucleate' CMSC assembly, which can then propagate to form large structures surrounding FAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additional membrane-bound cues, such as the presence of PIP3, to which LL5β can bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paranavitane et al., 2003</xref>), can further promote CMSC coalescence by increasing concentration of CMSC players in specific areas of the plasma membrane. This model helps to explain why the CMSC accumulation at the cell periphery is reduced but not abolished when PI3 kinase is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>), and why the clustering of all CMSC components is mutually dependent. Most importantly, this model accounts for the mysterious ability of the two large and spatially distinct macromolecular assemblies, FAs and CMSCs, to form in close proximity of each other.</p><p>To conclude, our study revealed that a mechanosensitive integrin-associated adaptor talin not only participates in organizing the actin cytoskeleton but also directly triggers formation of a cortical microtubule-stabilizing macromolecular assembly, which surrounds adhesion sites and controls their formation and dynamics by regulating microtubule-dependent signaling and trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa Kyoto cell line was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Terry Lechler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents a molecular model for the connection between focal adhesions and associated complexes that stabilize microtubules (called cortical microtubule stabilization complexes, CMSC). KANK1 and 2 are able to bind to both talin at focal adhesions as well as liprins and KIF21A in CMSC's. In the absence of this bridging interaction, CMSCs do not form around focal adhesions. Important strengths of this work include the rational design of point mutants that disrupted talin-KANK interactions and the careful analysis of localizations in backgrounds in which either talins or KANKs were depleted. Functionally, disrupting the association between talin and KANK results in CMSC disruption, which perturbs microtubule growth speeds and organization at the cell cortex. Thought provoking models for the assembly of CMSCs around focal adhesions are presented in the Discussion. Overall, all 3 reviewers felt that this is a very well executed manuscript that provides substantial new insight into how focal adhesions locally control microtubule dynamics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on the results of blebbistatin treatment (Results section) the authors concluded that 'the organization of CMSCs at the cell cortex might be controlled by tension-sensitive components of FAs'. However, it is obvious from the image of the blebbistatin-treated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that this treatment caused complete disassembly of the focal adhesions rather than moderate decrease in actomyosin contractility. To support author's statement, which is interesting and important, an additional experiment is required. The authors should attenuate myosin contractility by either plating the cells on a soft substrate (similar to the experiments in Myers et al., 2011) or by treating the cells with low concentration of blebbistatin or Y-27632 (see Oakes et al., 2012). These treatments will decrease mechanical tension across force-bearing adhesion molecules without compromising structural integrity and signaling function of the focal adhesions. Finding that low contractility impairs CMSC organization will significantly strengthen the paper.</p><p>Additional experiments to consider:</p><p>1) It would improve the impact of the manuscript to demonstrate whether stabilization of microtubules by KANK1-talin complex has an effect on focal adhesion dynamics. In the introduction section of the manuscript the authors provided several lines of evidence demonstrating the crosstalk between microtubules and focal adhesions. However, the experimental data presented in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, F</xref>) show very little, if any, difference in the focal adhesion size upon perturbing talin-KANK interaction.</p><p>2) Since MT localization at FAs is important in cell polarization and migration, it would seem useful to test whether key mutant rescues of talin1 or KANK1 knockdowns have normal polarization and migration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18124.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) Based on the results of blebbistatin treatment (Results section) the authors concluded that 'the organization of CMSCs at the cell cortex might be controlled by tension-sensitive components of FAs'.

We have treated the cells with a low dose of the ROCK1 inhibitor Y-27632 and imaged focal adhesions and KANK1 in both live and fixed cells. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-H</xref> and Supplemental Video S1, we found that this treatment induced a reduction in focal adhesion size, as expected. Interestingly this treatment led to an increased the penetration of KANK1 into focal adhesions and thus enhanced the colocalization between KANK1 and focal adhesion markers; subsequently, gradual dispersion of KANK1 clusters was observed. These data strongly suggest that the interaction between KANK1 and talin is mechanosensitive and can be regulated by tension at focal adhesions. These data are incorporated into the Results.</p><p> <italic>Additional experiments to consider:</italic></p><p><italic>1) It would improve the impact of the manuscript to demonstrate whether stabilization of microtubules by KANK1-talin complex has an effect on focal adhesion dynamics. In the introduction section of the manuscript the authors provided several lines of evidence demonstrating the crosstalk between microtubules and focal adhesions. However, the experimental data presented in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, F</xref>) show very little, if any, difference in the focal adhesion size upon perturbing talin-KANK interaction.</italic></p><p>We have now measured focal adhesion size in HeLa cells where both talin1 and talin2 were depleted and adhesion was rescued by either the wild type talin1 or the G1404L mutant. We found no significant differences between focal adhesion sizes in these two conditions, although cell spreading was mildly increased in cells transfected with the G1404L mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-G</xref> and the Results of the revised manuscript (subsection “Talin1-KANK1 interaction controls cortical organization of CMSC components“). We note that the HeLa cells used here migrate extremely slowly. As a result, they have a highly symmetric shape and represent an excellent model to study microtubule organization and dynamics but are not a good model for investigation of focal adhesion remodeling during cell migration. To address the 2 consequences of disrupting KANK1-talin interaction on focal adhesion turnover, one would therefore need to move to another cell system, such as, for example, 3T3 fibroblasts or HaCaT keratinocytes, in which the cortical microtubule stabilization complexes strongly associate with focal adhesions at the leading cell edge (Lansbergen et al., 2006 Dev Cell, Stehbens et al., 2014 Nat Cell Biol). Unfortunately, these cell models are difficult to transfect, and thus establishment of multiple stable cell lines will be needed to properly address the impact of perturbation of KANK1-talin binding on cell migration and focal adhesion turnover. Such experiments would require at least several months to perform, and, in our opinion, go beyond the scope of the current paper but should constitute a separate study.</p><p> <italic>2) Since MT localization at FAs is important in cell polarization and migration, it would seem useful to test whether key mutant rescues of talin1 or KANK1 knockdowns have normal polarization and migration.</italic></p><p>As indicated above, we think that investigation of the impact of disruption of KANK1-talin interaction on cell polarity and migration would require the use of another model of cell motility. Development of proper tools in such a new model will take multiple months, and thus, in our opinion, goes beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
