Here, we investigated the role of IL-21 in this process. When administered intra-tracheally into wild-type mice, IL-21 induced granzymes and augmented clearance of pulmonary MRSA but not when neutrophils were depleted or a granzyme B inhibitor was added. Correspondingly, IL-21 induced MRSA killing by human peripheral blood neutrophils. Unexpectedly, however, basal MRSA clearance was also enhanced when IL-21 signaling was blocked, both in <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice and in wild-type mice injected with IL-21R-Fc fusion-protein. This correlated with increased type I interferon and an IFN-related gene signature, and indeed anti-IFNAR1 treatment diminished MRSA clearance in these animals. Moreover, we found that IFNβ induced granzyme B and promoted MRSA clearance in a granzyme B-dependent fashion. These results reveal an interplay between IL-21 and type I IFN in the innate immune response to MRSA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>methicillin-resistant Staph aureus</kwd><kwd>IL-21</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Division of Intramural Research, NHLBI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leonard</surname><given-names>Warren J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophil-dependent innate immune responses to the human pathogen, methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, are modulated by an interplay between interleukin-21 and type 1 interferons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for a high percentage of hospital-acquired infections as well as for an increasing incidence of community-acquired skin and soft-tissue infections and secondary infections during pulmonary viral infections such as influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). The emergence of the highly virulent USA 300 lineage of strains of methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) has complicated efforts to control infections in immunocompromised patients as well as in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mediavilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rigby and DeLeo, 2012</xref>). Neutrophils play a key role in host defense to pulmonary <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection and are critical for clearance of MRSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker and Prince, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rigby and DeLeo, 2012</xref>). Neutrophils are recruited to the lung and contribute to the immune response, along with proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other anti-microbial mediators released by lung epithelial cells and resident and incoming innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rigby and DeLeo, 2012</xref>). This response can lead to tissue injury, compromising pulmonary integrity and function, thereby promoting the pathogenesis of <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker and Prince, 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Interleukin-21 was first identified as a T-cell derived cytokine with pleiotropic actions on lymphoid cells. Along with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15, IL-21 shares the common cytokine receptor γ chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leonard, 2001</xref>), γ<sub>c</sub>, which is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noguchi et al., 1993</xref>), and defective IL-21 signaling substantially accounts for the defective B-cell function that is observed in XSCID patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Recher et al., 2011</xref>), corresponding to IL-21’s ability to promote terminal B cell differentiation to plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozaki et al., 2004</xref>). IL-21 also can promote the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nurieva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>), is required for the normal development of T follicular helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vogelzang et al., 2008</xref>) and optimal Th2 responses to helminth infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fröhlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pesce et al., 2006</xref>), has potent activity as an anti-tumor agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spolski and Leonard, 2014</xref>), and promotes the development of a range of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bubier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spolski et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that blocking IL-21 may be a therapeutic approach in such diseases. Indeed, the effectiveness of JAK3 inhibitors in autoimmune disease presumably at least partially relates to the inhibition of IL-21 signaling.</p><p>IL-21 has also been shown to control both humoral and adaptive cellular responses to viral infections. For example, IL-21 is critical for the host response to chronic LCMV infection, as viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are impaired in <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elsaesser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fröhlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yi et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, although humoral immune responses to viral infection could initially develop in the absence of IL-21, the generation of long-lived plasma cell responses was defective in the absence of IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rasheed et al., 2013</xref>). Previously, we found that IL-21 promotes the pathologic immune response to infection with Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM), which is highly related to human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with enhanced neutrophil recruitment and acute respiratory distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spolski et al., 2012</xref>). In PVM, lung CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells constitutively express IL-21, and the number of IL-21<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells increases following viral infection. Besides its effects on lymphoid cells, IL-21 exerts effects on non-lymphoid cell types, including inhibiting dendritic cell function and inducing the apoptosis of conventional DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2013</xref>); however, a role for IL-21 in innate neutrophil-mediated responses to pulmonary bacterial infection has not been reported. In light of the fact that human neutrophils have been reported to express IL-21R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>), we explored the regulation of anti-bacterial responses by IL-21. Here, we investigated the ability of IL-21 to control a pulmonary model of MRSA infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-21 enhances MRSA killing in the lungs of WT mice</title><p>To investigate the role for IL-21 in the response to a pulmonary bacterial infection, WT mice were intratracheally (i.t.) infected with the USA 300 strain of MRSA, which induced a significant increase in <italic>Il21</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and IL-21 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in the lung 24 hr after infection. Moreover, using <italic>Il21-</italic>mCherry reporter transgenic (TG) mice, we found that lung CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had low basal mCherry expression, but the percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1, A and B</xref>) and total number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) of <italic>Il21</italic>-mCherry expressing cells increased after infection with MRSA. IL-21 production was also significantly induced in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells cultured in the presence of Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that bacterial products can directly induce IL-21 production by this T cell population. Interestingly, treatment of WT mice with IL-21, as opposed to PBS, prior to intratracheal infection with MRSA resulted in a modest but significant increase in pulmonary clearance of bacteria at both 7 and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; see summary of 6 independent experiments at 7 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). When we examined lung pathology, as expected, MRSA infection led to increased lung pathology compared to uninfected mice, but IL-21 treatment resulted in reduced lung pathology and neutrophil infiltration at 24 hr as compared to PBS-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see insets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) at this time point. When we quantified neutrophils by flow cytometry, we found that IL-21-treated animals had more lung neutrophils than PBS-treated animals at 7 hr, but fewer lung neutrophils than PBS-treated mice at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with the PBS vs. IL-21 effects on histology at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The specificity of the IL-21 effect was confirmed by the observation that IL-21 treatment of <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice did not significantly affect MRSA clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of naïve mice with IL-21 in the absence of MRSA infection induced an increased accumulation of cells in the BAL fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and a substantial percentage of the infiltrating cells were neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Consistent with the latter report, mouse bone marrow neutrophils (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>) expressed low levels of surface IL-21R as assessed by flow cytometry. Interestingly, IL-21R expression was enhanced by treatment with peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a component of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall. Thus, <italic>S. aureus</italic> components can induce expression of the IL-21 receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) as well as the IL-21 ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To determine whether IL-21-induced clearance of MRSA required neutrophils, WT mice were treated with anti-Ly6G to deplete neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and then given PBS or IL-21 i.t. prior to MRSA infection. Although IL-21 treatment significantly reduced the MRSA titer in the lung 24 hr after infection of isotype control-treated mice, it had less of an effect on MRSA clearance in the neutrophil-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with a major role for neutrophils in MRSA clearance, neutrophil-depleted lungs had significantly higher CFU than lungs not subjected to neutrophil depletion, including in the PBS-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The remaining smaller effect of IL-21 on MRSA clearance in the absence of neutrophils might be due to effects of IL-21 on phagocytosis by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vallières and Girard, 2013</xref>) or dendritic cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2013</xref>).

Moreover, although <italic>IFNG</italic> mRNA induction did not quite meet the FC &gt;2 criterion and thus was not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, expression of this gene was highly induced by IL-21, as assessed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, IL-21 treatment did not appreciably alter the expression of intracellular granzyme B protein detected by flow cytometry in permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, left and right panels), but it significantly increased the release of granzyme B protein into the supernatant of purified human peripheral blood neutrophils, as assessed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). To further analyze production of granzyme B by neutrophils, we used western blotting. Levels of granzyme B from &gt;99% enriched neutrophils were lower than in an equivalent number of PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but PBMC contamination could not account for the signal from purified neutrophils, as even a 1% level of PBMCs gave no detectable signal when added to A549 cells, which do not express detectable Granzyme B, and even a 5% PBMC addition was still less than the signal from the &gt;99% enriched neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Coupled to flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and the failure of IL-21 to induce <italic>Gzmb</italic> mRNA after neutrophil depletion of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), this further supports production of granzyme B by these cells (see Discussion). A previous report had shown enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to zymosan plus IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>). However, IL-21, either alone or in combination with HKSA, did not significantly enhance intracellular ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that increasing ROS is not a major mechanism by which IL-21 augmented the killing of MRSA. Although granzymes A and B were originally characterized based on their roles in T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voskoboinik et al., 2015</xref>), these proteases and anti-microbial peptides can promote the killing of a number of types of bacteria as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walch et al., 2014</xref>). IL-21 also induced expression of the <italic>CCL2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which encodes MCP1, a chemokine that recruits additional innate cells to sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balamayooran et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, IL-21 induces a transcriptional program in human neutrophils that enhances their cytotoxic potential and leads to further recruitment of innate immune cells. Because IL-21 enhanced release of granzyme B, we investigated if IL-21 stimulation could enhance in vitro killing of MRSA by these cells. Indeed, purified peripheral human blood neutrophils stimulated with IL-21 consistently reduced the number of MRSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Moreover, IL-21 also induced clearance of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> by human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>), indicating that the effect was not restricted to a single pathogen.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45501.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Human neutrophils express IL-21R, and IL-21 induces a program that leads to granzyme B-dependent neutrophil-mediated killing of MRSA.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Purified peripheral blood neutrophils were stimulated with PBS (control) or IL-21 (100 ng/ml) for 4 hr, and <italic>IL21R</italic> mRNA was measured by real-time PCR and normalized to <italic>RPL7</italic> expression (<bold>A</bold>), and IL-21R protein levels were measured by flow cytometry (<bold>B</bold>); left panel shows isotype control shaded and anti-IL21R black line, with a summary in the right panel).

To further evaluate the ability of WT vs. <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice to handle MRSA, we examined the inflammatory response. In WT mice, infection with Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM), in which host defense substantially depends on adaptive immunity, results in a marked inflammatory response by 5 or 6 days, and we previously showed that this is substantially diminished after infection of <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spolski et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, with MRSA infection, in which host defense significantly depends on a neutrophil-mediated innate immune response, <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice had greater inflammation than WT mice, and this was already evident at 4 and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, see magnified insets), with an increased pathology score at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Note that the higher pathology score at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) is not inconsistent with the lower total neutrophil count at that time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), as the pathology score is not limited to neutrophil numbers but rather to the severity of lung lesions in involved areas. WT lungs at 24 hr showed only focal lesions, mostly seen at perivascular areas with mild inflammation. These inflammatory cells consist of neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages. However, KO lung at 24 hr showed diffuse lesions with alveolitis and numerous neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages.

Moreover, the IFNλ receptor (IFNLR1) and miR-21, a target of type 1 and 3 IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Consistent with increased type I interferon production, RNA-Seq analysis of mRNA from lungs of MRSA-infected mice that were treated with the IL-21R-Fc fusion protein revealed augmented expression of mRNAs for a range of genes regulated by type I or type II interferons, as compared to mice treated with the control Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Thus, both IL-21 and type I interferon appear to induce similar cytotoxic programs and to augment killing of MRSA.</p><p>The enhanced type I interferon responses that we observed when IL-21 signaling was absent or impaired suggested an inverse correlation between IL-21 and IFNα/β levels during the response to MRSA infection. We explored this possibility using an in vitro system in which both cytokines could be produced.

Although there presumably are effects of STAT3 deficiency in addition to the IFN-related connection, our results collectively indicate that the absence of a functional STAT3-mediated immune response correlates with an amplified type I interferon response and that this contributes to the augmented killing observed in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45501.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for the functional interplay of IL-21 with type I interferons in the response to MRSA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wild-type (WT) mice, MRSA produces SEB, which bridges between T cells and dendritic cells by interacting with TCR and MHCII, leading to the production of IL-21 by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Interestingly, IL-21 augments expression of the IL-21R on neutrophils and additionally upregulates expression of granzyme A, granzyme B, and perforin in enriched human peripheral blood neutrophils and mouse lung neutrophils, with enhanced cytotoxic activity against MRSA and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. In human cells, granzymes A and B are delivered to target cells by granulysin, which we show is also induced by IL-21 in human neutrophils, and these enzymes can kill bacteria through cleavage of enzymes that promote oxidative damage, thereby preventing the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walch et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, granzyme B was also reported to contain a peptide sequence with bactericidal activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shafer et al., 1991</xref>). The idea that granzymes are expressed by neutrophils has been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman and Ley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hochegger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metkar and Froelich, 2004</xref>), with some studies not identifying these proteins and others collectively detecting their expression in neutrophils by confocal microscopy, western blotting, and ELISA, and subcellular fractionation has localized granzymes to primary neutrophil granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hochegger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, our data indicate that intracellular granzyme B is expressed by neutrophils, that its release is induced by IL-21, that depletion of neutrophils decreases IL-21-mediated induction of <italic>Gzmb</italic> mRNA in the lung thereby implicating these cells as a source of these transcripts, and that a granzyme inhibitor blocks the IL-21-induced lowering of MRSA CFU. Interestingly, granzyme B-expressing neutrophils were detected in lung granulomas from humans and macaques in association with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>). IL-21 has also been shown to be critical in the adaptive immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booty et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a multi-faceted IL-21-mediated response to pulmonary microbial infection. Our observation that granzyme B was released by neutrophils after IL-21 stimulation in vitro is consistent with reports of a neutrophil-mediated extracellular proteolytic activity on either extracellular matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2009</xref>) or components of the innate complement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perl et al., 2012</xref>) that may more broadly regulate disease pathology. Human B cells have also been shown to release granzyme B in response to co-stimulation by the B cell receptor and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hagn et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, IL-21 and granzymes appear to play roles in early responses to pathogens by both innate and adaptive immune cells. Cleavage of IL-1α by secreted granzymes has been shown to enhance the biological activity of this cytokine both in vitro and in vivo, thus adding to the potential functions for secreted granzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonina et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although IL-21 augmented MRSA killing, to our surprise both <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice and WT mice treated with an IL-21R-Fc fusion protein also displayed higher pulmonary MRSA clearance than untreated WT mice. This conundrum is at least in part explained by our demonstrating that chronic absence of IL-21 signaling (<italic>Il21r</italic> KO) or even short-term inhibition of IL-21 signaling (treatment with IL-21R-Fc fusion protein) is accompanied by an enhanced type I interferon response in the lung, with increased granzyme B expression and neutrophil anti-microbial action. Although type I IFNs can regulate CD8 cytolytic activity via the induction of granzyme B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohlmeier et al., 2010</xref>) and as noted above, granzyme B-expressing neutrophils were reported in lung granulomas following infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattila et al., 2015</xref>), to our knowledge an interplay between type I IFNs and granzymes in neutrophil anti-microbial action has not been reported. The effects of type I IFN on bacterial infection can be either beneficial or detrimental, depending on the particular bacterium and the context of potential co-infection with a virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stifter and Feng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trinchieri, 2010</xref>). Here, we show that type I IFN promoted killing of MRSA and that this was inhibited by a granzyme B inhibitor. Previous studies have shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> induces a type I IFN signal in dendritic cells via TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parker and Prince, 2012b</xref>), and that <italic>Ifnar1</italic> KO mice were protected from MRSA infection compared to WT mice and preferentially survived a lethal dose of MRSA. Our results demonstrate that type I IFN induction of granzyme B can mediate MRSA clearance, and experiments using anti-IFNAR1 in WT mice reduced clearance of MRSA. This implies a potential difference between mice developmentally deficient in expression of receptor for type I IFNs versus acute blockade of IFN signaling. In addition to the effects of type I IFN on MRSA clearance, our RNA-Seq analysis identified type III IFN receptor (IL-28R) as one of the upstream regulators of the enhanced killing by <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice. Interestingly, type III IFN receptor KO mice were also resistant to MRSA, displaying reduced inflammation and lower expression of inflammatory cytokines and yet no reduction in recruitment of neutrophils to the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen and Prince, 2013</xref>). Some of these effects of type III IFN are mediated by deficient neutrophil serine protease cleavage of IL-1β precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pires and Parker, 2018</xref>). Thus, compensatory changes in cytokines or cell populations in both type I and type III IFN receptor KO mice may account for differences seen with mice in which IFN is acutely blocked by anti-IFNAR1.</p><p>IL-21 signals mainly via STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), often in the context of large transcription factor complexes comprising AP1 and IRF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciofani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glasmacher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>); it also more weakly can activate and signal via STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), with sometimes opposing effects of STAT1 and STAT3 (62). Type I interferons dominantly activate STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (ISGF3) complexes; thus, it is possible that type I interferons and IL-21 might functionally compete given the enhanced expression of type I IFN-regulated transcripts in <italic>Stat3</italic> KO T follicular helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, STAT3 has been shown to negatively regulate type I IFN-mediated anti-viral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2011b</xref>). Importantly, we showed that IL-21-induced granzyme B responses were defective in cells from STAT3-deficient AD-HIES patients, which could relate to the recurrent infections that occur in these individuals, including with <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman and Holland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2007</xref>), and furthermore, AD-HIES neutrophils had defective IL-21-induced MRSA cytotoxic activity in vitro. The failure of AD-HIES patients to produce a functional Th17 response is consistent with studies demonstrating the defective clearance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from the lungs of <italic>Il17r</italic> or <italic>Il22</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kudva et al., 2011</xref>), and this may to be dependent on reduced anti-microbial function of lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minegishi et al., 2009</xref>). However, although IL-21 can be produced by Th17 effector cells, IL-21 production in the lung could be dominated by T follicular helper cells, independent of local production of IL-17, and in fact, IL-17 production can be independent of STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">St Leger et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, neutrophils from some AD-HIES patients had enhanced IL-21-independent in vitro MRSA cytotoxic activity, which could potentially relate to the augmented STAT1 responses that have been observed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wan et al., 2015</xref>) and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2007</xref>) from these patients. However, not all of the AD-HIES patients’ neutrophils had enhanced in vitro MRSA cytotoxic activity, potentially reflecting patient heterogeneity and differences in recent infections/medical history. However, when we used a mutant <italic>Stat3</italic> transgenic mouse model for AD-HIES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steward-Tharp et al., 2014</xref>), we uniformly found increased levels of type I IFN in both serum and BAL fluid after MRSA infection, suggesting a possible mechanism for the enhanced MRSA killing/lower CFU observed with neutrophils from some AD-HIES patients as well as from the AD-HIES-like <italic>Stat3</italic> mutant transgenic mice. It is also conceivable, however, that the compensatory increase in the type I IFN program observed in the absence of IL-21 signaling or STAT3 expression may involve IL-21-mediated inhibition of type I IFN expression by dendritic cells, as we observed in our in vitro experiments with SEB. It is important to recognize that multiple cytokines besides IL-21 can also activate STAT3, and some of the STAT3-mediated effects on MRSA clearance are known to depend on signaling by IL-6 in the lung epithelial compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, our results with <italic>Il21r</italic> KO mice and IL-21R-Fc treated WT mice indicate that the specific absence of IL-21-induced STAT3 signaling can lead to a compensatory interferon-mediated cytotoxic program.</p><p>IL-21 can have both pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory functional roles, depending on the cellular context and cytokine milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spolski and Leonard, 2014</xref>), but our current findings importantly extend the known actions of IL-21, particularly related to neutrophil biology and bacterial infection. Our data suggest that IL-21 may not only serve a protective role during pulmonary bacterial infection but also indicate potentially complex homeostatic regulation of the IL-21 versus the type I IFN anti-microbial program, given that the latter is associated with blocking IL-21. These studies underscore the potential complexity of the role of IL-21 in host defense, and further studies are needed to understand how the effects of IL-21 related to neutrophils can integrate with actions of IL-21 on other immune cells. Given that both administering IL-21 (for cancer) and blocking IL-21 (for autoimmune disease) are of potential clinical interest in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spolski and Leonard, 2014</xref>), it is important to be cognizant of possible effects on host defense of modulating levels and the actions of this cytokine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (S. aureus)</td><td>FPR3757</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC BAA-1556</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Streptococcus pyogenes)</td><td>NZ131</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC-BAA-1633</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (M. musculus)</td><td><italic>Il21r-/-</italic></td><td>Ozaki et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;IL-21/type I interferon interplay regulates neutrophil-dependent innate immune responses to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philip Verhoef (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The manuscript was reviewed by three experts, including a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Overall, the reviewers thought the manuscript was of high interest. Also, reviewers found it of interest and fascinating that the paper described discordant results when examining the role of IL21 in controlling intra-tracheal infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Administration of IL21 led to enhanced clearance of MRSA, but surprisingly the same result was seen in IL21R ko mice. The authors provide evidence that IL21R ko mice have enhanced type I interferon responses that in part explain the findings.</p><p>However, the reviewers were concerned about several issues that are described in detail in the full text of their reviews. Among the main issues raised that require attention are the statistical evaluation of some of the experiments and the need to cite prior work on interferons and MRSA pathogenesis. We invite the submission of a revised manuscript that addresses these issues in particular. The revised manuscript should also address the other concerns listed in the detailed reviews, though no additional new experiments are required for these other concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Spolski et al submitted an interesting paper examining the role of IL21 in controlling intra-tracheal infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). They found intra-tracheal administration of IL21 led to enhanced clearance of MRSA, though inexplicably this was relatively small (about 2-fold) in Figure 1 when compared to Figure 2 which demonstrates over a log difference in CFU. They ascribe this effect to neutrophils, but neutrophil depletion led to decreased clearance, regardless of IL21 administration, and the effect of IL21 administration was lost. Most interestingly, MRSA infection of IL21R ko mice also showed enhanced bacterial clearance in a direct comparison experiment. The authors ascribe this to type I interferons which are elevated in infected IL21Rko mice which also show enhanced inflammation histologically. Anti-IFNAR1 resulted in decreased clearance and loss of a difference between WT and IL21R ko mice. Corroborating data are presented supporting the general notion that IL21R ko mice have enhanced type I interferon responses.</p><p>There are other experiments that could be done to better describe the effects, such as different doses of MRSA, different assay time points after infection, direct ascertainment of IL21 effects on type I interferon responses. However, I think the paper describes the surprising dual effects of IL21 in bacterial clearance with a plausible explanation of how IL21R ko might lead to enhanced bacterial clearance via type I interferons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Overall, this is a well-done study which demonstrates a novel interplay between IL-21 and type 1 IFN signaling in the context of host defense to Staph aureus infection, with correlates in both mice and humans.</p><p>It's a fascinating study in part because the use of the knockout mouse gave a result completely unexpected, but also because the authors explored the mechanism for bacterial clearance in the absence of a functional IL-21 axis and found that type 1 interferon signaling plays a critical role. This raises numerous additional questions, but those need not be addressed in this manuscript. The methodology is thorough and appropriate and the data are appropriately presented. I have no major concerns that would merit significant additional experimentation and think that this manuscript merits publication. I do have several minor concerns that could be addressed (in the minor concerns section).</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Their Introduction provides adequate information about IL-21 and MRSA; however, there was nearly no justification for the exploration of IL-21 as a component of MRSA host-defense. In addition, while I realize that the discovery of type 1 interferons in the absence of IL-21 signals was unexpected, is there a way to work in any information about type 1 interferon signaling in MRSA infection in to the Introduction? Or the relationship between type 1 IFN signaling and IL-21? (some of this is covered in the Results and Discussion…)</p><p>2) The authors pre-treat mice with IL-21 1 day prior to infection; however, what effect does IL-21 have in the lungs in the absence of infection? Does it promote recruitment of neutrophils or macrophages? Does it lead to an inflammatory response? Does it pre-activate the immune response to facilitate bacterial clearance? This is not clear from the data presented.</p><p>3) Figure 2C clearly indicates that IL-21 has effects beyond those mediated by neutrophils (especially given that this is a log scale). In addition, the authors indicate that IL-21 induces MCP-1 release, which would attract other inflammatory monocytes. Can the authors comment on the additional inflammatory responses that may be activated above and beyond those dependent on neutrophils?</p><p>4) In the supplemental data, the authors suggest that CD4 T cells may be a source of IL-21 during MRSA infection. However, a wide range of other cell types may act as sources (notably ILCs) and the subset of CD4 T cells is also not clear (naïve? NKT? Γ δ?) and in addition, I'd imagine this would be an innate response and not an adaptive one. I'm not sure that these data add to the paper, other than indicating that IL-21 increases in the lung in response to infection (so could be playing a role). The authors could consider leaving it out, since it raises more questions than it answers.</p><p>5) Throughout the paper, the authors do not statistically analyze apparent increases that are documented in flow cytometry histograms (e.g. Figure 2A, 3B, 3H). Such analysis is easily done and would be informative. This is important, for instance, because as I look at Figure 2A, I definitely believe that PG has a strong effect inducing the IL-21R… but I don't necessarily buy that IL-21 is actually inducing the IL-21R.</p><p>6) Figure 6H, the authors indicate that blocking of IL21R strongly enhances IL-21 transcript expression in CD4T cells, which might suggest a feedback inhibition in T cells by IL-21 (if T cells express IL-21R) or suggests that if DCs express IL-21R that they are inhibiting T cell production of IL-21, or that perhaps type IFNs stimulate IL-21 transcription? Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>7) Figure 6D should probably be moved to Figure 5, given that Figure 6 otherwise focuses on the effects of blocking the IL-21R.</p><p>8) In Figure 4, how do the authors reconcile a higher path score with lower neutrophil counts? What are all the cells that are present in the lungs if they are not neutrophils?</p><p>9) Figure 5F: assume that because they didn't indicate it, that there was no statistically significant difference between the various groups?</p><p>10) I think that Supplementary Figure 5 (the model figure) is important enough to be in the main manuscript. This is really helpful for clarifying the mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors investigated the role of IL-21 during infection with the important human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. Application of IL-21 was found to improve bacterial clearance and it did so via a granzyme mediated killing in neutrophils. An unexpected observation was that treatment of mice with IL-21R-Fc or infection of Il21r KO mice also led to an improvement in bacterial clearance. This too was associated with neutrophil mediated killing via IL-21 and correlated with a type I IFN gene signature. Neutrophils from patients with STAT3 mutation also showed decreased granzyme activity. This is a scientifically well carried out study and utilizes a variety of techniques. Enthusiasm is diminished due to the disconnect between the IL-21 and IL-21R-Fc/Il21r-/- KO phenotypes and how can both activation and elimination of a pathway cause the same result. This mechanism is still not fully understood. Also, given the emphasis on the connection to interferon signaling it is surprising that there is an absence of discussion of previous studies given those studies show the opposite phenotype. Specific comments are provided below for the authors.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Many points during the manuscript were quantitative differences noted in the text but values were not specified or the% or fold changes noted.</p><p>Bacteria were quantified from individual lobes from the lung. This is always a potentially problematic approach, versus a whole lung, as individual lobes can be differentially infected. The lobes that were taken aren't stated.</p><p>To clarify, the data in Figure 1F-K is on naïve mice and not in the context of infection?</p><p>In Figure 2A it was shown that purified peptidoglycan can increase IL-21R expression, is the same result observed when bacteria are used?</p><p>Subsection “IL-21 induces granzyme-mediated MRSA killing by neutrophils”, Figure 2, mentions neutrophil depleted lungs had significant higher cfu compared to non-depleted lungs however, statistics are supplied to support this statement.</p><p>IL-21 can induce apoptosis in DCs, is there a difference in cell death of DCs or other cell types in the IL-21 KO and in IL-21 treated mice?</p><p>What was the rationale for using heat killed bacteria in Figure 3 versus live?</p><p>Data in 4B somewhat replicates that shown in Figure 1.</p><p>The Il21r KO mice should have increased inflammation while having reduced neutrophil numbers. What immune cell is thus contributing to this inflammation?</p><p>It is not clear the number of biological replicates used to generate the RNA-seq data. It is mentioned two independent experiments were performed, but how many biological samples were included in each experiment?</p><p>The heatmap in Figure 5B is only showing interferon related gene products, how were these genes selected?</p><p>Purified neutrophils should show a flow diagram in supplemental confirming purity and giving some identification on what other cell types might also be present.</p><p>Was the IFN α ELISA used specific to any particular IFN α or was it reactive to all subtypes?</p><p>Did treatment of mice with IL-21 thus diminished type I IFN production?</p><p>Were all statistics performed using paired t-tests, even for animal studies that are considered to be non-parametric, not normally distributed.</p><p>In the studies using IL-21R-Fc and Il21-/- mice, 4h after infection a spike in type I IFN production was observed, in addition to increased inflammation, consistent with a role of type I IFN in immunopathology (see citations below).</p><p>In Figure 6 expression of IL-21 and IFN is examined using staphylococcal superantigen B. This is not necessarily the best control given that SEB is not even produced by the strain of MRSA being used. FPR3757 expresses SEK and SEQ, which have shown to be not involved in pathogenesis in mouse models of pneumonia.</p><p>What was the source of the SEB used and its purity, i.e. endotoxin levels-which could easily influence IFN induction?</p><p>Figure 7B is lacking statistics.</p><p>In Figure 7D, would be expectation be IL-21 in WT donors should it increase GBP expression, if the mechanism of IL-21 mediated clearance is analogous to that observed with Il21r-/- and IL-21R-FC experiments.</p><p>With the AD-HIES patient cells they were shown to be IFN responsive, did they also show differential interferon induction? Should this IFN responsiveness be also correlated to an improved killing? The stat3 mutant mice were shown to clear better, which is somewhat at odds with AD-HIES patients that have significant problems with S. aureus infection.</p><p>Some emphasis was placed on the influence of interferon signaling on the outcome to infection. However, the data in Figure 5E does not show any statistical differences between WT mice given IgG or anti-IFNAR1.</p><p>The Discussion doesn't place this work in the context of any of the prior studies that examine MRSA and interferon signaling. Specifically, all the prior studies have shown that both type I and III interferon signaling contributes to pathogenesis. This oversight should be corrected and the contrary results justified.

We now mention that the prior report of IL-21R on human neutrophils motivated us to explore anti-bacterial responses to IL-21 and then that we specifically used MRSA. Regarding mentioning type I interferons in the Introduction, the fact is that we were not focused on type I IFN until we obtained the RNA-Seq results and upstream pathway analysis. We think it makes the most sense to discuss this in the Results and Discussion rather than in the Introduction, but we are happy to consider a specific suggestion if you have a good way to include in the Introduction. We have expanded the discussion of the relationship between type 1 IFN signaling and IL-21 in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors pre-treat mice with IL-21 1 day prior to infection; however, what effect does IL-21 have in the lungs in the absence of infection?

This is not clear from the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>As we noted related to Figure 3C, IL-21 induces expression of <italic>CCL2</italic> (encoding MCP-1), which could be involved in recruitment of myeloid cells to the lung. In fact, IL-21 treatment of naïve mice in the absence of infection leads to a minor enhancement of neutrophil recruitment to the lung (now added as Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which could potentially pre-activate the immune response to facilitate bacterial clearance, but we focused on the responses of neutrophils after MRSA infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2C clearly indicates that IL-21 has effects beyond those mediated by neutrophils (especially given that this is a log scale).

Immunity 38:514, 2013) and macrophage populations (enhanced phagocytosis; Vallieres and Girard, 2013). These points and studies are now cited in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the supplemental data, the authors suggest that CD4 T cells may be a source of IL-21 during MRSA infection.

Γ δ T cells were ruled out as the source of IL-21 in those studies. We believe that it is important to show that these cells pre-exist in the uninfected lung, consistent with the lung’s representing a barrier immune site, and thus included the data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The data could be omitted, although we see no harm in including the results. It is possible that other cell types might contribute.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Throughout the paper, the authors do not statistically analyze apparent increases that are documented in flow cytometry histograms (e.g. Figure 2A, 3B, 3H).

We agree that the effect of IL-21 on the induction of IL-21R as measured by flow cytometry is small, but it was reproducible and statistically significant. Peptidoglycan clearly has a stronger inducing effect on IL-21R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6H, the authors indicate that blocking of IL21R strongly enhances IL-21 transcript expression in CD4T cells, which might suggest a feedback inhibition in T cells by IL-21 (if T cells express IL-21R) or suggests that if DCs express IL-21R that they are inhibiting T cell production of IL-21, or that perhaps type IFNs stimulate IL-21 transcription?

Although we have not explored the mechanism by which blocking IL21R augments SEB-induced IL21 expression, Strengell et al., 2004, demonstrated that IFN-α in combination with either IL-12 or TCR could enhance expression of IL-21 in human NK and T cells and also downregulate IL-21R expression on these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6D should probably be moved to Figure 5, given that Figure 6 otherwise focuses on the effects of blocking the IL-21R.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that Figure 6 walks the reader through our discovery that IL-21 and type I IFN both induce similar cytotoxic programs to augment MRSA killing. As a result, we think it is logical to present the information in Figure 6 so that they were described in parallel with each other.

This is now stated in the Figure 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2A it was shown that purified peptidoglycan can increase IL-21R expression, is the same result observed when bacteria are used?</p></disp-quote><p>We used peptidoglycan rather than bacteria so that the longer time point (24hr) could be assessed in the absence of neutrophil death in the cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “IL-21 induces granzyme-mediated MRSA killing by neutrophils”, Figure 2, mentions neutrophil depleted lungs had significant higher cfu compared to non-depleted lungs however, statistics are supplied to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analysis of this difference has been added to Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>IL-21 can induce apoptosis in DCs, is there a difference in cell death of DCs or other cell types in the IL-21 KO and in IL-21 treated mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not investigate lung DC death in this system; we were concerned that the long enzymatic isolation procedure for purifying lung cells would make it difficult to accurately assess apoptosis in this model. In a previous paper from our lab, Wan et al. (Wan et al., 2013) investigated in vivo death of splenic DCs induced by IL-21 released from α-gal-cer induced NKT cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the rationale for using heat killed bacteria in Figure 3 versus live?</p></disp-quote><p>Heat-killed bacteria were used so that longer (24 h) time points could be included in the RNA-Seq analysis of neutrophil in vitro responses. With live bacteria, the culture would have been overgrown by 24 h. This is now mentioned in the legend to Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data in 4B somewhat replicates that shown in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 4B is slightly redundant with both Figure 1 and also Figure 4A, but we wanted to assay both the IL-21 treatment as well as the <italic>Il21r</italic> KO samples at the same time points and within a single experiment so that we could directly compare the effects on MRSA clearance. We therefore believe it is best to keep all three panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>he Il21r KO mice should have increased inflammation while having reduced neutrophil numbers. What immune cell is thus contributing to this inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>As described above and in the text related to Figure 4, the pathology score is not limited to neutrophil numbers and is based on the severity of lesions in affected regions. Lymphocytes and macrophages were also observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear the number of biological replicates used to generate the RNA-seq data. It is mentioned two independent experiments were performed, but how many biological samples were included in each experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-Seq analysis was performed in 2 independent experiments in each of Figure 1G, 3C, 5, and 7C, and in each experiment, 3 to 5 biological samples were pooled for the sequencing reactions. Specific gene expression was validated by RT-PCR or ELISA analysis of additional mice or donors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The heatmap in Figure 5B is only showing interferon related gene products, how were these genes selected?</p></disp-quote><p>Upstream pathway analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that IFNAR1 was a top regulator. This led us to focus on the type I interferon pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Purified neutrophils should show a flow diagram in supplemental confirming purity and giving some identification on what other cell types might also be present.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1B shows the purity of mouse lung neutrophils and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A shows the purity of human peripheral blood neutrophils. We do not know the contaminating cells in the mouse lung but based on lack of CD11b expression, they are not macrophages. The human neutrophils are devoid of NK cells or CD8 T cells and are 99.9% pure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was the IFN α ELISA used specific to any particular IFN α or was it reactive to all subtypes?</p></disp-quote><p>The IFNalpha ELISA used in Figure 5D was reactive to all subtypes. This is now stated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did treatment of mice with IL-21 thus diminished type I IFN production?</p></disp-quote><p>IL-21 did not have an effect on lung type I IFN production (based on RNA-Seq analysis) during the time period of the infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were all statistics performed using paired t-tests, even for animal studies that are considered to be non-parametric, not normally distributed.</p></disp-quote><p>All statistics used Mann-Whitney non-parametric t-tests in light of both the small sample size and the animal studies. This is stated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the studies using IL-21R-Fc and Il21-/- mice, 4h after infection a spike in type I IFN production was observed, in addition to increased inflammation, consistent with a role of type I IFN in immunopathology (see citations below).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and the citations have been incorporated into the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6 expression of IL-21 and IFN is examined using staphylococcal superantigen B. This is not necessarily the best control given that SEB is not even produced by the strain of MRSA being used. FPR3757 expresses SEK and SEQ, which have shown to be not involved in pathogenesis in mouse models of pneumonia.</p></disp-quote><p>We used SEB not as representative of an effect of this MRSA strain but as a convenient superantigen bridge to explore interactions between cells known to produce either IL-21 or type I interferons. SEB helped us to evaluate the importance of the CD4 and DC cooperation for the induction of <italic>Il21, Ifna2</italic>, and <italic>Ifnb</italic> mRNA shown in Figure 6H-J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What was the source of the SEB used and its purity, i.e. endotoxin levels-which could easily influence IFN induction.</p></disp-quote><p>SEB was obtained from List Biological Laboratories and is estimated to be &gt;95% pure with 14 EU/mg. This is now stated in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 is lacking statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analysis has now been added to this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>n Figure 7D, would be expectation be IL-21 in WT donors should it increase GBP expression, if the mechanism of IL-21 mediated clearance is analogous to that observed with Il21r-/- and IL-21R-FC experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that AD-HIES patient neutrophils had greater expression of a cluster of IFNb-responsive genes, as compared to normal donor neutrophils. It is IFNb rather than IL-21 that induces GBP levels in Figure 7D, so we do not expect a greater direct effect of IL-21 on GBP expression. In infected mice in Figure 5D, please note that the KO mice have higher IFNα production and correspondingly higher <italic>Gbp1</italic> mRNA expression in Figure 5G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the AD-HIES patient cells they were shown to be IFN responsive, did they also show differential interferon induction? Should this IFN responsiveness be also correlated to an improved killing? The stat3 mutant mice were shown to clear better, which is somewhat at odds with AD-HIES patients that have significant problems with S. aureus infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Neutrophils do not produce type IFN; thus, only IFN-responsive genes were identified by RNA-Seq. We did not have access to patient serum samples; therefore, we do not know if other cells in the patients are producing IFN following infection. Although the STAT3 mutant TG mice had enhanced clearance of MRSA in the basal state, IL-21 did not enhance MRSA killing, which was consistent with the inability of IL-21 to induce in vitro MRSA killing by AD-HIES patient neutrophils. In fact, 2 out of 6 of the patient neutrophils had enhanced killing of MRSA in the absence of in vitro stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some emphasis was placed on the influence of interferon signaling on the outcome to infection. However, the data in Figure 5E does not show any statistical differences between WT mice given IgG or anti-IFNAR1.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analysis has been added to Figure 5E, and there is a difference in WT mice given IgG versus anti-IFNAR1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion doesn't place this work in the context of any of the prior studies that examine MRSA and interferon signaling. Specifically, all the prior studies have shown that both type I and III interferon signaling contributes to pathogenesis. This oversight should be corrected and the contrary results justified. MSSA type I IFN (J Immunol 2012 189:4040, PLoS Path 2014 10::e1003951), III IFN (Eur J Imm 2018 48:1707, PLoS Path 2013 9: e1003682) and in the context of influenza (J Immun 2011 186: 1666, Am J Phys Lung cell Mol 2015 309: L158).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her comments.
