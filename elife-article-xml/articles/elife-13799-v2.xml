Despite a large body of work on the neural control of walking in invertebrates and vertebrates alike, the mechanisms underlying the motor flexibility that is needed to adjust the motor behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated optomotor-induced turning and the neuronal mechanisms underlying the differences between the leg movements of the two body sides in the stick insect <italic>Carausius morosus</italic>. We present data to show that the generation of turning kinematics in an insect are the combined result of descending unilateral commands that change the leg motor output via task-specific modifications in the processing of local sensory feedback as well as modification of the activity of local central pattern generating networks in a body-side-specific way. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the specificity of such modifications in a defined motor task.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13799.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13799.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13799.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Walking along a curve or turning is a complex manoeuvre for the nervous system, as it must coordinate different leg movements on each side of the body. Rhythmic processes such as walking are controlled by networks of neurons called central pattern generators. The resulting movements can be adjusted by feedback from sense organs in response to environmental conditions. For example, sensory feedback that provides information about the load placed on each leg, allows the animal to control the duration of a stance. How the nerve cells, or neurons, involved in these processes work together to produce complex, flexible movements such as turning is largely unknown.</p><p>Previous work on how the brain negotiates turning movements has been carried out mostly in animals that swim or fly. To understand what happens during walking, Gruhn et al. monitored stick insects that walked in a curve on a slippery surface, and recorded the electrical activity within the animals' nervous system as they turned.</p><p>By comparing the activity of the nervous system on each side of the body while the insects walked a curve, Gruhn et al. found that the nervous system uses at least three different mechanisms to produce the different movements on the inside and outside. Firstly, the sensory feedback signals that communicate the load on the leg are processed in the legs on the outside of the curve to support forward steps, while they are processed on the inside legs to support forward, sideward, and backward steps. Secondly, the motor activity produced by the central pattern generator is modulated to be stronger for the muscle that moves the leg backward on the outside of the curve. At the same time, this activity is stronger for the muscle that moves the leg forward on the inside of the curve. Thirdly, signals from a front leg influence the movement of the other legs on the same side of the body. This influence is strong on the inside and weak on the outside of the curve.</p><p>Together or separately, these three mechanisms could provide the animal with the means to perform turns in all their different curvatures. Future work will need to work out exactly which local neurons process the signals sent from the brain to control movement.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13799.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13799.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>stick insect</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>walking</kwd><kwd>adaptive behavior</kwd><kwd>CPG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Carausius morosus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bu857/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Büschges</surname><given-names>Ansgar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Turning in an insect is the combined result of body-side-specific modifications in processing of local sensory feedback, and modification of local central pattern generator activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An animal's motor system faces complex demands in order to ensure proper function and survival. Such demands arise either from the intrinsic need to find food, or a mating partner, or the extrinsic needs to avoid predators or simply overcome obstacles. The investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of locomotion has unraveled considerable detail on how those neural networks that produce the basic motor outputs for swimming, flying and walking of invertebrates and vertebrates are organized and operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehmann, 2004</xref>). At the level of the locomotor organs, a basic motor output is the result of the activity of local central pattern generating networks (CPGs), and its adjustment through sensory feedback from the locomotor organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Büschges and Gruhn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearson, 2008</xref>). Particularly important for the control of the step cycle in this context is load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitz and Stein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duysens et al., 2000</xref>). The activity of the CPGs is initiated and modified depending upon the behavioral tasks the animal faces. Evidence suggests that descending signals from brain centers such as reticulospinal neurons in the vertebrate hind brain/basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2011</xref>) or the head ganglia of arthropods with the putative arthropod basal ganglia homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013</xref>), the central complex in the cerebral ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>) contribute to both the basic drive and its modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shik et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). How these descending signals influence the motor activity at the level of the local neural networks that control the locomotor organs, however, is only beginning to be understood, in particular for walking, the most ubiquitous form of locomotion in terrestrial animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridgel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dyson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>When changing course, all walking animals need to change the kinematics of each leg substantially in order to separate the activity between the leg and body segments and produce the appropriate locomotor movements on the two body sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jander, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rivera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jindrich and Full, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Musienko et al., 2012</xref>). In a six-legged curve walking insect, for example, outside legs push the animal, while inside legs pull the animal into the direction of the curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jindrich and Full, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>), sometimes even reversing the stepping direction in single inside legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruse et al., 2009</xref>). Currently, little insight exists, into how the nervous system generates such motor flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellekes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridgel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fagerstedt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClellan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). It seems clear that sensory input from vestibular/antennal or optical areas is processed in the brains of vertebrates and insects alike, and transformed into descending neuronal signals that induce changes in the activity of the local networks which produce the ongoing motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Ritzmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridgel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Musienko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClellan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). The nature of these changes that generate body-side-specific motor output, however, is still largely unknown.</p><p>In the present study we have therefore investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of the motor output during curve walking in an insect. We first analyzed stepping activity as well as the activity and timing of leg muscles in tethered, intact animals, walking freely on a slippery surface during optomotor-induced curved walking. In a next step, we investigated the underlying mechanisms by studying the local processing of load signals on the respective inside and outside of the curve. Finally, we investigated the centrally generated local motor output in a deafferented preparation and tested if the observed behavioral changes involved also changes in the activity of local central pattern generating networks.</p><p>Our results show that the leg motor output in optomotor induced curve walking insects results from body-side-specific modulation of the local, segmental processing of sensory feedback and the modulation of the activity of CPGs that control the individual leg joints.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Turning of the intact tethered animal</title><p>During curved walking in insects, outside legs usually perform slightly modified forward steps, while the inside leg pulls the animal into the direction of the curve, and may produce forward, sideward and backward steps independent of the conditions under which walking is studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jindrich and Full, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>). To understand the neuronal basis for these differences, we first studied turning of intact stick insects on a slippery surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruhn et al., 2006</xref>). Despite some differences to walking on solid ground that will be discussed below, this arrangement excludes inter-leg influences from mechanical coupling through the ground, and a passive entrainment of leg activity through that of neighboring legs.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of 14 inside and outside curve walking sequences from 10 intact animals showed that the period of front leg (FL) inside steps (P<sub>in</sub>=0.83s; SD=0.21) between animals was significantly shorter than that of FL outside steps (P<sub>out</sub>=1.21s; SD=0.37) in 11 out of 14 sequences (p&lt;0.05). Likewise, the average period of middle leg (ML) inside steps (P<sub>in</sub>=0.76s; SD=0.15) was significantly shorter than that of ML outside steps (P<sub>out</sub>=1.13s; SD=0.28) (p&lt;0.01, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Neither the stepping periods of the inside, nor those of the outside FLs and MLs were significantly different from one another (p<sub>in</sub> =0.43s, p<sub>out</sub>= 0.6s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We also looked for changes in motor output at the level of the muscle activity between the inside and outside legs. The only clear difference in the average EMG activity was observed in the most proximal leg joint, the thorax-coxa-joint, through which movements of a leg along the body axis are controlled. During inside stepping, the muscles <italic>retractor coxae</italic> and its antagonist, the <italic>protractor coxae</italic>, both served as either stance or swing muscles. Figures 1bi and bii show examples of ML <italic>pro</italic>- and <italic>retractor coxae</italic> EMG activity during inside and outside walking, and the averages of the rectified and smoothed EMG activity from 182 inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1ci</xref>) and 204 outside steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1cii</xref>) from five animals. Interestingly, the protractor activation in this case often also overlapped with that of the retractor, which suggests co-contraction and matches sideward steps observed during inside stepping. In addition, depressor activity on the outside was slightly prolonged (data not shown). Altogether, these findings corroborate the relative independence of the CPGs for each joint, and between hemiganglia that has been long known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Büschges et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13799.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differences between inside and outside middle leg (ML) activity in the intact tethered stick insect that is turning on the slippery surface.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Significant difference between the periods of inside (orange) and outside (yellow) turning of the front (striped) and middle (solid) leg, and no significant differences between the periods of front and middle leg stepping on either the inside or the outside; asterisks mark significance levels: * p&lt;0.05, ** p&gt;0.01.

In contrast to the standing animal, however, no stereotypical activation of retractor activity was observed upon load stimuli (n=617). Instead, load stimuli either started or terminated retractor, and <italic>vice versa,</italic> protractor activity. Activation of the retractor MNs in variable strength compared to control upon load stimuli was observed in all 13 animals (16–100% of the stimuli/animal), termination of retractor, and activation of protractor MNs was observed in 54% of the cases (7 out of 13 animals, 2–25% of the stimuli). In addition, in 10 out of 13 animals, and on average upon 18.8% of the stimuli (SD=15.2), load stimuli did neither elicit retractor nor protractor activation. This is depicted for one animal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, including PSTH analysis of the responses to CS stimuli during standing and during inside turning sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3bi–iii</xref>). Timing of the load stimuli with respect to the front leg steps was distributed uniformly throughout the FL step cycle. We also tested whether the strength of the retractor activation was dependent on the timing of the CS stimulus during the FL step cycle. This was not the case, as shown in the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> for the example animal shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, nor for all other animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We equally tested whether either activation of the protractor motor activity or the lack of a response occurred during a preferred phase of the step cycle. No phase preference was found for the activation of protractor activity during FL step cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). However, we found a significantly increased likelihood for failure to elicit a response to a CS stimulus at 0.89 of the FL step cycle (p=0.028) although this phenomenon could occur during all phases of the FL step cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In summary, these results clearly show side-specificity in the processing of local load signals during inside curve walking, modified from that during forward and outward stepping, such that the stereotypical influence of load feedback is no longer present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Motor output during turning</title><p>In light of the significant role sensory feedback plays in the generation of the motor output for stepping in the stick insect, the results presented above can offer some explanation for observed differences in stance kinematics in the curve stepping animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the question as to the mechanism behind the differences in cycle periods of outside and inside legs upon removal of mechanical coupling remains. We therefore checked for potential differences in the activity of those local central networks that generate alternating activity in the coxal protractor and retractor motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Büschges et al., 1995</xref>). To do so, we analyzed their motor output in the deafferented mesothoracic ganglion during curve walking. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows mesothoracic protractor and retractor MN activity during inside (a–c), and outside turning (d–f) of the FL ipsilateral to the recording site. When the FL performed inside steps, protractor activity in the mesothorax was increased over retractor activity in all animals (N=17), and alternating activity between the two MN pools was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The rhythmic activity of the mesothoracic coxal motoneurons was tightly correlated and largely in phase with the steps of the ipsilateral FL, as previously described for straight walking of the FL on a treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bi–ii</xref>).

The success of the turning motor behavior can either be deduced from changes in the stride length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>) or from the sideward or backward steps or strokes of the inside leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rivera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al., 2014</xref>). In the stick insect, the ML movement on the inside is characterized by a flexion around the femur-tibia joint, reduced angle of movement in the thorax-coxa joint, and the occurrence of forward, sideward and backward steps in immediate succession. In contrast, outside MLs only show an increased front to back angle of movement, and reduced flexion in the femur tibia joint both under conditions of turning on normal substrate and during turns on the slippery surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">, 2011</xref>). Most studies on turning of arthropods have been performed on air cushioned balls, and also reported a decrease in stepping frequency of the inside compared to the outside legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zolotov et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jander, 1985</xref>), sometimes no change in frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruse and Saavedra, 1996</xref>).</p><p>These reports differ from our observation that the average cycle period of inside steps was significantly shorter than that of outside steps. However, all of the studies cited above investigated curve walking while the individual legs of the animals were mechanically coupled through the ground, and could not express their inherent cycle period. A plausible explanation for the difference to our findings and similar ones in the cockroach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mu and Ritzmann, 2005</xref>) is that we studied curve walking on a slippery surface. During walking above greased plates, the mechanical coupling between the legs, and passive influences caused by ground contact are reduced or even abolished. Therefore, turning on the slippery surface must be considered a special case, in that the traction for the legs and the resistance the legs experience is reduced. In addition, stepping is not affected by passive displacement through the movements of the other legs on the ground via the mechanical coupling. Hence, the resulting sensory feedback is altered from walking on normal ground. Interestingly, turning kinematics between slippery surface and air-cushioned ball are still remarkably similar for both cockroach and stick insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tryba and Ritzmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al., 2014</xref>). Because of these differences, walking on the slippery surface allows one to draw conclusions about the centrally generated motor output of the nervous system. The significantly higher stepping frequency observed on the inside compared to the outside under these conditions may therefore reflect exactly this changed output during turning which, under more naturalistic conditions, is masked and altered by sensory feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different processing of local load feedback on both sides of a curve stepping insect</title><p>How are the differences in stepping frequency and kinematics generated? Experimental data point towards two alternative ways for the neuronal control of turning, that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In lamprey, curve swimming is achieved by increasing the descending excitatory drive unilaterally which ultimately leads to steering into the direction of the body side with the increased drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fagerstedt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner et al., 2008</xref>). During terrestrial locomotion, however, the rigid coupling through ground contact exerts much stronger influences than mechanical coupling in fluids and locomotion involves more than trunk movement. This might explain why changes in sensory processing have been reported to form the basis of context-dependent changes in motor output in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellekes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that local load feedback signals influence coxal MN activity depending on whether the load stimulus is applied to the ML stump ipsilateral to an outside or inside front leg (FL). Similar context-dependent processing of sensory feedback was reported before in vertebrates and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearson and Collins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellekes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</xref>). Feedback about flexion of the stick insect tibia, signaled by the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO), leads to a reinforcement of flexion in inside legs, while no such effect is observed in outside legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellekes et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, feedback from ML campaniform sensilla (CS) of stick insects, elicited by a load-mimicking stimulus in the horizontal plane, like that applied in our experiments, was shown to trigger a switch from ML protractor to retractor activity during forward, and in the opposite direction during backward stepping of the FL on a treadwheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>). All these changes in sensory processing could be depending on descending commands from the brain, as lesioning the connective anterior to the prothoracic ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</xref>) and stimulation of turn-inducing central complex (CX) neurons have been shown to alter similar reflexes elicited by stimulation of the chordotonal organ in cockroach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that processing of a loading stimulus on the outside is similar to that during forward stepping, leading to retractor activation. Processing of the same stimulus on the inside was not found to be so stereotypic, ranging from activation of retractor to different degrees and termination of protractor activity, through activation of neither motor neuron pool, to protractor activation and termination of retractor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Except for a very weak phase dependence in the failure to respond to a CS stimulus to the final fourth of the FL step cycle, all other types of response to loading stimuli were not dependent of the FL step cycle. On the outside, the response matches the functional stance movement of the outside leg in the intact animal and, similar to straight walking, load in this context supports retraction of the leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>). On the inside, the variability in the influence is in good agreement with the observations from turning intact animals, where inside ML steps show the full spectrum of movement directions from forward to backward steps both on slippery ground and under more natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dürr and Ebeling, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruhn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruse et al., 2009</xref>). A context-dependent influence of load feedback as part of a unilateral mechanism to generate behavioral adaptivity had been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>). From our results, it seems clear that graded input from yet unknown origin anterior to the mesothoracic ganglion during optomotor induced curve walking of the front legs locally modifies strength and sign of this load stimulus-dependent influence. At least two possible mechanisms for the processing of load feedback are conceivable. One is presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stein and Schmitz, 1999</xref>) that could modify the gain of load feedback onto the neural networks controlling the thorax-coxa joint CPG. The existence of presynaptic modulation of sensory synapses in the CNS has previously been described in a number of invertebrate and vertebrate locomotor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarac and Cattaert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Büschges and Wolf, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sirois et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the weighing of parallel pathways from the load sensors, the CS, to the premotor interneurons could be shifted and thereby either promote retractor or protractor activation, as previously shown for gain control of reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driesang and Büschges, 1996</xref>) and recently implemented in a simulation model for cockroach turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the turning related modifications of the sensory processing on the two body sides always support stance. The difference between the two sides is that on the inside, flexion of the tibia and the inward directed movement of the leg are prioritized through strong assisting input from the fCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellekes et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, loading feedback is of lesser importance for determining forward or backward movement. In contrast, on the outside, processing of sensory feedback produces the opposite effect in that loading supports retraction to promote the front-aft movement of the leg.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Body-side specific influences on ThC-CPG activity during curve stepping</title><p>In addition to altered processing of local load feedback, we showed that in the intact animal phasing of the subcoxal protractor and retractor muscles with respect to stance and swing is markedly different between inside and outside steps. In addition, the motor output in the deafferented mesothoracic motor control system is also modified in a side-specific manner during curve walking of the FLs: first, there is pronounced alternating activity between pro- and retractor MNs on the inside, and tonic activity on the outside. Second, there is a strong bias towards protractor activation on the inside, and towards retractor activation on the outside. Our results thus indicate that the activity of the local subcoxal CPGs is under the influence of descending input from more anterior ganglia to support the generation of curve walking kinematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). How can such an influence be mediated?</p><p>Up to now, there are only two animal neural networks for which there exists a well founded idea on how turning is realized on the local level. The first are the networks that generate swimming in lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner et al., 2008</xref>), and the other are the networks that generate flight in locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowell, 1993</xref>). In lamprey, curve swimming is presently viewed to be mediated by a unilateral increase in descending excitatory drive from the brainstem onto the segmental CPGs which leads to a bias in the contraction strength of the segmental trunk muscles, and consequently to swimming towards the side with the increased drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fagerstedt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillner et al., 2008</xref>). In the locust, asymmetries in wing beat amplitude, phase shifts of wing beat between the sides, bending the abdomen and ruddering with the hind legs, all form part of steering maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowell, 1993</xref>). Especially, if the pronation angle in both wings on one side changes, turns are induced as a result of differences in lift and thrust between the two body sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolf, 1990</xref>). These asymmetries are created by activation of thoracic interneurons that receive input from descending interneurons about changes in body orientation. This appears to directly affect MN output on one side of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichert, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowell, 1993</xref>). However, in contrast to lamprey and the stick insect, in the locust, local CPG activity is unaffected by this descending input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rowell, 1993</xref>).</p><p>In the curve walking stick insect, it is quite conceivable that a unilateral mechanism not completely unlike that in curve swimming lamprey is at work, as severing one of the two connectives between pro- and mesothoracic ganglion only prevented turning-related changes in motor activity on the lesioned side and not on the other. The existence of a descending drive from anterior to the mesothoracic ganglion to the pattern generating networks of the mesothoracic joints was shown previously in physiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Westmark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>), and successfully implemented in models for the stick insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knops et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al., 2012</xref>) and also for cockroach walking and turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al. 2014</xref>). In contrast to lamprey steering, however, this drive appears to affect the segmental CPGs on each side of the stick insect. Moreover, the drive to the mesothorax during turning produces particularly strong activity in the respective opposite coxal MN pools in the homologous CPGs of the two sides. The above mentioned model hypothesized, and our results suggest an independent descending drive to the two body sides, which can independently strengthen or weaken the motor outputs to single leg muscles on each side of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knops et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szczecinski et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential sources for the influences on the thoracic network during turning</title><p>Currently, little information is available on where the drive onto the mesothoracic segment that induces the modification of local network activity in the stick insect comes from. The coupling of mesothoracic inside motor activity, clearly demonstrates a phasic interganglionic thoracic influence through the FL activity. However, this influence is not present on the outside. This suggests that higher order centers in the subesophageal and supraesophageal ganglia may play the decisive role in shaping thoracic motor activity and sensory processing. Evidence for higher order centers in the insect brain as a source of the descending drive come from studies on the central complex (CX) of the cerebral ganglion. Lesion and stimulation experiments in the cockroach have shown that this neuronal structure is necessary for proper turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridgel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). Fruit flies with mutations in the CX, show severe deficits in turning and start/stop maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strauss and Heisenberg, 1993</xref>). By lesioning the connectives anterior to the prothoracic ganglion, in cockroach and locust, or stimulation of the CX, descending signals from the brain were also shown to be responsible for altering reflex sign or gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mu and Ritzmann, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knop et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2015</xref>) as part of the generation of turning kinematics. The nature of the descending signals and the cellular pathways are still unknown. Assuming a similar source in the stick insect, alteration of motor activity and sensory processing in the turning stick insect could be the result of increased excitation following disinhibition on one side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roeder, 1937</xref>) or, through crossed inhibition, on the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gal and Libersat, 2006</xref>), and direct inhibition from the cerebral ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gal and Libersat, 2006</xref>). Our data allow both mechanisms to play a role in turning behavior, as both, inside and outside mesothoracic pro-/retractor CPGs show increased activity, only in opposite MN pools. Recently, a neuron class was described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that seems both necessary and sufficient to drive backward walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>). Sustained activation of the so-called MDN neurons (two per cerebral ganglion hemisphere) allow the flies to reverse stepping direction. Their axons arborize in both hemispheres of the cerebral and subesophageal ganglia, and cross the midline to project to the contralateral thoracic ganglia. From the report, it appears that this crossing takes place in the ventral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>). Unilateral activation of similar neurons in the stick insect could provide means to promote turning.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that motor output of single legs in the turning stick insect is under individual hemi-segmental influence by descending signals. We have shown that these signals to the mesothoracic ganglion act together to produce turning kinematics by at least three mechanisms: first, task-dependent processing of local load signals, modified on the inside, and unchanged on the outside; second, a shift in the weighting of motor output to the protractor on the inside, and the retractor on the outside, via modification of mesothoracic CPG activity; and third, task-dependent influence from the ipsilateral front leg which is strong on the inside and weak on the outside. Together or separately, in full strength or gradually, these three mechanisms could provide the animal with the means to perform optomotor induced turns in all their different curvatures. Previous work suggests that the origin for the modulatory influence on mesothoracic CPG activity resides largely anterior to the prothoracic ganglion. Our results provide the first comprehensive evidence for the combined local action of different central neuronal mechanisms acting together at the level of the thoracic ganglia to drive this specific kind of behavior in a legged animal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed in a darkened Faraday cage at room temperature (22°–24°C) on adult female stick insects (<italic>Carausius morosus</italic>; Brunner), of 7.5 cm in length.

This produced slipperiness and allowed recording of tarsal contact when desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruhn et al., 2006</xref>). Animals were glued ventral side down on an 80 mm long and 3 mm wide balsa rod using dental cement (ProTempII, ESPE, Seefeld Germany) so that legs and head protruded from the rod, and all joints were unrestrained. Animal height above the substrate was adjustable, but was typically 10 mm. Walking was elicited as an optomotor response by projecting a striped pattern (pattern wave length 21°) onto two 13.5 cm diameter round glass screens placed at right angles to each other and at a 45°angle to the walking surface, approximately 6–7 cm away from the eyes of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruhn et al., 2006</xref>). If the animal did not begin locomotion spontaneously, walking was elicited by light brush strokes to the abdomen. For experiments with two-legged animals, we induced autotomy of the meso- and metathoracic legs with a pair of forceps or cut the legs at the level of the coxa after recording from the intact animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>).

Legs were marked at the distal end of the tibia, using yellow fluorescent pigments as markers (catalogue #56150, Dr. Georg Kremer Farbmühle, Aichstetten, Germany) which were dissolved in two-component glue (ProTempII, ESPE, see above). During the recording, the animal was illuminated with blue LED arrays (12 V AC/DC, Conrad Electronic, Germany). A yellow filter in front of the camera lens was used to suppress the short wavelength of the activation light. Video files were analyzed using motion tracking software (WINanalyze, Vers.1.9, Mikromak service, Berlin, Germany). Stepping frequencies between inside and outside front and middle legs were determined using the times of touchdown (at the anterior extreme position, AEP) and lift-off (at the posterior extreme position, PEP), as well as the period between consecutive AEPs. These were verified visually by an additional mirror placed at an angle of 45° behind the animal. All inside and outside steps of complete 20–30 s stepping sequences were averaged in their respective groups and evaluated. The sample size for the inside and outside walks was N=10 animals, and 1–2 stepping sequences per animal (total of 14), the walks used for the analysis of front and middle leg stepping frequency were the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Recording tarsal contact</title><p>Latencies of muscle activation were determined using the electronic tarsal touchdown signal of the ML as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruhn et al., 2006</xref>). In brief, a square wave signal of 2–4 mV amplitude was generated with a pulse generator (Model MS501, electronics workshop, Zoological Institute, Cologne), and applied to the slippery surface and a lock-in amplifier (electronics workshop, Zoological Institute, Cologne) as a reference signal. A copper wire (49 µm outer diameter) with its insulation removed at the tip was tied around the tibia of the monitored leg, and connected to the lock-in amplifier with an alligator clip. The electrical resistance between the cuticle and copper wire was reduced with a drop of electrode cream (Marquette Hellige, Freiburg, Germany) placed at the area of contact, allowing a 2–4 nA current to pass through tarsus and tibia. During stance, current flowed from the plate through tarsus and tibia into the copper wire. The digitized using an AD converter (Micro 1401k II, CED, Cambridge, UK) and Spike2 software (Vers. 5.05, CED, Cambridge, UK). Due to the low-pass filter properties of the lock-in amplifier and the gradual lift-off/touchdown of the tarsus, the signal was not exactly square. We used thresholds close to the transition point to define the timing of tarsal contact and manually checked each event. Touchdowns could be determined at a resolution of less than 1 ms. Lift-off transitions were less steep and more delayed because of delayed tearing of the lubricant from the tarsus due to capillary action and occasional upward movements of the leg during stance without complete lift-off. To have comparable lift-off times in all experiments, we always defined lift-off as the time point with the steepest ascending slope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Muscle activity (<italic>electromyogram</italic>, EMG) was recorded as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenbaum et al., 2010</xref>), using two twisted, coated copper wires (40 µm outer diameter) placed in each muscle approximately 1 mm apart and held in place with dental cement (ProTempII, ESPE) or tissue adhesive (3 M Vetbond, St.Paul, MN). All recordings were differentially amplified. The EMG signal was pre-amplified 100 fold (electronics workshop, Zoological Institute, Cologne), band-pass filtered (100 Hz-2000 Hz), when necessary further amplified 10–1000 fold, and imported into Spike2 (Vers. 5.05, CED) through an AD converter (Micro 1401k II, CED). A reference electrode was placed in the abdomen of the animal. For the analysis of muscle latency in the inside or outside ML, in most experiments, two antagonistic joint muscles were recorded simultaneously. <italic>Protractor coxae</italic> and <italic>retractor coxae</italic> EMG`s were recorded in the thorax, <italic>depressor trochanteris</italic> and <italic>levator trochanteris</italic> in the coxa, and <italic>extensor tibiae</italic> and <italic>flexor tibiae</italic> in the femur. In 2 experiments three muscles, in 3 experiments four, and in one all six muscles were recorded from, simultaneously. These experiments gave the same results as the others. For the experiments in the two-leg preparations, EMGs in the flexor tibiae muscle of each leg served as a reference for the step cycle of the front leg. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the EMG activity was placed in the reference frame of the electrically determined swing and stance phases.</p><p>Extracellular nerve recordings were performed as follows: all except the two front legs were amputated at mid-coxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>). Animals were fixed with dental cement (Protemp II, ESPE) dorsal side up on a foam platform with the same width as the balsa stick for the intact animals, but for a small stretch along the thorax behind the front legs where the platform was 8mm wide to accommodate the gut. The dorsal side of the thorax was opened, the gut moved aside, and connective tissue carefully removed to expose the connectives, the meso- and metathoracic ganglia and respective leg nerves. The coxae of the amputated middle and hind legs were fixed with dental cement, and afferent feedback was prevented by severing all lateral nerves of the meso- and metathoracic ganglia, except nl2 and nl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marquardt, 1940</xref>) of the mesothorax, which contain the axons of the mesothoracic coxal protractor and retractor motor neurons (MNs), respectively. The body cavity was filled with <italic>Carausius</italic> saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weidler and Diecke, 1969</xref>), except for in split-bath experiments (see below). Mesothoracic motor activity was recorded extracellularly from leg nerves nl2, and nl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>) on both sides of the animal, using monopolar hook electrodes (modified after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitz et al., 1991</xref>). For the lesion experiments, the pro-to-mesothoracic connective under investigation was cut with a pair of micro-surgery scissors. Split-bath experiments with the muscarinic agonist Pilocarpine were conducted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2009</xref>). A small, 2 mm stretch of cuticle between the pro- and meso-, and the meso- and metathoracic ganglia was removed except for the connectives, and the gap filled with vaseline (Bad Apotheke, Bad Rothenfelde, Germany). The compartments were first filled with normal <italic>Carausius</italic> saline for control recordings, and the saline in the mesothoracic compartment was subsequently replaced by 3 mM pilocarpine solution in saline.</p><p>ML campaniform sensilla (CS) were stimulated according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2007</xref>).

For comparisons of EMG activity, EMG traces were rectified and smoothed (τ = 50 ms, Spike 2, CED, UK), and each single data point of each step exported to Excel (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, USA) for averaging. For each step, the minimum muscle activity was set to zero and the maximum to 1. In some cases, weak crosstalk from the antagonist muscle was removed by the following procedure: the activity of the EMG in the antagonist and in the agonist were triggered simultaneously (i.e. at lift-off or touchdown of the tarsal contact trace), and exported in the same way as above. Then the antagonists minimum activity was set to 0, but its maximum to an arbitrary value of 0.5, due to the smaller size of the antagonist signal in the agonist EMG. The normalized activity of the antagonistic muscle was then subtracted from the corresponding value of the muscle under investigation. Latencies of the first spike with respect to lift-off or touchdown were calculated relative to the tarsal contact signal (see above). The absolute latency was normalized with respect to the corresponding step cycle and averaged. Average swing/stance phase duration was calculated from each evaluated step from lift-off to touchdown for swing, and from touchdown to lift-off for stance.</p><p>For stepping period analysis, we used 14 walks from N=10 animals, the muscle activation profiles during inside and outside were determined from N=5 animals. For the reduced preparations of two-legged animals, we used head movement in addition to leg kinematics to determine the direction of the turn. By using head posture alone and not having four more legs to judge turning behavior from, we may have introduced a bias towards more easily identifiable narrow turns in our sample of the two-leg preparations. However, this has no consequence for the conclusions drawn. For the analysis of the processing of load feedback we analyzed walking sequences from N=13 animals. Data for the analysis of descending influence of two-legged walking on the motor activity of ML pro-/retractor was taken from N=14 to 17 animals depending on the muscle and the direction of the turn (numbers given in the text). For the split-bath experiments, data from N=5 animals for outside, and N=8 animals for inside turns were analyzed. The lesion experiments were performed on N=4 animals (lesion of the pro-mesothoracic connective), and CS stimulation in N=13 animals.</p><p>Data processing and figure preparation were performed in Spike2 (Vers. 5.05, CED) and MATLAB 7.0 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick). In some analyses, extracellular recordings were rectified and smoothed. For EMG analysis, smoothing was performed with the Spike2 smoothing function by calculating the average value of the input data points from time t - T to t + T seconds for each sample point. T was 0.05 s in our analyses. To analyze the activity of the retractor in response to CS stimuli we first rectified and then smoothed the retractor activity with a running Gaussian average (width of 100 ms). For responses during inside steps we then determined the maximum retractor activation in a time window of 150 ms after CS stimulation and normalized these to the average maximum response during control stimulations. The resulting activation strength was then plotted against the instantaneous phase of the FL step cycle. To characterize retractor responses during outside steps we first determined the average retractor activity in a time window of 100 ms before CS stimulation and 100 ms after CS stimulation. We then subtracted the average activity after CS stimulation from the activity before CS stimulation and divided the difference by the sum of the two activities; the resulting value (also known as Michelson contrast) varied between -1 and 1. Values larger than 0 thereby indicated an increase in retractor activation after CS stimulation, values below 0 indicated a decrease. These values were plotted against the phase of the FL step cycle, defined by the start of one stance phase to the start of the next, using circular statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berens, 2009</xref>). In addition, we determined the instantaneous phase of FL steps during inside steps at the times when either no retractor activation occurred in response to CS stimulation or when protractor activation was observed. For the analysis of the mesothoracic motor activity during FL stepping, data were first analyzed with respect to walking leg step cycle, again defined by the start of one stance phase to the start of the next, using circular statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berens, 2009</xref>). Phase histograms were used to compare motor neuron activity in steps with different cycle periods. Polar plots for mesothoracic motor activity show mean vectors of activity in the step cycle for each experiment. Vectors that had significant lengths are marked with an asterisk (Rayleigh test with a value of 0.005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batschelet, 1981</xref>]). The vector length from most experiments was highly significant due to the large number of spikes. For the overall mean vector of all experiments no test of significance was done due to the varying number of spikes and steps in the experiments. A cross-correlation between pro- and retractor MN activities was done for the complete recording time including the time between stepping sequences. Between stepping sequences, pro- and retractor MNs are tonically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Büschges and Schmitz, 1991</xref>). The cross-correlation function mirrors the episodic occurrence of the stepping sequences and, if it exists, a periodic coupling between pro- and retractor MN activities. Significance levels marked with asterisks are as follows: * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001 where applicable.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald L. Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roy Ritzmann and Hans-Joachim Pflüger (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a detailed analysis of optomotor-induced turning and the neuronal mechanisms underlying the differences between the leg movements of the two body sides in stick insects. They find that the generation of turning kinematics are the combined result of unilateral commands that change the leg motor output via task-specific modifications in the processing of local sensory feedback as well as modification of the activity of local central pattern generating networks in a body-side-specific way. This work in an important model system for the study of the reflex control of terrestrial limbed locomotion has potential implication for how visually guided turning movements are controlled in terrestrial limbed vertebrates. In this system there is excellent experimental access to reflex mechanisms and to central neurons that integrate reflex inputs and participate in motor pattern generation.</p><p>The experiments are carefully done and the data presented is elegant and in general appropriately analyzed. Figures are clear and present the needed data. Writing is clear.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are three main concerns that must be addressed before this paper can be considered for publication, however. The detailed reviews provide the reasoning behind why these changes are essential.</p><p>1) The origin of the unilateral commands that are posited to underlie turning movements are not clear. No direct evidence is presented here that these commands descend from the brain and that asymmetric descending activity in connective axons occurs. The authors must clarify this point particularly in light of findings by Martin JP, Guo P, Mu L, Harley CM, Ritzmann RE. (Central-Complex Control of Movement in the Freely Walking Cockroach. Curr Biol. 2015 Nov 2;25(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>):2795-803. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.044. Epub 2015 Oct 22. PubMed PMID: 26592340.). They should also adjust their claims accordingly.</p><p>Alternatively, they can record such asymmetric activity and show that it descends from the brain.</p><p>2) How the 'turns' that take place on the frictionless slippery plate relate to turns on a normal substrate is difficult to envision. The authors must provide a compelling discussion of how to relate slippery plate data to normal substrate conditions. Alternatively, new experiments would have to be performed using a more natural situation, e.g., the leg moving on an air suspended ball to make useful comparisons.</p><p>3) Reviewer #2 has asked for some new analysis of the existing data which must be performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that clearly describes asymmetrical effects on both CPGs and load reflexes associated with turning on inside and outside legs. The authors suggest that such changes are the result of descending commands and provide a model for motor adjustments associated with turning. The data are very nice, but I have some concerns.</p><p>First, I am concerned about what they authors mean by &quot;descending effects&quot;. They seem to take the correlation of mesothoracic load effects and CPG activation with prothoracic activity as indicating a causative relationship; i.e. the prothoracic ganglion is dictating the changes in mesothoracic. I am not sure that is warranted. It could be that descending commands from higher centers are causing both prothoracic and mesothoracic changes associated with turning in tandem. That would create the correlations that are documented here, but without causation. Moreover, I think the authors need to be careful about what they mean by &quot;descending effects&quot;. They performed a nice experiment looking at the effects of unilateral lesion of the T1-T2 connective that indicates a descending effect. But descending from where? This experiment addresses effects from prothoracic to mesothoracic ganglion, but does not address effects from higher centers. In the Discussion, they seem to jump to the brain and in fact to the central complex (CX) (BTW a morphology paper authored by just about all the anatomists who work on insect brain recently agreed to use &quot;CX&quot; as the shorthand for &quot;central complex&quot;). That is entirely possible, but I don't see any data in this paper that addresses influences from the CX or any other brain source. The authors do refer to several CX papers to support that claim. They also describe two systems that have examined effects of brain neurons descending to lower centers in association with turning movements. Interestingly they did not list a recent paper that more directly addresses their hypothesis. Martin et al. (2015) Curr. Biol. 25:1-9 describes motor maps associated with extracellularly recorded CX activity in freely walking cockroaches as they turn and climb over object and that stimulation through the CX electrodes could consistently evoke turns in a particular direction. When that occurred, they moved the preparation, with the brain electrodes in place, to a prep dish that allowed them to test the inter-joint reflexes stemming from the femoral chordotonal organ on the inside leg with and without brain stimulation in the CX region that evoked turns. On the inside leg, Ds reflexes were reversed consistent with what Mu and Ritzmann, 2008 found with bilateral cervical lesion. Another paper that would seem to be relevant is Szczecinski et al. (2014) Biol. Cybern. This paper examined the joint kinematics of all leg joints as a cockroach mounted on an oiled plate transitioned from forward walking to turning in response to an optomoter stimulus. The changes that occurred were then modeled in a neural simulation of joint reflexes and reflexes.</p><p>Second, I think the authors need to be careful about what they mean by turning (especially in the Discussion, subsection “Different leg kinematics and motor output on the two body sides of a curve stepping insect”). This paper utilizes only data from oiled plate experiments. I think this preparation is very useful and I agree wholeheartedly with their assertion that the mechanical decoupling of the legs from each other allows them to directly assess central neural effects. I have no problem with that. However, no experimental procedure is without its own baggage and this one has plenty. The animal is slipping and the decoupling could have profound effects on motor control. As the authors point out in the Discussion, some of the differences they report relative to other papers could arise from this. The CPGs could be running at a very high rate that would be limited with a whole suite of inter-leg mechanical coupling. In the intact freely moving insect, the CPGs could be providing a switch of last resort that never actually occurs, because various sensors from various legs normally force the issue before the CPG repolarizes. This is seen nicely in leech heart where neurons on one side of the ganglion will eventually repolarize from a plateau potential but normally are driven to baseline by inhibition from its contralateral homologue long before that occurs in isolation. Moreover, the turning that the authors are reporting on represents just one of many types of turns. The switch to pulling motion that is seen in the inside leg is not always seen in freely walking turns of insects. Jindrich and Full (1999) JEB 202:1603 showed several years ago that many cockroach turns show no kinematic changes but rather result from asymmetrical ground reaction forces. That kind of turn could easily occur simply by a descending command altering the strength of lateral joint movements on one side. The point is, there are many ways that any animal can execute a turn and each could be controlled by different mechanisms.</p><p>None of these comments question the relevance of the data that is reported or even the model that is presented. I just think the authors need to be careful to not generalize too much beyond the preparation that they are using and the results that they have to report on. So, I would strongly suggest making it clear that this may or may not relate directly to more natural turning movements, although it probably plays some part in natural turning, and that their data are not addressing commands descending from the brain at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper analyzes the role of local feedback, descending commands, and the intrinsic CPG on the patterns of antagonist protractor/retractor motor activity on opposing sides of the stick insect during curve walking. The importance of this work lies in its analysis of the contribution of each these factors to differences in the movements of contralateral legs to produce curve walking. Previous work has shown that the inside middle legs move at a lower frequency than the outside legs in animals that are curve walking on normal substrates. In the present experiments, only the front legs contacted the ground, which was frictionless. During frictionless curve walking induced by optokinetic stimuli, the inside legs moved at a higher frequency than the outside legs. The paper describes experiments to determine how the intrinsic left and right CPGs, lateralized descending commands, and imposed load stimuli each affect the inside and outside leg motor patterns during curve walking. While this analysis is clear, its relevance to the different motor patterns seen during curve-walking on normal substrates is not made clear. As the authors discuss, &quot;Most studies on turning of invertebrates also reported a decrease in stepping frequency on the inside compared to the outside legs (Zolotov et al., 1975; Jander, 1985), sometimes no change in frequencies (Cruse and Saavedra, 1996)&quot;. Under these conditions, the legs are coupled through movements of the body relative to the substrate. This coupling is absent during frictionless walking. The authors suggest that &quot;The higher inside stepping frequency under these (frictionless substrate) conditions may therefore reflect true centrally generated drive during turning.&quot; But the higher stepping may also reflect the faster movements of the leg and therefore a more frequent generation of feedback signals that promote stance/swing and swing/stance transitions. Indeed, the factors analyzed under frictionless walking may operate differently to produce the different walking patterns observed on normal substrates. The authors should show how the mechanisms at work during frictionless curve walking inform our understanding of curve walking on normal substrates.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Contribution of load feedback to turning kinematics”: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> does not present evidence that the load response &quot;was independent of the phase of the stimulation with respect to the FL steps.&quot; Bii shows when the stimulus was presented with respect to the FL step, and Biii appears to show a cumulative PSTH for all the responses. A plot of the response amplitude vs. phase of the FL step is needed to show the phase independence of the response.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Contribution of load feedback to turning kinematics”: To show that &quot;the observed motor effects are independent of FL stepping (Figure 3Bii)&quot;, the authors will need a plot of the response amplitude vs. phase of the step. Some stimuli evoked increases and some evoked decreases in retractor activity; the authors should show how these vary across the phase of the step.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Gruhn et al. describes experiments in stick insects that examine the central aspects of turning behaviour under the interesting condition where the animal performs stationary turns on a &quot;slippery surface&quot;. The main finding is that inside and outside legs receive different inputs from their ipsilateral (side specific) connective which not only alters the involved central pattern generators but also the processing of local sensory feedback. Not totally unexpected from discussions and theories of previous work, it is the experimental evidence presented here, that supports this idea very convincingly. Therefore, I do not have any objections to the scientific content of this manuscript. In general, experiments and results are clearly described and documented.

No direct evidence is presented here that these commands descend from the brain and that asymmetric descending activity in connective axons occurs. The authors must clarify this point particularly in light of findings by Martin JP, Guo P, Mu L, Harley CM, Ritzmann RE. (Central-Complex Control of Movement in the Freely Walking Cockroach. Curr Biol. 2015 Nov 2;25(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>):2795-803. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.044. Epub 2015 Oct 22. PubMed PMID: 26592340.). They should also adjust their claims accordingly.</italic></p><p><italic>Alternatively, they can record such asymmetric activity and show that it descends from the brain.</italic></p><p><italic>2) How the 'turns' that take place on the frictionless slippery plate relate to turns on a normal substrate is difficult to envision. The authors must provide a compelling discussion of how to relate slippery plate data to normal substrate conditions. Alternatively, new experiments would have to be performed using a more natural situation, e.g., the leg moving on an air suspended ball to make useful comparisons.</italic></p><p><italic>3) Reviewer #2 has asked for some new analysis of the existing data which must be performed.</italic></p><p>First of all we would like to thank you for the many critical and helpful comments and criticism that you have raised. We have tried to answer to them as well as we could. We believe that we have improved the manuscript considerably, and hopefully to your satisfaction. We have also added some more analyses that were requested and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> accordingly, as well as additional supplements to these two figures. In the following, we have interwoven our answers to the comments raised by each reviewer into your comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>This is an interesting study that clearly describes asymmetrical effects on both CPGs and load reflexes associated with turning on inside and outside legs. The authors suggest that such changes are the result of descending commands and provide a model for motor adjustments associated with turning. The data are very nice, but I have some concerns.</italic></p><p><italic>First, I am concerned about what they authors mean by &quot;descending effects&quot;. They seem to take the correlation of mesothoracic load effects and CPG activation with prothoracic activity as indicating a causative relationship; i.e. the prothoracic ganglion is dictating the changes in mesothoracic. I am not sure that is warranted. It could be that descending commands from higher centers are causing both prothoracic and mesothoracic changes associated with turning in tandem. That would create the correlations that are documented here, but without causation. Moreover, I think the authors need to be careful about what they mean by &quot;descending effects&quot;. They performed a nice experiment looking at the effects of unilateral lesion of the T1-T2 connective that indicates a descending effect. But descending from where? This experiment addresses effects from prothoracic to mesothoracic ganglion, but does not address effects from higher centers. In the Discussion, they seem to jump to the brain and in fact to the central complex (CX) (BTW a morphology paper authored by just about all the anatomists who work on insect brain recently agreed to use &quot;CX&quot; as the shorthand for &quot;central complex&quot;). That is entirely possible, but I don't see any data in this paper that addresses influences from the CX or any other brain source. The authors do refer to several CX papers to support that claim. They also describe two systems that have examined effects of brain neurons descending to lower centers in association with turning movements. Interestingly they did not list a recent paper that more directly addresses their hypothesis. Martin et al. (2015) Curr. Biol. 25:1-9 describes motor maps associated with extracellularly recorded CX activity in freely walking cockroaches as they turn and climb over object and that stimulation through the CX electrodes could consistently evoke turns in a particular direction. When that occurred, they moved the preparation, with the brain electrodes in place, to a prep dish that allowed them to test the inter-joint reflexes stemming from the femoral chordotonal organ on the inside leg with and without brain stimulation in the CX region that evoked turns. On the inside leg, Ds reflexes were reversed consistent with what Mu and Ritzmann, 2008 found with bilateral cervical lesion. Another paper that would seem to be relevant is Szczecinski et al. (2014) Biol. Cybern. This paper examined the joint kinematics of all leg joints as a cockroach mounted on an oiled plate transitioned from forward walking to turning in response to an optomoter stimulus. The changes that occurred were then modeled in a neural simulation of joint reflexes and reflexes.</italic></p><p>If the reviewer understands our claims this way, we apologize. We have not meant &quot;descending effects&quot; to mean that the prothoracic ganglion is dictating changes in the mesothoracic ganglion. In fact, we do believe that the inputs causing the changes in the mesothoracic motor activity and the processing of mesothoracic sensory inputs is caused by descending influence from the brain and may be influenced by prothoracic activity under certain circumstances. In order to take the reviewers very valid concerns into account we have reworded the entire manuscript carefully in order not to suggest such an effect and pay tribute to the very valid concerns. For example, we have removed the term &quot;descending&quot; from the final paragraph of the Introduction and carefully reworded conclusions in the Results part (see below). In addition, we have integrated the citations the reviewer mentions into the manuscript as we feel that especially Martin et al. work strongly supports our claims. This influential work had clearly skipped our attention in the final phase of pre-submission. We have also carefully reworded the entire Discussion with regard to the origin of the &quot;descending&quot; inputs. In addition, we have modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> such that it is more clear that the arrows within the scheme only suggest the minimum origin for descending inputs we are sure about (i.e. anterior to the mesothorax or FL influence during inside steps) and broken lines indicate in our view likely but untested origin from the brain.</p><p><italic>Second, I think the authors need to be careful about what they mean by turning (especially in the Discussion, subsection “Different leg kinematics and motor output on the two body sides of a curve stepping insect”). This paper utilizes only data from oiled plate experiments. I think this preparation is very useful and I agree wholeheartedly with their assertion that the mechanical decoupling of the legs from each other allows them to directly assess central neural effects. I have no problem with that. However, no experimental procedure is without its own baggage and this one has plenty. The animal is slipping and the decoupling could have profound effects on motor control. As the authors point out in the Discussion, some of the differences they report relative to other papers could arise from this. The CPGs could be running at a very high rate that would be limited with a whole suite of inter-leg mechanical coupling. In the intact freely moving insect, the CPGs could be providing a switch of last resort that never actually occurs, because various sensors from various legs normally force the issue before the CPG repolarizes. This is seen nicely in leech heart where neurons on one side of the ganglion will eventually repolarize from a plateau potential but normally are driven to baseline by inhibition from its contralateral homologue long before that occurs in isolation. Moreover, the turning that the authors are reporting on represents just one of many types of turns. The switch to pulling motion that is seen in the inside leg is not always seen in freely walking turns of insects. Jindrich and Full (1999) JEB 202:1603 showed several years ago that many cockroach turns show no kinematic changes but rather result from asymmetrical ground reaction forces. That kind of turn could easily occur simply by a descending command altering the strength of lateral joint movements on one side. The point is, there are many ways that any animal can execute a turn and each could be controlled by different mechanisms.</italic> </p><p><italic>None of these comments question the relevance of the data that is reported or even the model that is presented. I just think the authors need to be careful to not generalize too much beyond the preparation that they are using and the results that they have to report on. So, I would strongly suggest making it clear that this may or may not relate directly to more natural turning movements, although it probably plays some part in natural turning, and that their data are not addressing commands descending from the brain at this time.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is absolutely right in his call for caution in the use of the term &quot;turning&quot; and we have re-written the Discussion thoroughly to make sure potential readers will be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the approach that we have used, and the implied caveats. Especially the paragraph on &quot;Different leg kinematics and motor output on the two body sides of a curve stepping insect&quot; has been thoroughly edited in this respect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This paper analyzes the role of local feedback, descending commands, and the intrinsic CPG on the patterns of antagonist protractor/retractor motor activity on opposing sides of the stick insect during curve walking. The importance of this work lies in its analysis of the contribution of each these factors to differences in the movements of contralateral legs to produce curve walking. Previous work has shown that the inside middle legs move at a lower frequency than the outside legs in animals that are curve walking on normal substrates. In the present experiments, only the front legs contacted the ground, which was frictionless. During frictionless curve walking induced by optokinetic stimuli, the inside legs moved at a higher frequency than the outside legs. The paper describes experiments to determine how the intrinsic left and right CPGs, lateralized descending commands, and imposed load stimuli each affect the inside and outside leg motor patterns during curve walking. While this analysis is clear, its relevance to the different motor patterns seen during curve-walking on normal substrates is not made clear. As the authors discuss, &quot;Most studies on turning of invertebrates also reported a decrease in stepping frequency on the inside compared to the outside legs (Zolotov et al., 1975; Jander, 1985), sometimes no change in frequencies (Cruse and Saavedra, 1996)&quot;. Under these conditions, the legs are coupled through movements of the body relative to the substrate. This coupling is absent during frictionless walking. The authors suggest that &quot;The higher inside stepping frequency under these (frictionless substrate) conditions may therefore reflect true centrally generated drive during turning.&quot; But the higher stepping may also reflect the faster movements of the leg and therefore a more frequent generation of feedback signals that promote stance/swing and swing/stance transitions. Indeed, the factors analyzed under frictionless walking may operate differently to produce the different walking patterns observed on normal substrates. The authors should show how the mechanisms at work during frictionless curve walking inform our understanding of curve walking on normal substrates.</italic></p><p>We have tried to make the analysis of frictionless walking in comparison to normal walking more clear. While the reviewer is right that the higher inside stepping frequency may reflect faster movement of the leg due to the frictionless walking conditions, this does not explain while this should be different on the outside and not create a higher outside frequency. Therefore, we still believe that the inherent drive between inside and outside is different. However, we have re-worded the text carefully to take the concern into account. It now reads: &quot;A plausible explanation for the difference to our findings and similar ones in the cockroach (Mu et al., 2005) is that we studied curve walking on a slippery surface. […] However, because the slipperiness takes away the influences of friction and reduces the sensory feedback between legs, the significantly higher stepping frequency on the inside compared to the outside, under these conditions may reflect true centrally generated drive during turning.&quot;</p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Contribution of load feedback to turning kinematics”: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> does not present evidence that the load response &quot;was independent of the phase of the stimulation with respect to the FL steps.&quot; Bii shows when the stimulus was presented with respect to the FL step, and Biii appears to show a cumulative PSTH for all the responses. A plot of the response amplitude vs. phase of the FL step is needed to show the phase independence of the response.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is right that our plot of the response to CS stimuli during outside steps of the ipsilateral FL does show phase but absolute timing of the CS stimulus. We phrased this incorrectly. We have also further analyzed the phasing of the response and modified the text accordingly. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we added a plot with the retractor activity vs CS stimulus with respect to phase. In addition, we added a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> with the data from all 13 animals.</p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Contribution of load feedback to turning kinematics”: To show that &quot;the observed motor effects are independent of FL stepping (Figure 3Bii)&quot;, the authors will need a plot of the response amplitude vs. phase of the step. Some stimuli evoked increases and some evoked decreases in retractor activity; the authors should show how these vary across the phase of the step.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct in that there is variability in the strength of the retractor activation during inside steps of the FL. We have re-analyzed the retractor response to load stimuli during inside turns to evaluate the response amplitude with respect to phase. We found that there is no correlation between the response amplitude and the phase of the FL step cycle during which the stimulus occurred. This is shown as a plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. In addition, we added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> with the data from all 13 animals. Furthermore, we have added phase response plots for protractor activation and the failure to respond in 3E and F.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript by Gruhn et al. describes experiments in stick insects that examine the central aspects of turning behaviour under the interesting condition where the animal performs stationary turns on a &quot;slippery surface&quot;. The main finding is that inside and outside legs receive different inputs from their ipsilateral (side specific) connective which not only alters the involved central pattern generators but also the processing of local sensory feedback. Not totally unexpected from discussions and theories of previous work, it is the experimental evidence presented here, that supports this idea very convincingly. Therefore, I do not have any objections to the scientific content of this manuscript. In general, experiments and results are clearly described and documented. Of course, additionally one really would like to see recordings from the respective connectives and whether their patterns differ on both sides and whether it would be possible to identify some of the descending neurons which would be causal for the observed effects on inside and outside legs.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this very good suggestion and agree that recordings from the connectives would be a very nice addition to the data presented here. Plans to conduct these experiments are underway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
