Surprisingly, it is not their youthfulness that protects young hermaphrodites, but the fact that they have self-sperm. The beneficial effect of self-sperm is mediated by a sperm-sensing pathway acting on the soma rather than by fertilization. Activation of this pathway in females triggers protection from the negative impact of males. Interestingly, the role of self-sperm in protecting against the detrimental effects of males evolved independently in hermaphroditic nematodes. Endogenous strategies to delay the negative effect of mating may represent a key evolutionary innovation to maximize reproductive success.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46418.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A nematode worm known as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is often used in the laboratory to study how animals grow and develop. There are two types of <italic>C. elegans</italic> worm: hermaphrodite individuals produce both female sex cells (eggs) and male sex cells (sperm), while male individuals only produce sperm.</p><p>The hermaphrodite worms are able to reproduce without mating with another worm, allowing populations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to grow rapidly when they are living in favorable conditions. However, when the hermaphrodites do mate with males they tend to produce more offspring. These offspring are also usually healthier because they receive a mixture of genetic material from two different parents.</p><p>Although mating is beneficial for the survival of a species it can also harm an individual animal. Previous studies have shown that mating with male worms can accelerate aging of hermaphrodite worms and cause premature death. However, it remained unclear whether hermaphrodite worms have evolved any mechanisms to protect themselves after mating with a male.</p><p>To address this question, Booth et al. used genetic techniques to study the lifespans of hermaphrodite worms. The experiments found that the hermaphrodites’ own sperm (known as self-sperm) regulated a sperm-sensing signaling pathway that protected them from the negative impact of mating with males. Hermaphrodites with self-sperm that mated with males lived for a similar length of time as hermaphrodites that did not mate. On the other hand, hermaphrodites that did not have self-sperm (because they were older or had a genetic mutation) had shorter lifespans after mating than worms that did not mate. Modulating the sperm-sensing signaling pathway in worms that lacked self-sperm was sufficient to protect them from the negative effects of mating with males.</p><p>Further experiments found that the hermaphrodites of another nematode worm called <italic>C. briggsae</italic> – which evolved self-sperm independently of <italic>C. elegans</italic> – also protected themselves from the negative effects of mating with males in a similar way. This suggests that other animals may also have evolved similar mechanisms to protect themselves from harm when mating.</p><p>A separate study by Shi et al. has found that the beneficial effects of self-sperm are mediated by a pathway linked to longevity that also exists in mammals.

In mammals, mates induce neurological, developmental, and behavioral changes in the opposite sex and can negatively impact health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garratt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aloise King et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stowers and Kuo, 2015</xref>). For example, the presence of males can increase female body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garratt et al., 2016</xref>) and accelerate puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flanagan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vandenbergh, 1969</xref>). Identification of specific strategies involved in responding to the effects of sexual encounters could help to improve our understanding of how the sexes interact with each other, how sexual pressures have shaped species over evolutionary time, and how these mechanisms could be harnessed to improve health.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is particularly well suited to the study of the effect of sexual interactions on lifespan. Males shorten the lifespan of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite through a phenomenon called male-induced demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>). Previous studies showed that males shorten hermaphrodite lifespan by several means (<italic>e.g.</italic> sperm, seminal fluid, and pheromones), and identified some of the hermaphrodite genes that mediate male-induced demise (e.g. <italic>utx-1</italic>, <italic>ins-11, daf-16</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>). However, whether hermaphrodites evolved natural defense mechanisms to protect themselves after a sexual encounter with a male remained unknown.</p><p>Here we discover that young hermaphrodites are entirely protected from brief sexual encounters with males. Surprisingly, the natural protection in young hermaphrodites is not due to their youthfulness, but rather to the presence of self-sperm. Self-sperm act through a sperm-sensing pathway to protect the soma in a fertilization-independent manner, and activating this pathway in females can protect them against the detrimental effect of males. The protective effect of self-sperm is conserved in other hermaphroditic nematodes and may represent a key adaptation for their reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Young hermaphrodites are protected from demise induced by a brief mating with males</title><p>Previous studies were done with long encounters between young <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), which does not reflect the situation in nature where males are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrière and Félix, 2005</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Long and frequent sexual interactions with young males (blue dashed line) reduced hermaphrodite lifespan (p&lt;0.0001 vs. no males).

(<bold>E</bold>) To control for the mating efficiency differences between ages and genotypes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), we measured the lifespans of only <italic>C. elegans</italic> individuals that had successfully mated by identifying and isolating hermaphrodites that have fluorescent male sperm (represented by the red tilde in the scheme) from those that are unmated and lack fluorescent male sperm using either hand picking or a large particle COPAS large particle biosorter. The presence of fluorescent male sperm is indicative of fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>), though this was not specifically measured for the lifespan assays. Hermaphrodites that received male sperm following two hours with males were compared to hermaphrodites that never interacted with males but that were hand-picked or run through the COPAS large particle biosorter. (<bold>F-G</bold>) Using a different method of isolating mated hermaphrodites, we also found that young hermaphrodites (F) were resistant to mating-induced demise if they received male sperm and seminal fluid during a brief, 2 hr interaction with males (n.s. vs. no males) but that older hermaphrodites (G) were sensitive and lived shorter following a brief, 2 hr interaction with males (p&lt;0.0001 vs. no males).

To disentangle age and reproductive status, we compared the lifespan of young hermaphrodites to that of young ‘feminized’ individuals (which have oocytes, but no self-sperm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellis and Schedl, 2007</xref>) after a brief encounter with males. Surprisingly, young feminized individuals (<italic>fem-1[hc17]</italic> or <italic>fog-2[q71]</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doniach and Hodgkin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schedl and Kimble, 1988</xref>) were sensitive to mating-induced death and exhibited premature death and deterioration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Although mating efficiency can vary between <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants and individuals of different ages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leighton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>), we specifically measured the lifespan of only the hermaphrodites that mated (i.e. received male sperm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, mating efficiency differences are unlikely to contribute to the sensitivity of feminized individuals to males. Consistent with the observation that the presence of self-sperm is necessary to live a normal lifespan even after a brief encounter with males, young individuals that lack self-sperm and oocytes (<italic>glp-1[e2144]</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Priess et al., 1987</xref>) also lived shorter after a brief encounter with males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), even though <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants are normally long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antebi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arantes-Oliveira et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keith and Ghazi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).

This may be particularly important to allow hermaphrodites to maximize their reproductive success by fertilizing their eggs through self-fertilization and mating with another male later in life. As male sperm out-compete hermaphroditic self-sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LaMunyon and Samuel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ward and Carrel, 1979</xref>), such a strategy would also allow for the hermaphroditic self-sperm to be used. Because the sperm-sensing pathway is conserved in species with true females and is sufficient to protect feminized individuals, this pathway could be leveraged to protect the soma in a conserved manner, even in other species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we show that a sensing mechanism between the germline and the soma mediates protection against the negative impact of sexual interactions. While previous work revealed the phenomenon of male-induced demise and identified specific mutations that could protect individuals from male-induced demise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gems and Riddle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), it was unknown whether natural defenses exist to protect from the detrimental effects of males and what their mechanism of action could be. The previous studies investigated the effects of prolonged interactions between the sexes. While there is evidence of occasional ‘bursts’ of high rates of males in wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrière and Félix, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frézal and Félix, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sivasundar and Hey, 2005</xref>), males in the wild are thought to be rare. Thus, sexual interactions in nature are likely to be quite brief. Here, we have used very brief interactions between the sexes to uncover phenomena that better reflect the natural situation. We show for the first time that innate mechanisms that involve self-sperm can protect against the deleterious effects of mating with males.</p><p>The presence of self-sperm in hermaphrodites is also known to decrease attraction of and mating with males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leighton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), and we did account for this in our study by selecting only mated individuals. Hence, self-sperm may be evolutionary important to ensure, in several different ways, that hermaphrodites produce as many of their own self-progeny as possible before succumbing to mating-induced death. Whether the ability of males to shorten the lifespan of older hermaphrodites that lack self-sperm is advantageous in nature remains unknown. The number of animals that reach middle or older-age in the wild is probably low. However, the protective effect of self-sperm on the soma appears to have evolved independently in two distantly-related species, suggesting that it is important for nematode hermaphrodites. The role of self-sperm as a signal to regulate the response to the opposite sex may also have evolved in other animals, including self-fertilizing hermaphroditic species (<italic>e.g.</italic> snails, slugs, and the vertebrate mangrove killifish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarne and Auld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mackiewicz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The ancestor of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and related nematodes did not have self-sperm-mediated protection from mating-induced death and our data indicate that self-sperm mediated protection was an evolutionary innovation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> lineages. Whether the evolution of resistance to mating-induced death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> occurred as the result of linking ancestral protection mechanisms to self-sperm, or whether novel mechanisms evolved in these hermaphroditic lineages, is unknown. However, given that self-sperm mediated mating-induced death protection evolved more than once in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, the most parsimonious model is that the hermaphroditic lineages linked ancestral protection mechanisms with self-sperm. Indeed, the signaling pathways that are engaged by self-sperm (an Ephrin receptor and homeodomain transcription factor) are conserved in nematodes, suggesting that these ancestral pathways were harnessed in unique ways in the hermaphroditic lineages to evolve self-sperm mediated resistance to mating-induced death. This raises the intriguing possibility that such protective mechanisms could also be ‘tuned up’ in female species by mimicking activation of the signaling pathways that are triggered by self-sperm. Interestingly, the Ephrin receptor that detects the presence of sperm is conserved in mammals, it is expressed in the somatic gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), and is linked with mammalian fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barban et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buensuceso et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, some of the mechanisms that signal between germline and soma could be used more generally to protect against the negative impact of sexual interactions in other species.</p><p>Fertilization has a rejuvenating effect in the germline and resets the aging clock in each generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rando and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Unal et al., 2011</xref>).

In mammals, triggering rejuvenating factors in somatic cells, in a manner that is uncoupled from de-differentiation, has been recently suggested to be a potential rejuvenation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>). However, the potential role of sperm in protection, and possible rejuvenation, of the soma is not known. Given the effect of sperm and fertilization on resetting the aging clock in the germline, as well as the conservation of key elements of the sensing pathway, it is possible that the protective properties of self-sperm, or even sperm itself, are conserved in other species, including mammals. These findings could open new strategies for harnessing the potential of gametes and their sensing pathways to ‘reset’ some hallmarks of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and maintenance</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae, C. remanei,</italic> and <italic>C. brenneri</italic> WT and mutant strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Hermaphrodites or females for these assays were age-synchronized with a short (3–4 hr) egg-lay using young (day 3–5 of life), well-fed adult parents. For the female species (<italic>C. brenneri</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic>), age-synchronized, virgin females were identified and isolated from males by placing them on fresh plates at the L4 stage. All worms were grown on NGM plates with streptomycin (50 μg/mL) and seeded with OP50-1 bacteria unless RNAi knock-down was performed. In the case of RNAi knock-down, worms were cultured on NGM containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL, Sigma) and IPTG (0.4 mM, Invitrogen). During development, worms were fed HT115 bacteria (grown to stationary phase, RNAi expression induced for 2–4 hr with 0.4 mM IPTG, and the bacteria concentrated to 20x) carrying empty vector (EV). Upon adulthood (day 3 of life), HT115 bacteria (grown to stationary phase, RNAi expression induced for 2–4 hr with 0.4 mM IPTG, and the bacteria concentrated to 20x) carrying the appropriate RNAi clone from the Ahringer RNAi library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>) (a gift from A. Fire) or RNAi clones created in this study (see ‘<italic>C. briggsae</italic> RNAi knock-down’). The inserts of the plasmids encoding the RNAi clones used in this study were sequenced to verify their identity.</p><p>For each assay, worms were scored as dead or alive and transferred to new plates daily during the reproductive period and then every other day. Worms were scored as dead if they did not respond to gentle, repeated prodding with a wire pick (90% Pt, 10% Ir) along different points of their body. Worms were scored as censored if they crawled off the media or died due to bagging (internal hatching) or vulval rupture. Data from these censored worms were included up until the point of censorship (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for all data).</p><p>For conditions in which the effect of sexual interactions was assessed, we used one of three methods, as indicated. For the long-term exposure method (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), young males (day 1 to 2 of adulthood) were added to the hermaphrodites at the onset of adulthood. For lifespan experiments in which the hermaphrodites were exposed to males for their entire adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>), males were added in a 1:1 ratio with hermaphrodites and the number of males remained fixed, even as hermaphrodites began to die or censored. Male worms were replaced every other day at the time the hermaphrodites were transferred to new plates. Male stocks were set up every day for the entirety of the lifespan assay. For the lifespan experiments in which hermaphrodites were exposed to males for only one day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>), young males were added in a 2:1 male:hermaphrodite ratio. Following 24 hr of exposure, hermaphrodites were moved to new plates and did not encounter a male again throughout their lifespan. For the newly established, short mating-induced demise lifespan experiments, the males and hermaphrodites were only allowed to interact for 2 hr at the age specified for each assay. Males were twice as abundant as hermaphrodites during the mating period. Following a mating period of two hours, mating was assessed by the presence of fluorescent male sperm (see below). These mated hermaphrodites did not interact with an adult male again and worms on plates in which male progeny reached adulthood and could have mated with the hermaphrodites were censored.</p><p>Synchronized individuals (hermaphrodites, feminized individuals etc.) were randomly assigned to the ‘no males’ or ‘+males’ conditions by picking them onto fresh plates in an alternating manner to avoid selection bias. Similarly, the males used for mating with individuals of different genotypes or ages were from the same sets of males and were allocated randomly in an alternating manner. For each single biological replicate, approximately 35 individuals were placed on each of 2–4 plates (each plate represents a technical replicate). The number of individuals per plate and number of technical replicates were chosen based on field standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lucanic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For feminized and sterile mutants, slight modifications were made to the methods. The sterile <italic>glp-1(e2144)</italic> mutant, fertilization defective <italic>spe-9(hc88)</italic> mutant, masculinized <italic>fem-3(q20)</italic> mutant, and WT control parents were used for an egg lay at the permissive temperature (15°C) and following the egg lay, the individuals used for the assay were kept at 25°C for the remainder of the assay. The feminized <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> mutants and the WT control parents were kept at 15°C for the egg lay and these eggs developed until day 3 of life (adulthood) at 25°C (the restrictive temperature). Then, both the <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> feminized worms and the WT worms were moved to 20°C for the remainder of the assay. The lower temperature did not impact the feminized phenotype. For the auxin-inducible degradation of the transcription factor SPE-44, the worms were grown on NGM with 1 mM auxin (3-indoleacetic acid, Sigma-Aldrich) from egg lay to adult day one and were then cultured on NGM without auxin for the remainder of their lifespan. These individuals were fully self-sterile as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasimatis et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, the <italic>C. elegans fog-2(q71)</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae she-1(v35)</italic> feminized mutants were kept at 20°C for the entire assay. For these assays, virgin feminized individuals were isolated from males at the L4 stage and were either kept away from males for the entire lifespan or only interacted with males for 2 hr as described.</p><p>Lifespan data were plotted as Kaplan-Meier survival curves in Prism 7 and statistical analyses performed using the logrank (Mantel-Cox) test.

The day before the mating assay, adult day one males (for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, either <italic>him-5[e1467]</italic> or <italic>nIs128[Ppkd-2::GFP]; him-8[e1469]</italic>, for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>Cbr-him-8[v186]</italic>, and WT for <italic>C. brenneri</italic> and <italic>C. remanei)</italic> were fluorescently labeled by culturing them overnight on NGM plates seeded with 100 μL stationary phase OP50-1 and 5 ng/μL MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher cat# M7512, resuspended in DMSO [Fisher] at 100x and kept at −20°C in aliquots) at a density of approximately 100 males per 6 cm plate. On the day of the mating assay, 40 fluorescently-labeled males and 20 unlabeled hermaphrodites were placed on 6 cm NGM plates seeded with OP50-1 bacteria. Animals were allowed to interact with each other and mate for 2 hr at their normal culturing conditions. Following this period, hermaphrodites that received male sperm as a result of mating were identified based on the presence of fluorescence (male sperm) in their uterus and/or spermatheca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) using a fluorescent dissecting microscope or the COPAS large particle biosorter as indicated. In a small number of cases, a hermaphrodite consumed some of the MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled bacteria resulting in red fluorescence in the gut or throughout the body. When this occurred, the individual was censored from the experiment because of the difficulty in determining if they received male sperm or not.</p><p>For mating efficiency assays, 5–7 mating plates (n) were typically used per experimental condition and one to two independent, biological replicates (N) were performed. The number of mated hermaphrodites was compared to the total number of hermaphrodites per plate (mating efficiency = # hermaphrodites with male sperm/total # hermaphrodites).</p><p>To better understand the dynamics of mating during a two-hour period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we performed a separate assay using a slightly modified version of the mating efficiency method such that two male genotypes were used. Specifically, on each plate 20 young, unlabeled hermaphrodites or feminized individuals interacted with 20 unlabeled <italic>nIs128(Ppkd-2::GFP); him-8(e1469)</italic> males and 20 MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled <italic>him-5(e1467)</italic> males for two hours. Following this 2 hr interaction, hermaphrodites that received male sperm from the fluorescently labeled <italic>him-5(e1467)</italic> males were isolated and placed individually on 3 cm NGM plates to lay eggs. To determine if any of these <italic>him-5(e1467)</italic> mated individuals also mated with a <italic>nIs128(Ppkd-2::GFP); him-8(e1469)</italic> male, we looked for male progeny that carried <italic>nIs128[Ppkd-2::GFP]</italic> transgene. These individuals were thus mated at least twice and received male sperm from at least two males.</p><p>For lifespan assays, approximately eight mating plates were set up per condition. Hermaphrodites or females that received male sperm were moved to fresh plates without males at a density of approximately 35 individuals per plate and tracked for the remainder of their lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>To better understand the resistance of young hermaphrodites to mating-induced demise, we characterized the transcriptomes of the young, WT hermaphrodites that have a normal lifespan after a brief interaction with males to those that have a shortened lifespan after a brief interaction with males (the self-sperm depleted <italic>fem-1[hc17]</italic> feminized individuals and the middle-aged, WT hermaphrodites).</p><p>WT and <italic>fem-1</italic>(<italic>hc17</italic>) mutant individuals were age-synchronized using a brief, 3–4 hr egg lay (see ‘Lifespan Assays’ above) on NGM plates seeded with OP50-1 bacteria and grown at 25°C during development and the young adult stage. On day 3 of life (egg lay is day 0), the worms were all moved to 20°C for the remainder of their lifespan. This set up resulted in fully penetrant feminized germline phenotypes for the <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> mutants and delayed the age-associated appearance of red autofluorescence in the gut that would have made accurate detection of MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled male sperm in the uterus and spermatheca difficult. For each of the four biological replicates, egg lays were performed on two separate days such that there was a cohort of age-synchronized young (day 3 of life) and middle-aged (day 7 of life) hermaphrodites of both genotypes on the day of mating. Following the Materials and methods section ‘Fluorescent Sperm Tracking to Identify Mated Hermaphrodites for Mating Efficiency Assays and for Lifespan Assays’, we identified and isolated young and middle-aged WT and <italic>fem-1(hc17)</italic> individuals that received male sperm from fluorescently labeled <italic>him-5(e1467)</italic> males and transferred them to fresh plates. At the same time, unmated hermaphrodites that never encountered a male were also moved to fresh plates at the same density (approximately 30 worms per plate). After approximately 24 hr, 40 worms from each condition (individuals of each age and genotype that either received male sperm or never interacted with males) were picked onto an unseeded NGM plate. These worms were immediately washed twice with ice cold M9 buffer (22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 42 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 86 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and the worm pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Remaining DNA was degraded with DNaseI (Promega) and the RNA cleaned with a sodium acetate and ethanol precipitation. RNA quality was measured using Nanodrop spectrophotometry and the Agilent BioAnalyzer Total RNA Nano chip and kit. mRNA enriched cDNA was prepared using 10 ng of total RNA (quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometry) and the Takara SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit, with 8 rounds of amplification. Paired-end libraries were made using the Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina) with 1 ng of cDNA (quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity reagents, Invitrogen) and barcoded using the Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina).

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Self-sperm induce resistance to the detrimental effects of sexual encounters with males in hermaphroditic nematodes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Matt Kaeberlein as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal their identity: George Sutphin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers are in agreement that the work described here is of general interest and generally high quality. A few relatively minor concerns were raised that the authors are encouraged to address in a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the reviewers felt that the data were quite interesting, there were some concerns as to whether the interpretation was sufficiently developed in the context of natural environments and evolutionary conservation. The authors are encouraged to develop this in the Discussion.</p><p>One reviewer commented: &quot;In the Introduction, the authors state that mating in mammals can have negative impacts on health. What would such negative impacts be and could the protective mechanisms for male-induced demise by self-sperm be also conserved in mammals? This is especially important to address since the authors make strong claims that their results could provide &quot;new insights into the role of gametes in 'resetting' the aging clock in all species.&quot; Really, this statement is overstated and is reiterated three times, i.e., in Introduction, Results and Discussion, but should be a discussion point only without any direct data as support. To this end, the authors may want to consider modulation of the sperm-sensing pathway in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Moreover, would overexpression of components of the sperm-sensing pathway including in older animals be beneficial?&quot;</p><p>Another reviewer commented: &quot;The authors of both manuscripts make several assumptions and statements about how and why these mechanisms evolved, but it seems to me that a careful consideration of what these animals experience in the wild may be lacking. Is it ever the case that wild, reproductively mature nematodes are likely to experience a high enough density of males for some of these mechanisms to be engaged? Are long and frequent sexual encounters with males something that ever happens or is this an unnatural state that can only be induced in a laboratory? While it is plausible that the protection conferred in young hermaphrodites from brief sexual encounters might be important in wild populations, it seems unlikely (to me at least) that sperm-depleted adult hermaphrodites will be exposed to a high density of males for a long enough time that the lifespan shortening effects would be relevant. In fact, is relatively modest lifespan shortening under laboratory conditions even something that would ever matter in the real world? Is laboratory adult lifespan something that matters at all in natural populations? I realize this is largely speculation since we don't know much about aging of natural populations of nematodes, but as far as I know, there's no evidence for very old worms in nature.</p><p>While I don't think this reduces the interest and importance of this work, I do think it's important to consider the natural environment when trying to understand how and why these biological interactions came about. Is a slight shortening of adult lifespan really detrimental? One could argue that this isn't clear, since most worms in nature aren't (probably) going to live long enough to experience this effect. Some consideration and discussion of the likely relevance of these mechanisms on fitness in the real world would be valuable.&quot;</p><p>2) There were shared concerns that some experiments were not sufficiently replicated, or if triplicate replication was performed it was not apparent in some cases. In particular, the authors should assure that they have three biological repeats for their RNAi experiments. It also appears as if the COPAS experiment was only done once.</p><p>3) The RNASeq is not well integrated in the overall study. The authors could at least discuss a possible connection between their identified transcription factor and the target genes in their RNASeq. As it is, this part really 'dead ends' in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46418.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the reviewers felt that the data were quite interesting, there were some concerns as to whether the interpretation was sufficiently developed in the context of natural environments and evolutionary conservation.

We have now included two examples of the effect of sexual interactions on mammalian health in the Introduction. Whether the mechanisms of male-induced demise or the downstream pathways engaged by self-sperm to protect against the deleterious effects of mating are conserved outside of nematodes is unknown. To better reflect this state of knowledge and as suggested by this reviewer, we have removed the statements regarding the possible roles of gametes in aging from the Results and Introduction sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for their interesting suggestion to manipulate the sperm-sensing pathway in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> to test if this is beneficial, notably in older animals. We have now included new experiments to test the role of the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> sperm-sensing pathway orthologs in the protection from mating-induced demise. We find that feeding <italic>Cbr-ceh-18</italic> and <italic>Cbr-vab-1</italic> RNAi bacteria to feminized, transgenic <italic>C. briggsae</italic> that are competent for RNAi by feeding (Nuez and Felix, 2012) resulted in protection of middle-aged hermaphrodites following mating with a male (new Figure 5E, F). We also verified that <italic>Cbr-ceh-18</italic> and <italic>Cbr-vab-1</italic> RNAi were effective as they lead to increased number of unfertilized oocytes in the uterus and a reduction in the compaction of the oocytes in the gonads (new Figure 5—figure supplement 3), similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Miller et al., 2003). Thus, the role of the sperm sensing pathway appears to be conserved in <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and has evolved to mediate resistance to mating-induced demise at least twice in hermaphroditic nematodes. These experiments are described in the third paragraph of the subsection “The ability of self-sperm to promote resistance to mating with males evolved independently twice in nematodes” and have been included as new Figure 5E, F, Figure 5—figure supplement 3. All three replicates of the lifespan assays are in new Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer commented: &quot;The authors of both manuscripts make several assumptions and statements about how and why these mechanisms evolved, but it seems to me that a careful consideration of what these animals experience in the wild may be lacking.

As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included a discussion of the relevance of this phenomenon in the wild. We now discuss studies of wild populations of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that indicate that males and hermaphrodites interact in the wild, though these interactions are rare. We agree with the reviewer that long interactions with males are unlikely to be frequent in the wild and that a brief interaction, as we have more closely modeled here, is more plausibly relevant to the natural state. We now also include a discussion of whether lifespan shortening in the wild would be (dis)advantageous to males and hermaphrodites. These revisions can be found in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were shared concerns that some experiments were not sufficiently replicated, or if triplicate replication was performed it was not apparent in some cases.

It also appears as if the COPAS experiment was only done once.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is very important. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have included additional replicates for both the COPAS large particle biosorter experiment and the sperm-sensing RNAi experiments. Some of these additional replicates were performed by an independent investigator (Cindy Tantilert), who is included as an author of the revised manuscript. These replicates have been included in Supplementary file 2 and the replicates that were performed by an independent investigator are indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The RNASeq is not well integrated in the overall study.

As it is, this part really 'dead ends' in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point, and during the revision we have further analyzed our RNA-seq data to test the relationship between the target genes and the identified transcription factor CEH-18. Specifically:</p><p>- We have now performed a network analysis of CEH-18 by using the GeneMANIA web browser. We found a significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (young hermaphrodites versus young feminized individuals) in this CEH-18 network. These results are presented in new Figure 4F and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B.</p><p>- We performed CEH-18 motif and ChIP-seq binding analysis using publicly available data (Kudron et al., 2018; Narasimhan et al., 2015). A subset of genes differentially expressed between young hermaphrodites and feminized individuals had CEH-18 binding sites in their regulatory regions, although there was no significant enrichment (perhaps because heterogenous cell populations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mask the tissue-type specific binding or gene expression (Cao et al., 2017; Narasimhan et al., 2015). We have added these results in main text, new Figure 4—source data 1, and Materials and methods (subsections “Self-sperm protect hermaphrodites by triggering a sperm-sensing pathway that normally affects the germline to protect the soma”, second paragraph and “CEH-18 DNA binding motif and ChIP-seq peak analysis”).</p><p>- We have performed GO enrichment analysis on the subset of genes regulated by the presence of self-sperm that contain CEH-18 binding sites. We find that these genes are enriched for several GO-terms involved in the regulation of lifespan, and could mediate the protective effects of self-sperm. We have included these results in new Figure 4G, new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, and new Figure 4—source data 2.</p><p>Together, these analyses suggest that changes in CEH-18 activity may contribute to the gene expression differences that underlie sensitivity and resistance to mating-induced death.</p></body></sub-article></article>
