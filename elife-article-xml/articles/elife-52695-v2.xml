It is commonly accepted that once fully differentiated the cells enter a stable cellular phenotype, but relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that reinforce and maintain this differentiated state. Maintenance of the differentiated state is, however, essential for tissue function and identifying the molecular pathways involved in these processes may be of great importance for understanding tissue homeostasis and pathology.</p><p>Tendons are connective tissues that transmit forces from muscle to bone to generate movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kannus, 2000</xref>). Despite their importance to overall musculoskeletal function and their slow and limited healing capabilities, relatively little is known about tendon development, the tendon cell fate, maturation and pathology. Elucidating the key molecular regulators of these processes is thus essential for improvements in the management of tendon healing, the treatment of tendinopathy and for bioengineering efforts for this tissue.</p><p>A limited number of transcription factors were so far identified as key regulators of the tendon cell fate including most notably, Scleraxis (<italic>Scx</italic>), a bHLH transcription factor expressed in tendon cells from progenitor stages and through development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schweitzer et al., 2001</xref>) and Mohawk (Mkx), an atypical homeobox protein with essential roles in the development of the collagen matrix in tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2010</xref>). Prototypic markers for the tendon cell fate also include the transmembrane protein tenomodulin (Tnmd) and collagen type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kannus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), the major building blocks of the tendon fibrillar extracellular matrix that mediates the transmission of force by tendons.</p><p>Previous studies have also established a central role for the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling pathway in early events of tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Havis et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, TGFβ is a potent inducer of <italic>Scx</italic> both in vivo and in cultured cells and disruption of TGFβ signaling in mouse limb bud mesenchyme resulted in complete failure of tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). This phenotype manifested at the onset of embryonic tendon development but robust expression of TGFβ ligands and associated molecules in later stages of tendon development suggested possible additional roles for TGFβ signaling in tendon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, subcutaneous application of growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), members of the TGFβ superfamily, can induce ectopic neo-tendon formation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolfman et al., 1997</xref>). The goal of this study was therefore to ask if TGFβ signaling plays essential roles at later stages of tendon development.</p><p>The TGFβ superfamily comprises secreted polypeptides that regulate diverse developmental processes ranging from cellular growth, differentiation and migration to tissue patterning and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santibañez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakaki-Yumoto et al., 2013</xref>). These ligands act by binding to transmembrane type II receptors, which in turn recruit and activate a type I receptor. The activated receptor complex subsequently phosphorylates and activates receptor-regulated transcription factors called Smads (Smad2/3 for TGFβ signaling) that then complex with the common-mediator Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus where they promote or repress responsive target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vander Ark et al., 2018</xref>). The TGFβ proper ligands (TGFβ1–3) all bind to a single type II receptor. Consequently, disrupting this one receptor is sufficient to abrogate all TGFβ signaling. To test for additional roles of TGFβ signaling in tendon development and biology, we wanted to bypass the early essential function in tendon formation, and decided to target TGFβ type II receptor (<italic>Tgfbr2</italic>) directly in tendon cells. We therefore targeted the receptor using <italic>ScxCre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>), a tendon-specific Cre driver, so that TGFβ signaling will be disrupted specifically in tendon cells and only after the initial events of tendon formation.</p><p>We find that tendon differentiation function and growth during embryonic development was not disrupted following targeted deletion of TGFβ signaling in tenocytes, but shortly after birth the cells lost tendon cell differentiation markers and reverted to a more progenitor-like state. Moreover, viral reintroduction of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> to mutant cells was sufficient to prevent dedifferentiation and even to rescue the tendon cell fate in a cell autonomous manner, highlighting a continuous and essential role of TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the tendon cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting TGFβ type II receptor in Scx<italic>-</italic>expressing cells resulted in tendon disruption and limb abduction</title><p>Our previous studies showed that disruption of TGFβ signaling in mouse limb mesenchyme resulted in the complete failure of tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>).

Examination of forelimb tendons of P7 mutant pups using the tendon reporter <italic>ScxGFP</italic> revealed severe tendon disruptions. A few lateral limb tendons, for example the extensor carpi radialis longus tendon underwent fragmentation and disintegrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, yellow arrowhead and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), whereas the majority of other tendons, notably the extensor digitorium communis tendons, retained structural integrity with a substantial loss of <italic>ScxGFP</italic> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, white arrowhead).

All mutant tendon cells lost <italic>ScxGFP</italic> at P7. We therefore performed most analyses of the mutant phenotype in this fully-phenotypic stage. The progressive nature of the phenotype also manifested in exacerbated movement limitations as mutant pups became older. This phenotypic progression was observed in most mutant pups but intriguingly, in rare cases (~2%) the mutant pups showed physical abnormalities and severe tendon phenotypes already at birth. Regardless, all mutants died at or before P14 likely due to <italic>ScxCre</italic> activity in developing cardiac valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levay et al., 2008</xref>), leading to enlarged heart as evidenced by gross examination and histological analysis (data not shown).</p><p>A closer examination of the mutant embryos identified the first indication of a tendon phenotype already at E16.5.

Surprisingly, despite the functional defects and loss of <italic>ScxGFP</italic> signal starting around P3, collagen fibers in mutant tendons appeared organized and indistinguishable from those of wild-type (WT) littermates at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Apparent collagen degradation was observed only in older mutant pups (≥P7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>), suggesting the disruption to the matrix of these tendons may be a secondary consequence of the cellular changes in these mutants and/or of their movement difficulties. Furthermore, epitenon, a monolayer of cells that engulf and define the boundary of the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kannus, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, black arrowhead), was gradually disrupted and in some cases was almost undetectable in older mutant pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, white arrowhead), suggesting that loss of the tendon boundary is an additional feature of the phenotype in these mutants.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tendon degeneration observed in <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants only at later postnatal stages.</title><p>TEM images of tendons from forelimbs of mutant and wild-type littermates at P3, P7 and P13.

We next sought to determine if the <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative cells were indeed tendon cells that lost tendon gene expression or if the mutant tendons were simply repopulated by non-tenogenic cells. Using TUNEL assay, we did not detect cell death in mutant tendons and the rate of tenocyte proliferation as examined by EdU assay was also not altered in these tendons during different developmental stages ranging from E14.5 to P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), suggesting the cell population of mutant tendons was not altered. To directly determine if the cells in mutant tendons were tenocytes whose cell fate was altered, we took advantage of the fate mapping feature of the <italic>RosaT</italic> Cre reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). When the reporter is activated by <italic>ScxCre</italic>, expression of the <italic>RosaT</italic> reporter is restricted to the <italic>Scx</italic>-expressing cells and their progeny. We found that all <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative cells within mutant tendons were positive for the <italic>RosaT</italic> Cre reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, white arrowhead). Notably, some non-tendon cells are also positive for the <italic>RosaT</italic> Cre reporter at this stage. However, given that there is no apparent elimination of the existing tenocytes, even if some of these cells were recruited into the mutant tendons that would not explain the absence of the original tenocytes in mutant tendons. This result thus indicates that the <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative cells in the mutant tendons were derived from tenocytes, and highlighted an unexpected reversibility for the tendon cell fate where it was possible for committed and functional tenocytes to lose their differentiation status.</p><p>Next, we wanted to ask if these results reflected that maintenance of the tendon cell fate was dependent on continuous activation of TGFβ signaling. Since the cellular phenotype manifestated mainly in post-natal stage, we targeted <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in all cells using the ubiquitous tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Rosa<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hameyer et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Tgfbr2;Rosa<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> pups were fed with tamoxifen at P1,P2 and P5, P6 (1.25 mg per pup for each time point) and harvested at P7-P14. Efficient recombination of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene was confirmed by immunostaining of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Interestingly, the cell fate of targeted cells was not disrupted in these mutants as evidenced by retention of tendon marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This result suggests that a mere loss of TGFβ signaling is not sufficient to cause tenocyte dedifferentiation, and additional factors associated with the loss of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in the spatial and temporal features determined by <italic>ScxCre</italic> activity may also play a critical role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutant tenocytes acquired stem/progenitor features</title><p>Loss of cell differentiation marker can be the outcome of a few cellular processes, including most notably cell death, change of cell fate (transdifferentiation) or reversion to a less differentiated state (dedifferentiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tata et al., 2013</xref>). As aforementioned, we found no apparent cell death in mutant tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using histological staining for the prototypic markers of osteocytes, adipocytes and chondrocytes, we found that loss of tendon gene expression in the cells of mutant tendons was also not due to transdifferentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that the changes in mutant tendons may reflect a process of cellular dedifferentiation.</p><p>One hallmark of cellular dedifferentiation is the loss of differentiation markers, which is what we observed in mutant tendon cells. When cells dedifferentiate they also assume stemness features for example colony-forming potential, and in most cases these cells also acquire expression of stem/progenitor cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nusse et al., 2018</xref>).

The only defined feature of these cells is the expression of the Scx tendon progenitor marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schweitzer et al., 2001</xref>), which was evidently lost in the mutant tendon cells. We therefore next directed our attention to similarities with stem/progenitor cells isolated from tendons (tendon-derived stem/progenitor cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murchison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mienaltowski et al., 2013</xref>) and with stem/progenitor cell markers reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyment et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Runesson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To test the colony-forming capacity of the mutant tendon cells, P7 mutant tendons were dissociated and FACS-sorted to collect <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative and <italic>RosaT</italic>-positive cells, which were then seeded at one cell per well in 96-well plates.

Since tendon biology is not annotated in most databases, changes in the collagen matrix, the most prominent structural component in tendons is the best indicator for the disruption of the tendon cell fate. Disruption of the collagen matrix in tendons was also detected in older mutant pups by ultrastructural analysis using TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>).</p><p>Using PANTHER, we also investigated which protein classes were significantly altered in P7 mutant cells relative to WT tenocytes. Genes found to be most downregulated in mutant cells encode for receptors, signaling molecules, membrane traffic proteins and ECM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3A</xref>). On the other hand, the upregulated genes in the mutant cells encode most prominently for proteins involved in nucleic acid binding, enzyme modulators, cytoskeletal protein, signaling molecules and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3B</xref>). Notably, expression of the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcriptional complex, associated with numerous cellular processes including cell fate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hess et al., 2004</xref>), was significantly induced in mutant cells.

This result however, reflects the fact that induction of tendon markers by TGFβ signaling is context-dependent and further indicates that the tenocytes in mutant pups have dedifferentiated to a state that retained tenogenic potential and the capacity to respond to TGFβ signaling.</p><p>Taken together these results highlight a surprising cell autonomous role for TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the tendon cell fate. In <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants tenocyte differentiation and function are normal during embryonic development but the tenocytes dedifferentiate in early postnatal stages. Tenocyte dedifferentiation is directly dependent on the loss of TGFβ signaling since retention or reactivation of the TGFβ receptor in isolated cells prevents or reverses the process of dedifferentiation. TGFβ signaling is thus essential for maintenance of the tendon cell fate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we find that the tendon cell fate requires continuous maintenance in vivo and identify an essential role for TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the tendon cell fate.

Mutant embryos appeared normal at birth and showed movement difficulties from early neonatal stages. Tendon formation and maturation was not affected in mutant embryos, but one flexor tendon snapped consistently at E16.5 and a few additional tendons disintegrated in early postnatal stages. Surprisingly, we find that in all other tendons the resident tenocytes lost tendon gene expression and dedifferentiated, assuming behavior and gene expression associated with stem/progenitor cells. While a direct loss of TGFβ signaling in individual tenocytes was not sufficient to cause tenocyte dedifferentiation, we found that tenocyte dedifferentiation could be reversed by reactivation of TGFβ signaling in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results uncover an essential role for molecular pathways that maintain the differentiated cell fate in tenocytes and a key role for TGFβ signaling in these processes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed roles of TGFβ signaling in the maintenance of tendon cell fate.</title><p>Targeted disruption of the TGFβ type II receptor (<italic>Tgfbr2</italic>) by <italic>ScxCre</italic> resulted in tenocyte dedifferentiation in early postnatal stages.

Conversely, a mere loss of the receptor in individual tendon cell was not sufficient to cause tenocyte dedifferentiation, suggesting that external factors may also play a critical role in this process. We therefore propose that maintenance of the tendon cell fate is dependent on a combination of a cell autonomous function of TGFβ signaling and an additional, likely non-cell autonomous factor, for example the microenvironment of the tendon in the <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutant (cell-matrix interaction, mechanical loading, cell-cell contacts etc).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52695-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Dedifferentiation has mostly been studied in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pennock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nordmann et al., 2017</xref>) and there are only a handful of reported cases of dedifferentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). It was therefore important to establish if the tenocytes of <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants indeed dedifferentiated. Cellular dedifferentiation manifests in most cases by loss of features associated with the differentiated state and reversion to an earlier progenitor state within their cell lineage. In tendons of <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants, we indeed found that the tenocytes lost tendon gene expression and showed enhanced clonogenic potential. Moreover, the mutant tenocytes gained expression of the prototypic somatic stem/progenitor markers Sca-1, CD34 and CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes and Stanford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sidney et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, of these stem/progenitor markers only Sca-1 and CD44 are also expressed at high levels in cultured tendon-derived stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mienaltowski et al., 2013</xref>). Neither of these markers has so far been established as markers for tenocytes or for tendon progenitors. However, both expression of the <italic>Cd34</italic> and <italic>Cd44</italic> genes and expression of some additional signature genes identified in the dedifferentiated tenocytes by the scRNASeq analysis was previously shown to be significantly enriched in E14.5 mouse limb tendon cells when compared to cells from E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Havis et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that some aspects of the embryonic tendon development program may be reactivated in dedifferentiated mutant tendon cells. Interestingly, we found that Sca-1, CD34 and CD44 are expressed in the wild-type epitenon/paratenon, thin layers of cells that surround the tendon and has been implicated as a possible source of stem/progenitor cells for tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mienaltowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cadby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey et al., 2019</xref>). We further verified that mutant tendons are not repopulated by epitenon/paratenon cells since there is no evidence of elimination of the resident tenocytes by cell death.</p><p>Most studies of cellular dedifferentiation have focused on the regulation of this process in vitro. There is, however, evidence demonstrating this phenomenon in vivo especially in the context of pathological scenarios, as part of the regeneration process. One of the well-studied examples is limb regeneration in amphibians. Following limb amputation, cells near to the wound dedifferentiate to blastema, proliferate and eventually re-differentiate to replace all the components of the lost limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCusker et al., 2015</xref>). In zebrafish, it has also been reported that following partial heart amputation, sarcomeres in mature cardiomyocytes disassembled, lost their differentiation gene expression profile and switched to embryonic hyperplastic growth to replace the missing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). Cellular dedifferentiation has also been observed in murine mature hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gournay et al., 2002</xref>), pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talchai et al., 2012</xref>) and skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mu et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, Nusse and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nusse et al., 2018</xref>) have shown that disruption of the mouse intestinal barrier, via either parasitic infection or cell death, led to reversion of crypt (epithelial) cells to a fetal-like stem cell state. Interestingly, expression of Sca-1 was highly induced in these cells, and when cultured the Sca-1 positive crypt cells exhibited characteristics of fetal intestinal epithelium including re-expression of fetal signature genes and loss of differentiated markers. The results presented in this study therefore suggest that a similar process may be activated in tenocytes as part of the regenerative process in response to pathology. Taken together, this growing body of evidence suggests that dedifferentiation may be a generalized cellular response to tissue damage that warrants further investigation. Moreover, these observations may also suggest that induction of Sca-1 may serve as a marker for a pathology-related dedifferentiation process. Intriguingly, Sca-1-positive cells were also found in the wound window in rat patellar tendon incisional injury model, but in this case it was not determined if Sca-1 expression was associated with dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). Sca-1 expression has been identified on putative stem/progenitor cell populations in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes and Stanford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hittinger et al., 2013</xref>), but little is known about its biological function. It may therefore be interesting to examine whether Sca-1 functions as a stemness marker in dedifferentiated cells or if it also plays additional roles in cellular responses to pathological conditions.</p><p>Tenocyte dedifferentiation as observed in this study reveals an unexpected flexibility in the tendon cell fate where differentiated tenocytes can revert to a progenitor state under the mutant conditions. Significantly, reintroduction of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> not only prevented tenocyte dedifferentiation when it was performed during embryogenesis but was also able to rescue the cell fate of dedifferentiated tenocytes when the virus was introduced after birth. This result suggests that TGFβ signaling may have a continuous role in protecting the differentiated tenocytes from dedifferentiation, identifying TGFβ signaling as a key regulator of tendon homeostasis. Moreover, these results also highlight the importance of the molecular pathways involved in maintenance of the differentiated cell fate not only for tissue homeostasis and function, but also for processes associated with tissue regeneration or with the onset and unfolding of pathology. Previous studies have implicated TGFβ signaling in cell fate maintenance in various tissues, for example preserving chondrocyte identity in cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baugé et al., 2013</xref>) and suppressing intestinal cell dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cammareri et al., 2017</xref>). While TGFβ signaling has been associated with different aspects of tendon biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Havis et al., 2016</xref>), to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of its role in maintenance of the tendon cell fate.</p><p>The fact that the mutant phenotype was caused by disruption of TGFβ signaling in tenocytes and the rescue of the tendon cell fate by virus mediated reintroduction of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> even to individual mutant cells provides direct evidence for a continuous and cell autonomous role for TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the tendon cell fate. However, targeting of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> using ubiquitous inducible cre drivers did not result in tenocyte dedifferentiation. These observations suggest that tenocyte dedifferentiation in these mutants may not merely be the result of the loss of intrinsic TGFβ signaling in tendon cells, but rather may be caused by an interplay between intrinsic loss of TGFβ signaling and additional external factors associated with the loss of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> with the specific spatial and temporal features of the <italic>ScxCre</italic> driver. These additional factors may involve cell-matrix interactions affected by the microenvironment of the mutant tendons or changes in cell-cell contacts in the mutant environment. The fact that the phenotype manifested in early post-natal stages may also suggest that mechanical loading experienced by the pups after birth may play a role in the initiation of cellular dedifferentiation. The close relationship between tendon function and mechanical stimulus has been underlined in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nabeshima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinemeier and Kjaer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galloway et al., 2013</xref>). Enhanced mechanical loading may compound with altered features in the structure of the mutant tendons to trigger the initiation of the mutant phenotype.</p><p>The tendon phenotype of <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants highlights a likely role for tenocyte dedifferentiation in regenerative processes in tendons and possibly also in the progression of tendon pathology. Uncovering the molecular pathways involved in this process may therefore be important for new strategies for treatments of tendon pathologies. The <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants provide a unique opportunity to analyze these pathways, and the experimental approaches employed in this study may be developed into an experimental paradigm for molecular dissection of this process. Briefly, transcriptional and epigenetic analyses of the mutant tenocytes through the dedifferentiation process can provide a landscape of the molecular changes that initiate and drive the dedifferentiation process. Promising candidates can then be tested using the AAV-mediated cell fate rescue experiments to identify genes or groups of genes that can protect the tenocytes from dedifferentiation to establish the molecular process of cellular dedifferentiation. Of particular interest will be the early molecular changes in the mutant tenocytes that drive and promote the onset and progression of tenocyte dedifferentiation.</p><p>Our findings underscore the fact that the tendon cell fate requires continuous maintenance and that it is not an irreversible state, a long-standing biological dogma that has been challenged by recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ladewig et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that the dramatic cell fate changes in <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutant happens in the context of a genetic modification. The occurrence of such phenomenon in vivo might not be a simple direct outcome of changes to TGFβ signaling. Most importantly, while the initiating events for tenocyte dedifferentiation may vary in different scenarios, it is likely that the molecular events that drive the dedifferentiation process downstream of the initiation event are similar or related. Uncovering these pathways in this experimental system may therefore facilitate the analysis of such processes in various other contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, both forelimbs and hindlimbs were harvested from euthanized mice, skinned and exposed to 0.5% collagenase type I (Gibco, Cat 17100–017) and 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, Cat 27250–018) in PBS for 15 min at 37°C with gentle shaking. The surfaces of tendons were then scraped carefully with a pair of forceps to remove epitenon/paratenon cells. The middle portion of tendons was then harvested, cut into small pieces and tendon cells were released by digestion for 30 min at 37°C with gentle shaking in a solution of 0.3% collagenase type I, 0.8% collagenase type II (Cat 17101–015), 0.5% trypsin and 0.4% dispase II (Cat 17105–041) (all from Gibco). The released cells were strained with a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Cat 352350) and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 g. The cells were then resuspended in PBS with 1% BSA, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to separate the cells for colony-forming assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Colony-forming unit (CFU) assay</title><p>CFU assay was used to examine the self-renewal potential of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2007</xref>). The enzymatically-released WT and heterozygous tenocytes as well as dedifferentiated mutant tendon cells (i.e. <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative and RosaT-positive cells) were sorted by FACS and plated at one cell per well in a 96-well plate using a BD Influx cell sorter (BD Bioscience, USA). About 10–12 days into the culture, the colonies were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min, RT), stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min, and rinsed twice with water. Percentage of colony-forming unit was calculated as: Number of wells with colonies ÷ 96 × 100. Each data point represents the mean of duplicate plates from 3 to 5 separate experiments. Each experiment represents limb tendons collected from 2 to 4 pups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Re-expression of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> in mutant cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector</title><p><italic>FLAG</italic> or <italic>V5</italic> epitope tag sequences were added at the C-terminus of the murine TGFbR2 Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS23601).

Transuterine microinjection of the viral vector into embryos was performed according to a published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, a laparotomy was performed on anesthetized pregnant females to expose the uterus. The left wrist field of the forelimb bud of each embryo was injected with ~2 µl of concentrated viral inoculum (3.8 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/ml) using a borosilicate glass capillary pipette (25–30 µm outer diameter and 20 degree bevel). The abdominal and skin incisions were closed with resorbable sutures.

Briefly, sequencing reads were aligned to the mm10 genome and demultiplexed and filtered using total UMI count per cell to generate the gene barcode matrix. Principle component analysis was performed and the first ten principle components were used for the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensional reduction and clustering analysis. Cells were clustered using K-means clustering. For each cluster, genes with an average UMI count ≥0.5, fold change ≥1.5 and p-value&lt;0.05 were identified as signature genes for each cluster. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (clusterProfiler) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and the PANTHER Classification System (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org/">http://pantherdb.org/</ext-link>) were used to elucidate the biological process and signaling pathway associated with individual gene.

definitely ground-breaking. That this paper convincingly challenged the canonical role of TGFβ in the tendon generated considerable positive discussion during the review of this manuscript. Many researchers in the field believe that TGFβ is critical to tendon growth/maturation via a role in the regulation of collagen synthesis and matrix assembly. This study suggests that TGFβ's role is more so related to the maintenance of tenogenic cell fate. Further, by demonstrating the temporal aspects of the phenotypic changes (i.e., loss of tenogenic cell fate prior to significant matrix changes), this paper shows that dedifferentiation of the tenocyte to a general stem/progenitor state is possible. Collectively this work has high potential to have considerable impact in shaping research in the tendon field for years to come.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TGF-β signaling is critical for maintenance of the tendon cell fate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nathanial Dyment (Reviewer #1); Alayna E Loiselle (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study continues years of work by this lab studying the role TGFβ signaling in tendon differentiation. Previously this group demonstrated that TGFβ is required for tendon specification and formation (Pryce, 2009). In the current study, they used ScxCre mice to target tendon cells after specification and established that TGFβ signaling needs to be maintained by tendon cells to continue their differentiation and preserve a normal ECM. Interestingly, the cell phenotype and ECM does not appear to be abnormal until approximately 7 days after birth. After this stage, the tendons begin to disintegrate and the mutant mice actually die before P14. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq of Tgfbr2-depleted tendons showed that as the cells lose TGFβ, they also lose expression of tendon markers (Scx, Tnmd, etc.), increase their clonal potential, and gain expression of markers that have been reported as stem/progenitor markers (Sca-1, Cd34, and Cd44). However, the authors were unable to demonstrate that these genes were expressed by embryonic tendon progenitors within the tendon fascicle. This work putatively demonstrates the flexibility of tenocyte fate during development and growth, which could have implications for tendon pathology and regeneration. They then went on to rescue the phenotype within individual cells via viral expression of Tgfbr2, which is and interesting and elegant an innovative approach. This study is very thorough with innovative findings that will advance our understanding of tenogenic differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The amount of Tgfbr2 deletion in Scx-CreERt2 and RosaCreERt2 (which results in lack of a mutant phenotype) is critical data to argue the mutant phenotype is based the temporal nature of the Scx-Cre. These results imply that TGFβ signaling should active be in tendon cells during development and postnatal stages. Do we know the endogenous pattern of TGFβ signaling activity in tendons until P15? Is it possible to define if there is a specific stage when the presence of TGFβ signaling is critical to maintain tendon cell fate? This lack of phenotype generated a lot of discussion among the reviewers and it was not mentioned in the Materials and methods section when the tamoxifen injections were conducted, further confusing this issue. It was felt that is might be an interesting finding but that there must be proof showing that this was not a technical issue or a failure of the cre- to function. If a lack a technical issue explaining the lack of phenotype cannot ruled out, these data may need to be removed.</p><p>2) Related to the above issue, how efficient is the knockdown of Tgfbr2 in Scx-Cre? This would be an important comparison to confirm that the mutant phenotype is indeed time and lineage driven. In addition, understanding the degree of TgfBr2 knockdown is important as it is very likely that the specific effects of Tgfb signaling are highly dose dependent, that is, there is clearly a level of Tgfb signaling that is required to maintain tenocyte fate, but Tgfb is also a potent inducer of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis, which complicates the use of the Tgfb as a therapeutic.</p><p>3) The increased clonogenicity helps support the conclusion of dedifferentiation and the genes that are enriched in these cells (Sca-1, Cd34, Cd44, Dpt, Anxa1, CD34, CD44, Mgp and Mfap5) have been reported as general stem/progenitor markers or are expressed during early tendon development. The challenge with this conclusion, which the authors acknowledge, is that our understanding of markers at different stages of the tendon lineage is incomplete, which makes it even more difficult to prove that dedifferentiation occurs. As the authors noted and presented in Figure 6B, several of these genes are elevated in healing as well. The disintegration of the tendon likely elicits a healing response, which would almost certainly alter the cell phenotype. In addition, the phenotype is only seen with the ScxCre and not the CreERT2 models, suggesting that a large proportion of the tendon cell population needs to be modulated to elicit enough alterations in ECM and concurrent cell dedifferentiation. By the time the dedifferentiation occurs the ECM is already severely disrupted. Can the authors please discuss/defend their conclusion that this is dedifferentiation and not a general healing response?</p><p>4) The fact that the phenotype doesn't manifest until postnatal ages suggests that a mechanical loading threshold may exist that tips the scales towards disintegration of the tendon. Discussion of mechanics is warranted and would greatly benefit the manuscript.</p><p>5) Figure 4B- the authors state that the enlarged Scx-GFP cells in the mutant are newly recruited tendon cells- can they clarify what they mean by this? Are these cells from the tendon that actively express Scx-GFP or extrinsic Scx-expressing cells that migrate to the tendon. The reviewers respected that this is the basis for another manuscript but felt that this is very striking finding and an important statement that must be clarified.</p><p>6) Figure 4D- The authors trace with Scx-Cre; RosaAi9 to 'prove' that these green cells are tendon derived. However, there is evidence from the authors and other groups identifying non-tendon targeting with this cre, including muscle connective tissue cells, and bone (Mckenzie et al., 2017). A tendon graft may be the only way to 'prove' these are tendon derived. Given that these experiments are not feasible, the reviewers suggested a slight modification of this text to indicate that these data suggest these are tendon derived cells.</p><p>7) Do the authors know what percent of mutant cells were successfully targeted by the viral infection? That is, have they looked at V5 expression in Scx-Cre; RosaTd+ mutants since they say in subsection “Tenocyte dedifferentiation is dependent on cell autonomous loss of TGFβ signalling” that infected cells will be surrounded by mutant cells.</p><p>8) Is the data presented in Figure 7D from injection with the Cre dependent AAV or the constitutive Tgfbr2 construct? This is unclear from the Results section. If the P1 data are with the constitutive Tgfbr2 construct they should be plotted separately.</p><p>9) The authors performed single-cell RNA-seq and at the end only show differentially expressed genes that could have been obtained with bulk RNA-seq. It was strongly felt by all reviewers that the authors should exploit the scRNAseq data more fully to support their conclusions. Further, it was unanimously felt that the authors should show the clustering of both normal tendons and TGFBRII-depleted tendons. Researchers working in tendon area have been eagerly awaiting scRNAseq data of normal tendon to identify the different cell populations in tendon since tendon fibroblasts are uncharacterized.

Previously this group demonstrated that TGFβ is required for tendon specification and formation (Pryce, 2009). In the current study, they used ScxCre mice to target tendon cells after specification and established that TGFβ signaling needs to be maintained by tendon cells to continue their differentiation and preserve a normal ECM. Interestingly, the cell phenotype and ECM does not appear to be abnormal until approximately 7 days after birth. After this stage, the tendons begin to disintegrate and the mutant mice actually die before P14. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq of Tgfbr2-depleted tendons showed that as the cells lose TGFβ, they also lose expression of tendon markers (Scx, Tnmd, etc.), increase their clonal potential, and gain expression of markers that have been reported as stem/progenitor markers (Sca-1, Cd34, and Cd44). However, the authors were unable to demonstrate that these genes were expressed by embryonic tendon progenitors within the tendon fascicle. This work putatively demonstrates the flexibility of tenocyte fate during development and growth, which could have implications for tendon pathology and regeneration. They then went on to rescue the phenotype within individual cells via viral expression of Tgfbr2, which is and interesting and elegant an innovative approach. This study is very thorough with innovative findings that will advance our understanding of tenogenic differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The amount of Tgfbr2 deletion in Scx-CreERt2 and RosaCreERt2 (which results in lack of a mutant phenotype) is critical data to argue the mutant phenotype is based the temporal nature of the Scx-Cre. These results imply that TGFβ signaling should active be in tendon cells during development and postnatal stages. Do we know the endogenous pattern of TGFβ signaling activity in tendons until P15? Is it possible to define if there is a specific stage when the presence of TGFβ signaling is critical to maintain tendon cell fate? This lack of phenotype generated a lot of discussion among the reviewers and it was not mentioned in the Materials and methods section when the tamoxifen injections were conducted, further confusing this issue. It was felt that is might be an interesting finding but that there must be proof showing that this was not a technical issue or a failure of the cre- to function. If a lack a technical issue explaining the lack of phenotype cannot ruled out, these data may need to be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that pattern of TGFβ signaling activity and the efficiency of Cre activity in the inducible experiments are critical for a complete analysis of the phenotype.</p><p>The pattern of TGFβ signaling is usually detected by following the phosphorylation of Smad2 and has been of great importance both for our previous studies regarding TGFβ signaling and for this project. Unfortunately, despite numerous attempts to perform pSmad2 antibody staining to detect endogenous pattern of TGFβ signaling we could not achieve a reliable staining and therefore, cannot establish the pattern of TGFβ signaling.</p><p>For the inducible Cre studies, the existing <italic>ScxCreERT2</italic> tendon inducible cre is active only in post-natal stages and so far there is no good inducible Cre to target tendons at embryonic stages. A systematic developmental targeting of the TGFβ type II receptor was therefore not feasible, precluding the ability to define if there is a specific stage when the presence of TGFβ signaling is critical to maintain the tendon cell fate.</p><p>Since the cellular phenotype manifested only in early post-natal stages, we performed the post-natal deletion of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> using both <italic>ScxCreCreERT2</italic> and <italic>RosaCreERT2</italic> and detected no loss of tendon markers. As requested, a more detailed description of the experiment and the specific timing and dose of tamoxifen injections were now added to the text (subsection “Loss of the tendon cell fate in mutant tenocytes”). Loss of the receptor in these experiments was verified using antibody staining for TGFβ type II receptor and the results are shown as a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E).</p><p>While we recognize that these results do not provide an adequate developmental targeting of the receptor we feel that it is of great importance to include them in the text because they demonstrate that simple postnatal loss of TGFβ signaling is not sufficient to induce tenocyte dedifferentiation, suggesting that dedifferentiation involves a more complex process and also indicating to other researchers who may be interested to introduce this effect in their experimental systems that they cannot expect to achieve tenocyte dedifferentiation with a simple targeting of the receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the above issue, how efficient is the knockdown of Tgfbr2 in Scx-Cre? This would be an important comparison to confirm that the mutant phenotype is indeed time and lineage driven. In addition, understanding the degree of TgfBr2 knockdown is important as it is very likely that the specific effects of Tgfb signaling are highly dose dependent, that is, there is clearly a level of Tgfb signaling that is required to maintain tenocyte fate, but Tgfb is also a potent inducer of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis, which complicates the use of the Tgfb as a therapeutic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Our experience using Cre reporters is that <italic>ScxCre</italic> activity within tendons is not uniform during embryogenesis. However, the percentage of targeted tendon cells increases during development and reaches close to 100% [based on <italic>Ai14 Rosa26-tdTomato (RosaT)</italic> Cre reporter expression] at P0.</p><p>To directly determine the efficiency of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> knockdown in <italic>Tgfbr2;ScxCre</italic> mutants we performed immunostaining of TGFβ type II receptor in P0 samples and found complete loss of the receptor in tendons. The images have been added as a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C). The manuscript text has also been revised accordingly (subsection “Targeting TGFβ type II receptor in Scx<italic>-</italic>expressing cells resulted in tendon disruption and limb abduction”).</p><p>For the second comment regarding levels of TGFβ signaling and therapeutic relevance. As noted above we cannot directly determine the changes in the levels of TGFβ signaling we certainly agree that our results should not be interpreted in the context of using TGFβ as a therapeutic agent and have not made any such inferences in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The increased clonogenicity helps support the conclusion of dedifferentiation and the genes that are enriched in these cells (Sca-1, Cd34, Cd44, Dpt, Anxa1, CD34, CD44, Mgp and Mfap5) have been reported as general stem/progenitor markers or are expressed during early tendon development. The challenge with this conclusion, which the authors acknowledge, is that our understanding of markers at different stages of the tendon lineage is incomplete, which makes it even more difficult to prove that dedifferentiation occurs. As the authors noted and presented in Figure 6B, several of these genes are elevated in healing as well. The disintegration of the tendon likely elicits a healing response, which would almost certainly alter the cell phenotype. In addition, the phenotype is only seen with the ScxCre and not the CreERT2 models, suggesting that a large proportion of the tendon cell population needs to be modulated to elicit enough alterations in ECM and concurrent cell dedifferentiation. By the time the dedifferentiation occurs the ECM is already severely disrupted. Can the authors please discuss/defend their conclusion that this is dedifferentiation and not a general healing response?</p></disp-quote><p>The cell fate changes begin at P2 and actually precede the matrix disruption that is not observed before P7 (compare Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3). We agree with the reviewers that this is a critical point for understanding the key drivers of tenocyte dedifferentiation in these mutants and therefore revised text to explicitly highlight this point (subsection “Targeting TGFβ type II receptor in Scx<italic>-</italic>expressing cells resulted in tendon disruption and limb abduction”). In respect to the inducible experiments, as noted above the loss of the receptor is nearly complete in the inducible mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E), so the differences between the models are not due to extent of receptor targeting.</p><p>In regards to the issues of dedifferentiation vs. healing response, we agree and have noted in the text that mutant tenocytes did not turn on embryonic tendon progenitor genes, rather that they express more general progenitor markers. We believe and have now redoubled our efforts to explicitly discuss (subsection “Mutant tenocytes acquired stem/progenitor features”, Discussion section) that this kind of change in cell fate is also compatible with dedifferentiation and should be recognized as such. Moreover, since the identity and expression profile of tendon stem/progenitor cells that contribute to tendon healing has not been established so far it may well be possible that the cells will share more similarities with the dedifferentiated tenocytes in our mutants.</p><p>We further very much agree that the expression profile at P7 possibly represents a healing response. Notably it is usually suggested or implied that the cells with this expression profile are cells that were recruited to an injury site within the healing response. The important and it is the resident novel concept in this mutant analysis is that the resident tenocytes de-differentiate and they are the ones expressing these genes and assuming enhanced clonogenicity. This is also more explicitly stated in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fact that the phenotype doesn't manifest until postnatal ages suggests that a mechanical loading threshold may exist that tips the scales towards disintegration of the tendon. Discussion of mechanics is warranted and would greatly benefit the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. Discussion of mechanics has been added into the revised manuscript (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4B- the authors state that the enlarged Scx-GFP cells in the mutant are newly recruited tendon cells- can they clarify what they mean by this? Are these cells from the tendon that actively express Scx-GFP or extrinsic Scx-expressing cells that migrate to the tendon. The reviewers respected that this is the basis for another manuscript but felt that this is very striking finding and an important statement that must be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The finding of these cells are recruited is based mainly on the fact that some of these <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-positive cells exhibited weak or no expression of the <italic>RosaT</italic> Cre reporter. By P0 the cre reporter is positive in all tendon cells of wild-type tendons. The absence of Cre reporter thus indicates a recent activation of the <italic>Scx</italic> enhancer in these cells. This finding was corroborated with other experiments including the double-fluorescent cre reporter mTmG. Subsection “Loss of the tendon cell fate in mutant tenocytes” has been revised to clarify this part. We agree that this is a very exciting finding; however, it is impossible to include the full description of the finding in this study. The manuscript is currently under preparation and will be submitted for publication soon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4D- The authors trace with Scx-Cre; RosaAi9 to 'prove' that these green cells are tendon derived. However, there is evidence from the authors and other groups identifying non-tendon targeting with this cre, including muscle connective tissue cells, and bone (Mckenzie et al., 2017). A tendon graft may be the only way to 'prove' these are tendon derived. Given that these experiments are not feasible, the reviewers suggested a slight modification of this text to indicate that these data suggest these are tendon derived cells.</p></disp-quote><p>First a clarification, Figure 4D shows that the <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative cells, i.e. NOT green cells (<italic>ScxGFP</italic>-positive), in mutant tendons were tendon-derived based on the <italic>RosaT</italic> Cre reporter.</p><p>We agree that <italic>ScxCre</italic> labels also non-tendon cells and therefore that the mere fact that cells in mutant tendons are reporter-positive is not sufficient to indicate that these are tendon-derived cells. We therefore combined another rationale to address this issue. At P7, 75-80% of cells within all mutant tendons are both <italic>ScxGFP</italic>-negative and <italic>RosaT</italic>-positive (with the remaining are the recruited cells). Given that there is no apparent elimination of the existing tendon cells (i.e. no cell death), repopulation of the tendon by neighboring reporter positive cells would not explain the absence of cells that express tenocyte markers in these tendons. We thus suggest that the only logical explanation to these observations is that the dedifferentiated cells within the mutant tendon are the original tendon cells, i.e. tendon-derived cells (subsection “Loss of the tendon cell fate in mutant tenocytes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do the authors know what percent of mutant cells were successfully targeted by the viral infection? That is, have they looked at V5 expression in Scx-Cre; RosaTd+ mutants since they say in subsection “Tenocyte dedifferentiation is dependent on cell autonomous loss of TGFβ signalling” that infected cells will be surrounded by mutant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The efficiency of virus injections is highly variable in our experiments and quantification of infection efficiency may not be informative. However, our experience with AAV infection is that while muscle infection is robust (e.g. Huang et al., 2013) tenocyte infection is not efficient and therefore always results in sporadic and low infection (&lt;10%). Therefore, we usually observed one or two individual infected cells surrounded by mutant cells, as also shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Is the data presented in Figure 7D from injection with the Cre dependent AAV or the constitutive Tgfbr2 construct? This is unclear from the Results section. If the P1 data are with the constitutive Tgfbr2 construct they should be plotted separately.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in stating that the data from embryonic injections are with a cre dependent virus while for P1 injection was of the constitutive <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> AAV virus. The rationale behind this experimental design was the interest to test the outcome of maintenance of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> expression in isolated tenocytes for embryonic experiments that could use the cre activation scheme and of re-expression of TGFβ type II receptor in dedifferentiated cells that are therefore likely not <italic>ScxCre</italic> positive and therefore we used a ubiquitous expressor (see the Materials and Method section and subsection “Tenocyte dedifferentiation is dependent on cell autonomous loss of TGFβ signaling”). The main purpose of this data (Figure 7D) is to show that re-expression of <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> at the designated stages is sufficient to prevent or rescue the loss of tendon cell fate, irrespective of the stage in which the receptor was reintroduced. By presenting data in one plot, we find it is much easier and more compelling to convey the message that reintroduction of the receptor is sufficient to reactivate the tendon cell fate irrespective of stage. Since only cells within tendons were evaluated for this data the difference in virus construction was not pertinent to the outcome for the cells. For clarity we added however a note of this different virus structure to the Figure 7 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors performed single-cell RNA-seq and at the end only show differentially expressed genes that could have been obtained with bulk RNA-seq. It was strongly felt by all reviewers that the authors should exploit the scRNAseq data more fully to support their conclusions. Further, it was unanimously felt that the authors should show the clustering of both normal tendons and TGFBRII-depleted tendons. Researchers working in tendon area have been eagerly awaiting scRNAseq data of normal tendon to identify the different cell populations in tendon since tendon fibroblasts are uncharacterized. Further, the clustering of TGFBRII-depleted tendons will be very informative to determine which tendon cell types are affected in this mutant condition. An exhaustive analysis was not requested, and it was not felt that this should not take too long to do. Clustering with the Cell Rangers 10X software is immediate. A bioinformatics analysis could place the paper in a very attractive position which would he highly advantageous to the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Our lab is funded to perform a comprehensive scRNASeq analysis of tendons from embryonic stages and up to adult mice. We recognize the urgency for the field to have reliable single cell data and have therefore expedited analysis of one stage that will be ready hopefully within a few months. Through these studies we however learned to appreciate the complexity of these analyses and the fact that clustering is not a simple objective result and it can be different by changing algorithm or parameters and that it is therefore advisable to publish “an atlas” describing the cells in a tissue only after careful examination and validation of the cell types that manifest. In a counterintuitive fashion WT analysis requires more validation and confirmation than that of a mutant analysis since in the mutant it is possible to simply focus on comparing one set of clusters and the focus is on the difference between such clusters irrespective of the definitions and identities of all the other clusters. We agree with the reviewers that this is similar to the results usually associated with bulk analysis which would not have been possible in these mutants due to the cell complexity of dedifferentiated and newly recruited cells. We therefore preferred to avoid a comprehensive discussion of the wild-type data – that may if it is too detailed also detract from the flow of logic in the manuscript.</p><p>However recognizing the need that was reflected in the reviewers’ comments t-SNE plots and a list of top signature genes for the normal and mutant tendons have been added (Figure 6A, Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Please also note that scRNASeq data for both P7 mutant and wild-type pups has been deposited onto GEO repository for open access to readers</p><p>(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139558; token to access the data: elkhqeqmppgpbgl).</p></body></sub-article></article>
