posttranscriptional regulatory processes control their development. To better understand this control, we profiled translational efficiencies and poly(A)-tail lengths throughout Drosophila oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. The correspondence between translational-efficiency changes and tail-length changes indicated that tail-length changes broadly regulate translation until gastrulation, when this coupling disappears. During egg activation, relative changes in poly(A)-tail length, and thus translational efficiency, were largely retained in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which indicated that selective poly(A)-tail shortening primarily specifies these changes. Many translational changes depended on PAN GU and Smaug, and these changes were largely attributable to tail-length changes. Our results also revealed the presence of tail-length–independent mechanisms that maintained translation despite tail-length shortening during oocyte maturation, and prevented essentially all translation of <italic>bicoid</italic> and several other mRNAs before egg activation. In addition to these fundamental insights, our results provide valuable resources for future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16955.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16955.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Drosophila oogenesis</kwd><kwd>Drosophila embryogenesis</kwd><kwd>posttranscriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>ribosome footprint profiling</kwd><kwd>PAL-seq</kwd><kwd>wispy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Scientist Training Program fellowship T32GM007753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subtelny</surname><given-names>Alexander Orest</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Feodor Lynen Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronja</surname><given-names>Iva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM39341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartel</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Profiling of mRNA poly(A)-tail lengths and translational efficiencies provides new insights into posttranscriptional gene regulation in early Drosophila development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The generation of a zygote through fertilization marks the onset of development for the offspring, and requires the proper completion of sperm and oocyte development in the respective parents. Spermatogenesis produces haploid sperm capable of penetrating the oocyte, whereas oogenesis produces differentiated oocytes that are stockpiled with maternal nutrients, proteins, and mRNAs, and have outer layers that protect the embryo and enable fertilization. In most animals the oocyte is arrested in meiosis, and fertilization leads to initiation of mitosis as the oocyte nucleus completes meiosis and fuses with the haploid sperm nucleus. Fertilization also leads to changes in mRNA translation and protein stability, which support a period of development driven off of maternal stockpiles. After this initial stage of maternal control, which lasts for 1–2 mitotic divisions in mammals and 13 mitotic divisions in Drosophila, widespread transcription begins from the zygotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The production of viable offspring requires three key developmental events: oocyte maturation, the oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET), and the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Oocyte maturation involves the release of the primary meiotic arrest at prophase I and progression of the oocyte nucleus into meiotic divisions to produce a mature oocyte (egg) capable of being fertilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>). The mature oocyte is arrested in metaphase II in most vertebrates and metaphase I in insects. The OET requires egg activation, which is coupled to fertilization in most animals. Egg activation releases the secondary meiotic arrest, allowing completion of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horner and Wolfner, 2008</xref>). The MZT marks the transfer of control of development from the mother to the zygote as maternal mRNAs are degraded, transcription from the zygotic genome begins, and embryonic development becomes dependent on zygotic gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). In Xenopus, zebrafish, and Drosophila the major activation of zygotic transcription occurs as the cell cycle lengthens and gastrulation begins, a developmental period referred to as the midblastula transition.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16955.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transient coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency in embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time line of the developmental transitions probed in this study, illustrating the presence of maternal and zygotic mRNAs (pink and purple, respectively).

Indeed, widespread changes in protein levels without corresponding changes in mRNA levels are observed at these developmental transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2014b</xref>). Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during oocyte maturation, the OET, and early embryogenesis faces unique challenges, including stably storing maternal mRNAs through the prolonged periods of oogenesis and maintaining some of these mRNAs in a translationally inactive state (referred to as masking) while selectively translating others at the proper times in development. During mouse oocyte maturation ~1300 mRNAs are translationally upregulated and ~1500 are translationally downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, during Drosophila egg activation ~1000 mRNAs are translationally upregulated, and ~500 are translationally repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>One long-appreciated mechanism of translational regulation during development acts through control of mRNA poly(A)-tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). The observation of short poly(A) tails in oocytes from amphibians and marine invertebrates led to the proposal that short poly(A) tails help mask maternal mRNAs, preventing translation without triggering the destabilization that typically results from deadenylation. Specific mRNAs are then targeted for cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and the lengthened poly(A) tails in turn cause translational upregulation of these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrew et al., 1989</xref>), as demonstrated for the mRNAs for <italic>c</italic>-<italic>mos</italic> and several cyclin genes during oocyte maturation in Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheets et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkoff et al., 1998</xref>). The Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein (CPEB) plays a critical role in controlling translation of maternal mRNAs, both in recruiting Maskin to repress translation and later in promoting polyadenylation by binding cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase together with Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivshina et al., 2014</xref>). In Drosophila, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase encoded by the <italic>wispy</italic> gene promotes poly(A)-tail lengthening during both oocyte maturation and egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>), and increased poly(A)-tail lengths of mRNAs for <italic>cyclin B, cortex, bicoid, torso</italic>, and <italic>Toll</italic> coincide with the translational upregulation of these mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, appending synthetic poly(A) tails of increasing lengths to the <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA promotes the translation of this mRNA, which demonstrates a causal relationship between increased poly(A)-tail length and increased translation in early Drosophila embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Translational repressors, some of which have been identified through genetic analysis of pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo, also act during oogenesis and early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barckmann and Simonelig, 2013</xref>). These repressors can impact either poly(A)-tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Temme et al., 2014</xref>), the translational machinery, or both. Brain Tumor and Pumilio (PUM) bind to target mRNAs and recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which shortens poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Temme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newton et al., 2015</xref>). Bruno binds to target mRNAs during oogenesis and recruits the eIF4E-binding protein Cup, which represses translation by both blocking the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>) and promoting deadenylation while repressing decapping, which traps mRNAs in a translationally repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Igreja and Izaurralde, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the RNA-binding protein Smaug (SMG) is reported to recruit either Cup or the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, with the consequent repression of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semotok et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>smg</italic> mRNA is translationally repressed in the mature oocyte by PUM, and at egg activation this repression is relieved by the PAN GU (PNG) protein kinase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). PNG is also thought to regulate other translational regulators.</p><p>mRNA expression arrays, RNA-seq and ribosome-footprint profiling have enabled global analyses of mRNA levels and relative translational efficiencies (TEs) in Drosophila oocytes and embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>). Measuring poly(A)-tail lengths has been more challenging due to the homopolymeric nature of the tail, and this technical hurdle has restricted studies to measuring tail lengths of a small number of Drosophila mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</xref>) or to estimating relative differences in tail lengths more broadly using hybridization-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). However, methods are now available to measure poly(A)-tails of essentially any length for millions of individual mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). In zebrafish and Xenopus, high-throughput measurements demonstrate that poly(A)-tail length and TE are globally coupled during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), as expected from single-gene studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrew et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheets et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkoff et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, however, this coupling disappears at gastrulation and is not observed in any of the post-embryonic samples examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, soon after a developmental shift in transcriptional control (the MZT), these vertebrate species undergo a developmental shift in translational control, in which TE abruptly changes from being strongly coupled to tail length to being uncoupled.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> affords the opportunity to define changes in poly(A)-tail length and TE during oocyte maturation, the OET, and the MZT, facilitated by the high quality of both the genome assembly and the coding-sequence (CDS) annotations, the wealth of knowledge on regulatory proteins active during early development, the availability of genetic mutants in these known regulatory proteins, and the ability to isolate sufficient quantities of oocytes and embryos at distinct developmental stages for high-throughput sequencing techniques. Here we systematically analyze changes in poly(A)-tail length and TE during oocyte maturation, the OET and the MZT, and delineate the roles of Wispy, PNG, and SMG in regulating translation during these crucial periods. These studies reveal fundamental insights into the regulatory mechanisms and regimes operating during these key developmental transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A conserved switch in the nature of translational control</title><p>We performed poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>) to measure poly(A)-tail lengths globally at eight developmental stages in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, beginning with oocytes at the primary meiotic arrest point and ending with embryos late in gastrulation, at germ-band retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). PAL-seq determines the poly(A)-tail length of millions of mRNA molecules, providing for each molecule both a fluorescent measurement that reports on the poly(A)-tail length and a sequencing read that reports the cleavage and poly(A) site. Because alternative start sites or alternative splicing can generate different transcripts with the same poly(A) site, we considered our results with respect to a curated set of unique gene models. Moreover, because alternative cleavage and polyadenylation can generate different poly(A) sites for mRNAs from the same gene, we used our PAL-seq data to identify for each gene the alternative isoform with the longest 3' UTR and then combined its tail-length measurements with those of any shorter tandem 3'-UTR isoforms. Thus, the 'mRNAs' of our analyses each corresponded to a unique gene model representing a different protein-coding gene and the aggregated tail-length results from many (if not all) of the alternative transcripts from that gene. On the same samples as those analyzed by PAL-seq, we performed ribosome-footprint profiling and RNA-seq to determine TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>), which also report aggregate results for alternative isoforms, allowing comparison of mean poly(A)-tail length and TE for the thousands of mRNAs that passed our quantification cutoffs at each stage.</p><p>In Drosophila, the first 13 division cycles occur in a nuclear syncytium. Cellularization (at 2–3 hr of embryogenesis) marks completion of the MZT and is immediately followed by the morphogenetic movements of gastrulation. Thus, early embryogenesis is controlled by maternal mRNAs, and based on the studies of mRNAs from a few genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lieberfarb et al., 1996</xref>), those with longer poly(A)-tails would be predicted to have higher TEs, as observed in vertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, poly(A)-tail length and TE were correlated in cleavage-stage embryos (0–1 hr embryo), and the slope of this relationship was steep, such that small differences in poly(A)-tail length corresponded to large differences in TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; e.g., the median TE of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 70–80 nt was &gt;5 fold greater than that of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 30–40 nt). Likewise, when progressing through the OET, the changes in TE correlated with the changes in tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, 0–1 hr embryo / Stage 14 oocyte).</p><p>Although a positive correlation between poly(A)-tail length and TE persisted in the 2–3 hr embryos, the slope of this relationship strongly diminished such that the median TE of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 70–80 nt was &lt;2 fold greater than that of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 30–40 nt, as expected if poly(A)-tail length changes were no longer used to influence translation in these cellularized and gastrulating embryos. Indeed, the changes in poly(A)-tail length that occurred between cleavage-stage and cellularized embryos were not positively correlated with the changes in TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, 2–3 hr embryo / 0–1 hr embryo). The positive correlation between poly(A)-tail length and TE disappeared in subsequent stages of gastrulation (3–4 hr embryos and 5–6 hr embryos), and although tail lengths changed between these stages, the TE changes spanned a very narrow range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, 3–4 hr embryo / 2–3 hr embryo and 5–6 hr embryo / 3–4 hr embryo). The tail-length changes observed between these stages presumably resulted from transcription and mRNA decay as well as deadenylation, whereas those in earlier stages resulted primarily from cytoplasmic polyadenylation and deadenylation.</p><p>The narrower range of TE values and TE changes following the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was consistent with a diminished role of translational regulation in specifying protein output after the embryo begins to modulate gene expression by altering mRNA abundance. Most importantly, these results showed that the developmental shift in the nature of translational control observed in vertebrates also occurs in flies; in Drosophila, just as in zebrafish and Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), the coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE observed in the early embryo disappeared around gastrulation.</p><p>An analysis of the temporal patterns of translational regulation occurring from the OET through the onset of gastrulation identified several significantly enriched patterns, although all possible patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the five enriched profiles were those for mRNAs that were translationally upregulated at the OET and then stayed elevated during early embryonic development, those for mRNAs that were upregulated at the OET and then downregulated during early embryonic development, and those for mRNAs that were downregulated before the OET and remained repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because ribosome-profiling data reflect relative rather than absolute levels of translation of an mRNA across developmental stages, these results should be interpreted as reflecting changes in how well an mRNA was translated relative to all other mRNAs in the same stage. Thus, an mRNA translated at the same absolute efficiency in two stages might be perceived as downregulated if translation of many other mRNAs increased. Nonetheless, these dynamic and substantial changes in TE observed during the OET and early embryogenesis revealed a large-scale and rapid change in the translational capacity of mRNAs relative to each other during early development.</p><p>Pairwise comparisons within the mRNA, translation, and tail-length datasets (from RNA-seq, ribosome-footprint profiling, and PAL-seq, respectively) for the different developmental stages further supported these overall conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As expected, mRNA abundances were highly correlated between all stages prior to the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Over these same stages, poly(A)-tail lengths for many different mRNAs shortened or lengthened, but these changes seemed to have minimal impact on mRNA abundance measurements, consistent with stability of shorter-tail mRNAs during this time (and also indicating that the poly(A)-selection that was performed as part of the RNA-seq protocol did not bias our RNA abundance, and thus TE, measurements). In contrast to the highly correlated mRNA abundances, the number of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) differed substantially between stages prior to the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with dynamic and robust translational regulation during this time. Once transcription began, widespread changes in both mRNA levels and RPFs were observed between stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Poly(A)-tail lengths varied both prior to and after the onset of transcription, and generally mirrored the pattern of correlations observed for RPFs up until the MZT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Little to no positive correlation between poly(A)-tail lengths was observed when comparing samples with no active transcription to those after the onset of robust transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), presumably because of the influence of nascent transcripts on mean poly(A)-tail lengths.</p><p>The striking increases in TE observed soon after fertilization presumably generated factors needed for later developmental transitions. For example, the TE of mRNAs for <italic>zelda</italic> and <italic>stat92E</italic>, two transcription factors required for the onset of zygotic transcription at the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>), increased markedly during the OET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as expected if translational activation of these mRNAs produces the proteins necessary to initiate the MZT, and accounting for the previously noted increase in Zelda protein in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison and Eisen, 2015</xref>). Likewise, the TE of <italic>smaug</italic> and <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA increased markedly during the OET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), yielding factors essential for embryonic development and patterning, respectively. Although the TE of <italic>stat92E</italic> and <italic>smaug</italic> began to increase at stage 14, their TEs were still relatively low until after the OET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the roles of their translation products during early embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Translational regulation during oocyte maturation</title><p>Having established that Drosophila embryos resemble those of fish and frog with respect to the coupling between TE and poly(A)-tail length, we sought to extend these findings to oocytes. The ability to isolate individual oocytes at distinct developmental stages in Drosophila enabled us to measure poly(A)-tail lengths and TEs and examine their relationship at key stages of oogenesis. Stage 11 oocytes are arrested in prophase I. Nuclear envelope breakdown, a hallmark of the release of this arrest, occurs between stages 12 and 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Von Stetina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2009</xref>), and the oocytes arrest in metaphase I during stage 14, the final stage of oogenesis. Thus, comparison of oocytes from stages 11 through 14 captures the events of meiotic progression and oocyte differentiation that occur over the course of oocyte maturation.</p><p>Poly(A)-tail lengths and TEs were well correlated at stages 11, 12, and 13 (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> ≥0.51), but poorly correlated at stage 14 (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Our results extended these analyses to an invertebrate and to a global scale, showing that, as for the <italic>c-mos</italic> mRNA and several cyclin mRNAs in the Xenopus oocyte, tail-length increases correspond to translational activation in the maturing Drosophila oocyte. Thus, the global coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE, which had previously been examined only after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>), extends well before fertilization to potentially influence key developmental transitions in the oocyte.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16955.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency in oocytes.</title><p>Relationship between mean poly(A)-tail length and TE in either oocytes at the indicated stage or activated eggs (<italic>top</italic>), and the relationship between tail-length and TE changes observed between adjacent stages (<italic>bottom</italic>).

Between oocyte stages 11 through 14, the TEs of these mRNAs increased 103, 248, and 319 fold (compared to a median TE change of only 1.3 fold), respectively, whereas poly(A)-tail lengths increased 1.6, 2.4, and 2.0 fold (compared to the median of 1.2 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to these examples, mRNAs from 121 other genes were very poorly translated in stage 11 oocytes (TE ≤ 0.1) and became ≥10-fold better translated during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

However, for <italic>cyclin B, cyclin B3</italic> and <italic>fizzy</italic> mRNAs, the distribution of poly(A)-tail lengths remained unimodal as overall lengths increased, which indicated that the focus on the mean tail-length change in our analyses did not miss specific regulation of a subset of mRNAs for a gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Also helpful for considering the effects of increasing tail lengths during oocyte maturation is the steep relationship between poly(A)-tail length and TE during this developmental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The steepness of this relationship in stage 11, 12, and 13 oocytes implied a 6- to 7-fold increase in the median TE for mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 70–80 nt relative to those with a poly(A)-tail length between 30–40 nt. In stage 14 oocytes, the poor correlation between tail length and TE resulted in only a 1.8-fold increase in median TE when comparing mRNAs with such tail lengths. Thus during oocyte maturation, the modest increases observed in mean poly(A)-tail lengths presumably explain part, but not all, of the robust translational activation of <italic>cyclin B, cyclin B3, fizzy</italic>, and mRNAs from many other genes. Moreover, a broad range of TE values was observed for mRNAs with the same mean poly(A)-tail length, presumably as a consequence of additional regulatory processes that are independent of poly(A)-tail length. To the extent that these additional processes act concordantly with tail-length–dependent processes, they would increase the apparent effect of tail lengthening.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Translational regulation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition</title><p>Although egg activation occurs rapidly (within ~20 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horner and Wolfner, 2008</xref>), this developmental transition induced TE changes for mRNAs from many genes, some of which exceeded 30 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>).

Thus during egg activation, changes in poly(A)-tail length can account for a large proportion of the translational changes.</p><p>mRNAs for the embryonic patterning genes <italic>bicoid, torso</italic>, and <italic>Toll</italic> are translationally upregulated during egg activation in a manner reported to depend on changes in poly(A)-tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>). In our analyses, translation of <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA was undetectable or detected with very few reads in oocytes from stages 11 through 14, but it became much more highly translated following egg activation, increasing by 36 fold in the activated egg relative to the stage 14 oocyte (median TE change, 1.2 fold). mRNAs for <italic>torso</italic> and <italic>Toll</italic> were somewhat better translated in stage 14 oocytes, but nonetheless their TEs increased 13 and 46 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). During this time, the <italic>Toll</italic> poly(A)-tail length increased 3.3 fold (median tail length change, 1.1 fold), which corresponded well to the trend observed globally for tail-length and TE changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that its increased tail-length might fully account for its increased TE. However, concordantly acting tail-length–independent processes that increase the apparent effect of tail-length changes might also be influencing <italic>Toll</italic> translation. Indeed, our subsequent experiments with <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant animals showed that in the absence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation, <italic>Toll</italic> underwent substantial translational upregulation during egg activation and remained one of the most efficiently translated mRNAs in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid egg, despite having a mean tail length of only 14 nt. The poly(A)-tail lengths of <italic>bicoid</italic> and <italic>torso</italic> increased by only 1.7 and 1.3 fold, respectively, putting them outside the global trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and the unimodal tail-length distributions showed again that our focus on the mean change did not miss a unique behavior of a subpopulation of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the translational regulation of these mRNAs seems to also involve tail-length–independent mechanisms.</p><p>The strong translational upregulation of <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA, from essentially untranslated in oocytes from stages 11 through 14 to relatively well translated in the activated egg, implied the influence of either a translational repressor acting on <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA in the oocyte that was relieved at egg activation, or a translational activator acting on it during egg activation. Because <italic>bicoid</italic> mRNA had an average tail length of 42 nt in stage 14 oocytes, which was similar to that of many well translated mRNAs at this stage, we conclude that there was likely a translational repressor acting on it in oocytes to prevent its translation prior to egg activation. The same is presumably true for other mRNAs that had little to no detectable translation in oocytes but then became efficiently translated following egg activation. For mRNAs such as <italic>torso</italic>, which had somewhat greater translation in stage 14 oocytes but subsequently experienced a TE increase that was out of proportion to its tail-length increase, either possibility might account for its translational upregulation at egg activation. Likewise, the 15-fold and 4-fold translational activation observed between stage 14 oocytes and 0–1 hr embryos for <italic>zelda</italic> and <italic>stat92E</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), were accompanied by only 1.2-fold changes in poly(A)-tail length for both mRNAs (median TE change, 1.2 fold; median tail length change, 1.1 fold), again implying that a component of their activation may have occurred through a tail-length independent mechanism (note that the poly(A)-tail length of <italic>zelda</italic> was quantified by only 31 and 72 tags in stage 14 oocytes and 0–1 hr embryos, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Widespread impact of cytoplasmic polyadenylation on poly(A)-tail lengths but not TE</title><p>During oocyte maturation and egg activation, changes in poly(A)-tail length occur through the opposing activities of deadenylases and cytoplasmic poly(A)-polymerases, which shorten and lengthen poly(A) tails, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weill et al., 2012</xref>).

Of the mRNAs from 3571 genes measured in stage 13 oocytes, 1801 had tails that were at least 50% shorter in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant oocytes relative to wild-type, and for all but a few mRNAs the poly(A) tail was at least somewhat shorter in the absence of Wispy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid eggs, 1219 of the 1836 measured mRNAs had poly(A) tails at least 50% shorter than those in the analogous wild-type sample (0–1 hr embryos), and again for all but a few mRNAs the poly(A) tail was shorter in the absence of Wispy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant stage 13 oocytes and laid eggs, poly(A)-tail length and TE were correlated to a similar extent as in wild-type oocytes and embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These correlations were observed even though the RNA-seq measurements used to calculate TEs were made using poly(A)-selected RNA, which in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples likely resulted in inflated TE estimates for mRNAs with very short poly(A)-tails, as these would be poorly recovered during the poly(A) selection. Indeed, RNA-seq measurements correlated with poly(A)-tail lengths in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples but not the wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating a poly(A)-selection bias in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant RNA-seq data but not in the wild-type data. Because neither developmental stage being considered had appreciable transcription or RNA degradation, and because of the poly(A)-selection bias in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant RNA-seq data, we reasoned that the RNA-seq measurements from corresponding wild-type samples should more accurately reflect mRNA abundances in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples. Indeed, results obtained from determining TEs for the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples using the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant ribosome profiling and the wild-type RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) were similar to those obtained when only <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant measurements were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), except they had somewhat stronger correlations between poly(A)-tail length and TE, which supported the idea that these modified TEs more accurately reflected the true TEs at these stages.</p><p>Importantly, the strong correlation between changes in poly(A)-tail length and changes in TE that occurred at egg activation in wild-type flies was retained in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>, respectively), indicating that changes in the length of the poly(A) tail—not the act of cytoplasmic polyadenylation per se—is what influences TE. Moreover, the changes in TE that occurred during egg activation in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples strongly correlated with those in the wild-type samples, as did the relative changes in poly(A)-tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, although Wispy lengthens the poly(A)-tails of most mRNAs during egg activation, our results indicated that this lengthening was largely dispensable for reshaping TEs during egg activation, as the rank order of tail-length and TE changes at this time were largely preserved in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples.</p><p>The observation that cytoplasmic polyadenylation was not needed to generate the rank order of tail-length and TE changes for most mRNAs warranted further investigation, particularly when considering both the critical influence of cytoplasmic polyadenylation for generating these differences during vertebrate development and the importance of Wispy for relieving meiotic arrest during the OET. Perhaps some mRNAs most affected by the loss of Wispy dropped out of our tail-length analysis because they had very short poly(A)-tails in the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant and thus were poorly recovered in our PAL-seq libraries. Although the tail lengths of such mRNAs might have been difficult to measure by PAL-seq, the RPF measurements of mRNAs for all genes can be analyzed without consideration of the corresponding tail-length or mRNA abundance measurements, either of which might selectively lose the set of mRNAs most dependent on Wispy for their regulation. The RPFs in wild-type and <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant stage 13 oocytes were well correlated, and the same was true for 0–1 hr wild-type embryos compared with <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid eggs (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.76 for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although globally the RPFs were largely preserved in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples, some mRNAs had many RPFs in the wild-type samples but none in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Included among these was <italic>cortex</italic>, a known target of Wispy, the upregulation of which is essential for the OET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that during egg activation in Drosophila, cytoplasmic polyadenylation extends the tails of nearly all mRNAs but does not play the major role in generating the relative differences in tail lengths and TEs observed between mRNAs, which implies that poly(A)-tail shortening instead plays the major role in generating these differences.

SMG is reported to downregulate translation of its target mRNAs through either direct recruitment of the deadenylation machinery or recruitment of CUP, which directly represses translation initiation and can also promote deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semotok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Igreja and Izaurralde, 2011</xref>). Our results showed that in the absence of SMG, the poly(A)-tail lengths for the set of PNG-dependent downregulated mRNAs were less shortened during egg activation (median tail-length log<sub>2</sub> fold changes of –0.22 and –0.04 for the wild-type and <italic>smg</italic> mutant, respectively, relative to the median of all mRNAs, p&lt;10<sup>–27</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test), and this coincided with their partial translational derepression (median TE log<sub>2</sub> fold change of –2.2 and –1.2, respectively, after median centering, p&lt;10<sup>–32</sup>, one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

At least as early as the primary meiotic arrest point, changes in poly(A)-tail length largely explain changes in TE, and this regulatory strategy continues through early embryonic development. A switch around the onset of gastrulation uncouples poly(A)-tail length and TE in Drosophila, mirroring the developmental timing of the same uncoupling in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos. The uncoupling of TE from poly(A)-tail length is thus a broadly conserved developmental switch in the nature of translational control, occurring around the onset of gastrulation in both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos.</p><p>Changing the length of a poly(A) tail would influence both the number of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) that could bind the tail and the probability that at least one PABP would be bound, with the former being more relevant in conditions of saturating PABP and the later being more relevant in conditions in which tails are competing for PABP. If the number of PABPs that bind the tail were most relevant, then TE changes might have correlated better with absolute tail-length changes than with relative tail-length changes. However, repeating our analyses using absolute tail-length changes rather than tail-length log<sub>2</sub> fold changes yielded the same results for the respective comparisons, with nearly identical <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that PABP is limiting in the developmental stages in which tail length and TE are coupled, such that mRNAs are competing for PABP.</p><p>We presume that the correlation between poly(A)-tail length and TE that we observed in oocytes and pre-gastrulation embryos reflects a causal relationship, i.e., that changes in poly(A)-tail length at least partially cause the corresponding changes in TE. The other possibilities are that changes in TE cause changes in tail length or that these two measurements merely correlate without having a causal relationship. Because previous single-gene studies clearly demonstrate a causal role for cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and poly(A)-tail length itself, in regulating the translation of mRNAs during these developmental times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrew et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salles et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkoff et al., 1998</xref>), we interpret our observation of a global correlation between poly(A)-tail length and TE as reflecting a causal relationship between the two wherein tail-length changes cause TE changes. Given this interpretation, our results indicate that widespread changes in poly(A)-tail length broadly reshape the translational profiles of oocytes and early embryos.</p><p>Despite this strong qualitative conclusion, we cannot provide quantitative estimates of the proportion of each TE change that is attributable to each tail-length change, as additional translational regulatory mechanisms presumably act to reinforce or oppose the effects of tail-length–dependent translational regulation. Indeed, we suspect that tail-length–independent processes often act concordantly with tail-length–dependent processes and thereby amplify the apparent effects of tail-length changes. Such amplification would explain why some mRNAs, including <italic>cyclin B, cyclin B3, fizzy, zelda, stat92E, bicoid</italic>, and <italic>torso</italic>, undergo translational activation that seems out of proportion to their tail-length changes.</p><p>A primary motivation for using Drosophila in our study was the opportunity to examine the impact of Wispy, PNG, and SMG on poly(A)-tail length and TE. Of particular interest was Wispy, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that acts during late oogenesis and early embryogenesis, and is essential for the OET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of <italic>wispy</italic> mutants revealed key insights into both the mechanism of translational activation and the importance of tail shortening (as opposed to tail lengthening) in specifying translational control in Drosophila maturing oocytes and early embryos. Although poly(A)-tail lengths were typically shorter in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant stage 13 oocytes and laid eggs compared to the corresponding wild-type samples, tail length and TE were coupled in both of these <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant contexts, and the relative changes in poly(A)-tail lengths during the OET in wild-type samples were largely preserved in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples, as were the changes in TE. Thus, the act of cytoplasmic polyadenylation is not necessary for the coupling of poly(A)-tail length to translation. Moreover, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is largely dispensable for specifying which mRNAs are to be translationally activated or repressed, implying that in Drosophila, selective deadenylation is more important for imparting this specificity. This greater importance for deadenylation does not preclude a role for selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation in translational control in Drosophila—differences were observed when comparing TE changes in wild-type and <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), and when comparing RPF measurements between wild-type and <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), including for <italic>cortex</italic>, a critical OET regulator. However, the greater importance of selective deadenylation for specifying translational control in Drosophila differs from the prevailing paradigm of vertebrates, which centers on selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation of mRNAs with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piqué et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests either a fundamental difference between invertebrates and vertebrates or that an underappreciated component of translational control in vertebrates occurs through more global cytoplasmic polyadenylation with selective deadenylation.</p><p>Despite the surprisingly modest perturbation of translational regulation that we observed in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid eggs during egg activation, these laid eggs are blocked at the OET because of defective progression through meiosis and failure of pronuclei to fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2008</xref>). Why does this developmental arrest occur if translational regulation is largely preserved during egg activation in <italic>wispy</italic> mutants? One possibility is that the absolute level of translation in <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant eggs is reduced such that they make an inadequate amount of one or more essential protein. The other possibility rests on the observation that although TE changes and RPFs were remarkably concordant in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant and wild-type samples, they were not identical, and thus an aberrant change in expression for one or more key factor, such as <italic>cortex</italic>, might be sufficient to trigger the developmental arrest of <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid eggs.</p><p>Activity of the PNG kinase during egg activation affects most mRNAs that undergo translational activity changes at this developmental transition, both those that are up- and downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>). Although the direct targets of PNG kinase remain to be identified, PNG is required to relieve the repressive effects of PUM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007a</xref>) and thereby derepresses translation of <italic>smg</italic> and other mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). In wild-type activated eggs the mRNAs dependent on PNG for translational up- or downregulation exhibited corresponding increases or decreases in poly(A)-tail length, and these tail-length changes did not occur in <italic>png</italic> mutants. Thus, for both translationally activated and translationally repressed mRNAs, the downstream effectors of PNG appear to regulate translation primarily through changes in poly(A)-tail length.</p><p>Translational repressors in addition to SMG have been proposed to contribute to PNG-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). Our results are consistent with the idea that PNG activates at least one additional translational repressor, as the set of mRNAs dependent on PNG for their translational downregulation were still somewhat translationally repressed and deadenylated relative to all other mRNAs in <italic>smg</italic>-mutant embryos, although less than in wild-type embryos. Additionally, although SMG is reported to act partly through a mechanism that does not involve deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semotok et al., 2005</xref>), essentially all the derepression observed in the <italic>smg</italic>-mutant embryos was accompanied by tail-length increases. Perhaps at other times SMG causes direct translational repression, but in 0–1 hr embryos it seems to act predominantly through deadenylation.</p><p>Within the overall framework in which tail-length changes cause the up- or downregulation of mRNAs for a vast repertoire of different genes, we discovered unanticipated complexities and exceptions. One unanticipated complexity was the evidence for tail-length–independent processes that appear to amplify the tail-length–dependent effects, as already discussed. Additional unanticipated complexity was observed during oocyte maturation, in which surprisingly diverse patterns of regulatory dynamics produce the ultimate changes in TE. Single-gene studies in Xenopus, which show that <italic>c-mos</italic> mRNA becomes polyadenylated and translated prior to the mRNAs for several <italic>cyclin B</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piqué et al., 2008</xref>), hint that the complex landscape of translational control observed in Drosophila extends to vertebrate oocyte maturation. The diverse temporal behaviors of translational regulation during oocyte maturation might reflect the evolving demands on the maturing oocyte, or perhaps simply differences in the timing of expression of RNA-binding proteins that interact with these different sets of mRNAs. Regardless, the observation of different temporal patterns of regulation indicates that rather than being a sudden switch, oocyte maturation in Drosophila is a progressive process, whereby mRNAs are translationally activated or repressed at different times throughout this developmental transition.</p><p>Another surprise was the identification of a set of mRNAs for which tail-length changes did not correspond to TE changes during oocyte maturation. This exception to the general pattern occurred for the mRNAs that had undergone deadenylation between oocyte stages 13 and 14 yet continued to be translated with relatively high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To escape the general regulatory environment of the cytoplasm, these mRNAs might exploit unique interactions with the translational machinery analogous to the translational activation of histone mRNAs through stem-loop binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cakmakci et al., 2008</xref>), or they might localize to a subcellular compartment that lacks coupling. The deadenylation of these mRNAs during oogenesis might prime them for rapid degradation during embryogenesis. Most mRNAs from genes encoding proteasome subunits fell into this class. Previous comparisons of the proteome and translation changes suggest that extensive proteolysis occurs at egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>). Upregulation of the proteasome in late oogenesis might necessitate a mechanism to downregulate it rapidly during embryogenesis, perhaps facilitated by pre-deadenylating the corresponding mRNAs before egg activation.</p><p>The molecular mechanism that couples TE with poly(A)-tail length is unknown, as is the mechanism of the uncoupling that occurs at gastrulation. Nevertheless, our results, which show that widespread changes in poly(A)-tail length broadly reshape translational activity during oocyte and embryo development, demonstrate the importance of this coupling mechanism and provide a resource that documents the thousands of affected genes with information on the timing, magnitude, and inferred consequences of the tail-length changes for mRNAs from each of these genes. Moreover, the identification of unanticipated complexities and exceptions reveals the rich posttranscriptional regulatory landscape of oocytes and early embryos and points to additional mechanisms that operate for some mRNAs in specific settings, which can now be targeted for investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>All flies were kept at 18, 22 or 25°C according to standard procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenspan, 1997</xref>). <italic>Oregon R</italic> (<italic>OrR</italic>) flies were used as a wild-type control.

Similar correlations were observed in the current study when comparing stages for which little if any differences in tail lengths were expected, including activated egg and 0–1 hr embryo (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.86), stage 11 and stage 12 oocyte (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.94), stage 12 and stage 13 oocyte (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.88), as well as <italic>png</italic> and wild-type oocytes at stage 14 (<italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.86), which was prior to PNG activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mariana Wolfner for providing stocks, the Whitehead Genome Sequencing Core for sequencing, and Anthony Mahowald for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Elisa Izaurralde (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There are several points raised by reviewers 2 and 3 that in fact I prefer not to summarize because this will involve losing some important information and relevant comments provide by experts in the field. Most of the points raised by the reviewers are related to the interpretation of the results and involve reanalysis of the data or the inclusion of additional information. These points can be addressed by the authors without further experimental work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that provides a significant amount of novel information on poly(A) tail changes and translation efficiency in several stages of oogenesis and embryogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is the first study in which such a comprehensive analysis has been performed and thus provides highly relevant information and unexpected observations, which open new avenues of research. Therefore, the manuscript is ideal for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a global analysis of mRNA translation, measured using ribosome profiling, and poly(A) tail length, measured using PAL-seq, during the early stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development, spanning three important developmental transitions: oocyte maturation, egg activation, and the maternal-to-zygotic transition. These data provide interesting insights into the correlation between mRNA translation and poly(A) tail length during various stages of development, and represent a valuable resource. However, a number of issues require clarification, and the manuscript needs to be improved through additional analyses, and made more useful to the reader through the presentation of additional information, as described in the specific comments below:</p><p>1) In comparing changes in poly(A) tail length, the authors largely rely on examination of fold change. However, while measurement of fold differences is one approach for quantifying poly(A) tail length changes, this approach is not sensitive and not the most informative when the reference stage gene has a long poly(A) tail. For example, a change in poly(A) length from 10 to 20 yields a 2-fold change; however, a poly(A) tail lengthened from 40 to 80 also yields a 2-fold change, despite the fact that the absolute change is four times greater for the second gene compared to the first gene. This absolute change is not reflected in examining the fold change of the tail length, which may be problematic if one assumes that PABP has a role in linking changes in tail length to changes in translation. The minimum poly(A) length bound by PABP is 12 residues and, on longer tracts, PABP binds approximately every 25 residues (Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Sep;7(9):3268, RNA 2005 Jul;11(7):1131). PABP binding-site length and the additional number of possible PABP copies bound (i.e. change in length as measured by the number of additional PABP that can bind to the transcript) need to be considered when examining changes in poly(A) tail length, and when performing analysis of TE. This analysis would be particularly enlightening in explaining large changes in TE that correspond to apparently small fold-changes in poly(A) tail length.</p><p>2) The section discussing the wispy mutant experiments is difficult to follow, and has a number of potential caveats. For instance:</p><p>A) The use of poly(A) selection in these experiments complicates the interpretation of the results; why would poly(A) selection in generating samples for RNAseq show biases in <italic>wispy</italic> mutants but not wild type?</p><p>B) If <italic>wispy</italic> mutants are blocked at the OET, how were TE and tail lengths measured in 0-2 h embryos (this isn't mentioned until the Discussion section)?</p><p>C) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, while the changes in TE in <italic>wispy</italic> mutant and wild type during the OET are correlated, those in the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant appear decreased in magnitude, implying that <italic>wispy</italic> does have a role in regulating translational activation during this transition.</p><p>Given these issues, the conclusions from this analysis regarding a lack of dependence of translational activation on cytoplasmic polyadenylation are overstated.</p><p>3) The authors should provide lists and further analysis (e.g. GO-term enrichment) of specific groups of genes that are mentioned in the manuscript. For example, 300 transcripts underwent little to no decrease in TE despite substantial tail-length reductions during oocyte maturation; mRNAs with tails that were least affected by the absence of Wispy during OET; genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <italic>png</italic>-dependent up and down-regulated TE genes list in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>4) mRNA targets of SMG have been defined with regard to SMG-associated transcripts, and its regulation of translation and decay (Chen et al., 2014; Genome Biology). How do transcripts up-regulated in <italic>smg</italic> mutants in this study compare to those previously identified as SMG targets?</p><p>5) Quantification of several parameters are needed when making comparative statements. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “A conserved switch in the nature of translational control”, the manuscript describes the slope of several relationships and comments on how the slope becomes &quot;strongly diminished,&quot; but fails to provide numerical values of the slope, and thus makes it difficult to quantitatively judge these statements.</p><p>6) To maximize the usefulness of the manuscript to readers, it will be important to include the TE and poly(A) tail length data at different stages and in different genotypes as supplemental data. Authors should have information tables for different stage samples as in Kronja et al. (2014b), Table S2: showing each gene's mRNA abundance (rpkm), ribosome protected fragments (rpkm), translational efficiency, and mean or median of poly(A) tail length for wild type and each mutant genotype. In addition, links to the data on GEO should be provided.</p><p>7) The authors should provide more representative examples of the behaviour of individual transcripts from the datasets they are describing; for instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> it would be of interest to see traces for additional key genes, such as <italic>png, smg, bcd</italic> and <italic>wisp</italic>.</p><p>8) Could the authors extend <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to include time points all the way up to embryo 2-3h? Alternatively, provide a similar analysis for embryonic stages? It would also be beneficial for the reader if each cluster shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> had graphs describing not only TE changes but poly(A) length changes as well, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. This would help demonstrate the relationship between TE and poly(A) tail length for the different clusters of transcripts.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> should be consistent (especially regarding the x- and y-axes) so that the reader can more easily compare the changes in <italic>png</italic>-dependent mRNAs in the <italic>png</italic> mutant to the changes in the <italic>smg</italic> mutant.</p><p>10) This manuscript includes both newly acquired and previously published data (Kronja et al., 2014a,b). The authors should more clearly indicate which data have been previously published and which are new. For example, a table should be provided outlining the source of the datasets used for each portion of this study: the table should indicate where new datasets or previously published datasets are used, and the type of sequence analysis performed (RNA-seq, ribosome-profile, and/or PAL-seq).</p><p>11) When describing the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors discuss how a vast majority of the mRNAs that have &gt;2-fold increase in TE are observed to undergo increases in poly(A) tail length. However, without the reciprocal analysis, this approach appears biased towards confirming their current model. The authors should perform the reciprocal analysis and examine the TE behavior of the mRNAs that undergo poly(A) tail lengthening, and show what proportion of the lengthened mRNAs also have a &gt;2-fold increase in TE.</p><p>12) More information should be provided in the Methods and/or main text with regard to the number of replicates carried out for different experiments and statistical analyses performed on the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The work by Eichhorn et al. characterizes the correlation between poly(A) tail length changes and ribosome-footprinting/mRNAs-seq (Translation Eficiency; TE) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes and embryos. Thus, the authors describe the correlation, or lack of correlation, between both events at different developmental stages and in mutant flies for <italic>wispy, png</italic> and <italic>smg</italic> (all previously implicated in translation regulation and/or poly(A) tail length dynamics). This study is a direct follow-up on previous works by the authors studying changes in mRNA translation during early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (Kronja et al., 2014, ribosome-footprinting and proteomics) and poly(A) tail length profiling, together with TE measurements, in zebrafish and frog early development (Subtelny, 2014). Conclusions of the current study confirm those of previous works, showing a strong correlation between poly(A) tail length changes and TE until gastrulation, when the coupling is dampened.</p><p>Now, the authors further extend these approaches by using mutant embryos for known regulators of embryonic mRNA translation. However, genome-wide correlations allow for a limited set of conclusions as to the mechanism of maternal mRNA translation regulation, being the added value more as &quot;valuable resources for future studies&quot;.</p><p>1) The &quot;aggregation&quot; of data from different mRNA variants in PAL-Seq and TE complicates interpretation of results. Thus, in oocytes, where there is no transcription and where there is a good correlation between poly(A) tail length and TE, it is safe to assume that the same mRNA is being compared. However, after MZT, newly transcribed mRNAs (for any given ORF) can be different than the maternal ones. This is indeed the case for alternative cleavage and polyadenylation during embryonic development (Hoque, 2013).</p><p>2) This work assumes a linear relationship between poly(A) tail length and translation. However, this has not been demonstrated. For example, while previous works show that (for maternal mRNAs) elongation of the poly(A) tail from 20-30 to 80-100 As causes translational activation (presumably by allowing the formation of the close-loop eIF4E-eIF4G-PABP), there is no evidence showing that further elongation has any impact. Thus, more than a linear correlation, poly(A) tail length may have a bimodal regulatory effect. This is supported by recent evidence (Park et al., 2016) indicating that a single PABP (binding 30-40 As) may be sufficient to support full translational activation. Therefore, ΔP(A) does not have the same meaning when it goes from 20 to 40 As than from 100 to 200 As.</p><p>3) Even for &quot;unimodal&quot; poly(A) tail length distribution (i.e., <italic>cyclin B</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) the peak is broad ranging from 0 to 100, with about 40% of the transcripts having a poly(A) tail above 50 nt. Based on the above argument, it is difficult to interpret the meaning of an average at 40 nt. On the other hand, for toll (4D), most of the mRNAs are below 50 nt in stage 14 and the majority above 50 in activated eggs.</p><p>4) Normalization of the ribosome-footprinting by mRNA levels (mRNA-seq) using oligo-dT capture generates a strong bias that overestimates TE for short polyadenylated mRNAS (Park et al., 2016).</p><p>5) Being mRNA translation initiation a &quot;competitive event&quot; in which, not only mRNA-intrinsic features, but also competition with other mRNAs for the translational machinery dictates its efficiency, the large level changes in specific mRNAs after MZT (with maternal mRNA degradation and new transcription) can severely affect the normalization to obtain the TE ratio. This would not be an issue before MZT, as individual mRNA levels do not change.</p><p>6) Other level at which the interpretation of the results is difficult is derived from the origin of changes in poly(A) tail length, nuclear vs. cytoplasmic. Thus, in oocytes (with no transcription and no mRNA degradation), poly(A) tail length changes are presumably originated in the cytoplasm and for the same mRNA populations. After MZT (when mRNA transcription and degradation are reestablished), most of the poly(A) tail elongation events presumably correspond to newly transcribed mRNAs and most of the deadenylation events will result in mRNA degradation.</p><p>7) Probably, the most relevant contribution of this work over previous analyses is the use of mutants to correlate changes in poly(A) tail length with changes in TE. Although some potential correlations are found for <italic>wispy, png</italic> and <italic>smg</italic>, the main problem of this approach is that it does not differentiate between direct and indirect effects and all three genes have a profound impact in early embryonic development. This is clearly shown in the global deadenylation in <italic>wispy</italic>-mut oocytes and embryos. Obviously, this phenotype cannot be ascribed to the direct role of wispy in cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which should only affect a reduced number of mRNAs. In turn, the fact that these global changes do not impact the TE/poly(A) distribution over WT, can be due to the competitive nature of the poly(A) tail effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16955.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are several points raised by reviewers 2 and 3 that in fact I prefer not to summarize because this will involve losing some important information and relevant comments provide by experts in the field.

However, while measurement of fold differences is one approach for quantifying poly(A) tail length changes, this approach is not sensitive and not the most informative when the reference stage gene has a long poly(A) tail. For example, a change in poly(A) length from 10 to 20 yields a 2-fold change; however, a poly(A) tail lengthened from 40 to 80 also yields a 2-fold change, despite the fact that the absolute change is four times greater for the second gene compared to the first gene. This absolute change is not reflected in examining the fold change of the tail length, which may be problematic if one assumes that PABP has a role in linking changes in tail length to changes in translation. The minimum poly(A) length bound by PABP is 12 residues and, on longer tracts, PABP binds approximately every 25 residues (Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Sep;7(9):3268, RNA 2005 Jul;11(7):1131). PABP binding-site length and the additional number of possible PABP copies bound (i.e. change in length as measured by the number of additional PABP that can bind to the transcript) need to be considered when examining changes in poly(A) tail length, and when performing analysis of TE. This analysis would be particularly enlightening in explaining large changes in TE that correspond to apparently small fold-changes in poly(A) tail length.</italic> </p><p>Inspired by the referee’s comment, we repeated our analyses of the relationship between changes in tail length and changes in TE throughout development (i.e., those appearing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) using absolute changes in tail length instead of fold differences (log<sub>2</sub> fold changes). This analysis resulted in plots that were essentially identical to those made using log<sub>2</sub> fold changes, and in all cases the correlation between change in tail length and change in TE was essentially the same as when it was calculated using log<sub>2</sub> fold changes in tail length. These new analyses are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Part of the reason that these two methods of analyzing the impact of changes in tail length on TE yielded such similar results is because the absolute change in tail length is highly correlated with the log<sub>2</sub> fold change. However, we, like the referee, might have expected the absolute tail-length changes to still be more informative if the main influence of changing the tail was to change the number of PABP proteins that could bind. If, however, PABP was limiting during the stages in which we observed coupling between tail length and TE changes, and mRNAs were competing for the limiting pool of PABP, then the relative changes would be at least as informative as absolute changes because a 2-fold lengthening would be expected to have the same relative effect on ability to compete for PABP regardless of whether a poly(A)-tail increased from 20 to 40 nt or from 40 to 80 nt. Thus, our observation that relative changes were as informative as absolute changes implies that mRNAs are competing for PABP. We have revised our text to include this mechanistic implication of our new analyses.</p><p><italic>2) The section discussing the wispy mutant experiments is difficult to follow, and has a number of potential caveats. For instance:</italic></p><p><italic>A) The use of poly(A) selection in these experiments complicates the interpretation of the results; why would poly(A) selection in generating samples for RNAseq show biases in wispy mutants but not wild type?</italic> </p><p>In the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples, the poly(A)-tail length of essentially every gene was shorter than in the corresponding wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Due to the global shortening of tails in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples, many of the tail lengths now fell within a size range that was not efficiently captured during poly(A)- selection. Moreover, poly(A)-tail length and mRNA abundance correlated in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples but not in the wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), again supporting the idea that mRNAs with short tails were poorly recovered in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples, but that tail lengths were sufficiently long for this problem to not arise in the wild-type samples. Additional analysis discussed in the paper pertaining to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> supports the absence of a poly(A)-selection bias in our wild-type samples, indicating that this was only an issue in the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant due to the pervasive tail-shortening that occurred. We have revised the discussion of the <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant experiments to make it easier to follow.</p><p><italic>B) If wispy mutants are blocked at the OET, how were TE and tail lengths measured in 0-2 h embryos (this isn't mentioned until the Discussion section)?</italic> </p><p>Although <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant eggs do not complete meiosis and thus do not begin nuclear divisions as embryos would, most of the molecular changes characteristic of the OET are independent of these divisions, motivating a comparison of <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant laid eggs with wild-type early embryos. We now explain this in the Results and refer to <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant samples at this stage as “laid eggs” (rather than “0–2 h embryos”) to help clarify this point.</p><p><italic>C) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, while the changes in TE in wispy mutant and wild type during the OET are correlated, those in the wispy mutant appear decreased in magnitude, implying that wispy does have a role in regulating translational activation during this transition.</italic> </p><p>Overall, the changes in the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant do not decrease in magnitude. A linear deming regression of these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> yields a slope of 1.2 (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), which is consistent with <italic>wispy</italic>-mutant data exhibiting a slightly largerchange in TE than we observed in the corresponding wild-type data.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16955.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16955.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16955.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16955-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Given these issues, the conclusions from this analysis regarding a lack of dependence of translational activation on cytoplasmic polyadenylation are overstated.</italic> </p><p>We have continued to analyze the <italic>wispy</italic> data, considering even those mRNAs without any detected translation in the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which has provided some evidence for <italic>wispy</italic>-dependent translational activation, and we have tempered our conclusions accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should provide lists and further analysis (e.g. GO-term enrichment) of specific groups of genes that are mentioned in the manuscript. For example, 300 transcripts underwent little to no decrease in TE despite substantial tail-length reductions during oocyte maturation; mRNAs with tails that were least affected by the absence of Wispy during OET; genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and png-dependent up and down-regulated TE genes list in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have provided the requested lists of specific groups of genes mentioned in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Throughout the text we have highlighted classes of genes that were over-represented within a group of genes with a characteristic behavior. For example, we mention and discuss the proteasome genes as highly enriched among the ~300 transcripts that decrease in poly(A)-tail length without concordant TE decreases during oocyte maturation, and mention the ribosomal protein genes as highly enriched among the mRNAs with tails least affected by loss of <italic>wispy</italic>. The requested GO-term enrichment analysis for <italic>png</italic>-dependent up and down-regulated genes appears in a prior manuscript cited when describing these sets of targets (Kronja et al., 2014b). We have also performed many additional analyses of GO-term enrichment that are not presented in the manuscript, choosing instead to focus on the most significant results and highlight only those groups of genes that seem biologically relevant or particularly striking. Anyone interested in the weaker, less interesting GO-term enrichments will be able to easily obtain these enrichments themselves using the processed data from our <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> (point 6, below).</p><p><italic>4) mRNA targets of SMG have been defined with regard to SMG-associated transcripts, and its regulation of translation and decay (Chen et al., 2014; Genome Biology). How do transcripts up-regulated in smg mutants in this study compare to those previously identified as SMG targets?</italic> </p><p>As requested, we analyzed these previously identified SMG-bound mRNAs and found the anticipated decreases in TE and tail length in wild-type samples but not in the <italic>smg</italic>-mutant samples. We have added this analysis as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Quantification of several parameters are needed when making comparative statements. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “A conserved switch in the nature of translational control”, the manuscript describes the slope of several relationships and comments on how the slope becomes &quot;strongly diminished,&quot; but fails to provide numerical values of the slope, and thus makes it difficult to quantitatively judge these statements.</italic> </p><p>Throughout the paper these statements have either been replaced or expanded upon with quantitative metrics. For example, the statement that the referee mentions now says, “the slope of this relationship strongly diminished such that the median TE of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 70–80 nt was &lt;2-fold greater than that of mRNAs with a poly(A)-tail length between 30-40 nt.”</p><p><italic>6) To maximize the usefulness of the manuscript to readers, it will be important to include the TE and poly(A) tail length data at different stages and in different genotypes as supplemental data. Authors should have information tables for different stage samples as in Kronja et al. (2014b), Table S2: showing each gene's mRNA abundance (rpkm), ribosome protected fragments (rpkm), translational efficiency, and mean or median of poly(A) tail length for wild type and each mutant genotype. In addition, links to the data on GEO should be provided.</italic> </p><p>As requested, all of the RNA, RPF, TE, and poly(A)-tail length measurements now appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, with each developmental stage as its own sheet within the excel workbook, and information about whether a given gene passed the cutoffs applied throughout our analyses to aid readers in reproducing our results. Additionally, these processed files as well as the raw data will be available for download from GEO (accession numbers GSE52799 and GSE83616).</p><p><italic>7) The authors should provide more representative examples of the behaviour of individual transcripts from the datasets they are describing; for instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> it would be of interest to see traces for additional key genes, such as png, smg, bcd and wisp.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> has been updated to include <italic>smaug</italic> and <italic>bicoid</italic>.

The authors should more clearly indicate which data have been previously published and which are new. For example, a table should be provided outlining the source of the datasets used for each portion of this study: the table should indicate where new datasets or previously published datasets are used, and the type of sequence analysis performed (RNA-seq, ribosome-profile, and/or PAL-seq).</italic> </p><p>The RNA-seq and RPF data for wild-type stage 14 oocytes and activated eggs and <italic>png</italic>-mutant activated eggs that are analyzed in this paper were previously published in Kronja et al., 2014b, and this is now more clearly described in the Methods section and stated in all figures where these data were used. We note that the vast majority of our datasets, including the poly(A)-profiling datasets from the same samples as the previously published RNA-seq and RPF datasets, have not been previously published.</p><p><italic>11) When describing the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors discuss how a vast majority of the mRNAs that have &gt;2-fold increase in TE are observed to undergo increases in poly(A) tail length. However, without the reciprocal analysis, this approach appears biased towards confirming their current model. The authors should perform the reciprocal analysis and examine the TE behavior of the mRNAs that undergo poly(A) tail lengthening, and show what proportion of the lengthened mRNAs also have a &gt;2-fold increase in TE.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned in our response to point 8, our revised analysis resolved the discordant behavior we previously observed in the relationship between tail length changes and TE changes for up and down-regulated mRNAs during oocyte maturation. This behavior occurred because we had erroneously used TE data and PAL-seq data that came from two different stage 14 samples. When we used measurements made from the same sample, this discordant behavior went away, and thus the analysis that the referee would like for us to improve no longer appears in the paper.</p><p><italic>12) More information should be provided in the Methods and/or main text with regard to the number of replicates carried out for different experiments and statistical analyses performed on the data.</italic> </p><p>We have expanded the Methods section to include a paragraph about reproducibility and the statistical analyses performed on the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The work by Eichhorn et al. characterizes the correlation between poly(A) tail length changes and ribosome-footprinting/mRNAs-seq (Translation Eficiency; TE) in Drosophila oocytes and embryos. Thus, the authors describe the correlation, or lack of correlation, between both events at different developmental stages and in mutant flies for wispy, png and smg (all previously implicated in translation regulation and/or poly(A) tail length dynamics). This study is a direct follow-up on previous works by the authors studying changes in mRNA translation during early Drosophila development (Kronja et al., 2014, ribosome-footprinting and proteomics) and poly(A) tail length profiling, together with TE measurements, in zebrafish and frog early development (Subtelny, 2014). Conclusions of the current study confirm those of previous works, showing a strong correlation between poly(A) tail length changes and TE until gastrulation, when the coupling is dampened.</italic> </p><p><italic>Now, the authors further extend these approaches by using mutant embryos for known regulators of embryonic mRNA translation. However, genome-wide correlations allow for a limited set of conclusions as to the mechanism of maternal mRNA translation regulation, being the added value more as &quot;valuable resources for future studies&quot;.</italic> </p><p>The referee seems to imply that genome-wide correlations are of limited value with regard mechanistic insight and that results that provide mechanistic insight are the only type of results that offer value. We have a more positive view of what can be learned from high-throughput analyses and what constitutes a valuable result. Indeed, from our analyses, we made the following discoveries and insights:</p><p>A) <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a developmental shift in the nature of translational control, in which the coupling between translational efficiency and poly(A)-tail length disappears at gastrulation. This developmental shift resembles the one that had previously been observed only in vertebrates—the fact that it is also observed in an invertebrate implies that it is a basal feature of bilaterian development and post-transcriptional gene regulation.</p><p>B) Widespread coupling between translational efficiency and tail length extends to oocyte development. Previously it had been observed globally only during embryonic development, or only for a few genes in oocytes.</p><p>C) Key developmental regulators, such as <italic>zelda, stat92E, bicoid, cyclin B, fizzy</italic>, and <italic>torso</italic>, which were previously thought to be activated by tail-length– dependent processes, are also activated through other mechanisms.</p><p>D) The extent to which tail-length changes can explain the translational regulation by PAN GU and Smaug is greater than previously appreciated.</p><p>E) In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the differential translational efficiencies of different mRNAs observed in late oocytes and early embryos are specified more by selective deadenylation than by selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation. This result differs from the paradigm that operates in vertebrate oocytes/embryos and had been assumed to be operating in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Thus our work not only provides a resources for future studies but also new discoveries, important in their own right.</p><p><italic>1) The &quot;aggregation&quot; of data from different mRNA variants in PAL-Seq and TE complicates interpretation of results. Thus, in oocytes, where there is no transcription and where there is a good correlation between poly(A) tail length and TE, it is safe to assume that the same mRNA is being compared. However, after MZT, newly transcribed mRNAs (for any given ORF) can be different than the maternal ones. This is indeed the case for alternative cleavage and polyadenylation during embryonic development (Hoque, 2013).</italic> </p><p>Nearly all analyses presented in this paper are on samples that are not transcriptionally active (the exception being the right half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1— figure supplement 1</xref>, and three scatter plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, all but the first of the five discoveries/insights listed above were made based on the analysis of pre-MZT embryos. Additionally, our analyses of zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Subtelny et al., 2014), found that coupling between poly(A)-tail length and TE extended well past the onset of transcription (zygotic transcription begins at approximately 2.5 hours post-fertilization in zebrafish and stage 7 in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, whereas we observed coupling between tail length and TE at 4 hours post-fertilization and stage 9, respectively). Thus, there is no reason to think that the loss of coupling we observe around gastrulation in zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> resulted from any potential issues relating to different transcript isoforms.</p><p><italic>2) This work assumes a linear relationship between poly(A) tail length and translation. However, this has not been demonstrated. For example, while previous works show that (for maternal mRNAs) elongation of the poly(A) tail from 20-30 to 80-100 As causes translational activation (presumably by allowing the formation of the close-loop eIF4E-eIF4G-PABP), there is no evidence showing that further elongation has any impact. Thus, more than a linear correlation, poly(A) tail length may have a bimodal regulatory effect. This is supported by recent evidence (Park et al., 2016) indicating that a single PABP (binding 30-40 As) may be sufficient to support full translational activation. Therefore, ΔP(A) does not have the same meaning when it goes from 20 to 40 As than from 100 to 200 As.</italic> </p><p>The single-PABP result of Park et al. is not relevant to the developmental stages for which we see coupling between translational efficiency and tail length, since this observation was made in a very different regulatory regime (i.e., the typical post-embryonic regime for which we had already shown that translational efficiency does not generally correlate with tail length; Subtelny et al., 2014).</p><p>Nonetheless, the idea that translational activation might plateau after tail elongation exceeds 100 nt is potentially pertinent to our study, since it is based on observations of maternal mRNAs, implying that these observations were made in a developmental stage at which we have shown that translational efficiency is coupled to tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and Subtelny et al., 2014). Indeed, we sometimes did observe a plateauing of the relationship between tail length and translation in our analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, stage 11, 12, and 13 oocytes), which resembled the non-linear relationship that the referee mentions. Interestingly, though, we did not observe a plateau when comparing <italic>changes</italic> in tail length with changesin translational efficiency in the two developmental transitions that retain coupling (oocyte maturation and egg activation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). Moreover, this plateau was not a major factor in dampening the relationship between translational efficiency and tail length, as very few mRNAs had mean tail lengths exceeding 100 nt in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples.</p><p>With regard to our work assuming a linear relationship, we have always used Spearman analysis of correlations (which avoids the linear assumption), but our initial submission also did include some linear regression analyses of the relationship between tail length and translation, which indeed implied that we were assuming a linear relationship between the two. In the revision, we have replaced the previous regression analysis with an analysis of median differences in translation for mRNAs with mean tail lengths of 30–40 nt compared to those with mean tail lengths of 70–80 nt (within the range that the referee proposes to be influential for maternal mRNAs). Therefore, we no longer imply a linear relationship between tail length and translation, and none of our conclusions depend on the assumption of a linear relationship.</p><p>Finally, we note that this concern of referee #3, that doubling of a short tail would be more consequential than doubling of a long tail, resembles the concern of referee #2 (point 1) but is in the opposite direction, as referee #2 is concerned that doubling of the long tail would be more consequential than doubling of the short tail. Thus, had we found that using absolute tail-length changes (rather than relative tail length changes) reduced the correlations with TE, we would have had support for the concern of referee #3, but this was not the case (see response to referee #2, point 1, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript).</p><p><italic>3) Even for &quot;unimodal&quot; poly(A) tail length distribution (i.e., cyclin B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) the peak is broad ranging from 0 to 100, with about 40% of the transcripts having a poly(A) tail above 50 nt. Based on the above argument, it is difficult to interpret the meaning of an average at 40 nt. On the other hand, for toll (4D), most of the mRNAs are below 50 nt in stage 14 and the majority above 50 in activated eggs.</italic> </p><p>There is indeed a distribution of poly(A)-tail lengths for mRNAs from each gene. We have tried considering the entire distribution of tail lengths for each mRNA and treating the relationship with tail length as a step function, trying an array of parameters, but none of these more complicated treatments were more informative than using the simple mean. The strong performance of the mean was presumably because the tail-length distributions are unimodal and thus an mRNA with a longer mean tail length has more longer-tail molecules than one with a shorter mean tail length, and when the mean tail length increases, more molecules have longer tails. Therefore, even if the relationship involves a step function, our simple approach of using the mean captures enough of the relevant information to perform as well as more complicated treatments.</p><p><italic>4) Normalization of the ribosome-footprinting by mRNA levels (mRNA-seq) using oligo-dT capture generates a strong bias that overestimates TE for short polyadenylated mRNAS (Park et al., 2016).</italic> </p><p>We have also been mindful of the potential pitfalls of using oligo-dT capture for mRNA-seq used for normalization of ribosome-footprinting experiments (Weinberg et al., Cell Reports2016). To investigate the possibility that this influenced the TE measurements for our <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples, we compared RNA expression levels between all of our samples. In oocytes from stages 11 through 14, activated eggs, and 0-1h embryos, transcription and mRNA degradation are effectively absent, but many changes in poly(A)-tail length occurred. These changes in poly(A)-tail length did not result in changes in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which showed that in wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples poly(A)-tail lengths were long enough that oligo-dT selection did not introduce a bias. In contrast, we did observe a bias resulting from oligo-dT selection in the <italic>wispy</italic>- mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which had poly(A)-tail lengths that were much shorter than those in the corresponding wild-type samples. In the text we describe how we account for this bias in our analyses of these data.</p><p><italic>5) Being mRNA translation initiation a &quot;competitive event&quot; in which, not only mRNA-intrinsic features, but also competition with other mRNAs for the translational machinery dictates its efficiency, the large level changes in specific mRNAs after MZT (with maternal mRNA degradation and new transcription) can severely affect the normalization to obtain the TE ratio. This would not be an issue before MZT, as individual mRNA levels do not change.</italic> </p><p>As noted in our response to point 1, essentially all the analyses presented in the paper deal with pre-MZT samples (the exceptions being the right half of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and three scatter plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Following the MZT, changes in the set of expressed transcripts could indeed influence the TE value of a given gene. Our revised manuscript emphasizes that TE is a relative measure and should be interpreted as reflecting how well an mRNA is translated relative to the other mRNAs present in a given context, and that changes in the translation of the other mRNAs could cause a change in TE for an mRNA that is actually translated at the same efficiency (subsection “A conserved switch in the nature of translational control”, fifth paragraph).</p><p><italic>6) Other level at which the interpretation of the results is difficult is derived from the origin of changes in poly(A) tail length, nuclear vs. cytoplasmc. Thus, in oocytes (with no transcription and no mRNA degradation), poly(A) tail length changes are presumably originated in the cytoplasm and for the same mRNA populations. After MZT (when mRNA transcription and degradation are reestablished), most of the poly(A) tail elongation events presumably correspond to newly transcribed mRNAs and most of the deadenylation events will result in mRNA degradation.</italic> </p><p>This is indeed our interpretation of the changes in poly(A)-tail length that we see before and after MZT, as now explained in the subsection “A conserved switch in the nature of translational control”. As with previous points, it is important to keep in mind that nearly all of our analyses are on the more simply interpreted pre-MZT samples.</p><p><italic>7) Probably, the most relevant contribution of this work over previous analyses is the use of mutants to correlate changes in poly(A) tail length with changes in TE. Although some potential correlations are found for wispy, png and smg, the main problem of this approach is that it does not differentiate between direct and indirect effects and all three genes have a profound impact in early embryonic development. This is clearly shown in the global deadenylation in wispy-mut oocytes and embryos. Obviously, this phenotype cannot be ascribed to the direct role of wispy in cytoplasmic polyadenylation, which should only affect a reduced number of mRNAs. In turn, the fact that these global changes do not impact the TE/poly(A) distribution over WT, can be due to the competitive nature of the poly(A) tail effect.</italic> </p><p>Because Wispy is the only cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase acting at the stages examined, we in fact can ascribe the molecular phenotype of the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant (i.e., global deadenylation) to the direct role of Wispy in cytoplasmic polyadenylation. When we combine this finding with our observation that this global tail shortening only modestly impacts the TE/poly(A) distribution over WT, we arrive at one of the major conclusions of our study (listed as #5 in the first part of our response to this referee), that in contrast to the prevailing paradigm, the differential translational efficiencies of different mRNAs observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes and early embryos are specified more by selective deadenylation than by selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation. The competitive nature of translation and the poly(A) effect does indeed explain why the TE distribution still reflects the poly(A) tail distribution in the <italic>wispy</italic> mutant, but the key finding is that relative differences in tail lengths are largely maintained in the absence of selective cytoplasmic polyadenylation.</p><p>With respect to PNG and SMG, indirect effects certainly occur, given that these regulators act on large sets of mRNAs. Nonetheless, our analysis of the <italic>smg</italic>- mutant data found that PNG-dependent downregulated mRNAs were translationally derepressed, while the <italic>png</italic>-dependent upregulated mRNAs were not affected by loss of SMG. This result shows that indirect effects did not overwhelm the signal of direct effects in this experiment. Moreover, our revision also includes an analysis of a set of mRNAs known to bind SMG, which should be enriched in direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
