pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43271.001</object-id><p>The origins and functions of kidney macrophages in the adult have been explored, but their roles during development remain largely unknown. Here we characterise macrophage arrival, localisation, heterogeneity, and functions during kidney organogenesis. Using genetic approaches to ablate macrophages, we identify a role for macrophages in nephron progenitor cell clearance as mouse kidney development begins. Throughout renal organogenesis, most kidney macrophages are perivascular and express F4/80 and CD206. These macrophages are enriched for mRNAs linked to developmental processes, such as blood vessel morphogenesis. Using antibody-mediated macrophage-depletion, we show macrophages support vascular anastomoses in cultured kidney explants. We also characterise a subpopulation of galectin-3<sup>+</sup> (Gal3<sup>+</sup>) myeloid cells within the developing kidney. Our findings may stimulate research into macrophage-based therapies for renal developmental abnormalities and have implications for the generation of bioengineered kidney tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43271.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The kidneys clean our blood by filtering out waste products while ensuring that useful components, like nutrients, remain in the bloodstream. Blood enters the kidneys through a network of intricately arranged blood vessels, which associate closely with the ‘cleaning tubes’ that carry out filtration. Human kidneys start developing during the early phases of embryonic development. During this process, the newly forming blood vessels and cleaning tubes must grow in the right places for the adult kidney to work properly.</p><p>Macrophages are cells of the immune system that clear away foreign, diseased, or damaged cells. They are also thought to encourage growth of the developing kidney, but how exactly they do this has remained unknown. Munro et al. therefore wanted to find out when macrophages first appeared in the embryonic kidney and how they might help control their development.</p><p>Experiments using mice revealed that the first macrophages arrived in the kidney early during its development, alongside newly forming blood vessels. Further investigation using genetically modified mice that did not have macrophages revealed that these immune cells were needed at this stage to clear away misplaced kidney cells and help ‘set the scene’ for future development.</p><p>At later stages, macrophages in the kidney interacted closely with growing blood vessels. As well as producing molecules linked with blood vessel formation, the macrophages wrapped around the vessels themselves, sometimes even eating cells lining the vessels and the blood cells carried within them. These observations suggested that macrophages actively shaped the network of blood vessels developing within the kidneys. Experiments removing macrophages from kidney tissue confirmed this: in normal kidneys, the blood vessels grew into a continuous network, but in kidneys lacking macrophages, far fewer connections formed between the vessels.</p><p>This work sheds new light on how the complex structures in the adult kidney first arise and could be useful in future research. For example, adding macrophages to simplified, laboratory-grown ‘mini-kidneys’ could make them better models to study kidney growth, while patients suffering from kidney diseases might benefit from new drugs targeting macrophages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>nephron</kwd><kwd>blood vessel</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K501293/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Jamie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P013732/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hohenstein</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Embryonic macrophages encourage early kidney development, interact with developing renal blood vessels, are enriched for mRNAs linked to vascular development, and promote endothelial cross-connections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are professional phagocytes with roles in tissue development, immunity, regeneration, remodelling, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosurgi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eom and Parichy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stamatiades et al., 2016</xref>).

The first wave is generated from yolk sac-derived primitive macrophage progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>), the second from yolk sac-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) that migrate and colonise the fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rantakari et al., 2016</xref>), and the third from haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that emerge in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheng et al., 2015</xref>).

In development, kidney macrophages closely associate with the epithelial tubules of nephrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rae et al., 2007</xref>), but their interactions with vascular endothelial cells have not been examined.

As the embryo is thought to be relatively sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tissier, 1900</xref>), there are likely few immune complexes transported via the vasculature during development, but perivascular macrophages may nevertheless survey the bloodstream for factors such as maternal-derived antibodies that have crossed the placental barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morphis and Gitlin, 1970</xref>). Further, we demonstrated that macrophages can engulf erythrocytes in the developing kidney, suggesting a possible role for renal perivascular macrophages in clearing cells carried via the vasculature.</p><p>One way that macrophages shape developing tissues is via their roles in cell clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wood and Martin, 2017</xref>); for example, macrophages clear excess neurons in the developing brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuadros et al., 1993</xref>) and engulf dying cells in embryonic footplates to facilitate digit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings indicate that macrophages play a similar role at the beginning of kidney organogenesis, as they prune the rostral domain of the early nephron progenitor population. Our study failed, however, to expose the precise mechanism(s) by which rostral nephron progenitors are cleared. We observed Six2<sup>+</sup> nuclei of rostral nephron progenitors within the cell bodies of some macrophages, suggesting active phagocytosis of these cells, but it is unclear whether other mechanisms also contribute to their clearance; for instance, macrophages may generate signals and/or act as cellular chaperones to promote the caudal migration of these cells.</p><p>A trophic role for macrophages in kidney development was first suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rae et al., 2007</xref>, who demonstrated that treating cultured kidney explants with Csf1, a macrophage mitogen, results in enhanced renal growth and branching morphogenesis associated with increased macrophage numbers. Along with this finding, studies in the postnatal mouse revealed that increased activation of the Csf1/Csf1r pathway results in increased kidney weight and volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alikhan et al., 2011</xref>), whereas blockade of this pathway in the adult results in reduced kidney weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>). Our results add to these findings by showing that, in the absence of macrophages in vivo, the beginning of kidney development is delayed. Collectively, these studies suggest that macrophages act to enhance growth and maturation of renal tissue across the lifespan.</p><p>The growth and maturation of renal organoids using current differentiation protocols is limited. Since blood vessels and phagocytic cells are important for renal organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alikhan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rae et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sauter et al., 2014</xref>), our results may have significant implications for the generation of kidney organoids. Endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages are thought to arrive in the developing kidney from extra-renal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>) and future studies might usefully compare organoid maturation when macrophages and blood vessels are exogenously added to these systems.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that foetal kidney macrophages are a multifunctional cell type that frequently interact with newly forming renal blood vessels and encourage organogenesis. These results may inform future macrophage-based strategies for the prevention and treatment of neonatal and adult kidney diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type embryonic tissues that were used for descriptive studies and kidney explant culture experiments were obtained from outbred CD-1 mice killed by qualified staff of a UK Home Office–licensed animal house following guidelines set under Schedule 1 of the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Melissa H Little (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The developing murine kidney has previously been shown to contain a resident macrophage population at 12.5dpc, however the specific role of this population and their origin is not well characterized. Previous studies have shown that kidney morphogenesis in vitro is improved in the presence of macrophage colony stimulating factor while differentiation is impeded by loss of this population, suggesting a role for this macrophage population in renal development. In this study, Munro et al. extend these studies, and they propose that there are two waves of migration; an early population of macrophages derived from the yolk sac, and a later arriving population derived from HSCs. They show that depleting macrophages during differentiation using mouse lines expressing DT result in mis-patterning of the Six2<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal progenitor population, suggesting that macrophages have a role in clearing of this population from more anterior regions to define the metanephric field. Finally, they argue a close spatial localization of the resident macrophage population with the developing vasculature and a disruption to endothelial cell anastomosis and plexus formation upon macrophage depletion, but no converse adverse effect on macrophage number after depletion of endothelial populations.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) A key claim of the manuscript is that the position of the macrophages is in close association with the forming vasculature. The imaging performed to make this argument can only place the macrophages with respect to the endothelial and collecting duct populations. What is not shown is the location of the forming nephrons. The data from Rae et al. shows a tight relationship between the resident macrophages and the nephron epithelium itself. Indeed, in support of this as a primary and critical relationship, it has been reported that the epithelium itself can produce CSF1 in response to injury. Hence, a macrophage/nephron epithelial relationship may be just as important. The manuscript argues that the role of these resident macrophages is in vessel morphogenesis alone however their location is equally close to the forming tubules, which should also be shown. The authors should investigate this possibility. There are many different antibodies they could use to localize with respect to tubule. EpCAM and PAX2 would be a good start. This could be done as whole-mount and images in low or high resolution. The analysis of resident macrophages wrapping around tubules should be done as whole-mount.</p><p>2) Using DTA transgenic lines, the authors deplete the early macrophage population, and they observe clusters of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells persisting in the rostral domain in the mutant, supporting the idea that these early arriving macrophages may be important for clearance. The proposal that early macrophages are important for clearance implies that there is active phagocytosis of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells. In the absence of this macrophage population there is a clear separation between a caudal Six2<sup>+</sup> population and a more rostral population that is perhaps within the mesonephric field. Is it possible that macrophages generate signals that stimulate caudal migration of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells rather than clearance? The presence of an increased total number of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells in the DT experiments would help support the proposal that macrophages clear Six2<sup>+</sup> cells via phagocytosis.</p><p>In addition, it would be nice to know more about the aftereffects of failed clearance of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells; for example, do ectopic nephrons form in the area corresponding to the mesonephros? Six2 cells secrete GDNF and other molecules, are there ectopic ureteric bud branches as a consequence of persistence of these cells?</p><p>3) The proposal that a second wave of macrophages arrive via the vasculature needs to be better supported; for example, with movies, better quality images or alternately, the tone of the text needs to be softened.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) The study makes a claim that a major role for the resident macrophage population is assisting in the joining of endothelial structures to form a mature and connected vasculature. This claim appears to rest on the quantification presented in Figure 7E-K. It is not clear how the feature measured in Figure 7K was reached. This refers to% of field covered by each CD31<sup>+</sup> structure. How is a CD31<sup>+</sup> structure defined here? In the non-depleted population this is a single plexus and it seems difficult to see how individual cells can be separated. The earlier data in Figure 7 showing phagocytosis is also very difficult to see as the critical panels are simply too small and the contrast, particularly on the blue channel, too high to see what is going on.</p><p>2) Lineage tracing experiments are required to definitively prove that Gal3<sup>+</sup> macrophages seen at E14.5 are not just the F480<sup>+</sup> macrophages that up-regulate Gal3 expression at this stage. Hence, this point should be toned down unless there is additional evidence supporting 2 lineages.</p><p>3) The authors find that macrophages are localized between the Six2<sup>+</sup> nephron progenitor cells and the nephric duct prior to the onset of ureteric bud outgrowth, and by E10.5 were localized in a rostral domain of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells (this is the regressing mesonephros?) where the authors hypothesize they may be important for clearance.</p><p>In terms of the broad community, it would be nice to link macrophage biology in the kidney with what is known in other systems. For example, what signals could be important for migration of early and late macrophage populations during development, are they conserved with pathways that function during pathogenesis or are known regulators likely to be involved? There might be some clues that can be gleaned from the single-cell RNA sequencing study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43271.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) A key claim of the manuscript is that the position of the macrophages is in close association with the forming vasculature.

To address this point, we performed new experiments using whole-mount imaging and we found that macrophages often wrap around developing nephrons, in accordance with the findings of Rae et al., 2007. These data can be found in the new Video (Video 6) and in a new figure supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 5). These new results are described in paragraph five of subsection “Most kidney macrophages in the nephrogenic zone are perivascular throughout fetal development”.</p><p>To aid understanding for non-renal development experts, we have added a cartoon in Figure 3—figure supplement 5 to illustrate the location of nephron formation relative to other cell populations within the nephrogenic zone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Using DTA transgenic lines, the authors deplete the early macrophage population, and they observe clusters of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells persisting in the rostral domain in the mutant, supporting the idea that these early arriving macrophages may be important for clearance.

Therefore, we have discussed these possibilities in a new paragraph in the Discussion section (paragraph three).</p><p>We also performed an additional staining / imaging experiment and prepared a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) showing high resolution images of macrophages engulfing rostral Six2<sup>+</sup> nephron progenitor cells.</p><p>Regarding the after effects of failed clearance of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells: we did not observe ectopic ureteric bud formation in any macrophage-depleted embryo (see new text in Results section paragraph five). In the absence of macrophages, ureteric bud development always occurred at an anatomically normal position; however, its development was delayed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proposal that a second wave of macrophages arrive via the vasculature needs to be better supported; for example, with movies, better quality images or alternately, the tone of the text needs to be softened.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we had not provided conclusive evidence that Gal3<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells arrive as a later wave via the vasculature; we have softened the tone of our text to reflect this. We have, however, shown that a proportion of Gal3<sup>high</sup> cells is carried within renal blood vessels and these data are present in Figure 4E-F’. We have now added additional images of intravascular Gal3<sup>high</sup> cells in a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), to support this point even more strongly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) The study makes a claim that a major role for the resident macrophage population is assisting in the joining of endothelial structures to form a mature and connected vasculature.

The original count was non-blinded, so we re-performed this analysis using a blinded counter who was given coded samples to limit potential researcher bias (using the manual counting method as described in the Materials and methods section). The conclusions remained the same after the re-analysis, as the counts of the blinded counter were very similar to those of the original non-blinded researcher (data from this re-analysis are shown in Figure 7J-K).</p><p>The original representative field of view image shown for the ‘non-depleted’ / control-treated kidney had the fewest isolated structures of all samples, which may have made it difficult to interpret how the analysis was performed. We have changed this image to a more representative example (see new Figure 7F, anti-rat-IgG panels).</p><p>We have increased the size of the phagocytosis images in Figure 7A-B. In response to the comment, we have also reduced the contrast of the images in Figure 7A, particularly in the blue channel. Video 7 displays the individual z-planes of the relevant macrophages from Figure 7A-B, clearly showing that the phagocytosed cells are within the cell bodies of the macrophages of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Lineage tracing experiments are required to definitively prove that Gal3<sup>+</sup> macrophages seen at E14.5 are not just the F480<sup>+</sup> macrophages that up-regulate Gal3 expression at this stage.

We have toned down our wording throughout the text when referring to the Gal3<sup>high</sup> cells to avoid any suggestion that these cells have distinct developmental lineages from the F4/80<sup>high</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors find that macrophages are localized between the Six2<sup>+</sup> nephron progenitor cells and the nephric duct prior to the onset of ureteric bud outgrowth, and by E10.5 were localized in a rostral domain of Six2<sup>+</sup> cells (this is the regressing mesonephros?) where the authors hypothesize they may be important for clearance.</p><p>In terms of the broad community, it would be nice to link macrophage biology in the kidney with what is known in other systems.

Unfortunately, the single-cell RNA sequencing study was performed at too late an age (E18.5) to give us any indications about the signals (e.g. ligand-receptor pairs) that may be important for macrophage migration at the developmental stage when rostral nephron progenitors become diminished.</p></body></sub-article></article>
