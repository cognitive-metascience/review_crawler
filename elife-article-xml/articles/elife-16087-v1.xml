characterized by the absence of limbs and an elongated morphology. Such a particular interpretation of the basic vertebrate body architecture has often been associated with changes in the function or regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Here, we use an interspecies comparative approach to investigate different regulatory aspects at the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> locus. We report that, unlike in other vertebrates, snake mesoderm-specific enhancers are mostly located within the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster itself rather than outside. In addition, despite both the absence of limbs and an altered <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene regulation in external genitalia, the limb-associated bimodal <italic>HoxD</italic> chromatin structure is maintained at the snake locus. Finally, we show that snake and mouse orthologous enhancer sequences can display distinct expression specificities. These results show that vertebrate morphological evolution likely involved extensive reorganisation at <italic>Hox</italic> loci, yet within a generally conserved regulatory framework.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16087.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16087.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16087.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals with a backbone can look remarkably different from one another, like fish and birds, for example. Nevertheless, these animals – which are also known as vertebrates – have many genes in common that shape their bodies during development. These genes include a family called the <italic>Hox</italic> genes, which control how an animal’s body parts develop from its head to its tail and are needed to shape the animal’s limbs. <italic>Hox</italic> genes are found clustered in groups within a vertebrate’s DNA, and large regions of DNA on either side of a <italic>Hox</italic> cluster can, in some cases, physically interact with the <italic>Hox</italic> genes to regulate their expression.</p><p>So how do the same genes produce different body shapes? Different vertebrates regulate where and when their <italic>Hox</italic> genes are switched off and on in different ways. As such, it is likely that differences in gene regulation, rather than in the genes themselves, lead embryos to develop into the distinct shapes seen across the animal kingdom.</p><p>Snakes – for example – evolved from a lizard-like ancestor into elongated limbless animals as they have adapted to a burrowing lifestyle. However, it was not known if changes in how <italic>Hox</italic> genes are regulated have played a role in shaping the distinct body plan of snakes.</p><p>Guerreiro et al. have now compared how <italic>Hox</italic> genes are regulated in snakes, mice and other vertebrates, focusing on corn snakes and one particular cluster of <italic>Hox</italic> genes called the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster. The comparison revealed that these <italic>Hox</italic> genes are regulated differently in developing snakes than in other vertebrate embryos. This is particularly the case for tissues that show the most differences when compared with other animals (such as the torso and genitals) or that are absent (such as the limbs). Although <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes are activated at different times and places in snakes than in other vertebrates, snake <italic>Hox</italic> genes appear to be regulated using the same general mechanisms as mouse <italic>Hox</italic> genes.</p><p>Guerreiro et al. suggest that changes to <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene regulation have contributed to the evolution of the snake’s shape and have most likely influenced the body shapes of other vertebrates as well. However, the findings also suggest that these gene regulatory changes have been constrained by an existing regulatory mechanism that has been maintained throughout evolution. It remains for future work to address whether these changes in <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulation are a cause or a consequence of the snake’s extreme body shape, or indeed a combination of the two.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16087.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16087.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>snakes</kwd><kwd>squamata</kwd><kwd>reptiles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDB/BEX-BID/0899/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mallo</surname><given-names>Moises</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_138662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>232790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Claraz Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006389</institution-id><institution>Université de Genève</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003992</institution-id><institution>Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Espírito Santo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duboule</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite their extreme morphologies, snakes display a global regulatory strategy of their <italic>Hox</italic> genes similar to that implemented by mammals with, however, important modifications in enhancer specificity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Even though vertebrate species can display different morphologies, they all contain a strikingly similar repertoire of transcription factors and signalling molecules. In particular, genes with critical functions during embryonic development are often largely pleiotropic and highly conserved across species (for references, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirschner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duboule and Wilkins, 1998</xref>). This universality of genetic and genomic principles has changed the evolutionary paradigm from the question of the nature of similarities to that of how distinct traits could evolve using such related developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Robertis, 2008</xref>). Initially, <italic>Hox</italic> genes, as well as their structural and functional organization into genomic clusters were found well conserved across bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duboule and Dolle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia-Fernandez and Holland, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Graham et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinnis et al., 1984</xref>). In addition, their mis-expression led to changes in the identity of both insect and vertebrate segments, illustrating their crucial role in the patterning of animal structures, even though the structures they specify are of very different nature in various taxa (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maeda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krumlauf, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Tetrapods generally have four clusters of <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<italic>HoxA, HoxB, HoxC</italic> and <italic>HoxD</italic>), originating from genome duplications early in the vertebrate lineage (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemons and McGinnis, 2006</xref>) and located on different chromosomes, unlike fishes or some jawless vertebrates, which have more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Prince et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amores et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, all vertebrate <italic>Hox</italic> clusters described thus far implement a particular type of regulatory process referred to as collinearity, whereby <italic>Hox</italic> genes are expressed sequentially in both time and space following their topological organization within each genomic cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaunt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Izpisua-Belmonte et al., 1991</xref>). This regulatory property is first observed during axial extension and, subsequently, in some structures such as the limbs (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deschamps, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deschamps and van Nes, 2005</xref>). In this latter case, and while the detailed underlying mechanism may be distinct from that at work in the major body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kmita and Duboule, 2003</xref>), the general principle remains the same and was likely co-opted in the course of tetrapod evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz et al., 2001</xref>), through the emergence of global enhancers located at remote positions on both sides of the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These complex regulations were extensively studied in the mouse, in particular at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus, by using various targeted approaches in vivo. The <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster is surrounded by two gene deserts of approximately 1 Mb (megabase) in size, each one containing distinct sets of enhancers capable of activating specific sub-groups of target <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes depending on their location within the cluster. Each of these two gene deserts can be superimposed to a Topologically Associating Domain (TAD), i.e. a chromatin domain where DNA-DNA interactions in <italic>cis</italic> are privileged, for example between promoters and enhancers, and determined through chromosome conformation capture technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nora et al., 2012</xref>). The centromeric gene desert can activate the transcription of the <italic>Hoxd9</italic> to <italic>Hoxd13</italic> genes, whereas the telomeric gene desert, which is further subdivided into two sub-TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>) controls the expression of <italic>Hoxd1</italic> to <italic>Hoxd11</italic> (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lonfat and Duboule, 2015</xref>]).</p><p>This bimodal regulation allows for the selected expression of <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene sub-groups in a series of secondary embryonic structures. During limb development, for instance, the telomeric TAD initially controls all genes from <italic>Hoxd3</italic> to <italic>Hoxd11</italic> in the proximal part of the limb bud, whereas more posterior genes such as <italic>Hoxd13</italic> or <italic>Hoxd12</italic> are controlled subsequently in the most distal aspect of the incipient limb by enhancers located within the centromeric TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>). This latter regulatory landscape also controls transcription of the same posterior genes during the outgrowth of external genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>). Since snakes are limbless animals and they display highly specialized and divergent external genitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>), the existence of such a bimodal type of regulation at the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> locus was uncertain. Therefore, we set out to investigate <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulation in snakes. While these animals cannot yet be considered as genuine model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guerreiro and Duboule, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Milinkovitch and Tzika, 2007</xref>), recent advances in their genomic analyses make their study increasingly interesting in an Evo-Devo context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castoe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ullate-Agote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vonk et al., 2013</xref>). These analyses revealed that snakes, regardless of their extreme morphologies, have a tetrapod-like complement of <italic>Hox</italic> genes with only a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vonk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di-Poï et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, the serpentiform body plan may have evolved either along with changes in time and space of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression or with a different interpretation of Hox protein functions (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di-Poï et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woltering et al., 2009</xref>]).</p><p>The analysis of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in the developing corn snake (<italic>Pantherophis guttatus</italic>) revealed a surprisingly well conserved collinear mRNA distribution along the anterior-posterior axis. However, the rather strict correlation between morphological landmarks and the anterior borders of <italic>Hox</italic> transcript domains, usually seen in mammals and birds, was not always present in snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woltering et al., 2009</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Head and Polly [2015]</xref>). It was thus concluded that some Hox proteins had likely changed (part of) their functionality. In addition, the fact that the most posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes were poorly expressed in the extending tailbud was tentatively associated to the unusually large number of segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di-Poï et al., 2010</xref>), together with an increased pace in segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gomez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we used a combination of experimental approaches to try and elucidate the nature of the differences in <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene regulation between snakes and mice at comparable stages of their early development. We find that, even though the structural organization of the corn snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster resembles that of tetrapods, the extreme body plan observed in snakes is associated with an extensive regulatory restructuring. In snakes, mesodermal enhancers are mostly located inside the cluster itself, whereas other vertebrates make use of long-range regulations located at remote positions. In addition, we show that despite the loss of limbs, the bimodal chromatin organisation at the <italic>Hoxd</italic> locus found in tetrapods is conserved in the snake lineage. However, we find that the regulation of snake <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes during the development of the external genitalia is different from that of other tetrapods, even though the general logic is conserved. In this latter case, the change in enhancer activity from a limb to an external genital specificity seems to have occurred. Altogether, we conclude that <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene regulation in the snake is in many ways distinct from the situation in mammals. We discuss the possible causative nature of these changes in the evolutionary transformation towards a serpentiform body plan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To analyse the regulation of the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, we initially had to complement the available genomic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ullate-Agote et al., 2014</xref>) with high coverage sequencing of the gene cluster itself, along with the two flanking gene deserts. We screened a corn snake custom-made BAC library using as probes DNA sequences conserved from mammals to the anole lizard, present within this large DNA interval. A scaffold was built out of 13 overlapping BACs, which were selected for sequencing and from which a 1.3 Mb large DNA sequence of high quality was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The structural analysis of the corn snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster revealed that, as for other species of snakes whose genomes were recently released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vonk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castoe et al., 2013</xref>), all <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes but <italic>Hoxd12</italic> are present and share the same transcriptional orientation within the cluster.

When reptiles were excluded from the linear regression analysis, an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.43 was scored, indicating significant correlation. However, when the corn snake, king cobra and Burmese python cluster sizes were added to the analysis, the R<sup>2</sup> value was reduced to 0.027 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Even though snake Hox clusters show a size larger than what would be expected based on their genome size, the green anole lizard cluster is, from the vertebrate species analysed, the one with the lowest level of correlation with genome size (R<sup>2</sup>=0.0012). When we performed the same correlation analysis for the regulatory gene deserts that surround the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, high values of R<sup>2</sup> were scored both by excluding and including squamate values. However, the size of the squamate 3’ gene desert clearly showed a better correlation with genome size than the 5’ gene desert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Because the increased size of the cluster in Squamata correlated with the presence of a high number of transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di-Poï et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2010</xref>), we investigated the number and type of repeats present in the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus. We found that the corn snake cluster contains more than twice as many repeats as the mouse counterpart. In addition, while the mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster is mainly composed of SINEs (short interspersed elements), the corn snake cluster is composed of different types of transposable elements including LINEs (long interspersed elements) and DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The 5’ and 3’ gene deserts that surround the cluster contain a similar amount of repeats in the two species. Both gene deserts in mice include a wider range of repeat element types than in the cluster itself, yet SINEs remain the most represented transposable elements, whereas snake gene deserts mostly included LINEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our deep DNA sequence of the entire corn snake <italic>HoxD</italic> locus, including both flanking gene deserts, allowed a global conservation analysis to be performed between non-coding regions amongst different vertebrate species. Surprisingly, we found that the pattern of conservation of the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> genomic landscape is almost identical to that of the chicken, when compared to the mouse sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster</title><p>Because the silencing of transposable elements is often paralleled by the modification of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kidwell and Lisch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>), heterochromatin-like islands within the snake <italic>Hox</italic> clusters may be associated with severe modifications in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di-Poï et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woltering et al., 2009</xref>). H3K9me3 modifications are normally not found at <italic>Hox</italic> loci in tetrapods, which like many other genomic loci containing genes of importance for development, are also poor in transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simons et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we performed a ChIP-seq experiment with an antibody against this histone modification on micro-dissected embryonic snake brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), a tissue that we routinely use as a negative control for <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). No particular H3K9me3 enrichment was scored over the length of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster and the closest located peak was identified in an intron of the <italic>Lunapark</italic> gene, i.e. at a position unlikely to have any critical impact on <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In tetrapods, the proper collinear regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> gene transcription was associated with the progressive removal of H3K27me3 coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</xref>), a histone modification deposited by the Polycomb complex PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). We checked if this repressive system would operate similarly during the elongation of the snake body axis by performing an H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, either in the embryonic brain, or in a part of the posterior trunk excluding the post-cloacal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the absence of <italic>Hox</italic> gene transcription (brain), the entire cluster was decorated with H3K27me3 marks, forming a dense domain of Polycomb repression as seen previously in other species. In contrast, the posterior trunk tissue displayed an H3K27me3 coverage specifically over the 5’ part of the gene cluster, containing the most ‘posterior’ <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In parallel, whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) to assess <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene expression revealed a clear correlation between the domain of active <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes and the absence of the H3K27me3 mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). From these experiments, we concluded that both spatial collinearity and the associated dynamics of chromatin structure accompanying progressive gene activation are implemented in snakes as in any other vertebrate species studied thus far.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Regulatory potential of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster in vertebrates</title><p>In tetrapods, regulatory elements controlling <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression are found at various positions. The mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster for instance contains regulatory elements, which are mainly involved in driving <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression along the anterior-posterior body axis during gastrulation, whereas remote enhancers located outside of the cluster itself regulate transcription in other organs or structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lonfat and Duboule, 2015</xref>). Therefore, to try and identify snake-specific differences in the modes of regulations, we compared the regulatory potential of the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster with that of other vertebrates by using a BAC transgenic approach in mice, whereby BACs containing <italic>HoxD</italic> clusters of either human, mouse, chicken, snake and zebrafish were randomly integrated in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The expression of <italic>Hoxd4</italic> was monitored by in situ hybridization with species-specific probes and, under these experimental conditions, all mammalian transgenic BACs showed transcript patterns restricted to the dorsal part of the main embryonic body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), resembling the pattern obtained when a single copy <italic>Hoxd4/LacZ</italic> transgene was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tschopp et al., 2012</xref>).

This set of analyses indicated the presence of mesodermal enhancer(s) within a segment of the telomeric gene desert. In addition, the distribution of H3K27ac modifications in the mouse trunk mesodermal tissue, a histone mark associated with putative active enhancers and promoters, was clearly enriched in the telomeric gene desert when compared to the centromeric counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, top) with 18 significant peaks telomeric to the cluster versus only 7 located in the centromeric gene desert.

Therefore, in contrast to other vertebrate species, enhancers located within the snake cluster appear sufficient to drive <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene expression in the ventral mesoderm. In order to assess if this increase in regulatory potential within the cluster was correlated with a reduction of long-range regulatory elements in the surrounding gene deserts we performed a comparative analysis of H3K27ac profiles between snake and mouse trunk tissues dissected from similar body parts. A global assessment of the profiles suggested that there were relatively less enriched sequences outside of the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster than outside its mouse counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom). In order to be able to directly compare the ChIP-seq datasets in mouse and snake, we identified 27 DNA regions conserved between the two species and located within the telomeric desert and scored their enrichments with acetylation of H3K27. While 40% of these conserved sequences were acetylated in the mouse sample, only 22% of them were significantly decorated by this chromatin mark in the snake tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right).

To confirm the enhancer activity of this sequence (MSS), we cloned the mouse version upstream of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene.

As snakes lack digits, we investigated whether the conservation of this particular chromatin domain was related to the existence of external genital organs. Male snakes display hemipenes (HP), resulting from symmetrical genital buds during development. As it was proposed that the genitals of mammals have a different embryonic origin than those of other amniotes such as squamates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>), the existence of the same global regulation in snakes was unclear.</p><p>In situ hybridization revealed that 3’-located genes such as <italic>Hoxd4</italic> are expressed in the snake HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top), in contrast to the mouse where neither <italic>Hoxd3</italic> nor <italic>Hoxd4</italic> are transcribed in this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>). This difference was also scored when <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression was analysed in the various BAC transgenic lines.

This likely reflects a lack of repression of these genes into such structures, rather than the presence of limb and genital enhancers located inside the cluster. We investigated this issue by RT-qPCR in the incipient genitals of both mouse and snake, using as a control a region of the trunk located at the exact same anterior-posterior level. In such conditions, while the mouse <italic>Hoxd9</italic> to <italic>Hoxd3</italic> genes were expressed at much higher levels in the trunk when compared to the genitals, the steady state levels of snake mRNAs were nearly the same in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We performed 4C-seq analyses using embryonic mouse GT and snake HP tissues at comparable stages, as well as control trunk tissues. As expected, both the mouse <italic>Hoxd11</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> genes showed more interactions with the centromeric gene desert in the GT material than in control trunk material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In fact, the comparative analysis of the snake 4C-seq data revealed that, if anything, only the Prox sequence, a known mouse GT and limb enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>) appeared to gain interactions in the snake HP sample, when compared to control tissue.</p><p>Therefore, in addition to the fact that snakes are limbless and that their external genitalia may derive from a different embryonic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>), our results pointed to distinct modalities in the implementation of global gene regulation at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus. Consequently, we searched for the presence within the snake centromeric TAD of the digit- and genital bud-specific enhancers previously identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>).

Interestingly however, and in contrast to the mouse sequence, staining was not detected in the growing limb buds, indicating that the snake Prox sequence had lost its potential to drive transcription in digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom). Likewise, the snake GT2 sequence was able to drive reporter gene expression in the mouse GT. However, the level of <italic>lacZ</italic> staining obtained was consistently weaker than with the mouse GT2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, bottom), perhaps related to the weak (if any) contact observed by 4C between the snake <italic>Hoxd13</italic> gene and this sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Therefore, in this case, the same regulatory sequence conserved between the mouse and the snake was interpreted either as a limb- or as a genital-specific enhancer by the mouse, when introduced as transgenes. To further evaluate this striking change in enhancer potential, we cloned and investigated the regulatory capacity of both the chicken and the green anole lizard Island I sequences. The chicken construct elicited staining in limbs but not in the GT, i.e. in a pattern reminiscent of the mouse rather than the snake Island I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top). Noteworthy, while the lizard Island I also drove reporter gene expression in limbs, weak staining was scored in the GT, somehow displaying an intermediate enhancer specificity between the snakes and the other amniotes assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proper sequential <italic>Hox</italic> gene activation in time and space during the elongation of the main body axis is critical for the correct patterning of the axial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deschamps and van Nes, 2005</xref>). While the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain to be fully understood (see e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaunt, 2015</xref>), they likely involve control sequences located both inside and outside of the <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tschopp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tschopp and Duboule, 2011</xref>) as well as concurrent epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Transgenic approaches have identified several <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, which could reproduce, for the most part, a <italic>Hox</italic>-like expression pattern in the main body axis and which mapped close to their target gene(s) (for examples, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bel-Vialar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brend et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charité et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oosterveen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharpe et al., 1998</xref>). However, our various transgenic mouse lines containing <italic>HoxD</italic> clusters from different vertebrate species showed that, in most vertebrates, regulatory sequences located in the gene deserts flanking the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster are necessary for proper expression in the embryonic trunk mesoderm. Indeed, when using the expression of <italic>Hoxd4</italic> as a read-out of the regulatory potential contained either in the mouse, the human, the chicken or the zebrafish clusters, ventral mesodermal expression was not detected. This result is at odds with previous reports describing the presence of mesodermal enhancers on a short mouse transgene derived from this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrison et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, we found <italic>Hoxd3</italic> expression to be absent from the ventral mesoderm in mouse embryos that lack the telomeric gene desert while previous work has reported that a small single-copy construct containing the <italic>Hoxd3</italic> locus was able to drive reporter gene expression in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tschopp et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These discrepancies may derive from a qualitative aspect whereby a short transgene may reveal the potentialities absent from a more complex BAC environment, such as in the case of <italic>Hoxd3</italic>. They may also reflect quantitative differences, for example when comparing (close to) single copy BAC integrations with a large number of head to tail integrations of a shorter transgene, as for <italic>Hoxd4</italic>. In any case, a different result was obtained when the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> BAC was used since, unlike the other vertebrate clusters tested, the snake transgene appeared to contain the regulatory elements necessary for expression in the trunk mesoderm. The H3K27 acetylation profiles in mouse and corn snake trunks supported this result for only few acetylation peaks were scored outside of the snake cluster compared to the mouse. In an evolutionary context, it is possible that in snakes, long-range mesodermal enhancers were progressively complemented by local enhancers to regulate <italic>Hoxd</italic> gene expression in the developing body axis, perhaps to provide an increased fine-tuned control in the expression balance between single <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes during embryonic development.</p><p>In the absence of any genetic approach to study snake development, it is difficult to evaluate the functional relevance of this difference in regulation. It is however worth noting that the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster BAC was the only transgenic configuration where expression was strong in the limbs and external genitals, whereas BACs derived from animals with limbs did not elicit an expression of <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes into the transgenic limbs, even though the endogenous genes were strongly expressed there. Also, isolated mouse mesodermal enhancers were often described to activate reporter gene expression in secondary structures such as limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charité et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharpe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Renucci et al., 1992</xref>). In tetrapods, this apparent paradox may reflect the necessity for a highly specific type of regulation to control both <italic>Hoxa</italic> and <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in specific domains of the growing limb buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berlivet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woltering et al., 2014</xref>). Implementing such global limb regulations may require previous regulatory inputs to be terminated. Our results using the corn snake BAC suggest that, in the absence of limbs, this negative control may have been lost in the course of evolution, leading to the maintenance of transcription in all mesoderm derivatives. Whether or not this increased ‘mesoderm potential’ present in the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster may somehow relate to the presence of ventral mesodermal enhancer remains to be clarified.</p><p><italic>Hox</italic> clusters of jawed vertebrates show high levels of chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noordermeer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fabre et al., 2015</xref>), a feature associated with the unusual level of gene packaging and organization, which occurred at the roots of the vertebrate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duboule, 2007</xref>) together with the emergence and generalisation of long-range regulations at these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darbellay and Duboule, 2016</xref>). Squamate <italic>Hox</italic> clusters however seem to slightly deviate from this rule by having accumulated a large number of transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di-Poï et al., 2009</xref>), a situation rarely found around genetic loci of developmental importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simons et al., 2007</xref>) due to the potential effects of such sequences to elicit genetic and morphological variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kidwell and Lisch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>). While the presence of such repeated elements within and around the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster may have been associated with differences in the location of enhancer sequences, the distribution of chromatin modifications did not point to any drastic regulatory re-organization of this gene cluster in snakes. Indeed, the H3K9me3 histone mark, which in some cases is associated with TEs such as LTRs, LINEs and SINEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>) was not found within the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster itself. In addition, the analysis of other chromatin marks present in trunk tissue during the sequential activation of the gene cluster displayed distributions similar to those found in the mouse cluster.</p><p>These global similarities between mouse and snake in the structure of the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster were also noticed when interaction profiles were considered. There again, the snake embryonic material displayed the bimodal distribution of contacts on both sides of the gene cluster, as expected either from several studies using specific mouse samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrey et al., 2013</xref>), or from the full embryonic material used in this work. In all cases, most <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes tend to naturally interact within the ‘telomeric’ (3’-located) TAD, whereas <italic>Hoxd13</italic> was strongly associated with the ‘centromeric’ (5’-located) TAD. However, a significant difference was scored in the interaction profiles of <italic>Hoxd9</italic>, which displayed more contacts further away of region CNS39 in the mouse than in the snake sample. As this regulatory region is particularly active in proximal limbs, the lower frequency of contacts observed in snake embryos was not unexpected. This observation indicates that, while the general bimodal TAD regulatory structure is conserved at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus, differences between vertebrate species may exist either in the extent, or in the internal organization of interactions within the TADs.</p><p>This latter point was of particular interest as the mouse centromeric TAD was initially defined due the presence of many limb and genital-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lonfat et al., 2014</xref>), which were not necessarily expected to be conserved in the snake orthologous landscape due to both the absence of limbs and the presumably distinct origin of snake external genitalia following the relative shift of the cloaca over the course of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>). However, tetrapod limb-specific enhancers are often conserved in snakes and a significant overlap between limb and genital <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mechanisms was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Infante et al., 2015</xref>), in agreement with the similarities between the molecular mechanisms employed to generate the two structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed when a mouse limb- and genital-specific <italic>Tbx4</italic> enhancer sequence was isolated from snake, it could only recapitulate genital expression, thus having lost the limb-specific regulatory potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Infante et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this observation, we find that the snake counterpart of the mouse limb and genital enhancer Prox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gonzalez et al., 2007</xref>) has lost its limb regulatory potential, while keeping a strong capacity to drive expression in the developing genitalia. This suggests that the mouse Prox consists of two regulatory modules, while the snake Prox has kept the genital specificity only. More strikingly however, Island I, which in the mouse is a limb-only specific enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Montavon et al., 2011</xref>), switched its regulatory capacity in the snake to become a genital-only specific enhancer, accompanied by elevated enhancer-promoter interactions as assayed by 4C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> – asterisk). On the other hand, the chicken Island I revealed enhancer specificities almost identical to those of the mouse sequence despite the fact that birds are more closely related to squamates than to mammals, suggesting that Island I had a limb-only activity at the time of divergence between mammals and reptiles/birds. Interestingly, the lizard sequence displayed a weak activity in the genital bud, in addition to the limb, indicating that the co-option to a genital function likely occurred in the squamate clade and thus preceded limb loss in snakes.</p><p>External genitalia of squamates, unlike that of mammals, were proposed to have the same embryonic origin as limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tschopp et al., 2014</xref>). Although, this could bias our mouse-based transgenic analysis, the snake Prox sequence could drive reporter gene expression specifically in the mouse GT and not in the limb, making it unlikely that differences in embryonic origin could interfere with this particular analysis. While the generation of the same transgenics in snakes would be necessary to fully rule out this bias, such experiments are not feasible for the moment.</p><p>Altogether our results show that, while the general bimodal regulatory strategy is conserved, some profound differences in the regulation are scored at the <italic>HoxD</italic> locus between two species displaying strikingly distinct morphologies. It is as yet unclear if such changes were causative of the extensive morphological changes that snakes experienced over the course of evolution, or whether they are merely consequential. It nevertheless indicates that vertebrates with extreme variations in those systems known to be under the control of <italic>Hox</italic> genes (vertebral number and identities, limbs, genitals) rely upon the same general regulatory architecture and principles at <italic>Hox</italic> loci. In this view, vertebrate morphological evolution was accompanied by changes in <italic>Hox</italic> gene regulation, yet such variations were constrained within the general regulatory framework found at these loci. This may reflect selective pressures that impose essential basic properties to vertebrate body plans, while other more subtle morphological specificities, less likely to result in adverse effects, may arise in the course of evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal maintenance</title><p>Maintenance of, and experiments on animals were approved by the Geneva Canton ethical regulation authority (authorization 1008/3421/1R to M.C.M. and GE/81/14 to D.D.) and performed according to Swiss law.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>BAC library construction, screening and sequencing</title><p>A <italic>Pantherophis guttattus</italic> BAC library containing 55’296 clones was constructed from liver tissue of one single individual (Amplicon Express).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Robb Krumlauf) and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hugo Parker (Reviewer #1); Jacqueline Deschamps (Reviewer #2); Axel Meyer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A large amount of work is brought together here through analysis of the <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster in an effort to explain why a snake ends up looking like a snake and not like a mouse. Although <italic>Hox</italic> gene cluster architecture is extremely conserved among different classes of vertebrates, their body plans are surprisingly diverse. This &quot;disconnect&quot; between genomic conservation and phenotypic diversity is intriguing and still largely not understood. Snakes are secondarily simplified vertebrates that possess a derived/unusual tetrapod body plan and alterations in <italic>Hox</italic> gene function and regulation have been suggested to play an important role in bringing about that change. This study relies extensively on the known principles of <italic>Hox</italic> regulation as previously characterized by the author's group in mouse. Extrapolating from this mouse &quot;ground state&quot; the study presents a descriptive molecular genetic comparative analyses of regulatory mechanisms between a model (mouse) and non-model organism (snake), focusing on mesodermic enhancer activity. This work provides interesting advances towards answering that the central question through a detailed analysis of the regulation of the snake <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster. It contains large and detailed datasets, including BAC transgenesis, ChIP-seq and 4C-seq.</p><p>The manuscript is, in principle of sufficient quality and broad interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but several central questions and concerns need to be addressed which may require additional data. These issues fall into three main areas: 1) the nature of the mesoderm; 2) the postulated location of mesodermal enhancers; and 3) analysis of the exaptation finding.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>1).The authors should make it more explicit that the differently regulated mesodermal <italic>hoxd4</italic> expression domains are the lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm, and that these be termed 'ventral mesoderm' in the manuscript. It is more appropriate to call the mesoderm where <italic>HoxD</italic> genes are regulated differently in snake and other vertebrates &quot;ventral mesoderm&quot; (meaning lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm together, in fact the tissues where limbs and external genitals arise from) instead of other versions of this mesoderm used through the manuscript (&quot;upper mesodermal derivatives&quot;, &quot; trunk mesoderm&quot;). From the expression patterns documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, it is quite clear from the whole mounts that the difference in regulatory potential from inside the cluster between snake and other vertebrates concerns ventral mesoderm. This is clear even in the absence of identifying the mesodermal components involved upon sectioning the embryos. Dealing with the presence of a ventral mesoderm enhancer in the telomeric desert flanking mouse <italic>HoxD</italic> then is not at odds with the data described in Spitz et al., 2001. In that paper expression of a &quot;scanning lacZ reporter&quot; replacing all <italic>HoxD</italic> genes remains expressed in the ventral most mesoderm. This addresses any concern about the specific domains of mesodermal expression in the transgenics and mutants. It might also be useful if the authors would label this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for those unfamiliar with mouse embryos.</p><p>2) All comments regarding whether a ventral mesodermal enhancer is likely to exist in the snake telomeric desert (a situation that cannot be tested in snakes), and whether it is legitimate to say that snake mesoderm-specific enhancers are mostly located within the <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster itself rather than outside raise the point of why don't the authors invoke their most parsimonious hypothetical scenario: telomeric mesodermal enhancers might exist both in snake (without being identified so far) and in other vertebrates, accounting for <italic>HoxD</italic> expression in ventral mesoderm in these species, a potential conserved regulatory event. In tetrapods this mesodermal expression of <italic>HoxD</italic> would be repressed at the initiation of the second wave of <italic>HoxD</italic> expression to ensure distal limb morphogenesis. In snakes, which are limbless, this negative control would not take place (discussion and ventral mesoderm expression of <italic>HoxD</italic> remains. There would thus not be snake-specific mesoderm enhancers inside the snake <italic>HoxD</italic> cluster, but a loss of repression. The authors need to soften their assertion about the absence of a ventral mesodermal enhancer/s in the snake telomeric desert, along these lines.</p><p>3) The exaptation finding is potentially most illuminating from an evolutionary perspective. However, activity of snake enhancers in mouse is not necessarily a reliable readout of their activity in snake, due to regulatory systems drift. However, as testing these elements in a reporter assay in a lizard or snake is too much to ask, perhaps tissue specific histone marks such as H3K27ac could be informative. This approach was recently used by Infante et al. 2015 (Developmental Cell 35.107-119) for Anolis limb and genital tissue. The authors could look through the ChIP-seq data from this Anolis study, available on-line, to see whether Anolis homologs of their elements show up. At least one of the homologous Anolis enhancers, as well as a homolog from another snake, could also be tested in mouse, as was done by Infante et al. for the Tbx4 HLEB enhancer. This would greatly enhance the evolutionary conclusions about the changing activities of these enhancers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16087.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors should make it more explicit that the differently regulated mesodermal hoxd4 expression domains are the lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm, and that these be termed 'ventral mesoderm' in the manuscript.

To this aim, we have added a Supplementary Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) where we show a transversal section of both the Del(<italic>Attp-Sb3</italic>), The human BAC and the snake BAC transgenic embryos, as well as of a control embryo. It appears that the isolated human cluster does not have the ability to drive expression in any of the trunk mesoderm at this developmental stage and <italic>Hoxd4</italic> expression is clearly restrictedto the neural tube. The deletion of the mouse telomeric desert also lacks normal ventral mesoderm expression. To our understanding, the ventral-most somitic mesoderm expression is also affected in addition to the more clearly absent intermediate and lateral mesoderm. The text has been changed accordingly (subsection “Reshuffling mesodermal enhancers”) in order to take into account this new figure and the term “ventral mesoderm” is then used throughout the manuscript to describe ventral somitic mesoderm, as well as intermediate and lateral mesoderm.</p><p>We have also highlighted this ventral mesoderm region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) All comments regarding whether a ventral mesodermal enhancer is likely to exist in the snake telomeric desert (a situation that cannot be tested in snakes), and whether it is legitimate to say that snake mesoderm-specific enhancers are mostly located within the HoxD cluster itself rather than outside raise the point of why don't the authors invoke their most parsimonious hypothetical scenario: telomeric mesodermal enhancers might exist both in snake (without being identified so far) and in other vertebrates, accounting for HoxD expression in ventral mesoderm in these species, a potential conserved regulatory event.

The authors need to soften their assertion about the absence of a ventral mesodermal enhancer/s in the snake telomeric desert, along these lines.</italic></p><p>We initially concluded that most mesodermal enhancers were mostly located within the gene cluster following the results obtained with the BAC transgenic experiment. We agree that even though we can conclude that sequences within the snake cluster are sufficient to drive expression in the ventral mesoderm of the mouse, this experiment does not exclude that other enhancers are located outside of the cluster. However, the H3K27 acetylation ChIP in mouse and snake trunk shows a considerable decrease of peaks in the regulatory gene deserts of the snake. Therefore, although the complete absence of enhancers in the telomeric gene desert cannot be claimed without further experiments, it appears that, at the very least, a significant reduction of mesodermal enhancers outside of the cluster may have occurred. We have changed the text to correct the premature conclusion on the location of the snake mesodermal enhancers (subsection “Bimodal regulation in the snake HoxD regulatory locus”).</p><p>In our view, the conclusion that most trunk mesodermal enhancers are present within the snake cluster, unlike the mouse, remains the most parsimonious. In the mouse, mesodermal enhancers have been described to be present within the cluster and snakes seem to have found an evolutionary advantage in increasing the regulatory potential of sequences in close proximity to their target genes. Such a scenario would account for the use of a preexisting regulatory strategy that would simply be reinforced in the case of the snake. In contrast, mouse limb enhancers have only been described outside of the cluster and therefore it is unlikely that a limbless organism such as the snake would select for the re-allocation of limb enhancers within the cluster. It is therefore possible that snake <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes have suffered distinct regulatory changes perhaps depending on whether such changes were selected after positive or relaxed selection. We have changed the text to more extensively discuss this hypothesis and have toned down our conclusions.</p><p><italic>3) The exaptation finding is potentially most illuminating from an evolutionary perspective. However, activity of snake enhancers in mouse is not necessarily a reliable readout of their activity in snake, due to regulatory systems drift. However, as testing these elements in a reporter assay in a lizard or snake is too much to ask, perhaps tissue specific histone marks such as H3K27ac could be informative.

At least one of the homologous Anolis enhancers, as well as a homolog from another snake, could also be tested in mouse, as was done by Infante et al. for the Tbx4 HLEB enhancer. This would greatly enhance the evolutionary conclusions about the changing activities of these enhancers.</italic> </p><p>We have followed this interesting suggestion and have analyzed the recently published acetylation tracks of limb and genitalia from lizards and mice (Infante et al., 2015). Interestingly, we find that, like in the mouse, the lizard Island I is enriched for H3K27ac in limb samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>). Some level of acetylation is also present in lizard genitals. This prompted us to assay the lizard Island I sequence in an enhancer assays, together with the chicken counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, top). We find that, while the chicken Island I has a limb-only function, thus looking very much like the mouse sequence, the lizard counterpart contains both limb and genital regulatory specificities, even though the genital expression was much weaker than in the limbs. Since the chicken is more closely related to squamates (lizards and snakes) than to mammals, these results suggest that an ancestral Island I enhancer had a limb-only specificity, which was subsequently co-opted to a genital specificity in squamates. Of course all these assays were performed in a mouse background, yet the correspondence between reporter activity experiments in the mouse and the previously published H3K27ac ChIP-seq in other species re-enforces the relevance of this experimental approach.</p><p>These new results are described in the revised text.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16087.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> H3K27ac profiles in limb and genitals over Island I of mouse (up) and lizard (bottom).</title><p>The Island I is shown as a black box under the profiles and sequence conservation as assessed by UCSC Blat is shown underneath for different vertebrate species.
