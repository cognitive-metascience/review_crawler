Replicated DNA is weaved into discrete chromatids during mitosis by condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>) while sister chromatids are held together by cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), which is essential for their bi-orientation on mitotic spindles.</p><p>Both complexes contain a pair of rod-shaped Smc proteins (Smc1/3 in cohesin) whose association via their hinge domains creates V-shaped heterodimers with ATPase domains at their vertices. These are interconnected by kleisin subunits to form trimeric rings, whose activity is regulated by a set of hook-shaped proteins composed of HEAT repeats known as HAWKs (HEAT repeat proteins Associated With Kleisins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wells et al., 2017</xref>). Regulation by HAWKs distinguishes cohesin and condensin from bacterial Smc/kleisin complexes and the eukaryotic Smc5/6 complex, whose kleisin subunits associate instead with tandem-winged helical domain proteins called KITEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palecek and Gruber, 2015</xref>). Cohesin has three HAWKs: Scc3 is permanently bound while Scc2/Nipbl and Pds5 appear interchangeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petela et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Condensin has the remarkable ability to form and expand in a processive manner DNA loops in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>), an activity known as loop extrusion, previously postulated to explain how condensin transforms interphase chromosomes into thread-like chromatids while at the same time accumulating along their longitudinal axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goloborodko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>). Cohesin has more diverse activities. In addition to its canonical role of holding together sister chromatids, cohesin also organises interphase chromatin into defined territories called TADs (Topologically Associated Domains), a process also thought to be driven by loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>). Cohesin is thought to mediate cohesion by entrapping sister DNAs inside its tripartite ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). It can also entrap individual DNAs prior to DNA replication and this may be a feature of its chromosomal association throughout the cell cycle. Whether DNAs are entrapped within cohesin rings during loop extrusion is not known.</p><p>Loading of cohesin onto chromosomes as well as entrapment of mini-chromosome DNAs by cohesin rings depends on both Scc3 and Scc2 but not on Pds5. Loading also requires Scc4, which binds to an unstructured N-terminal domain within Scc2. Because neither Scc2 nor Scc4 are required to maintain cohesion following S phase, Scc2/4 has long been thought to function merely as a ‘loading complex’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). However, the finding that Scc2 associates with chromosomal cohesin long after loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhodes et al., 2017a</xref>) suggests that this may not be the whole story. Because it is essential for activating cohesin’s ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petela et al., 2018</xref>), Scc2 may have a key role in activating the DNA translocase activity that powers loop extrusion.</p><p>DNAs are released from cohesin rings by two mechanisms, either through kleisin cleavage by separase, which occurs at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>), or at other stages of the cell cycle via a separase-independent mechanism that requires the binding to Pds5 and Scc3 of a fourth regulatory subunit called Wapl. Wapl-dependent releasing activity (RA) is abrogated by mutations on Pds5 and Scc3 (<italic>pds5S81R</italic> and <italic>scc3K404E</italic>) that abolish their interaction with Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wapl-dependent RA induces disengagement of the ring’s Smc3/kleisin interface, thereby creating a gate through which DNAs can escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>). The steady state level of chromatin associated cohesin during G1 is therefore determined by the rates of Scc2 catalysed loading and Wapl-dependent RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because it would destroy sister chromatid cohesion, Wapl-dependent RA is neutralised during DNA replication through acetylation of Smc3 K112 and K113 by Eco1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ivanov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Unal et al., 2008</xref>).

For example, cohesin that loads onto chromosomes during G2 cannot connect sister DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2004</xref>) and mutation of non-essential fork-associated proteins (Ctf4, Ctf18, Tof1, Csm3, Mrc1and Chl1) causes cohesion defects without adversely affecting replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanism by which cohesion is established remains poorly understood. Photo-bleaching experiments showing that replication fork passage does not per se induce cohesin’s dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rhodes et al., 2017b</xref>) suggest either that replication forks actually pass through cohesin rings that have entrapped DNA ahead of the fork or that such cohesin rings are opened transiently as they are passed on to, and subsequently entrap sisters.</p><p>One way of providing insight into cohesion establishment would be to determine whether it depends on Scc2. Replication through rings should not require a second Scc2-dependent loading reaction while ring opening and re-loading on lagging or leading (or both) strands would be expected to do so. The recent observation that cohesin loaded onto a double stranded DNA in vitro is capable of capturing a second single stranded DNA molecule in a manner dependent on Scc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>) raises the possibility that cohesion is established by rings associated with a leading strand capturing the lagging strand through Scc2 catalysed ring opening. If so, Scc2 must be required during replication itself as well for loading cohesin onto un-replicated chromatin.</p><p>We therefore set out to answer the following simple question: In cells lacking Wapl-dependent RA, is Scc2 required to build cohesion during S phase in cells that have already loaded cohesin onto chromosomes during G1? To answer this, we set out to inactivate Scc2 in late G1 cells that had already loaded cohesin onto chromosomes, while Scc2 was still active, and then allow these cells to undergo S phase in the absence of any further Scc2 activity. Unexpectedly, inactivation of Scc2 in pre-replicative cells causes cohesin unloading throughout the genome, even in cells that lack Wapl-dependent RA, a phenomenon that precluded our intended experiment.</p><p>We subsequently discovered that release in G1 cells involving disengagement of the Smc3/Scc1 interface is in fact a Wapl-independent process that is actively blocked by Scc2. Scc2 is therefore not merely a loader and Wapl is not an intrinsic aspect of releasing activity (RA). Wapl-independent RA is switched off as cells undergo S phase in a manner that does not require either replication or acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1 but involves Cdk1. Because it cannot be switched back on (upon Cdk1’s subsequent inactivation) without cohesin’s removal from chromosomes, we were able to show that cohesin loaded prior to replication can create cohesion without Scc2, a finding that has profound implications regarding the mechanism of cohesion establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A Wapl-independent activity releases cohesin from chromosomes in G1 cells</title><p>To measure DNA entrapment within cohesin rings, we used budding yeast cells containing cysteine pairs at all of cohesin ring’s three interfaces (6C) that can be cross-linked by the homobifunctional crosslinker BMOE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). Following SDS treatment, gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting reveals two types of circular mini-chromosomes associated with 6C cohesin only when cells are treated with BMOE: catanated monomers (CMs) that correspond to monomeric supercoiled DNAs catenated by a single cohesin ring and catanated dimers (CDs) that correspond to sister DNAs catenated by a single ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>). CMs are formed when cohesin loads onto chromosomes either before or after (see below) DNA replication while CDs only form when cohesin builds cohesion during S phase.</p><p>To ascertain whether cohesin’s ‘loading complex’ is required to establish cohesion during S phase, we set out to determine whether its Scc2 subunit is required to convert CMs formed during G1 into CDs during replication. To do this, we first established a protocol for inactivating Scc2 in G1 cells that accumulate Scc1 to high levels and load cohesin onto chromosomes.

Three important corollaries follow. First, Scc2 is not merely involved in loading cohesin onto chromosomes but acts long afterwards to prevent release. Second, contrary to prevailing wisdom, Wapl is in fact not essential for cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes. Third, this Wapl-independent release mechanism is cell cycle regulated and turned off in G2 cells, with the result that Scc2 is no longer required to maintain cohesin on chromosomes after replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Scc2 does not require Scc4 to block Wapl-independent RA</title><p>How does Scc2 block release?

Under these circumstances, Scc2 depletion was accompanied by reduced NScc1’s association with and cross-linking to Smc3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), suggesting that Scc2 is necessary to prevent NScc1’s dissociation from Smc3 in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells.</p><p>Part of the reduction in Smc3-NScc1 crosslinking in <italic>wpl1Δ</italic> cells induced to degrade Scc2 can be attributed to the reduced activity of the Scc2-3XmAID fusion protein even in the absence of auxin.

Together with the persistence on chromosomes of cohesin containing the Smc3-Scc1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), these results suggest that Wapl-independent release induced by Scc2 inactivation in G1 cells is mediated by opening the Smc3/Scc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

If Cdk1 activity were really the parameter that determines whether cohesin requires the Scc2 maintenance function, then the cohesin in these two populations should have behaved identically. One possible explanation for their different behaviour is that the low Cdk1 state created by inhibition of Cdk1 in G2 cells is in some way different from the low Cdk1 state created by expression of non-degradable Sic1. In other words, these two cell cycle states in fact differ in some unknown way that affects cohesin’s behaviour. If this is the case, even cohesin loaded onto chromosomes after Cdk1 had been inhibited in G2 cells would behave differently to that loaded in Sic1-arrested cells.</p><p>To address if cohesin loaded onto chromosomes in the presence of the low Cdk1 levels produced by treating G/M phase arrested <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> cells with 1NMPP1 is sensitive or resistant to Scc2 inhibition, we arrested <italic>scc3K404E SCC2 cdc28-as1</italic> and <italic>scc3K404E scc2-45 cdc28-as1</italic> cells in G2/M, inhibited Cdk1 by 1NMPP1, and then only subsequently induced Scc1<sup>NC</sup>-PK to generate CMs. Crucially, these CMs, unlike those made prior to Cdk1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), disappeared in <italic>scc2-45</italic> but not in the <italic>SCC2</italic> cells upon shift from 25°C to 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This implies that the G1-like state created by inhibition of Cdk1 in G2/M cells is in fact similar to that produced by arresting cells in late G1 with non-degradable Sic1. CMs created in both types of G1 states require Scc2 for their maintenance.</p><p>This suggests that the persistence of a G2 character following Cdk1 inhibition of CMs made in G2 cells, namely their resistance to Scc2 inhibition, is conferred by cohesin’s continued association with chromosomes. In other words, loss of Scc2 resistance characteristic of G2 chromosomal cohesin, upon Cdk1 inhibition, requires cohesin’s removal from chromosomes. If the resistance is conferred by a post-translational modification promoted by Cdk1, then the modification must persist even when Cdk1 is subsequently inhibited, as long as cohesin remains associated with chromosomes. Though this might seem unlikely, there is in fact a clear precedent for such behaviour, namely the dependence of Smc3 deacetylation by Hos1 on Scc1 cleavage and not the decline in Cdk1 activity that normally accompanies cleavage during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>In the absence of all forms of cohesin release, Scc2 becomes dispensable for cohesion establishment</title><p>Our discovery that only CMs are produced when Scc1 is induced in G2/M phase cells and that these CMs are refractory to Scc2 inactivation even when Cdk1 is inhibited provided a means of testing whether Scc2 is required to convert CMs to CDs.

In other words, CMs can be converted during S phase to CDs in the absence of Scc2 activity. Though unexpected, the result was highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, the CDs formed in the absence of Scc2 activity was entirely dependent on cohesin crosslinking with BMOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), confirming that the CDs formed in the absence of Scc2 were held together by cohesin and not by DNA catenation.</p><p>Because of the unexpected results from this experiment and because it merely addressed CD formation by small circular mini-chromosomes, we sought an alternative way of addressing Scc2’s role during S phase. Our goal was to measure establishment of cohesion along chromosome arms in cells that enter S phase under very different circumstances. Because Scc2 is unnecessary to maintain cohesin’s association with chromosomes in Wapl deficient cells that activate Cdk1 but cannot undergo replication due to Cdc45 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we reasoned that the same might be true for cells whose replication is prevented by hydroxyurea (HU). We therefore asked whether or not Scc2 is required to generate cohesion upon replication following a transient HU arrest.</p><p>To measure cohesion on a chromosome arm, we used a version of chromosome V in which multiple tandem TetO arrays at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus are marked by TetR-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>SCC2</italic> or <italic>scc2-4</italic> cells were released from G1 arrest into HU containing medium at 25°C. After 45 min, cells were transferred to HU-free medium at 35.5°C under conditions in which cells were depleted for Cdc20, which prevented separase activation and caused metaphase arrest. Crucially, calibrated whole genome sequencing revealed little or no origin firing during the 45 min incubation in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>To assess the ability of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> red graphs) to build cohesion, they were compared to a different population of cells that were released from G1 arrest into HU-free medium directly at 35.5°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> blue graphs). In <italic>SCC2</italic> cells, the fraction of cells with two GFP dots (a measure of cohesion loss) remained low throughout the time course whether or not they had been given an opportunity to load cohesin in the presence of HU at 25°C (see <italic>SCC2 pds5S81R</italic> cells in left panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, as expected, wild type cells established cohesion under both regimes.</p><p>In <italic>scc2-4</italic> cells, the fraction of cells with two GFP dots rose soon after replication, indicating a failure to establish sister chromatid cohesion. Crucially, the cohesion defect was only modestly reduced when cells were allowed to load cohesin onto chromosomes in the presence of HU at 25°C (compare blue and red curves in middle panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This implies that loading of cohesin onto chromosomes during the HU arrest at 25°C is insufficient to create efficient cohesion when cells are released from the HU arrest at 35.5°C. Due to Cdk1 activation, Wapl-independent release should be inactive in HU arrested cells but Wapl-dependent release should still take place, as very little Smc3 acetylation occurs during the 45 min HU arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nasmyth, 2017</xref>) and because Wapl can induce release in <italic>eco1</italic> mutants arrested in G2/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To test whether Wapl-dependent release contributes to the lack of cohesion establishment, we introduced the <italic>pds5S81R</italic> mutation, which abolishes Wapl-dependent release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, transient incubation in HU at 25°C in <italic>scc2-4 pdss5S81R</italic> cells greatly ameliorated their cohesion defects following replication at 35.5°C (compare red and blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> right panel). Cohesion was not however restored to the level in <italic>scc2-4 pds5S81R</italic> cells grown only at permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We conclude that when both Wapl- dependent and -independent release mechanisms are inactivated, chromosomal cohesin associated with unreplicated genomes can generate substantial sister chromatid cohesion during S phase in the absence of any further Scc2 activity. This result is consistent with our finding that Scc2 is also not required to convert CMs to CDs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The work described here requires a major re-appraisal of the roles of Wapl and Scc2 in determining the dynamics of cohesin’s association with chromosomes in yeast. First and foremost, Scc2 is not merely a factor that loads cohesin onto chromosomes. In G1 cells lacking Wapl, where chromosomal cohesin does not in fact turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>), release is nevertheless possible but actively suppressed by Scc2. Because it occurs in the absence of Wapl, we refer to cohesin’s dissociation upon Scc2 inactivation during G1 as Wapl-independent release. These findings demonstrate that Scc2 is not merely involved in loading cohesin onto chromosomes but acts long afterwards to prevent release. Previous work with mammalian cells showed that Scc2/Nipbl associates transiently but continuously with chromosomal cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhodes et al., 2017a</xref>). Our work suggests that this association is functionally important.</p><p>Our second key insight is that in G1 cells Wapl merely facilitates an activity associated with the ATPases of tripartite rings that is inhibited by Scc2. In other words, contrary to prevailing opinion, Wapl is not an intrinsic feature of the release mechanism. Releasing activity during G1, that is actively inhibited by Scc2, is a property associated with tripartite Smc1/Smc3/Scc1 rings bound possibly only by Scc3. Both Wapl-dependent and -independent release reactions are accompanied by dissociation of Scc1’s NTD from Smc3’s coiled coil and blocked by fusing Smc3 to Scc1. They are also both abrogated by <italic>smc1D1164E</italic>, which alters how the Smc1 and Smc3 ATPase heads interact. They appear therefore to share a common mechanism, involving transient dissociation of Scc1’s NTD from Smc3’s coiled coil via a process involving cohesin’s Smc1/3 ATPase. One problem in this regard is the suggestion that <italic>smc1D1164E</italic> abolishes release by abolishing cohesin’s ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elbatsh et al., 2016</xref>). If correct and Scc2 did likewise, then one would have to postulate that Scc2 acts as an inhibitor as well as an activator of cohesin’s ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petela et al., 2018</xref>), which is difficult to envisage. Our finding that <italic>smc1D1164E</italic> does not in fact abolish cohesin’s ATPase activity raises the possibility that the mutation in fact abrogates release by some other mechanism, which avoids the above conundrum. How the dissociation of NScc1 from Smc3 is regulated by cohesin’s ATPase heads, how Scc2 blocks this process, and how Wapl somehow overcomes this inhibition are key questions.</p><p>The third insight is the discovery that cohesin’s dynamics are subject to a novel type of cell cycle control. Wapl-independent release is specific to G1 cells and is inactivated as cells undergo S phase, not by Smc3 acetylation but by Clb/Cdk1 activity. Because this regulation does not involve Pds5, Scc2, or Wapl, we suggest that it is mediated by phosphorylation either of Smc-kleisin rings or Scc3. We propose that phosphorylation of cohesin by Cdk1 or another mitotic kinase whose activity depends on Cdk1 as well as acetylation by Eco1 prevent exit gate opening during G2/M. We note that there are similarities between this phenomenon and the recent finding that in the absence of Eso1 (Eco1), Wapl induces loss of cohesion in G2 <italic>S.pombe</italic> cells by a pathway involving de-phosphorylation of Rad21 (Scc1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birot et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in both organisms cohesin phosphorylation may be accompanied by a change in its dynamics. Though similar in this regard, a key difference is that the release regulated by phosphorylation is Wapl-independent in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> but Wapl-dependent in <italic>S.pombe</italic>.</p><p>The fourth insight stems from the very different behaviour of newly synthesised and pre-existing chromosomal cohesin in G2 cells that have been converted to a G1-like state through Cdk1 inhibition. While the former requires Scc2 to remain on chromosomes the latter does not. In other words, chromosomal cohesin retains its ‘G2’ behaviour even when a cell’s cell cycle regulatory network is switched to a low Cdk1, G1-like state. This persistence is analogous to abnormal retention of Smc3 acetylation caused by a failure to cleave Scc1.</p><p>The fifth and last key insight is our discovery that once cohesin has loaded onto chromosomes in the absence of both Wapl-dependent and -independent release, Scc2 becomes dispensable for establishing sister chromatid cohesion. There are two types of explanation for this surprising finding. Either replication forks pass through cohesin rings or they open them up in a manner that either does not lead to dissociation or that is associated with an extremely rapid Scc2 independent re-association, albeit with both sister DNAs. The on rate for cohesin loading onto chromosomes de novo is approximately 33 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). If the kinetics of re-association at forks obeyed the same rules, then it would be impossible for displaced cohesin to re-associate before it had diffused far away. Thus, if displacement at forks does take place, the kinetics of re-association must be very different to those that normally apply to nucleoplasmic cohesin.</p><p>Though our findings do not exclude the possibility that a Scc2 dependent pathway involving entrapment of single stranded DNA associated with lagging strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murayama et al., 2018</xref>) co-exists with the Scc2 independent one, they are inconsistent with the claim that the former is essential. On the other hand, the finding that cohesin loading in mammalian cells is dependent on Mcm2-7 during S phase but not during telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) may be pertinent to our finding that entrapment of leading or lagging strands during DNA replication differs from the process of DNA entrapment at other stages of the yeast cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(Species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th>Source <break/>Or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3 GAL psi+</italic> <break/><italic>All following strains are based on this background</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K699</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials andmethods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae MATa scc2-4 SCC1-PK9 TETR-GFP::LEU2 TET Os::URA3 trp1:MET3p-CDC20::TRP1</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K15028</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials andmethods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae Mata trp1:smc3(E1155Q)-PK6::TRP1</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K17409</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials and methods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae Mata SCC1-PK9::KAN MX rad61Δ::HGH MX leu2::Gal1p-Sic1(9 m)/His3p-Gal1/His3p-Gal2/Gal1p-Gal4 (single copy)</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K20891</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials and methods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>S. cerevisiae Mat a MATa SCC1-PK9::KanMX rad61Δ::HGH MX smc3(R1008I)::HIS3 scc2-45::NAT MX (L545P D575G) leu2::Gal1p-Sic1(9 m)/His3p-Gal1/His3p-Gal2/Gal1p-Gal4(single copy)</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K22294</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials andmethods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>S. cerevisiae Mat a MATa SCC1-PK9::KanMX rad61Δ::HGH MX smc3(R1008I)::HIS3 leu2::Gal1p-Sic1(9 m)/His3p-Gal1/His3p-Gal2/Gal1p-Gal4(single copy)</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K22296</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials andmethods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae MATa eco1Δ::NatMX4 rad61Δ::HGH MX scc2-45::NAT MX (L545P D575G) Smc3(E199A/R1008I)::HIS37.5 kb minichromosome (TRP1 ARS1 CEN1-6KB)</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K22297</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials and <break/>methods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae MATa eco1Δ::NatMX4 rad61Δ::HGH MX Smc3(E199A/R1008I)::HIS3 7.5 kb minichromosome (TRP1 ARS1 CEN1-6KB)</italic></td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"><bold>K22298</bold></td><td valign="top">Materials andmethods subsection experimental models</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae MATa scc1(A547C)-PK6::KanMX smc3(E570C,S1043C)::ADE2 smc1(G22C,K639C)::NatMX2.3 kb Trp1-ARS1-Cen4 plasmid</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al.

Briefly, 10–100 ng of fragmented DNA was converted to blunt ends by end repair before ligation of the Ion Xpress Barcode Adaptors. Fragments of 300 bp were then selected using E-Gel SizeSelect2% agarose gels (Life Technologies) and amplified with 6–8 PCR cycles. The DNA concentration was then determined by qPCR using Ion Torrent DNA standards (Kapa Biosystems) as a reference. 12–16 libraries with different barcodes could then be pooled together to a final concentration of 350 pM and loaded onto the Ion PI V3 Chip (Life Technologies) using the Ion Chef (Life Technologies). Sequencing was then completed on the Ion Torrent Proton (Life Technologies), typically producing 6–10 million reads per library with an average read length of 190 bp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data analysis, alignment and production of BigWigs</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, data analysis was performed on the Galaxy platform. Quality of reads was assessed using FastQC (Galaxy tool version 1.0.0) and trimmed as required using ‘trim sequences’ (Galaxy tool version 1.0.0). Generally, this involved removing the first 10 bases and any bases after the 200<sup>th</sup>, but trimming more or fewer bases may be required to ensure the removal of kmers and that the per-base sequence content is equal across the reads. Reads shorter than 50 bp were removed using Filter FASTQ (Galaxy tool version 1.0.0, minimum size: 50, maximum size: 0, minimum quality: 0, maximum quality: 0, maximum number of bases allowed outside of quality range: 0, paired end data: false) and the remaining reads aligned to the necessary genome(s) using Bowtie2 (Galaxy tool version 0.2) with the default (--sensitive) parameters (mate paired: single-end, write unaligned reads to separate file: true, reference genome: SacCer3 or CanGla, specify read group: false, parameter settings: full parameter list, type of alignment: end to end, preset option: sensitive, disallow gaps within <italic>n-</italic>positions of read: 4, trim <italic>n</italic>-bases from 5’ of each read: 0, number of reads to be aligned: 0, strand directions: both, log mapping time: false).</p><p>To generate alignments of reads that uniquely align to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, the reads were first aligned to the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (CBS138, genolevures) genome with the unaligned reads saved as a separate file. These reads that could not be aligned to the <italic>C. glabrata</italic> genome were then aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (sacCer3, SGD) genome and the resulting BAM file converted to BigWig (Galaxy tool version 0.1.0) for visualisation. Similarly, this process was done with the order of genomes reversed to produce alignments of reads that uniquely align to <italic>C. glabrata</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Visualisation of ChIP-seq profiles</title><p>The resulting BigWigs were visualised using the IGB browser. To normalise the data to show quantitative ChIP signal the track was multiplied by the samples’ occupancy ratio (OR) and normalised to 1 million reads using the graph multiply function. In order to calculate the average occupancy at each base pair up to 60 kb around all 16 centromeres, the BAM file that contains reads uniquely aligning to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was separated into files for each chromosome using ‘Filter SAM or BAM’ (Galaxy tool version 1.1.0). A pileup of each chromosome was then obtained using samtools mpileup (Galaxy tool version 0.0.1) (source for reference list: locally cached, reference genome: SacCer3, genotype likelihood computation: false, advanced options: basic). These files were then amended using our own script (chr_position.py) to assign all unrepresented genome positions a value of 0. Each pileup was then filtered using another in-house script (filter.py) to obtain the number of reads at each base pair within up to 60 kb intervals either side of the centromeric CDEIII elements of each chromosome. The number of reads covering each site as one successively moves away from these CDEIII elements could then be averaged across all 16 chromosomes and calibrated by multiplying by the samples’ OR and normalizing to 1 million reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cohesin tetramer and Scc2 purification</title><p>All versions of the cohesin complexes purified bear a twin StrepII tag on the Scc1 kleisin. This is the same for the Scc2 construct used in this study except the later bears a single Strep-II tag. Typically 500 ml of SF-9 insect cells were grown to ∼3 million/ml and infected with the appropriate baculovirus stock in a 1/100 dilution. Infection was monitored daily and cells harvested when lethality (assayed by the trypan blue test) reached no more than 70–80%. Cell pellets were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C. Upon thawing, the pellets were suspended in a final volume of ∼65–70 ml with Buffer A (final concentrations of: 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, NaCl 150 mM, TCEP-HCl 1 mM and Glycerol 10%) and the suspension was immediately supplemented with two dissolved tablets of Roche Complete Protease (EDTA-free), 75 μg of RNase I and 7 μl of DNaseI (Roche, of 10 U/μl stock). The cells were then sonicated at 80% amplitude for 5 s/burst/35 ml of suspension using a Sonics Vibra-Cell (3 mm microtip). In total, 12 bursts were given for every 35 ml half of the 70 ml suspension (the sonication was always performed in ethanolised ice). A spin at 235,000 x g (45,000 rpm on a Ti45 fixed angle rotor) followed for 45 mins following addition of PMSF to 1 mM final concentration. The isolated cleared extract was supplemented with 2 mM EDTA and was then used to load a 2 × 5 ml StrepTrap HP (Fisher Scientific) column at 1 ml/min in an ÄKTA Purifier 100. Wash with Buffer A at 1 ml/min to the point of ΔΑU<sub>280nm</sub>∼0 and protein elution ensued using Buffer A + 20 mM desthiobiotin (Fisher Scientific) at 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were analysed using SDS-PAGE and were further purified in a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 (VWR) using Buffer A as running buffer (free of EDTA/PMSF). The resulting peaks were again analysed using SDS-PAGE and the concentration was determined in Nanodrop using A280.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Scc2 counteracts a Wapl-independent activity that releases cohesin from chromosomes in G1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hongtao Yu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper by Srinivasan et al. addresses the role of Scc2, a component of the cohesion of sister chromatids in cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that Scc2 is required for cohesin loading, and that there is a single pathway involving Wap1 for cohesin unloading. The current paper suggests that Scc2 is also required for maintenance of cohesin binding to chromosomes in G1 phase by preventing release in a Wapl-independent manner. The authors show that this release mechanism does require loop opening of the Smc3/Scc1 interface and the Smc1 ATPase activity. The studies raise key issues about the role of Wapl in release. The Scc2 prevention of the Wapl-independent release is cell cycle regulated and is affected by Cyclin-Cdk1 activity. The authors also suggest that once cohesin is loaded (for example in G2 and inherited into a G1-like state), Scc2 is no longer required for cohesion in a subsequent S phase. This may well be the case, but a key finding needs attention (see major point below).</p><p>The paper certainly raises a number of interesting points about the control of both loading and removing cohesin and the roles of key players such as Scc2 and Wapl. However, as it is currently presented, the manuscript is only accessible to a few experts in the field. For the general readership, following even the most basic experiments is difficult to read. A revised paper would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript tends to disregard some major effects of the mutants used, which the authors deem less relevant. For example, cohesin in the <italic>scc2-45</italic> mutant has already lost the vast majority of its chromosomal association even at permissive temperature (Figure 1B, D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). The Smc3-Scc1 fusion by itself renders cells temperature-sensitive. Furthermore, the authors use different mutant alleles for different experiments without apparent reason (e.g. <italic>scc2-45</italic> or <italic>scc2-4, scc3K404E</italic> or <italic>pds5S81R</italic>). We therefore consider that the authors:</p><p>a) show absolute ChIP-seq binding profiles for each experiment (as in Figure 1D) instead of relative binding profiles (as, for example, in Figure 1E-H), which will reveal effects of the different mutations on cohesin binding in comparison to 'real' wild-type cells. This would, for example, reveal whether fusion of Scc2 to the AID tag reduces cohesin binding in the absence of auxin in a similar manner as the <italic>scc2-45</italic> mutation does.</p><p>b) probe for the steady-state levels of mutant proteins under permissive and ts conditions in each experiment (e.g. Figure 1B-E, 2A: Scc2 and Scc4, Figure 2B: Pds5 and Scc2, Figure 2C: Smc3-Scc1 and Scc2, Figure 6E and G: Scc2). This is important since, for example, Scc4 is a constitutive binding partner of Scc2 and has been reported to be required for the stability the latter (Watrin et al., 2006). One would expect that <italic>scc4-4</italic> inactivation would indirectly reduce Scc2 levels, which, however, doesn't seem to be obvious from ChIP-seq profiles (Figure 2A).</p><p>2) At this point, the evidence that Wapl-independent cohesin release also occurs through opening of the Smc3-Scc1 interface is very limited and should be substantiated further with assays that directly probe for Scc1-N release (such as performed previously by the same group; Beckouet et al., 2016). This is particularly important, since half of the Smc3-Scc1 fusion protein is lost from pericentromeric regions after the temperature shift regardless of <italic>scc2-4</italic>/SCC2 status, which raises concerns about the interpretation of the fusion protein experiments.</p><p>3) The authors introduce a new mutation in Smc3 (R1008I) that allows the maintenance of <italic>scc2-45</italic> mutants in the absence of Wapl and note that the mechanistic effect of this mutation will be presented elsewhere. Since many conclusions are based on this mutant combination, it will be essential that the authors explain the effect of this mutation. Alternatively, the authors could use the SCC2-3XmAID degron version for most experiments, which doesn't depend on the <italic>smc3R1008I</italic> background and, unlike the <italic>scc2-45</italic> mutant, might not have a cohesin loading defect in the absence of auxin (see comment 1a).</p><p>4) The conclusion that Scc2 inactivation has 'only a modest effect on <italic>smc3T1185M</italic>' doesn't seem to match the massive reduction of cohesin at centromeric and pericentric regions (Figure 2E). The same is true for Scc2 inactivation in <italic>scc3K404E</italic> (Figure 4B) or <italic>cdc45</italic> (Figure 4E) cells. The authors seem to largely play down these differences at centromeres and pericentromeres and instead focus their discussion on cohesin at chromosome arm regions (e.g. '…at least along chromosome arms, which represents the majority of chromosomal cohesin'). However, Figure 1D clearly shows that most cohesin is present at centromeric and pericentromeric regions. The differences observed in these regions upon Scc2 inactivation might very well be significant and cannot be explained by a simple release mechanism.</p><p>5) Figure 6E and subsection “Scc2 is not required during S phase to establish sister chromatid cohesion”. Is it possible that the CM produced in the previous G2 period are then partially replicated and the CD that appear are a result of concatenation of the DNA rather than cohesion? They would still have cohesin associated with the CM and a second replicated DNA could remain associated by catenation of the DNA. In fact, the authors note the incomplete replication (Figure 6C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44736.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript tends to disregard some major effects of the mutants used, which the authors deem less relevant.

This is not surprising since almost all conditional mutants are defective under so called permissive conditions. We did not point it out in the previous version of the manuscript as we do not believe it compromises their utility. By providing the absolute profiles, the revised manuscript makes this point clearer without readers having to analyse the raw data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) probe for the steady-state levels of mutant proteins under permissive and ts conditions in each experiment (e.g. Figure 1B-E, 2A: Scc2 and Scc4, Figure 2B: Pds5 and Scc2, Figure 2C: Smc3-Scc1 and Scc2, Figure 6E and G: Scc2).

We cannot probe the steady-state levels and the fate of <italic>scc2-45</italic> protein upon temperature shift. It seems irrelevant whether or not Scc2-45 protein disappears or not upon shift to 37°C. The purpose of the shift is to inactivate the protein. Whether this is accompanied by degradation is not really relevant. However, we have good reason to believe that the mutant protein is not destroyed by the temperature shift as unpublished experiments show that re-loading can be rapidly induced by returning cells to the permissive temperature.</p><p>Under the conditions we use in late G1 cells, Scc4 inactivation does not affect Scc2 levels.

Using in vivo crosslinking, we now show that depletion of Scc2 in a wapl deletion strain releases the NScc1 that remains associated with Smc3. Please see Figure 4D, E and F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors introduce a new mutation in Smc3 (R1008I) that allows the maintenance of scc2-45 mutants in the absence of Wapl and note that the mechanistic effect of this mutation will be presented elsewhere.

We have used the <italic>smc3R1008I</italic> mutant only in one experiment described currently in Figure 2C and D. This was done to show the G1 release in <italic>scc2-45 wpl1</italic> deletion double mutant strains. The mutant has not been used in any other experiment described. We currently do not understand how R1008I suppresses the growth defect caused by <italic>wpl1</italic> deletion in <italic>scc2-45</italic> cells. The key point is that it does not do so by restoring cohesin release that is abolished by <italic>wpl1</italic> deletion. We use it as a tool to address a question. We have modified the statement to explicitly state that we do not understand how R1008I works and that it was used as a tool in just the one experiment. As already pointed out, the Scc2-3XAID is not a particularly useful alternative solution as this allele like <italic>scc2-45</italic> is partially defective in loading even under permissive conditions. The <italic>scc2-45</italic> allele has the huge advantage that its inactivation is clearly vary rapid indeed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that Scc2 inactivation has 'only a modest effect on smc3T1185M' doesn't seem to match the massive reduction of cohesin at centromeric and pericentric regions (Figure 2E). The same is true for Scc2 inactivation in scc3K404E (Figure 4B) or cdc45 (Figure 4E) cells. The authors seem to largely play down these differences at centromeres and pericentromeres and instead focus their discussion on cohesin at chromosome arm regions (e.g. '…at least along chromosome arms, which represents the majority of chromosomal cohesin'). However, Figure 1D clearly shows that most cohesin is present at centromeric and pericentromeric regions. The differences observed in these regions upon Scc2 inactivation might very well be significant and cannot be explained by a simple release mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We play down the effect on peri-centric cohesin for the very good reason that it represents only a minor fraction of the chromosomal cohesin pool. In the case of chromosome IV it represents less than 10%. We currently have no idea why we see differential effects on peri-centric and arm cohesin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6E and subsection “Scc2 is not required during S phase to establish sister chromatid cohesion”.

In fact, the authors note the incomplete replication (Figure 6C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point! We have addressed this and presented the data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1D along with a cartoon. We have excluded the possibility that DNA catenation was holding the re-replicated sister DNAs by showing that the SDS resistant CDs produced by re-replication are dependent on covalent circularization of cohesin with BMOE cross-linking. If under the same conditions cohesin remained un-crosslinked, no SDS resistant species other than the supercoiled min-chromosome monomer was detected. This rules out DNA catenation as a factor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
