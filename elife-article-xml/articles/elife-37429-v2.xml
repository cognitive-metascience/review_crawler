reciprocal extrinsic signalling between the distal mesenchyme and the overlying epithelium (e-m signalling). However, by grafting distal mesenchyme cells from late stage chick wing buds to the epithelial environment of younger wing buds, we show that this mechanism is not required. RNA sequencing reveals that distal mesenchyme cells complete proliferative outgrowth by an intrinsic cell cycle timer in the presence of e-m signalling. In this process, e-m signalling is required permissively to allow the intrinsic cell cycle timer to run its course. We provide evidence that a temporal switch from BMP antagonism to BMP signalling controls the intrinsic cell cycle timer during limb outgrowth. Our findings have general implications for other patterning systems in which extrinsic signals and intrinsic timers are integrated.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>limb</kwd><kwd>timing</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202756/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Constance A</given-names></name><name><surname>Stainton</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Chinnaiya</surname><given-names>Kavitha</given-names></name><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Spanish Ministerio de Economia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-88265- P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aceituno</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Saiz-Lopez</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name><name><surname>Ros</surname><given-names>Marian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Size control in limbs is an intrinsically determined process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Detailed models of pattern formation often involve cells being informed of their position in the embryo by interpreting gradients of extrinsic signals, or by measuring intrinsic time. Recently, it has become evident that both processes can operate together - either in parallel, such as in antero-posterior patterning of the limb (thumb to little finger) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Towers et al., 2011</xref>) and in dorso-ventral patterning of the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dessaud et al., 2007</xref>) - or sequentially, such as in proximo-distal patterning of the limb (shoulder to finger tips) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roselló-Díez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, understanding the precise requirement for extrinsic signals and intrinsic time in pattern formation is a challenging task. In addition, little is known about how these mechanisms operate together to terminate growth following pattern formation.</p><p>During early stages of proximo-distal patterning of the chick wing (stage Hamburger Hamilton HH19 – see Materials and methods for embryonic days), signals from the main body of the embryo specify proximal identity (humerus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mercader et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mercader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roselló-Díez et al., 2011</xref>). Once distal mesenchyme cells of the wing bud are displaced by growth away from proximal signals, there is a switch to an intrinsic timing mechanism that specifies distal identity (elbow to digits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). This intrinsic timer involves cells executing a programme of proliferation, expressing regulators of distal position (i.e. <italic>Hoxa13</italic>) and altering their cell surface properties, which are considered to encode position along the proximo-distal axis. In addition, distal limb bud mesenchyme cells produce a factor that maintains the overlying apical ectodermal ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zwilling and Hansborough, 1956</xref>) - a thickening of the distal epithelium, which is required for bud outgrowth until HH29/30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saunders, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Summerbell, 1974</xref>). This factor is the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist Gremlin1 (Grem1), which maintains expression of genes encoding Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) in the apical ectodermal ridge until HH27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Merino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pizette and Niswander, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zúñiga et al., 1999</xref>). Reciprocal signalling between the apical ectodermal ridge and the underlying mesenchyme is considered to maintain outgrowth, first by repressing apoptosis, and then by permissively maintaining cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dudley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the breakdown of the epithelial-mesenchyme (e-m signalling) feedback loop at HH27, and the subsequent loss of apical ectodermal ridge signalling, is considered necessary to terminate limb bud outgrowth at the end of the patterning phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zwilling and Hansborough, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scherz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verheyden and Sun, 2008</xref>). Note that the final distal phalanx is laid down at around HH28 in the chick wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saunders, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Summerbell, 1974</xref>). This could suggest that a switch from an intrinsic timer in the mesenchyme back to extrinsic signalling by the apical ectodermal ridge occurs at later stages of proximo-distal patterning to terminate outgrowth. Later growth of the limb after the apical ectodermal ridge has regressed is caused by the expansion of osteogenic progenitor cells in the developing long bones.</p><p>However, we recently showed that grafts of HH27 mesenchyme cells expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) that were made to younger HH20 buds, and which were left to develop for 24 hr until HH24 (now referred to as HH24 graft or HH24g), completed their proliferation programme in the presence of an overlying host apical ectodermal ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>) red lines - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, compare similar trajectories between HH27 to HH29 of normal development – black lines). Thus, HH24g mesenchyme (distal 150 microns of graft) has a similar cell cycle profile to HH29 mesenchyme (stage of donor limb), rather than contralateral HH24 mesenchyme (stage of host – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> - red lines). Although wing buds that develop with these grafts produce the three main segments of the wing, the autopod (digits and wrist) is very stunted due to the reduced growth of the grafted tissue relative to host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, an interpretation of these findings is that proliferative outgrowth terminates intrinsically in the distal mesenchyme (curved arrows in graft in green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) independently of e-m signalling (arrows between ridge and mesenchyme, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). An alternative possibility is that extrinsic e-m signalling had irreversibly broken down in donor tissue at the time of grafting and causes loss of proliferation in the graft (arrows absent in HH27 wing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37429.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell cycle and RNA-seq analyses of chick wing distal tips.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Decline in cell cycle rate determined by proportions of cells in G1-, S- and G2/M-phases between HH20 and HH30 in the distal chick wing bud (black lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>).

To achieve this, we performed RNA-seq on pooled blocks of distal cells from HH24, HH24g, HH27 and HH29 chick wing buds (three replicates of 12 blocks taken from distal tissue excluding the polarizing region– note one HH24 sample failed quality control - see Materials and methods). The region of undifferentiated mesenchyme is considered to extend proximally beneath the apical ectodermal ridge by 200 – 300 microns and to remain at a consistent length throughout outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Summerbell et al., 1973</xref>), but for our analyses, we used RNA extracted from the distal 150 microns of control buds and grafts to ensure consistency between all samples. We compared HH24g with contralateral HH24 datasets and HH24g with HH29 datasets (the stage the graft would have developed to if left in situ in the donor wing). This identified 154 genes that are differentially expressed (&gt;2 fold difference at a p-value of &lt;0.0005) between the two comparisons: 55 genes between the HH24g-HH24 pair and 99 genes between the HH24g-HH29 pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). Pearson correlation of the normalised data reveals that overall gene expression levels in HH24g distal cells are closer to HH24 than to HH29 cells, suggesting a good degree of resetting behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This is unexpected considering the idea that older mesenchyme cells maintain both their proliferative and patterning potential when grafted to a younger bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We performed KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses to identify up- and down-regulated pathways between the two pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> - the pathways identified were those that contained two or more genes at a &gt;2 fold difference at a p-value of 0.05 – it should be noted that this analysis is limited since only approximately 20% of chicken genes belong to verified KEGG pathways). There are five down-regulated pathways identified by the KEGG analyses in HH24g compared to HH29 distal cells - focal adhesion, ECM (extracellular matrix), gap junction, MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) and actin cytoskeleton - suggesting a general reset of genes in these pathways that increase in expression over time between HH24 and HH29. In addition, there are four up-regulated pathways identified by the KEGG analyses in HH24g compared to HH24 distal cells - ECM, focal adhesion, adrenergic signalling, TGFβ Transforming Growth Factor Beta) - suggesting maintained expression of genes in these pathways that generally increase in expression over time. In addition, the MAPK pathway is also up-regulated in HH24g compared to HH29 distal cells, showing the complex nature of this signalling pathway, and suggesting some genes in this pathway that decrease in expression over time can be reset. Interestingly, pathways represented by genes whose decrease in expression over time is maintained in HH24g distal cells were not found.</p><p>To identify genes that share similar behaviour across the two pairwise contrasts, we performed hierarchical clustering analyses of the 154 genes significantly altered in expression between the HH24g/HH24 and HH24g/HH29 datasets. This divided the genes into three clusters (See Materials and methods – note three genes were excluded that fell into more than one cluster). Cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) contains 54 genes that increase in expression between HH24 and HH29 during normal development (black line) and are maintained in HH24g distal cells (maintain a &gt;2 fold increase in expression compared to equivalent area in contralateral HH24 buds – red line). Cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) contains 44 genes that normally increase in expression between HH24 and HH29 (black line) and are not maintained in HH24g distal cells (&gt;2 fold decrease in expression compared to HH29 buds - red line). Cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) contains 53 genes that decrease in expression between HH24 and HH29 (black line) and are reset in HH24g grafts (&gt;2 fold increase in expression compared to HH29 buds - red line). Thus, genes in cluster one reflect stability of expression while genes in clusters 2 and 3 show reversibility of expression. In consensus with the KEGG analyses, a cluster containing genes whose decrease in expression over time is maintained in HH24g distal cells was not found, indicating that the young environment potently reactivates gene expression. These data suggest that many genes that are preferentially expressed during early stages of wing development can be reset to some degree (Cluster 3). However, later expressed genes show differential resetting behaviour in an earlier environment (Clusters 1 and 2).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Bmp2/4/7</italic> expression is maintained in HH24g mesenchyme</title><p>To identify signalling pathways associated with the maintenance of cell cycle timing in HH24g mesenchyme, we analysed the KEGG and clustering analyses for pathways/genes predominantly active at late stages of development, and that are maintained in distal mesenchyme transplanted to an earlier environment.

Our data reveals that the duration of mesenchyme cell proliferation is intrinsically determined but requires permissive signals from the apical ectodermal ridge: a distinction not recognized in previous approaches. For instance, surgical removal of the apical ectodermal ridge in the chick wing before HH24 causes apoptosis in the distal mesenchyme, but at later stages decreases proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dudley et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, genetic approaches that compromise apical ectodermal ridge signalling in the mouse limb also cause defective outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mariani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu and Ornitz, 2008</xref>). The fact that mesenchyme expansion was naturally inhibited in these experiments therefore masked the intrinsic control of proliferation in this tissue.</p><p>A schematic detailing the relationship between e-m signalling and mesenchyme proliferation during normal wing outgrowth is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. At early stages of wing development (HH20), the Grem1-mediated inhibition of BMP signalling fulfils two main roles: to maintain the apical ectodermal ridge until HH28 as classically-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Summerbell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Summerbell et al., 1973</xref>) and to permit a rapid rate of proliferation in distal mesenchyme cells as we have shown here. Around HH20, the mechanism of positional specification switches in mesenchyme progenitors from extrinsic signalling (humerus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roselló-Díez et al., 2011</xref>) to an intrinsic timer (distal to elbow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>). This intrinsic mechanism involves a progressive reduction in the proliferation rate as the elements are laid down in a proximal to distal sequence until HH28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Here, we showed that the deceleration in proliferation rate is caused by an increase in autocrine BMP signalling between HH24 and HH29 that overcomes Grem1-mediated antagonism in distal mesenchyme cells. Once the intrinsic cell cycle timer has run its course at HH29 and distal mesenchyme expansion ceases, high BMP signalling causes the apical ectodermal ridge to regress at HH29/30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

A statistical analysis using an adjusted p-value&lt;0.0005 and a fold-change &gt;2 identified 151 genes as differentially expressed in the two contrasts evaluated. Gene clusters were identified from the set of 151 unique genes that were differentially expressed in at least one of the statistical comparisons. The evaluation considered between two and 35 clusters using hierarchical, <italic>k</italic>-means, and PAM clustering methods based on the internal, stability and biological metrics provided from the clValid R package. The majority of internal validation and stability metrics indicated that either the lowest possible number or conversely the highest number evaluated were preferable. The metrics giving more nuanced information in the intermediate range were the Silhouette measure, and the Biological Homogeneity Index (BHI). Based on manual inspection, it was decided to use hierarchical clustering with <italic>k</italic> = 3 gene clusters, which showed favourable properties for both these measures. For KEGG pathway analyses, significant genes with adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 and fold-change &gt;= 2 from each comparison were analysed for enrichment of KEGG pathway membership using a hypergeometric test. Enrichment (p&lt;0.05) was assessed for up and down-regulated genes separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Apoptosis analyses</title><p>Chick wing buds were dissected in PBS and transferred to Lysotracker (Life Technologies, L-7528) PBS solution (1:1000) in the dark.

For this purpose, they performed RNA-seq of distal cells from HH24, HH27, HH29 wing buds as well as HH24g (grafts of old mesenchyme cells (HH27) to early HH20 wing buds, which is left until HH24). RNA-seq analyses revealed that, in HH24g, Bmp2/4/7 expression is maintained, whereas FGF and Grem1 expression is reset. Based on these results, authors draw conclusions that the mesenchyme cells terminate growth by an intrinsic cell cycle timer in the presence of e-m signalling. While the results are interesting, many changes are required to bring the manuscript to publishable form. Most critical is to perform further functional experiments to test the role of genes identified by RNA-seq to validate the model.

The &quot;young&quot; AER-FGF signal over the graft has no effect on the cell cycle – hence it is permissive.

Sall1 and Sall3 contribute to the autopod development, by competing with Hoxa13-d13 for a target sequence in the EphA4 upstream region.

For this purpose, they performed RNA-seq of distal cells from HH24, HH27, HH29 wing buds as well as HH24g (grafts of old mesenchyme cells (HH27) to early HH20 wing buds, which is left until HH24). RNA-seq analyses revealed that, in HH24g, Bmp2/4/7 expression is maintained, whereas FGF and Grem1 expression is reset. Based on these results, authors draw conclusions that the mesenchyme cells terminate growth by an intrinsic cell cycle timer in the presence of e-m signalling. While the results are interesting, many changes are required to bring the manuscript to publishable form. Most critical is to perform further functional experiments to test the role of genes identified by RNA-seq to validate the model. It would also be critical to provide evidence that the permissive signals from the AER is required for the duration of mesenchyme cell proliferation. The major issues raised by the reviewers are listed below. If you think you can make these changes in 2-3 months, we would be willing to entertain a revised version of the manuscript.
