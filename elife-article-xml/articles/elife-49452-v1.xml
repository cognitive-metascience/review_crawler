This flexibility is well-recognised in the diploid life stage, where a complex multicellular organism can generate adaptive plasticity in behaviour, morphology and physiology. However, far less is known about what plastic adaptive responses are possible at the seemingly simple unicellular gamete stage, when environmental variation can be profound. We therefore assessed whether males and females can adaptively vary sperm and egg function through gametogenesis in anticipation of impending functional environment.</p><p>Although sperm and eggs have universal primary roles that are vital for reproductive success, how they achieve these and the environments in which they must succeed can fluctuate considerably, both biotically and abiotically. Sperm almost always operate after ejaculation and release in a non-self and demanding environment, either within the female reproductive tract or through external fertilisation, and many factors that directly influence sperm function can vary profoundly across these environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pitnick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reinhardt et al., 2015</xref>). Ova face a similarly challenging set of biotic and abiotic variables, especially in the many species that are oviparous where zygotes and embryos develop in eggs to hatch in the natural environment outside the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hinton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbert, 2010</xref>). These intrinsically variable environments for gamete function could lead to selection for adaptive plasticity, allowing males and females to improve their reproductive fitness by matching sperm and egg phenotypes through development in anticipation of different fertilisation and embryogenesis environments.</p><p>One of the most important abiotic environmental variables is temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cossins and Bowler, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angilletta Jr., 2009</xref>), especially in the context of climate change when thermal environments are expected to both warm and become much variable and extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perkins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Raftery et al., 2017</xref>). Thermal variation has profound impacts on living systems, and numerous examples of adaptive plastic responses to temperature variability have been described, from acclimated mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pichaud et al., 2010</xref>) and sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Warner and Shine, 2008</xref>), up to complex shifts in behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pateman et al., 2012</xref>) and phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Walther et al., 2002</xref>). Temperature also influences gamete function across a number of levels, with sperm production and function being especially sensitive to warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Setchell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sales et al., 2018</xref>) and egg development being directly influenced by thermal regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gillooly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gillooly et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we therefore use a combination of experimental approaches (overview on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to examine whether males and females adaptively vary sperm and egg biology through gametogenesis at different temperatures, in anticipation of varying thermal environments for fertilisation and reproduction. We test for this potential in the flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> which, like most sexually reproducing animals, is both ectothermic and oviparous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sokoloff, 1974</xref>), and in which spermatozoal sensitivity to temperature is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sales et al., 2018</xref>). After exposing adult males and females and their gametes to different temperatures, we compare sperm and egg development and reproductive function within thermal regimes that mimic the increasingly variable conditions faced by warmer tropical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perkins et al., 2012</xref>). We find that thermal regime regulates gamete size development: in the short-term, as the developmental environment warms, eggs get larger and sperm become smaller. Having established these opposing male-versus-female responses, we use reciprocal transplant experiments to measure whether adaptive gamete plasticity exists. We find that warmer reproductive environments present challenges for reproduction. However, gamete plasticity enabled significant improvements in reproductive performance. Our findings reveal a potentially important route by which ectothermic populations can buffer their reproductive output against increasingly stressful and unpredictable temperature fluctuations under climate change.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49452.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>Overview of experiments investigating thermal adaptation and plasticity in sperm and egg biology and its adaptive significance.

To test for the adaptive value of any functional plasticity, the performance of sperm from males of the same ancestral KSS population reared from pupation at either 30°C or 38°C was tracked by comparing the total number of offspring sired across 100 days of oviposition by KSS females at either 30°C or 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), by which time all females in the experiment had exhausted their viable sperm stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Michalczyk et al., 2010</xref>) and ceased to produce offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Reproduction was generally sensitive to the proximal thermal environment, with on average 299 (± 20.8, mean ± s.e.m.) offspring eclosing at 30°C, compared with 135 (± 10.3, mean ± s.e.m.) at 38°C (<italic>β</italic> = −5.8, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,104</sub> = 69.8, p&lt;0.001). Despite these overall differences, it was clear that the thermal regime in which sperm production and insemination took place also gave individual males a reproductive advantage when matched to the same thermal environment for fertilisation and offspring development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Indeed, the interaction between spermatogenesis temperature (sperm production) and offspring production temperature was highly significant (<italic>β</italic> = 7.5, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,104</sub> = 29.6, p&lt;0.001), while the main effect of male treatment was not significant (<italic>β</italic> = 0.7, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,104</sub> = 1.1, p=0.290). Sperm from males exposed as pupae and maturing adults to 30°C achieved greater reproductive success in the 30°C reproductive environment than sperm from males that completed development at 38°C. By contrast, in the 38°C reproductive environment sperm produced by males in the 38°C treatment achieved double the reproductive success compared with sperm from males developed through the 30°C treatment. Across 100 days of oviposition in the 30°C reproductive environment, males reared at 30°C sired an average of 349 (± 29.1, mean ± s.e.m.) offspring, while males reared at 38°C sired 249 (± 27.1, mean ± s.e.m.) offspring. Using the same protocols in the 38°C reproductive environment, males reared at 38°C sired 180 (± 12, mean ± s.e.m. offspring), while males reared at 30°C sired only 91 (± 12, mean ± s.e.m.) offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Exploration of the temporal patterns of these effects showed a clear decline in reproduction across consecutive 10-day blocks, and that sperm matched to the fertilisation and development temperature consistently outperformed sperm that were thermally mismatched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Our model comparison based on AIC values confirmed that the interaction between male rearing temperature and fertilisation temperature was important: the best model included the main effects of male temperature, offspring temperature and time, and the interaction between male and offspring temperature for both parts of the model, and additionally the interaction between rearing temperature and time for the zero-inflation model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49452.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Adaptive thermal plasticity in sperm.</title><p>Reproductive output of ancestral KSS males following a 24 hr mating bout with a single female.

Such variation will directly influence important elements within the sperm storage and fertilisation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pitnick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reinhardt et al., 2015</xref>), including biophysical properties of fluids and membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kupriyanova and Havenhand, 2005</xref>), mitochondrial metabolic sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sokolova, 2018</xref>), flagellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Humphries, 2013</xref>) and haplotype integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paul et al., 2008</xref>). Our transplant experiments reveal obvious challenges for gamete performance in warmer environments, with an overall halving of reproductive output when sperm and eggs are challenged to function at 38°C versus 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Interestingly, between-line variance in sperm length also increased when males were forced to develop sperm at 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>), possibly indicating a response to thermal stress at the higher temperature.</p><p>Although we found evidence that laboratory selection across 54 generations at 38°C caused the overall evolution of ~4% longer sperm compared with the thermal line selection at 30°C, our within-generation experiments revealed consistent ~7% reductions in sperm length for all populations when produced through the warmer 38°C regime compared with 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The different sperm length responses to experimental evolution versus within-generation plasticity under different temperatures is puzzling, and may have arisen through indirect selection acting on the thermal lines for ~five years, given that the 38°C thermal selection lines showed generally longer sperm at both 30°C and 38°C rearing temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Recent work examining sperm length evolution in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> revealed that a history of heightened sexual selection led to the evolution of longer sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>), so one possibility is that increased metabolic and developmental rates in the 38°C regime had elevated mating activity, and therefore promoted male-male competition and selection for increased sperm length. However, our current results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and past findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sales et al., 2018</xref>) indicate that warmer conditions generally reduce male reproductive fitness, and we find no evidence that operational sex ratios have deviated between our 30°C or 38°C selection line regimes, with both showing an average adult sex ratio of 50% (54 adults randomly sampled from six lines per regime: 30°C regime male ratios = 0.52, 0.46, 0.50, 0.52, 0.48, 0.52; 38°C regime male ratios = 0.50, 0.59, 0.48, 0.48, 0.52, 0.43); offspring sex ratios are also not changed following male exposure to 42°C heatwaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sales, 2019</xref>). Another possible explanation is that increased developmental rate at 38°C has hastened sperm ageing, leading to correlated changes in length. However, <italic>T. castaneum</italic> is a relatively long-lived insect, with adult males showing no change in fertility even after one year of lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Godwin, 2016</xref>), so reproductive ageing differences over the few days of the sperm length assays conducted here are unlikely to explain the overall sperm length increases in the thermal selection lines at 38°C. Another developmental possibility is that elevated spermatogenic rates at 38°C leads to the production of smaller cells, and longer-term selection has compensated for this reduction in sperm cell size within warmer regimes to evolve longer sperm. There is some evidence for longer-sperm advantage in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>), and our results for individual male fertilisation success across a range of thermal regimes suggest that males producing longer sperm have improved reproductive fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additional possibilities for indirect effects acting on sperm length in the 38°C selection regime include genetic bottlenecking at the start of selection if fertility and offspring production had been compromised, or heightened metabolic rate throughout the entire life cycle allowing improved access to key nutrients which may enable the development of longer sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whatever the cause behind long-term experimental evolution of sperm length within our thermal lines, it is clear that short-term within-generation impacts of temperature have strong and direct effects on sperm development, with an experimental switch to warmer regimes for either the thermal selection lines or the ancestral stock population resulting in consistently clear reductions in sperm length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Temperature variation during gametogenesis is known to affect sperm size in ectotherms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanckenhorn and Hellriegel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rohmer et al., 2004</xref>), and cool and warm thermal extremes can reduce fertile function in tandem with reduced sperm length development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vasudeva et al., 2014</xref>). However, no previous study has revealed that the thermal regime during spermatogenesis can shape sperm function to be optimal for the forthcoming thermal reproductive environment. We demonstrate clear evidence for adaptive plasticity in sperm function in anticipation of thermal regime, enabling males (and their mates) to increase their reproductive success by 40% to 100% when males are developmentally ‘matched’ to the temperature of the subsequent reproductive environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Adaptive plasticity in the production of sperm numbers is known in relation to environmental risks of male-male competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wedell et al., 2002</xref>), with the capability for spermatogenesis to increase in response to elevated risks of sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramm and Stockley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giannakara et al., 2016</xref>). This male plasticity can also change individual sperm cell form and function: domestic cockerels (<italic>Gallus gallus domesticus</italic>) rapidly changed their sperm mobility in relation to their own competitive status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pizzari et al., 2007</xref>), and male Gouldian finches (<italic>Erythrura gouldiae</italic>) adjusted sperm morphometry in relation to social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Immler et al., 2010</xref>). Similar changes occured in sperm velocity and density in Arctic charr (<italic>Salvelinus alpinus</italic>) when dominance switched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rudolfsen et al., 2006</xref>), and broadcast-spawning ascidians (<italic>Styela plicata</italic>) produced larger, more motile sperm when adults were kept at densities with greater risks of sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crean and Marshall, 2008</xref>). Far fewer studies have explored adaptive sperm plasticity in relation to abiotic variation, which is a gap because physico-chemical factors can greatly influence sperm function and also vary across reproductive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reinhardt et al., 2015</xref>). Acclimation and in vitro fertilisation experiments with the broadcast spawning tubeworm <italic>Hydroides diramphus</italic> revealed adaptive plasticity in sperm and egg function in relation to salinity, with gametes performing best at salinities experienced by their parents prior to spawning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>). Likewise, sticklebacks (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) showed adaptive plasticity in spermatozoal sensitivity to the salinity and osmolarity signal for initiating flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Taugbøl et al., 2017</xref>). To our knowledge, only two studies have investigated sperm plasticity in relation to temperature: male mosquitofish (<italic>Gambusia holbrooki</italic>) acclimated to cool (18°C) and warm (30°C) regimes for five weeks showed no signs of spermatozoal acclimation or change in thermal limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adriaenssens et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, although warm conditions reduced sperm motility in brown trout (<italic>Salmo trutta</italic>), warm-acclimated males did not produce sperm with improved relative motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fenkes et al., 2017</xref>). Our transplant experiments revealed clear evidence for adaptive developmental plasticity in sperm function according to thermal regime, with males exposed to warmer 38°C temperatures producing sperm that enabled a doubling of reproductive success in warmer 38°C fertilisation and reproductive environments compared with sperm produced at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and c</xref>). The opposite also applied, with sperm produced in cooler 30°C regimes gaining ~40% greater reproductive success at 30°C compared with sperm produced at 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). This plasticity will confer direct fitness advantages if the thermal regime through development before mating anticipates the temperature for sperm function and reproduction following insemination. Sperm manufacture proceeds rapidly in <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, with production of mature, functional gametes taking around four days at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fishman et al., 2017</xref>). As in many insects, fertilisation and oviposition proceeds within hours of mating in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fedina and Lewis, 2008</xref>), so sperm production temperature will usually predict insemination, storage and fertilisation temperature.</p><p>In contrast to males, female <italic>T. castaneum</italic> produced larger gametes in the warmer environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is unusual for arthropods where smaller eggs are usually produced as temperatures increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seko and Nakasuji (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stillwell and Fox (2005)</xref>. This egg size plasticity occurred within two days of exposure to the novel thermal regime, and was reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Egg plasticity was also adaptive when comparing performance between the more extreme 30°C versus 40°C environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): 36% of eggs produced at 38°C generated viable offspring following development at 40°C compared with only 27% of eggs produced at 30°C. Conversely, 90% of eggs produced at 30°C generated offspring when developed at 30°C, versus 80% of eggs developed at 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Adaptive plasticity in egg biology is known in relation to a number of environmental factors, but we believe this is the first study to demonstrate it under environmental warming. Adaptive egg plasticity in relation to biotic variation is shown by seed beetles (<italic>Stator limbatus</italic>), where females vary egg size in relation to anticipated host plant quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fox et al., 1997</xref>). Experiments show that females respond to a switch in host plant in a manner that maximises reproductive fitness by matching egg size (and number) to the host type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fox et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Savalli and Fox, 2002</xref>). Likewise, female cowpea weevils (<italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic>) are sensitive to levels of larval competition predicted by increased adult density, laying larger eggs to improve larval fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kawecki, 1995</xref>). Broadcast-spawning ascidians (<italic>S. plicata</italic>) produce smaller eggs in high density populations, but their embryo-yielding ovicells are larger than eggs from low-density adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crean and Marshall, 2008</xref>). Similarly, female <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> wasps adjust the sex ratio of their broods depending on whether they are first or second to parasitise a host, improving offspring fitness according to anticipated variation in local mate competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Werren, 1980</xref>). Adaptive egg plasticity in relation to some abiotic variables is also recognised. Female stink bugs (<italic>Podisus maculiventris</italic>) detect reflectance at the site where they oviposit, and invest more protective pigment into eggs that will be exposed to stronger ultraviolet solar radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram et al., 2015</xref>). A number of studies have found variation in egg phenotypes according to temperature during development and oviposition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ernsting and Isaaks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanckenhorn, 2000</xref>), but few have identified that the changes are adaptive, with thermal variation creating physiological constraints or stress during egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>). A notable exception is in <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic> butterflies, where females lay larger (and fewer) eggs when they are exposed to lower temperatures during oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2003a</xref>); reciprocal transfer experiments, as we employ here, show that this behaviour is adaptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fischer et al., 2003b</xref>). We identify adaptive plasticity in response to the upper ranges of reproductive tolerance by <italic>T. castaneum</italic> females, with adaptive matching through warmer egg development temperatures enabling a 33% improvement in offspring production in the hottest reproductive environment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Mechanisms for optimising gamete function in different thermal environments are to be uncovered, but four broad and related possibilities exist through: 1) optimising size, 2) physiological matching, 3) haploid selection, and/or 4) epigenetic modifications for offspring development. Although we observed opposing responses by sperm and egg sizes under temperature variation, it seems unlikely that this phenotypic variation is solely responsible for enabling improvements in reproductive success. Sperm length decreased as temperatures increased, but additional correlative analyses gave no indication that reduced sperm size per se improved reproductive performance in hotter thermal regimes, and the reverse was more evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous work showing that sperm elongation is costly and positively selected by competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>). It therefore seems more likely that changes in sperm physiology, rather than morphometry, allow plasticity in sperm function to match thermal reproductive environments. Thermal adaptations influencing cell physiology and biochemistry are known to exist within mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egginton and Sidell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guderley and St-Pierre, 2002</xref>), essential for sperm function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ramalho-Santos et al., 2009</xref>), and membrane properties influencing cell structure and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cossins and Prosser, 1978</xref>) for sperm and flagellum function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardullo and Wolf, 1990</xref>). In addition, Heat Shock Proteins, expressed throughout spermatogenesis in the testis, play key roles in sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dun et al., 2012</xref>). These adaptations for different thermal and hydrodynamic environments could be adaptively varied through spermiogenesis so that sperm function is matched to challenges facing sperm migration, storage and fertilisation in warmer environments. Within-ejaculate haplotype selection provides another mechanism for improving offspring performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alavioon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Adaptive thermal plasticity may be possible via changes in egg size, because larger-volume eggs produced at higher temperatures will contain more fluids, and possibly a greater nutrient load, both of which could improve offspring viability under heat stress and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>). However, within the 30°C environment, larger eggs produced at 38°C were outperformed by smaller eggs produced at 30°C, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond size benefits. As for sperm, thermally plastic traits that are essential for egg fertilisation and subsequent function could include differential mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumollard et al., 2007</xref>) and egg plasma membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stein et al., 2004</xref>). Heat Shock Proteins could also play vital roles in protecting egg development from thermal stress; recent work demonstrates that increased loading of HSP23 into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> eggs improves embryo thermal tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lockwood et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the potential for adaptive plasticity within gamete function, reproductive fitness could be improved if short-term epigenetic modification through gamete development can pass adaptive information to the zygote, embryo and offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gannon et al., 2014</xref>). The potential for adaptive transgenerational plasticity via the matriline and through transcription factors within eggs is increasingly recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ho and Burggren, 2010</xref>), potentially enabling rapid responses to climate change via adaptive plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diamond, 2018</xref>). There is growing evidence that sperm also have the potential to be transcriptionally labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Immler, 2018</xref>), passing environmentally-driven epigenetic information to offspring through histone or protamine modifications, haplotype DNA methylation remodelling, and/or small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donkin and Barrès, 2018</xref>). Sperm carry complex payloads of coding and non-coding small RNAs which can be transcribed into the oocyte and embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadoune, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hosken and Hodgson, 2014</xref>) with conserved functions across mammalian and insect models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>); the potential importance of these RNA transcripts remains largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). However, the possibility for transgenerational information transmission via sperm or egg epigenomes in response to environmental variation during gametogenesis is an obvious mechanism to enable adaptive thermal plasticity for populations facing the challenge of reproducing under climate change where increases in both thermal averages, maxima and variation are expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perkins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Raftery et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td>Krakow <break/>Super Strain ancestral stock <break/>and Thermal Selection Lines at 30°C and 38°C</td><td>KSS: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson, 2018</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sales, 2019</xref> <break/>TSL: this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson, 2018</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sales, 2019</xref></td><td>KSS <break/>&amp; <break/>TSL30 or TSL38</td><td>Live beetles</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>)</td><td>Spermatozoa and ova</td><td>This paper</td><td>Sperm and eggs</td><td>Sperm recovered from sacrificed live males, eggs recovered from <break/>oviposition food medium</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R Studio</td><td>R Studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">RStudio Team, 2016</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>) (version 3.4.1)</td><td>R Studio version 1.1.463 and R version 3.4.1</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Model system, selection lines and thermal exposure</title><p><italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> flour beetles were maintained as previously described (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lumley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>) in a 16 hr: 8 hr light: dark photoperiod at 60 ± 10% relative humidity in small stock populations in <italic>ad libitum</italic> fodder comprising 90% organic white flour, 10% brewer’s yeast and a sprinkling of rolled oats to aid traction.

Each line was reproduced through every adult generation using 100 haphazardly-selected, sexually mature adults (&gt;ten days since pupal emergence). The mixed adults were free to mate and oviposit in 150 ml of fodder in 300 ml jars with mesh lids for one week, after which they were removed and the resulting eggs and larvae allowed to develop to the next generation at their respective temperatures. After 50+ generations of experimental evolution, gametes from males and females were assayed from eight independent lines in either thermal regime.</p><p>To measure the impacts of thermal regime on gamete biology, beetles were exposed to either 30°C, 38°C or 40°C temperatures in a controlled environment facility. Thermal exposure was regulated within a controlled environment facility held at 30°C, or in A.B. Newlife 75 Mk4 forced air egg incubators (A.B.

Flour beetle eggs are oblong in shape, and size was quantified by measuring length across the long axis of rotational symmetry of the egg. Initial measures of length and width revealed a positive correlation between the two measures across 100 individual eggs, so a single length measure was used to quantify egg size. Eggs were sieved from the fodder using mechanical sieves (pore size: 300 µm, Endecotts Ltd, London, UK), and placed on a dark tile using a fine paintbrush. Eggs from the fodder were coated with a single layer of flour, and were measured at x30 magnification using a Zeiss Discovery V12 binocular microscope, AxioCam MRc5 camera and AxioVision V5.1 imaging software. Mature sperm were recovered from the base of the testicular follicles dissected out of males frozen at –6°C. Follicles were isolated on microscope slides in 30 µl drops of insect saline (0.9% NaCl), and then ruptured using fine forceps under an Olympus SZX9 binocular microscope. Once ruptured, sperm were dispersed by spreading out the area of the saline drop across the microscope slide using fine forceps, and the smears left to dry at room temperature so that the sperm cells lay in flat two-dimensional planes adhering to the glass. Images of intact spermatozoa were captured at 600X magnification under dark-field phase contrast using an Olympus BX41 microscope connected to a GT Vision GX CAM digital camera and GXCapture 8.2 software (GT Vision Ltd, UK).

Responses to long-term variation were measured following five years of selection (50+ generations) within replicate lines maintained in either ‘warm’ (30 ± 1°C) or ‘hot’ (38 ± 1°C) conditions. To measure impacts of short-term thermal variation we created duplicates of each of the eight replicate 30°C and 38°C lines at generation 54 to measure sperm effects and 58 for egg effects, and reared these at both 30°C and 38°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) using a balanced, factorial design. Logistic contraints prevented simultaneous measurement at generation 54. To measure effects on sperm, males were exposed to either temperature from the pupal stage in 6 cm Petri dishes containing 15 ml of standard fodder, with adults allowed to emerge in groups of 20 per dish at their treatment temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Ten days later, when reproductively mature, they were frozen for dissection and sperm measurement. We also measured full body size of males from both regimes (<italic>N</italic> = 80; five males from each of eight lines across two regimes).

Egg length measurement followed a balanced design across temperature regimes and lines, with 30 eggs measured from each replicate line at either temperature regime (=960 egg measures across eight replicate lines of either selection regime and two short-term temperature exposures).</p><p>We also measured gamete size plasticity in the ancestral KSS stock population maintained at 30 ± 1°C, following methods for testing gamete size plasticity as above. Males were developed from pupae at either 30°C or 38°C and, ten days following emergence, five sperm and body length were measured from each of 26 males per treatment. Eggs were measured in three experimental blocks, within which two groups of 50 KSS females (eclosed and mated at 30°C with standard KSS males also developed at 30°C) oviposited at either 30°C or 38°C for two days in 100 ml jars with perforated lids and 80 ml of standard fodder.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Neil J Gemmell (Reviewer #2); Tom Pizzari (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors make use of the Tribolium flour beetle model to assess the potential for thermal adaptation in sperm and egg function. Exposing flour beetles to increased temperature under both long-term experimental evolution and short term acclimation, the authors found that thermal regime regulates gamete size development in both males and females. They find that long-term selection regimes at high temperatures (38°C) led to males producing sperm 4% longer than those evolved at lower temperatures (30°C). However, short term changes in temperature generated the opposite pattern: sperm production in males subjected to 38°C within a single generation produced sperm 7% shorter than those exposed to 30°C. Females also showed a response to both the long and short term selection regimes, producing longer eggs at higher temperatures.</p><p>Using a series of well-conducted thermal translocation experiments, the authors show that this gametic phenotypic plasticity was adaptive. Both sperm and eggs produced in warmer conditions had superior reproductive performance in warmer environments, and vice versa for colder conditions and reproductive environments. Further, in warmer environments, the gamete plasticity observed enabled males to double their reproductive success, and females could increase offspring production by one-third. Collectively the authors' work identifies a new dimension in gametic plasticity important for understanding how organisms may respond to the increasing thermal variation in the natural environment.</p><p>This is an excellent study, presenting a uniquely exhaustive experimental investigation into the consequences of environmental temperature for gametic phenotype and related fitness consequences in an ectotherm invertebrate model species. While the biological ramifications of climatic change, including environmental temperature, have been the focus of intense and increasing research interest in recent years, surprisingly little remains known about the impact on gametic performance and associated implications for reproductive fitness. The study therefore makes an influential contribution to a topical and unresolved question.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing result is the strong contrast in phenotypic response in sperm length under long-term and short-term regimes. Under long term selection to higher temperatures sperm get longer, while under the short term regime, they got shorter. I find this a puzzling result, which I cannot easily reconcile. The authors have put forward some plausible explanations, which I think are sensible, but I did wonder if other factors might contribute to or explain this result. First, was there potential for the sex ratios in the selection lines to have altered as a consequence of thermal exposure, which may have affected the level of sperm competition across some treatments? I wondered if this might be a particular factor in explaining the difference in sperm length response between short-term and long-term selection experiments? I know the authors are expert in this realm, so assume they controlled for this possibility, but some details on whether sex ratios differed and how these were handled might be useful to include. Similarly, I wondered if there were any data on sperm volumes or concentrations. While sperm length clearly responded to the selection regime, I wondered if the authors might also know how sperm number, ejaculate volume and motility altered as there are often strong interactions among these traits? Probably these traits are not easily measured in flour beetles, but if there are data, they might further strengthen this already impressive piece of work. Last, I wondered if there might be an ageing effect that was driving some of the findings observed. In particular, I was curious as to whether males age faster and/or sperm mature faster at higher temperatures. Might part of the effect observed be driven by male age and ejaculate age? Perhaps there is a way to factor in degree days to control for any variation that might exist among experiments?</p><p>The authors need to justify the experimental temperatures the beetles were exposed to. In special, 38 C is not a yearly average temperature that exists anywhere in the world. Even the lower temperature (30 C) is not a common average temperature anywhere in the world. And very unlikely it will exist, even under global warming scenarios. So, the paper can be better framed in the context of seasonal temperature variability (growing seasons, summer, etc.) and not necessarily in a global warming context. Comparing only two temperatures 30 vs. 38 C is not ideal, besides being temperatures that are very far apart from each other, it is impossible to draw a general trend when you only have one comparison. It would have been great had the manuscript had an intermediate temperature treatment, at 34 C (or so).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49452.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing result is the strong contrast in phenotypic response in sperm length under long-term and short-term regimes.

We include the reviewer suggestions for factors arising from sexual selection and/or developmental ageing. We also suggest nutrient access through the whole life cycle for spermatogenesis as a potential factor, since nutrient limited males develop shorter sperm in T. castaneum (Godwin et al., 2017). Finally, we consider the possibility that longer-term evolution in a warmer 38<sup>o</sup>C environment, where sperm are pushed by short-term effects (perhaps via faster development rate) to be shorter, has led to compensatory selection for sperm elongation.</p><p>We do not have data on sperm number/volume/concentration or motility in our thermal lines, because achieving meaningful measures of these pose problems in this system. Individual male T. castaneum can mate with multiple females throughout their long life, successfully inseminating an average of 50 females within 7 days if given the opportunity (Lumley et al., 2015), so individual ejaculate sperm number/volume/concentration will not reveal the capacity for overall sperm number production. (If the reviewer refers to sperm cell volume for consideration, T. castaneum sperm cells are also small and extremely thin, and may vary in diameter along their long axis, so volume will also be a challenge to measure accurately.) Finally, and as in most insects, motility is also a problem to measure meaningfully in T. castaneum because sperm evidently function through the female tract by moving within narrow tubules or within dense sperm masses, so the motility of individual isolated sperm (even if the tract biochemistry could be replicated) on a microscope slide will likely not reflect function in the natural fertilisation environment.</p><p>We therefore now suggest the following additional interpretations for why the 38<sup>o</sup>C thermal selection lines have evolved slightly longer sperm, whereas short-term temperature increases through pupal and adult development cause a reduction in sperm length:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Although we found evidence that laboratory selection across 54 generations at 38°C caused the overall evolution of ~4% longer sperm compared with the thermal line selection at 30°C, our within-generation experiments revealed consistent ~7% reductions in sperm length for all populations when produced through the warmer 38°C regime compared with 30°C (Figure 2). […] Whatever the cause behind long-term experimental evolution of sperm length within our thermal lines, it is clear that short-term within-generation impacts of temperature have strong and direct effects on sperm development, with an experimental switch to warmer regimes for either the thermal selection lines or the ancestral stock population resulting in consistently clear reductions in sperm length (Figure 2). Temperature variation during gametogenesis is known to affect sperm size in ectotherms…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to justify the experimental temperatures the beetles were exposed to.

We now frame the work more in this context, and make it clearer throughout the manuscript that our study is relevant to thermal variability, and not annual averages (including three new references to this). Although we cite climate change as being relevant to our study, we believe that our findings have primary impact in revealing a novel example of basic biological function for dealing with inherent thermal variation in the natural environment. Temperatures exceeding 38°C have been recorded in 150 countries (Mherrera, 2019), so are very frequently encountered in tropical latitudes. It is also relevant to note that the laboratory ‘optimum’ for population productivity in our T. castaneum model is a warm 35°C (stated in the manuscript Materials and methods), so 38°C is not too far apart from that.</p><p>We also agree that additional thermal regimes in the study would have been great, but the existing workload to complete this work through a number of years at control and extreme (but relevant) experimental temperatures was itself more than a stretch.</p><p>Changes to framing the work:</p><p>“One of the most important abiotic environmental variables is temperature (Cossins and Bowler 1987;Angilletta Jr., 2009), especially in the context of climate change when thermal environments are expected to both warm and become much variable and extreme (Perkins et al., 2012, Raftery et al., 2017).”</p><p><bold>“</bold>After exposing adult males and females and their gametes to different temperatures, we compare sperm and egg development and reproductive function within thermal regimes that mimic the increasingly variable conditions faced by warmer tropical regions (Perkins et al., 2012).”</p><p>“…an obvious mechanism to enable adaptive thermal plasticity for populations facing the challenge of reproducing under climate change where increases in both thermal averages, maxima and variation are expected (Perkins et al., 2012, Raftery et al., 2017).”</p><p><bold>“</bold>30°C is our standard rearing temperature, and the optimum laboratory temperature for population productivity in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> is 35°C (Sokoloff, 1974, Sales, 2019). […] Our experimental exposure to this thermal regime will have relevance to more extreme thermal conditions and heatwaves, predicted to increase in frequency, severity and duration under climate change (e.g. Perkins et al., 2012), and which we know specifically constrain reproduction and sperm function in this system (Sales et al., 2018).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
