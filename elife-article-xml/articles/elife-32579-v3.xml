For HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), combination therapy has proved life-saving. The targets of direct-acting antivirals for HCV infection are NS3/4A protease, NS5A phosphoprotein and NS5B polymerase. Differential visualization of drug-resistant and -susceptible RNA genomes within cells revealed that resistant variants of NS3/4A protease and NS5A phosphoprotein are <italic>cis</italic>-dominant, ensuring their direct selection from complex environments. Confocal microscopy revealed that RNA replication complexes are genome-specific, rationalizing the non-interaction of wild-type and variant products. No HCV antivirals yet display the dominance of drug susceptibility shown for capsid proteins of other viruses. However, effective inhibitors of HCV polymerase exact such high fitness costs for drug resistance that stable genome selection is not observed. Barriers to drug resistance vary with target biochemistry and detailed analysis of these barriers should lead to the use of fewer drugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32579.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are simple organisms that consist of genetic information and a few types of proteins. They cannot replicate on their own, and instead hijack the molecular machinery of a host cell to produce more of themselves.</p><p>Inside an infected cell, the genetic information of the virus is replicated and ‘read’ to create viral proteins. These components are then assembled to form a new generation of viruses. During this process, genetic errors may occur that lead to modifications in the viral proteins, and help the virus become resistant to treatment. For instance, a viral protein that used to be targeted by a drug can change slightly and not be recognized anymore.</p><p>Currently, the most efficient way to fight drug resistance is to use combination therapy, where several drugs are given at the same time. This strategy is successful, for example to treat infections with the hepatitis C virus, but it is also expensive, especially for developing countries.</p><p>An alternative approach is dominant-drug targeting, which exploits the fact that both drug-resistant and drug-susceptible viruses are ‘born’ in the same cell. There, the susceptible viruses can overwhelm and ‘mask’ the benefits of the resistant ones. For example, proteins from resistant strains, which are no longer detected by a treatment, can bind to proteins from susceptible viruses; drugs will still be able to recognize these resulting viral structures. The proteins that operate in such ways are potential dominant-drug targets. However, resistant and susceptible strains can also cohabit without any contacts if their proteins do not interact with each other.</p><p>Now, van Buuren et al. screen several viral proteins, including one called NS5A, to test whether a dominant drug target exists for the hepatitis C virus. Only a few molecules of a drug that targets NS5A can stop the virus from growing. In theory, drug-bound NS5A proteins could block their non-drug-bound neighbors, but when these drugs have been used on their own, resistance quickly emerged.</p><p>Experiments showed that NS5A is not a dominant drug target because the drug-resistant and drug-susceptible proteins do not mix. Unless ‘forced’ in the laboratory, NS5A proteins only bind to the ones produced by the same strain of virus. This explains why resistant viruses quickly take over when NS5A drugs are the sole treatment. However, other hepatitis C proteins, such as the HCV core protein, are known to mix during the assembly of the virus, and thus are likely be dominant drug targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatitis C virus</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>viral evolution</kwd><kwd>RNA replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19-AI09662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Karla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCRTP-HepC Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Buuren</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001424</institution-id><institution>American Liver Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Buuren</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Director's Pioneer Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Karla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alison and Steve Krausz Innovation Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkegaard</surname><given-names>Karla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interactions between viral genomes within the same cells can impact the selection of drug-resistant variants and this has been finessed by hepatitis C virus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In a recent triumph of modern science and medicine, patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) now receive multidrug regimens that are often curative and have low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afdhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhaliwal and Nampoothiri, 2014</xref>). Over the past two decades, researchers have developed and tested thousands of antiviral compounds with varying efficacies and toxicity profiles that have ultimately lead to the FDA approval of powerful combination therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheel and Rice, 2013</xref>). Several different direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target the NS3/4A protease, NS5A phosphoprotein, or NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HCV have been approved for use in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afdhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhaliwal and Nampoothiri, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manns and von Hahn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Younossi et al., 2015</xref>). Ideally, the knowledge gained in developing HCV antivirals that are effective and not prone to the outgrowth of drug resistance will be applied to other viruses as well.</p><p>The emergence of drug-resistant variants follows basic evolutionary principles, requiring spontaneous mutations as well as selective pressure, so that beneficial mutations increase the progeny size of genomes that bear them. The genetic diversity in RNA viral genomes results from the high error frequencies incurred by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which occur at approximately 4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> errors for each nucleotide synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>). Given the iterative copying of positive and negative strands, much higher cumulative error frequencies are observed, even during a single cycle of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acevedo et al., 2014</xref>). When more than one mutation is required to confer drug resistance, the outgrowth of drug resistance can be delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, treatment with combinations of drugs can be extremely effective at suppressing drug resistance, because the number of mutations required for resistance to multiple drugs is ideally the sum of the number of mutations needed for each drug alone. Combination therapies have proven invaluable in reducing the frequency of drug resistance in both microbiology and oncology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fillat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falade-Nwulia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerantzas and Jacobs, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Other strategies to suppress viral drug resistance accept the inevitability of drug-resistant mutations, but seek to decrease selection for their outgrowth. Examples of antivirals for which resistance comes with a high fitness cost include integrase inhibitors of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mesplède et al., 2015</xref>), protease inhibitors of coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2014</xref>) and certain nucleoside inhibitors of HCV NS5B polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawitz et al., 2013</xref>). As was first shown for 2’-C-methyl CTP, selected drug-resistant HCV variants grow poorly and retain their low fitness upon passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dutartre et al., 2006</xref>). Sofosbuvir, the FDA-approved NS5B polymerase inhibitor, has dramatically increased the efficacy of HCV treatment, and also generates little outgrowth of resistant variants. The few HCV variants observed in patients are nearly inviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Svarovskaia et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms by which this kind of fitness cost is enforced would greatly facilitate future antiviral design.</p><p>Another approach to decrease the selection of drug-resistant variants is termed dominant drug targeting. This applies to antiviral targets for which the drug-bound products of pre-existing drug-susceptible genomes are dominant-negative inhibitors of new drug-resistant progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mateo et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, this has been demonstrated for the capsid proteins of poliovirus and dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mateo et al., 2015</xref>), but other potential dominant drug targets have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2004</xref>). When a drug-resistant genome is in its cell of origin, it coexists with its drug-susceptible parents and siblings. If the drug target is, for example, a subunit of an oligomeric complex and subunits from different genomes have the opportunity to mix, chimeric oligomers often form. At the time of its creation, the drug-resistant genome will be a minority species, and such chimeras would be predominantly composed of the drug-bound, susceptible components thus incapacitating the entire oligomeric structure. Such ‘phenotypic masking’ was originally invoked to explain the very low frequency of foot-and-mouth-disease escape variants following selection with neutralizing antibodies when passaged at high multiplicities of infection (MOIs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holland et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Our goal was to screen the HCV-encoded viral proteins that are current targets of antiviral compounds to determine the intracellular dominance relationships between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible genomes. The high cost to viral fitness of Sofosbuvir-resistant variants is sufficient to explain its high barrier to resistance. There are currently no antivirals directed against HCV core protein; however, it is likely to be a dominant drug target. We used differential hybridization of RNA probes to detect two different genomic RNAs in a single cell by confocal microscopy and by flow cytometry. This analysis showed the <italic>cis</italic>-dominance of HCV viruses that are resistant to inhibitors of either NS3/4A protease or NS5A phosphoprotein, consistent with the rapid outgrowth of drug-resistance in patients of these two inhibitor classes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of three strains of codon-altered JFH1</title><p>Newly mutated drug-resistant genomes first arise within cells that are pre-populated by drug-susceptible genomes. To mimic such mixed infections, we have previously employed co-infection of cultured cells with drug-susceptible and drug-resistant viruses at high MOIs to ensure mixed infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mateo et al., 2015</xref>). For HCV, it is not practical to use high MOIs to achieve co-infection due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently high-titer viral stocks. Thus, we needed to develop an approach to distinguish between uninfected, singly infected and co-infected cells in relatively sparsely infected cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32579.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Construction of codon altered JFH1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell cultures coinfected with two strains of HCV result in four populations: uninfected, two types of singly infected, and coinfected cells.

A recently developed branched DNA probe technology allows the generation of sufficiently sensitive RNA probes to identify single molecules within cells, but requires approximately 1000 nucleotides of differential probe hybridization to achieve specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Affymetrix Inc, 2016</xref>). To create a viral strain with this extreme dissimilarity from wild-type virus, we tested the viability of three different codon-altered versions of the JFH1 variant of HCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each mutated version contained 200–300 nucleotide changes that did not alter the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Of these codon-altered (CA) variants, CA-1 was inviable, CA-2 showed reduced viral protein accumulation, and CA-3 showed accumulation of both viral protein and RNA to abundances equivalent to those of the wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Recently, detailed analysis of covarying nucleotides within the HCV coding region has identified the location of several previously unknown functional RNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pirakitikulr et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, CA-1 contains two such regions and CA-2 contains one, which correlates with decreasing viability, while CA-3 contains no such regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pirakitikulr et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, subsequent experiments were performed only with CA-3. This variant, now termed ‘CA’ virus, contains 247 synonymous mutations over a 918-nucleotide region that spans the coding sequences for most of NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test the sensitivity of RNA FISH probes generated against the positive- and negative-strands of wild-type (WT) and codon-altered (CA) viruses, both confocal microscopy and flow cytometry analyses were employed. Branched DNA technology allowed the labeling of each target RNA with as many as 8000 fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Affymetrix Inc, 2016</xref>). Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with either WT or CA viruses, subjected to FISH and visualized by confocal microscopy. WT and CA probe sets specifically targeted either the positive-sense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or the negative-sense vRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) of their corresponding virus. Additionally, we tested whether flow cytometry efficiently resolved cells transfected with different vRNAs; transfection was used to maximize the yield of each population. We resolved cells transfected with WT vRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Di</xref>), transfected with CA vRNA (ii), a mixture of these two cell types (iii) and cells co-transfected with both WT and CA vRNAs (iv).

Cells were infected for 72 hr at MOIs such that all four populations were represented, followed by 36 hr of continued incubation in the absence or presence of 2 μM BILN-2061.

All four cell types appeared in the absence of BILN-2061 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). In the BILN-2061-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>), the susceptible S population shifted to the U cells as expected. The S + R cells, on the other hand, shifted to the R population upon drug treatment.

Data from this and replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,K</xref>) confirmed the quantitative shift of S + R cells into the R population upon drug treatment. We conclude that, for the NS3/4A target, drug-resistant genomes are <italic>cis</italic>-dominant for the 1:1 ratio of S and R viruses tested here. We also tested whether over-expressed drug-resistant NS3/4A precursors could rescue BILN-2061-susceptible virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

JFH1 was passaged for multiple rounds of infection in the presence of 25 μM R1479. Several variants in NS5B (A336P, D438G, S282T, F427L, T481A) arose during passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Each mutation was introduced independently into the JFH1 genome and RNA transfections were performed. The T481A genome was the only variant to show any viral RNA production by 7 or 21 days post-transfection. We noticed that F427L and T481A were always isolated together. To test whether these mutations could together increase viral fitness, JFH1 viruses were generated that contained both mutations. Viruses with the mutations separate or together were passaged extensively in the presence of R1479. Occasional resistant outgrowths were observed, but none conferred sustained growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

This idea seemed promising because exogenously expressed NS5A has a dominant-negative effect on the growth of HCV replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graziani and Paonessa, 2004</xref>). Additionally, the NS5A inhibitors, as a class, display EC<sub>50</sub>’s in the low picomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao, 2013</xref>), making them among the most potent antiviral compounds ever identified.

Huh-7.5.1 cells were coinfected with CA and WT-Y93N viruses for 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Thus, resistance to NS5A inhibitor SR2486 in the context of viral infection was genetically dominant and the lack of rescue of the S virus with which it was mixedly infected shows that drug resistance is also <italic>cis</italic>-dominant. HCV infected cells become resistant to superinfection upon expression of non-structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tscherne et al., 2007</xref>). Due to this superinfection exclusion, it is likely that all coinfected cells arise through nearly synchronous infection throughout the course of the experiment. To control for any effects on selection that may occur due to the differential timing of coinfections that occurs over the initial 72 hr incubation period, we performed the same experiment with higher titer virus and a single cycle of infection in the absence of drug. Huh7.5.1 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 focus-forming unit (FFU)/cell with CA and WT-Y93N viruses and incubated for only 24 hr before drug treatment. Cells were then incubated in the absence and presence of 500nM SR2486 for an additional 24 hr. In this case, we also observe <italic>cis</italic>-dominance of drug resistant WT-Y93N genomes, indicating that asynchronous coinfection has no effect on selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

We conclude that NS5A, despite being an oligomeric species is not a dominant drug target. Instead, genomes resistant to NS5A remain drug resistant in co-infected cells but do not rescue drug-susceptible viruses present in the same cell. This is consistent with the observed outgrowth of viruses that are resistant to NS5A both in cultured cells and in patients, and with an earlier report that at least some functions of NS5A act exclusively in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fridell et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>One hypothesis that could mechanistically account for <italic>cis</italic>-dominant drug resistance is that NS5A molecules expressed from different alleles may not freely associate in mixed oligomers.

We were curious whether the dominance phenotypes were altered if we forced NS5A alleles to mix. To test whether exogenously expressed drug-susceptible NS5A proteins could co-assemble with drug-resistant NS5A, we utilized the previously described HCV plasmid that expresses HA-tagged and GFP-tagged NS5A within the same polyprotein but does not support genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

This has led to abandoned usage and development of many otherwise promising antivirals. To decrease the frequency with which drug-resistant variants arise, combinations of antivirals that, individually, exhibit low barriers to resistance are often used. When drug-resistant variants are first formed intracellularly, through error-prone RNA replication, they arise in a population that includes parental and sibling drug-susceptible viruses. Several genetic relationships between drug-resistant and drug-susceptible genomes are possible. First, the drug resistance of the new variants has the potential to be genetically dominant, and rescue both resistant and susceptible viral genomes. Alternatively, drug resistance can be <italic>cis</italic>-dominant, with the drug-resistant products rescuing only the genomes that encode them. Finally, the drug-resistant genome can fail to benefit any genomes in the cell because the drug-susceptible products present in the same cell are dominant inhibitors.</p><p>The DAAs targeting NS3/4A protease of HCV were the first to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamarre et al., 2003</xref>) and the first to reach the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bacon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacobson et al., 2011</xref>).

We therefore conclude that NS3/4A inhibitor resistance is <italic>cis</italic>-dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which should allow the rapid and specific selection for outgrowth from its cell of origin.</p><p><italic>Cis</italic>-dominance of drug resistance was also not originally anticipated while targeting NS3/4A. The original characterizations of the NS3/4A protease suggested that cleavage of the NS3/4A junction occurred in <italic>cis</italic>, but that cleavages at the 4A/4B, 4B/5A and 5A/5B junctions could all occur in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartenschlager et al., 1994</xref>). We felt that it was therefore, more likely, that drug-resistant NS3/4A could rescue drug-susceptible virus within the same cell. NS3/4A is not known to assemble into high-order oligomers in the same manner as NS5A, and we therefore did not anticipate drug-susceptible NS3/4A would be <italic>trans</italic>-dominant. Furthermore, a <italic>trans</italic> cleavage assay demonstrated that a NS4B-5B polyprotein could be cleaved by NS3/4A supplied in <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romero-Brey et al., 2015</xref>). However, the <italic>trans</italic>-cleavage system does not result in membranous web formation that would accompany genome sequestration. Other groups have reported a different result, that defective NS3 mutants cannot be rescued in <italic>trans</italic> by replicons with functional NS3/4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazakov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appel et al., 2005</xref>). Our interpretation of these studies is that NS3/4A is likely physically able to cleave in <italic>trans</italic> in cells, but requires access to the alternate precursor proteins in order for this to occur. Therefore, <italic>cis</italic>-dominance of drug-resistance is likely the result of a lack of free-mixing of NS3/4A encoded by different vRNAs within the same cell.</p><p>NS5A emerged as an HCV drug target through a chemical genetics screen for compounds that inhibited HCV growth but did not target the NS3/4A protease or the NS5B polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). The ease with which resistant viruses were selected suggested that drug resistance was either dominant or <italic>cis</italic>-dominant. This was somewhat surprising, given that NS5A is oligomeric and the NS5A inhibitors are extremely potent, and have been postulated to function at sub-stoichiometric ratios to NS5A protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao, 2013</xref>). Indeed, when drug-susceptible and drug-resistant NS5A protein were co-expressed in the present study, hetero-oligomers formed and the biological phenotypes of the drug-susceptible protein were dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Nonetheless, single-cell analysis of cells co-infected at a 1:1 ratio with NS5A inhibitor-susceptible and -resistant viruses showed, as with the NS3/4A inhibitor, that resistance to both SR2486 and Daclatasvir was <italic>cis</italic>-dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>What does <italic>cis</italic>-dominant resistance mean mechanistically? One potential mechanism is physical sequestration of the RNA replication complexes of the two co-infecting genomes. Genome-specific RNA probing of co-infected cells revealed that both the negative strands and positive strands from the two viruses were present at physically distinct locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is therefore highly probable that membrane-associated proteins such as HCV NS3/4A and NS5A do not mix within individual RNA replication complexes. However, not all mutations in a particular viral product should lead to the same defect with the same genetic properties. For example, we show here that viruses that are defective in a function of NS5A in RNA replication complexes are not rescued and have no effect on the outgrowth of drug-resistant variants. However, NS5A also plays an important role in packaging and assembly of mature HCV particles on lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyanari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boson et al., 2017</xref>). Lipid droplets are large and form adjacent to RNA replication complexes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, we have depicted the possibility that NS5A molecules encoded by distinct RNA replication complexes might mix on the surface of these lipid droplets. However, if replication of the drug-susceptible genomes is inhibited, contribution of their encoded proteins to any oligomers on the surface of lipid droplets should be minimal. In this vain, a hypothetical NS5A inhibitor that allowed RNA replication but inhibited the function of NS5A in particle assembly might have different genetic properties than the NS5A inhibitors currently in use.</p><p>Viral capsids have especially interesting genetic properties, often intermixing within co-infected cells. Defective capsid proteins of poliovirus, HBV and HIV have been shown to be dominant inhibitors of wild-type viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trono et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pettit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Checkley et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, when antiviral targets are capsid proteins, drug susceptibility can be genetically dominant by suppressing the outgrowth of drug-resistant virus within the cell in which it is first generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirkegaard et al., 2016</xref>). For HCV, very few inhibitors of capsid function have been identified, and their inhibition of viral growth is not sufficiently robust to make genetic experiments possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kota et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore not yet possible to test if, as we hypothesize, drug-susceptible virus will prove to be a dominant inhibitor of drug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, however, epitope-tagged HCV core protein can form mixed disulfide-bonded core oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kushima et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The success of combination therapy for HCV and the efficacy of the individual constituents illustrate some of the weapons in the arsenal of antiviral strategies. Future directions are likely to include, as well, the rational design of antivirals with high barriers to resistance such as those that hyper-stabilize oligomers and the prediction of DAA targets that impart a high fitness cost to drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Huh7.5.1 cells were a gift from Dr. Michael Gale Jr (University of Washington) and were cultured in DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega, Tarzana, CA), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island NY), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and Glutamax (Invitrogen).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: 1); Matthew Evans (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers found this work to be very interesting and thought-provoking. The re-coding of a genome to allow FISH discrimination of the replication of two viral strains is very innovative. The idea of cis-dominant drug resistance is novel, and this may be explained by the segregation of different viral genomes into distinct replication complexes. There was a concern that the low MOI used may allow asynchronous infection of cells and lead to the segregation of the complexes at separate sites in the infected cell. The reviewers felt that the manuscript would also be improved by further discussion of the possible mechanisms of cis-complementation and the literature on the genetic interactions of interacting HCV genomes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An experiment at higher MOI to confirm that the cis-dominance and segregation of the replication complexes are not due to asynchronous infection of cells. Even if it is not possible to use a high enough MOI to co-infect every cell, it should be possible to increase the level of co-infection. The authors could then make an argument as to why the MOI is not the cause of the segregation.</p><p>2) Further discussion of the literature on complementation between HCV viruses and further discussion of the mechanism of the cis-dominance would help the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) The quality of the scholarship needs improvement. Specifically, the authors didn't cite some relevant publications that do not fit precisely with their model.</p><p>2) The use of low MOIs greatly complicates interpretation of the two color FACS data. First, very few cells will be doubly infected during early times of infection at low MOIs; most double positive cells will therefore be the product of asynchronous, secondary infections. Second, because HCV exhibits superinfection exclusion, these co-infections must occur very close in time. The result is that even small differences in fitness may allow one genotype to appear dominant over another simply because it spreads faster and occupies a subset of cells, rather than because of cis dominant drug sensitivity. Thus, replication phenotypes would have to be closely matched for this experimental design to work as reported. This seems most relevant to Figure 6, where the drug-resistant genotype replicated far less efficiently than the wild-type, drug-sensitive genotype (Figure 6C, left panel). If indeed S virus spread more efficiently, it would have prevented coinfection by R virus, sealing its fate. Conversely, if R had replicated more efficiently it would prevented coinfection with S virus, and would not have been burdened by supporting S.</p><p>3) Subsection “Transmission genetics and phenotypic dominance of drug-resistant NS5A variant Y93N”, fourth paragraph and Figure 5C. It appears that both S and R NS5A levels were greatly reduced when the S genotype was present during drug treatment. In other words, the expression of the S allele poisoned the expression of the R allele. I recommend that the authors point this out here. Also, this observation complicates the interpretation of Figure 7 that phenotypic mixing does not occur.</p><p>4) Subsection “Lack of free mixing may prevent NS5A hetero-oligomerization”, last paragraph and Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The reason why expression of the R allele was unable to rescue the S genome is trivial: DNA transfection renders Huh-7 cells resistant to HCV replication (i.e., the fraction of cells that are productively transfected with DNA are greatly resistant to HCV replication, likely due to induction of an innate antiviral response – go ahead and confirm this with your DNA of choice). Therefore, I expect that very little R was expressed in the same cells as the virus. The obvious approach would be to show a positive control complementation with the same technique used here.</p><p>5) Figure 7A. This panel is difficult to interpret for several reasons. First, related to point 2, above, we don't know whether these co-infections occurred simultaneously or sequentially. Second, while we don't know the efficiency of negative- strand detection by this FISH method, it is likely an underestimate. Quinkert et al. (PMID: 16227280) reported that Con1, which replicates to lower levels than JFH-1, produce ≈40-100 negative-strands per cell and ≈5-8 times more positive strands. More recently, Klepper et al., (PMID: 27642141) found that ≈50% of HCV RNA is double-stranded, which will complicate negative-strand detection. In any case, if the FISH method used here only detects a fraction of negative-strands, it seems likely that it will miss replication compartments that have both R and S genotypes present. Third, it is unclear how representative these micrographs are; please present quantification over a larger number of cells. Fourth, what we'd really like to see is the localization of the R vs. S NS5A proteins in relation to the replication complexes.</p><p>6) Figure 4. This figure is quite confusing. First, why use a non-replicating system? Second, why express two NS5As from the same polyprotein? That seems irrelevant in relation to complementation or competition. Third, was there no HA-tagged NS5A expressed in the last two lanes?

Even if it is not possible to use a high enough MOI to co-infect every cell, it should be possible to increase the level of co-infection. The authors could then make an argument as to why the MOI is not the cause of the segregation.</p></disp-quote><p>A new experiment following this suggestion is shown in Figure 4G. These infections were performed with higher titer stocks so that the abundance of co-infected cells was increased. The duration was also shortened so that only one cycle of infection occurred before the addition of drug. Thus, the synchrony of the infections in the co-infected cells was assured. The same result was obtained, in which a great majority of coinfected cells showed no rescue of drug-susceptible virus. These new data are discussed in the third paragraph of the subsection “Transmission genetics and phenotypic dominance of drug-resistant NS5A variant Y93N”. The increased MOI and 24-hour duration of the experiments is also true for all data now shown in Figure 6.</p><p>We also reference two papers that demonstrate the superinfection exclusion discussed by reviewer 1. We consider it likely that, due to this phenomenon, even co-infected cells found at later time points were synchronously infected. This is discussed in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further discussion of the literature on complementation between HCV viruses and further discussion of the mechanism of the cis-dominance would help the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the invitation to discuss more viral genetics! A discussion of the interesting literature of intramolecular and intermolecular proteinase activities, and the genetics of genome rescue and lack thereof, can be found in the third paragraph of the Discussion. We interpret these findings in the context of ours, which we hope can resolve some of the apparent discrepancies between excellent experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) The quality of the scholarship needs improvement. Specifically, the authors didn't cite some relevant publications that do not fit precisely with their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the discussion above, in Essential revisions point 2, addresses this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of low MOIs greatly complicates interpretation of the two color FACS data. First, very few cells will be doubly infected during early times of infection at low MOIs; most double positive cells will therefore be the product of asynchronous, secondary infections. Second, because HCV exhibits superinfection exclusion, these co-infections must occur very close in time. The result is that even small differences in fitness may allow one genotype to appear dominant over another simply because it spreads faster and occupies a subset of cells, rather than because of cis dominant drug sensitivity. Thus, replication phenotypes would have to be closely matched for this experimental design to work as reported. This seems most relevant to Figure 6, where the drug-resistant genotype replicated far less efficiently than the wild-type, drug-sensitive genotype (Figure 6C, left panel). If indeed S virus spread more efficiently, it would have prevented coinfection by R virus, sealing its fate. Conversely, if R had replicated more efficiently it would prevented coinfection with S virus, and would not have been burdened by supporting S.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points. The replication efficiencies of the codon-altered and wild-type viruses are well matched, but the numbers of cells infected can differ from experiment to experiment and it is true that small differences could be amplified during multiple cycles. See Essential revisions point 1 above for discussion of new experiments in Figure 4G and Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Transmission genetics and phenotypic dominance of drug-resistant NS5A variant Y93N”, fourth paragraph and Figure 5C. It appears that both S and R NS5A levels were greatly reduced when the S genotype was present during drug treatment. In other words, the expression of the S allele poisoned the expression of the R allele. I recommend that the authors point this out here. Also, this observation complicates the interpretation of Figure 7 that phenotypic mixing does not occur.</p></disp-quote><p>The confocal images in Figure 5D indeed make it appear that there is less NS5A protein in the presence of drug in the presence of the drug-susceptible genomes. However, the immunoblots in panels B and C show that the presence of drug or the drug-susceptible genome actually does not affect the abundance of NS5A from either genome. Rather, the dispersed pattern of drug-susceptible NS5A renders the signal less visible than when it is more concentrated.</p><p>This has been addressed in the discussion of this figure in the last paragraph of the subsection “Transmission genetics and phenotypic dominance of drug-resistant NS5A variant Y93N”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Lack of free mixing may prevent NS5A hetero-oligomerization”, last paragraph and Figure 3—figure supplement 2. The reason why expression of the R allele was unable to rescue the S genome is trivial: DNA transfection renders Huh-7 cells resistant to HCV replication (i.e., the fraction of cells that are productively transfected with DNA are greatly resistant to HCV replication, likely due to induction of an innate antiviral response – go ahead and confirm this with your DNA of choice). Therefore, I expect that very little R was expressed in the same cells as the virus. The obvious approach would be to show a positive control complementation with the same technique used here.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure discussed is now Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We agree that a positive control would be excellent but, unfortunately, there are no HCV antivirals that target rescuable products. We are aware of the artifact discussed by the reviewer, and performed the infections three days before the transfections. The control in this experiment is that, in the absence of drug, transfection did not inhibit the growth of virus in the absence of drug (green bars). Nonetheless, it is true that the absence of a positive control makes this experiment incomplete and we would be willing to remove it if requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7A. This panel is difficult to interpret for several reasons. First, related to point 2, above, we don't know whether these co-infections occurred simultaneously or sequentially. Second, while we don't know the efficiency of negative- strand detection by this FISH method, it is likely an underestimate. Quinkert et al. (PMID: 16227280) reported that Con1, which replicates to lower levels than JFH-1, produce ≈40-100 negative-strands per cell and ≈5-8 times more positive strands. More recently, Klepper et al., (PMID: 27642141) found that ≈50% of HCV RNA is double-stranded, which will complicate negative-strand detection. In any case, if the FISH method used here only detects a fraction of negative-strands, it seems likely that it will miss replication compartments that have both R and S genotypes present. Third, it is unclear how representative these micrographs are; please present quantification over a larger number of cells. Fourth, what we'd really like to see is the localization of the R vs. S NS5A proteins in relation to the replication complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this point, we have performed a series of new experiments with higher titer viral stocks and 24-hour infections to obtain more synchronized, co-infected cells for purposes of quantitation. Co-localization patterns for S and R negative and positive strands (Figure 6B), S and R negative strands with NS5A, and S and R negative strands with core are shown (Figure 6D). This is discussed in the first two paragraphs of the subsection “Lack of free mixing may prevent NS5A hetero-oligomerization”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4. This figure is quite confusing. First, why use a non-replicating system? Second, why express two NS5As from the same polyprotein? That seems irrelevant in relation to complementation or competition. Third, was there no HA-tagged NS5A expressed in the last two lanes? If so, how was GFP-tagged NS5A co-IP'd?</p></disp-quote><p>Previously submitted Figures 4 and 5 have now been merged into Figure 5 to provide more clarity. Furthermore, the discussion is modified in response to the reviewer’s points in the last two paragraphs of the subsection “Lack of free mixing may prevent NS5A hetero-oligomerization”. The reason to use a non-replicating system and to express the NS5A proteins from the same polyprotein was to ensure biochemical mixing and thus to observe whether it was possible for drug-susceptible NS5A to be dominant when that occurred. There was no HA-tagged NS5A in the rightmost lanes in Figure 5B and 5C because those plasmids contained a single copy of GFP-5A. The lack of GFP-tagged NS5A upon HA immunoprecipitation was included as a control for the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. These experiments are introduced more effectively and clarified in the text in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The impaired replication of CA-1 and 2 is very interesting.
