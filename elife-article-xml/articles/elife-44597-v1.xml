The receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) receive cues from the extracellular environment and are well placed to influence cell signaling. However, the direct events downstream of these receptors have been challenging to resolve. We report here that the homophilic receptor PTPRK is stabilized at cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells. By combining interaction studies, quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics, proximity labeling and dephosphorylation assays we identify high confidence PTPRK substrates. PTPRK directly and selectively dephosphorylates at least five substrates, including Afadin, PARD3 and δ-catenin family members, which are all important cell-cell adhesion regulators. In line with this, loss of PTPRK phosphatase activity leads to disrupted cell junctions and increased invasive characteristics. Thus, identifying PTPRK substrates provides insight into its downstream signaling and a potential molecular explanation for its proposed tumor suppressor function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>Tyrosine phosphatase</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>cell-cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>dephosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome and Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship: 109407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fearnley</surname><given-names>Gareth W</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharpe</surname><given-names>Hayley J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deane</surname><given-names>Janet E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>086598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edgar</surname><given-names>James R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systematic proteomic approaches identify several cell junction regulators as substrates for the homophilic receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPRK and implicate its pseudophosphatase domain in substrate recognition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular organisms have evolved elaborate mechanisms of intercellular communication in order to organize cells into functioning tissues. The phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues is an essential feature of cell-cell communication and effectively coordinates diverse cell behaviors such as cell adhesion and motility in response to external stimuli. Kinases and phosphatases dynamically regulate phosphotyrosine levels, such that cells are primed to acutely respond to developmental cues or changes to their local environment. In particular, enzyme-linked cell surface receptors transduce external signals to the cell interior. For example, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) dimerize upon ligand binding leading to trans-autophosphorylation, which recruits phosphotyrosine-binding proteins that propagate a variety of signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hunter, 2009</xref>). Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are often thought to function in terminating or thresholding such signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agazie and Hayman, 2003</xref>). However, it is increasingly apparent that phosphatases themselves can propagate signals in response to growth factors; with the best example being PTPN11/SHP2; a key therapeutic target in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Cooper, 1996</xref>). Moreover, many human PTPs are receptor-linked suggesting they can also receive input from the extracellular environment. The effects of protein phosphorylation are site-specific, for example, phosphorylation of Src Tyr419 upregulates kinase activity but phosphorylation of Tyr530 reduces it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mohebiany et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, both kinases and phosphatases can modulate signaling cascades to affect cell behaviors. Despite this, the roles and substrates of the classical PTP family remain comparatively understudied.</p><p>The receptor type PTPs (RPTPs) are type one transmembrane proteins subdivided according to their extracellular domain (ECD) features. Like RTKs, RPTPs link extracellular sensing to intracellular catalysis. The regulatory mechanisms for most of the 21 RPTPs encoded by the human genome are poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tonks, 2006</xref>); however, it is known that the R2B RPTP subfamily form homophilic interactions and have been proposed to respond to cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aricescu et al., 2007</xref>). There are four human R2B receptors: PTPRK, PTPRM, PTPRT and PTPRU, which share a common domain architecture of one MAM (meprin/A5/μ), one immunoglobulin (Ig)-like and four fibronectin (FN) domains combined with an uncharacterized juxtamembrane domain and tandem intracellular phosphatase domains; the first active (D1) and the second inactive (D2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Structural and biophysical studies suggest the PTPRM extracellular domain forms a rigid, pH-dependent, homophilic interaction in trans through the MAM-and Ig domains of one molecule and the FN1 and FN2 domains of another molecule, with the possibility of further <italic>cis</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aricescu et al., 2007</xref>). Several cell adhesion proteins, such as cadherins and catenins, are proposed substrates for PTPRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Craig and Brady-Kalnay, 2015</xref>). Its paralog PTPRK was identified as a candidate driver gene in mouse intestinal tumorigenesis by insertional mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">March et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Starr et al., 2009</xref>) and was more recently identified as a gene fusion partner with the oncogene <italic>RSPO3</italic> in a subset of human colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seshagiri et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the <italic>PTPRK</italic> genic region are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and type I diabetes age of onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Inshaw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trynka et al., 2011</xref>). PTPRK is regulated by a proteolytic cascade involving furin, ADAM10 and γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2006</xref>) and might function to dephosphorylate proteins such as EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) or STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>PTPRK</italic> mRNA is broadly expressed, except in immune cells, skeletal muscle and testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and is upregulated by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Despite its importance in disease and signaling, the events downstream of PTPRK are not well established.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44597.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The homophilic receptor PTPRK is stabilized by cell-cell contact.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of full length PTPRK.

For example, their signal, removal of phosphate, is inherently negative and means it is critical that they are studied in an appropriate context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fahs et al., 2016</xref>). Given their homophilic interactions and subcellular localization, it is highly likely that the R2B family function at cell-cell contacts. We therefore reasoned that the appropriate context to assess their function would be in confluent, contact-inhibited epithelial monolayers. By combining proteomics approaches with in vitro and cell-based dephosphorylation assays we find that PTPRK displays striking substrate selectivity. In addition, there are distinct requirements for the two PTPRK intracellular phosphatase domains for substrate recognition. Multiple lines of evidence converge on five high confidence substrates: Afadin (AF6), PARD3 (Par3), p120<sup>Cat</sup> (p120-Catenin; CTNND1), PKP3 and PKP4 (p0071), which are known regulators of junctional organization. Indeed, PTPRK loss perturbs epithelial junction integrity and promotes invasive behaviors in spheroid cultures, consistent with its putative tumor suppressor role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PTPRK localizes to cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells</title><p>In order to detect endogenous PTPRK by immunoblot and immunofluorescence, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies against the purified PTPRK extracellular domain (ECD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Using one of our antibodies for structured illumination microscopy, we found PTPRK localized to puncta at basal cell-cell contacts that partially overlap with the adherens junction (AJ) protein E-Cadherin in MCF10A epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Homophilic interactions of the R2B receptor family have been demonstrated using suspension cell or bead aggregation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brady-Kalnay et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gebbink et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sap et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zondag et al., 1995</xref>), and PTPRM-based structural and biophysical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aricescu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aricescu et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate homophilic PTPRK interactions in cells, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 PTPRK knockout (KO) MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), stably expressing nuclear mApple, and co-cultured them with unlabeled wildtype cells. By immunostaining, PTPRK is strikingly absent from cell-cell contacts between wildtype and adjacent KO cells, despite expression of other R2B receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Consistently, PTPRK protein levels increase with increasing cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, screening recombinant PTPRK ECD against a secreted protein microarray did not identify any additional ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

We purified bacterially-expressed, biotinylated PTPRK wildtype and substrate-trapping intracellular domains (ICDs), as well as the pseudophosphatase D2 domain, and coupled them to streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) for affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS).

We found that only 21% of the PTPRK-ICD interactome overlapped between MCF10A and Hs27 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), which might reflect differences in protein expression or phosphorylation between the cell lines. The first substrate trap (D1057A) enriched the serine/threonine kinase MAP4K4 and RAPGEF6, which were both recently linked to Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meng et al., 2018</xref>).

RAPGEF6, MAP4K4 and PARD3 were reproducibly enriched on substrate traps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). We did not observe interactions with previously reported R2B receptor substrates including E-Cadherin, β-Catenin, STAT3, EGFR (pY1068) and Paxillin (DEPOD database; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2015</xref>) besides p120<sup>Cat</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zondag et al., 2000</xref>), which was enriched on the C1089S trap along with PKP4 and NUFIP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The principle of substrate trapping necessitates a direct interaction mediated by phosphotyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Flint et al., 1997</xref>). We tested whether trapped proteins could be competed off PTPRK-D1057A using the phosphate mimetic orthovanadate. The MAP4K4 interaction with PTPRK D1057A ICD from pervanadate lysates was competed using orthovanadate, consistent with phosphotyrosine-mediated trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In contrast, Afadin was not depleted by orthovanadate treatment. Furthermore, PARD3, PKP4 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> bind the C1089S ICD less effectively in the absence of phosphorylation, also supporting the efficacy of the trapping approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). However, we noted that all substrate-trapped proteins could still interact with PTPRK domains in phosphatase-treated lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>) and most interactors can bind to the enzymatically active WT ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), indicating phosphorylation-independent PTPRK interactions. Furthermore, the PTPRK-D2 domain alone was sufficient to pull down approximately a third of PTPRK ICD interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Although substrate trapping was effective, our data indicate that because many proteins can bind PTPRK independently of phosphorylation or to its D2 pseudophosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), trapping approaches alone could miss potential substrates.</p><p>To investigate interaction specificity further, we purified the ICD of the paralogous receptor PTPRM, which is 75% identical to PTPRK at the amino acid level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Afadin, RAPGEF6 and NUFIP2 interact specifically with PTPRK, indicated by their biased depletion from supernatants. Interestingly, we found several that bound both PTPRK and PTPRM ICDs such as PARD3 and PKP4. Although MAP4K4, MINK1, PTPN14, DLG5 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> are depleted by both ICDs, they appear to have a higher affinity for PTPRK in pull downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). Overall, the PTPRK interactome is enriched with cell junction-related proteins and shows partial overlap with PTPRM. Together, these data suggest that PTPRK and PTPRM have both unique and redundant roles at cell junctions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The PTPRK dependent tyrosine phosphoproteome</title><p>Next, we reasoned that PTPRK deletion should result in the hyperphosphorylation of its substrates. To investigate this, we used quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics to compare wildtype and PTPRK KO MCF10A cells. We investigated the tyrosine phosphoproteome of confluent cells 24 hr post media change in order to observe residual phosphorylation, initially induced by EGF and/or serum growth factors. To this end, tyrosine phosphorylated peptides were enriched from trypsinized SILAC (stable isotopomeric versions of amino acids)-labeled wildtype and PTPRK KO MCF10A lysates using anti-pTyr Abs and biotin-tagged phosphotyrosine ‘superbinder’ mutant Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tong et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We identified 282 quantifiable phosphotyrosine sites on 185 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) from three experiments. Interestingly, 15 phosphosites were statistically upregulated in PTPRK KO cells compared to wildtype in at least two experiments, but only one site, in PAG1, was down regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Strikingly, Afadin, PARD3 and PLEKHA6, which were all ‘substrate-trapped’ by PTPRK-C1089S, were amongst the proteins possessing enriched phosphosites in PTPRK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, we identified upregulated phosphorylation in at least one experiment for p120<sup>Cat</sup>, PKP2, PKP3 and PKP4, which are δ-catenin family proteins and interact with the PTPRK ICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Sites on KIAA1217 and Girdin were also upregulated in PTPRK KO cells, and analysis of our raw interaction data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) showed peptides for each protein were present in PTPRK pull downs, suggesting they are also potential substrates. Unfortunately, antibodies were not available to study them further. Critically, our total proteome analysis showed that the observed phosphosite levels on all proteins were not due to differences in protein amounts, except for PLEKHA6, which was not quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">2</xref>).

Interestingly, DCBLD2 was previously identified as a PTPRK-interacting protein in a large-scale AP-MS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>).

Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al. (2009)</xref> tested recombinant PTPs against a panel of phosphopeptides and observed limited sequence selectivity. For example, PTPRK showed reduced activity against peptides with basic residues in the three positions N-terminal to phosphotyrosine, including an EGFR-pY1068-containing peptide. In contrast, PTPRB showed no sequence preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). To investigate whether our candidate substrates shared common features we generated a consensus sequence, which showed a slight bias against basic residues immediately adjacent to the phosphotyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is consistent with the positively charged PTPRK active site entrance observed in its crystal structure, which may preclude binding of positively charged or basic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next searched the phosphosite plus database with a seven amino acid consensus sequence phosphotyrosine and cross-referenced to the PTPRK interactome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Beyond the candidate substrates, we identified an additional 18 phosphosites matching the consensus including substrate-trapped MAP4K4 and junction-associated ABLIM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, when we scrambled the consensus sequence we found fewer PTPRK interactors were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, PTP substrate consensus sequences might be useful in expanding a candidate substrate list when interactors are known, but most likely only represents a permissive sequence for dephosphorylation, rather than a strict requirement.</p><p>Based on our data and these analyses, PKP3, MAP4K4 and ABLIM3 were also included as candidate substrates after confirming interactions with PTPRK and PTPRM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

Interestingly, several phosphosites identified here are growth factor- and, in most cases, Src kinase-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, however, the Src family kinase activating phosphotyrosine (e.g. Src-Y419) is 1.6-fold lower in PTPRK KO cells, therefore such kinase activity does not explain the observed differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Phosphatases have a reputation for promiscuity therefore we included the intracellular domain of the closely related receptor PTPRM and assayed a panel of negative controls. Using an in vitro para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) colorimetric dephosphorylation assay, we determined that a three-fold higher molar ratio of PTPRM was required to match PTPRK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, a three-fold higher molar ratio of PTPRK-ICD was required for equivalent activity to the D1 domain, suggesting the D2 reduces D1 enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To identify proteins dephosphorylated by PTPRK, pervanadate-treated MCF10A cell lysates were incubated with recombinant protein domains, followed by phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We expected dephosphorylated proteins to be depleted from immunoprecipitates but present in supernatants, or, as observed for PKP4, to show a shift in molecular weight. In these assays phosphoproteins from different reactions were equally enriched by IP, as indicated by phosphotyrosine immunoblots, but the lysates incubated with active phosphatase domains had fewer phosphoproteins overall based on depletion from supernatants (Lower panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with our interaction data, several previously reported R2B receptor substrates including E-Cadherin, STAT3, β-Catenin, Paxillin and EGFR-pY1068 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2015</xref>), were not dephosphorylated by either PTPRK or PTPRM under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). In contrast, the PTPRK ICD, but strikingly not the PTPRK-D1 or PTPRM domains, completely dephosphorylated Afadin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a combined role for the D1 and D2 domains in its recognition and selective dephosphorylation. PARD3 and PKP3 were preferentially dephosphorylated by the PTPRK and PTPRM ICDs. In contrast, the PTPRK and PTPRM D1 domains alone were sufficient to dephosphorylate ABLIM3, PKP4 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, RAPGEF6 and MINK1 were not clearly dephosphorylated by the domains under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). MAP4K4, FMRP and NUFIP2 were not detectably tyrosine phosphorylated in the cell lysates, precluding us from assessing dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It has been suggested for the R2A RPTPs that the inactive D2 domain can inhibit the D1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 1998</xref>).

In combination with our interaction studies, these data suggest that PTPRM and PTPRK have overlapping substrate specificities for δ-catenin proteins, ABLIM3 and PARD3, and the PTPRK-ICD selectively dephosphorylates Afadin.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44597.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PTPRK directly and selectively dephosphorylates cell junction regulators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of in-lysate dephosphorylation assay.

In pull down assays, we found that PARD3 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> bound to all proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, Afadin and NUFIP2 showed a preference for proteins with the PTPRK-D2 domain, which is particularly evident by supernatant depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, RAPGEF6 bound equally to both PTPRK domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In dephosphorylation assays, proteins with the PTPRM D1 were used at a 3-fold higher concentration than PTPRK D1 domains to compensate for their lower activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Strikingly, the PTPRK-D2 domain is sufficient to recruit Afadin for dephosphorylation by PTPRM-D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, p120<sup>Cat</sup> is dephosphorylated by all domains, based on its presence in the associated supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, Paxillin is not dephosphorylated by any PTPRK or PTPRM combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that PTPRK and PTPRM can directly and selectively dephosphorylate substrates, and that the D2 pseudophosphatase domain is necessary and sufficient for recruitment of the PTPRK-specific substrate, Afadin.</p><p>A role for RPTP pseudophosphatase domains in substrate recognition has been proposed, however, the mechanism remains elusive. Structural studies on other RPTP D2 domains show a canonical PTP fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nam et al., 2005</xref>) and resemble substrate traps due to amino acid variation in key catalytic motifs. For example, the LAR (PTPRF) D2 domain could be converted to an active PTP by just two mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nam et al., 1999</xref>). We were unable to deplete Afadin from the PTPRK D2 domain with vanadate or dephosphorylation of cell lysates, suggesting binding is not mediated by phosphotyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We next attempted to reactivate the PTPRK D2 domain by reintroducing canonical sequences to the WPD loop, PTP signature motif and Q loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2001</xref>). Using a pNPP assay, we found no impact of the mutations on D2 domain activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), similar to recent failed attempts to reactivate the PTPRE D2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lountos et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the D2 domain mutations did not abrogate binding to several interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The catalytic cysteine, which forms a phosphocysteine intermediate in PTP D1 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pannifer et al., 1998</xref>), is conserved in most RPTP D2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2001</xref>). However, the CD45 (PTPRC) D2 domain structure shows that this key cysteine is occluded when compared to that of the D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). We generated a homology model for the PTPRK D2 domain based on PTPRE, and found that the surface charge surrounding the putative active site significantly diverges from that of the D1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>). These data suggest the D2 domain substrate recognition mechanism does not require substrate phosphorylation, which is consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>) as well as PTPRK D2 domain structural and sequence features.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PTPRK dephosphorylates p120<sup>Cat</sup>-pY228 and -pY904 in MCF10A cells</title><p>The Phosphosite plus database includes 17 frequently phosphorylated Human p120<sup>Cat</sup> tyrosine residues that have been identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>). By the same criteria, the larger protein Afadin is phosphorylated on only five tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>). This difference might explain why PTPRK completely dephosphorylates most of the Afadin present in lysates, but only a fraction of p120<sup>Cat</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, our dephosphorylation assays are likely to be quite conservative, particularly for proteins with many phosphosites. Our phosphoproteomics data revealed hyperphosphorylation of p120<sup>Cat</sup>-Y174, -Y228, -Y865 and -Y904 in PTPRK KO cells, suggesting these could be direct targets for PTPRK. Antibodies were available to detect phosphorylated p120<sup>Cat</sup>-Y228 and -Y904. To determine whether these sites could be directly dephosphorylated we incubated pervanadate lysates with recombinant protein domains and immunoblotted for specific phosphosites. In all cases, PTP domains did not dephosphorylate EGFR-pY1068 or Paxillin-pY118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Because these proteins are linked by roles in cell-cell junction organization, we sought to determine the impact of PTPRK loss on MCF10A morphology. Wildtype and PTPRK KO cells displayed signaling differences by phosphoproteomics at 24 hr after media change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We therefore used the same conditions to investigate junctional integrity of confluent cells. To this end, wildtype and PTPRK KO cells grown on transwell filters were analyzed by electron microscopy. Wildtype cells were more closely packed and organized than PTPRK KO cells, which exhibited large gaps between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, we observed a striking reduction in cell height in PTPRK KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (inset) and 7B). We further investigated junctional integrity by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and FITC dextran permeability of cells grown on transwell filters. PTPRK KO cells exhibited a ~ 50% reduction in TEER and a small but significant increase in FITC-dextran permeability compared to wildtype cells indicating a leakier monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). TEER measurements were partially rescued by reintroduction of PTPRK, but not a catalytically inactive mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with this altered organization, immunostained PTPRK KO cells grown on coverslips displayed a ~ 20% decrease in the intensity of F-actin, the AJ protein E-Cadherin, the desmosomal protein Desmoglein 3 (DSG3) and the PTPRK substrate p120<sup>Cat</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>).

These substrates are linked to cell-cell junction organization, which is perturbed when PTPRK is deleted. Importantly, our findings demonstrate the substrate selectivity of this receptor, which requires both its active and inactive PTP domains. We also identify PTPRK as a key mediator of adhesive signaling. Our conclusions have implications not only for understanding PTP biology and cell-cell junction phosphoregulation, but also provide molecular insight into how PTPRK might function as a tumor suppressor.</p><p>Cross-referencing the PTPRK interactome with the PTPRK-dependent tyrosine phosphoproteome enabled us to identify candidate substrates to assay for cellular interactions and direct dephosphorylation. Substrate-trapping methods in combination with mass spectrometry are commonly used to identify PTP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanchetot et al., 2005</xref>). We used two mutants affecting the WPD catalytic motif (D1057A) and catalytic cysteine within the PTP signature motif (C1089S) and found enrichment of distinct proteins on each. Using both Hs27 and MCF10A lysates, MAP4K4 and RAPGEF6 were enriched on the D1057A trap. Both were partially competed from traps with the phosphate mimetic vanadate, suggesting phosphorylation-dependent interaction. However, we could not validate RAPGEF6 or MAP4K4 as PTPRK substrates by in vitro dephosphorylation or phosphoproteomics, perhaps reflecting a limitation to the sensitivity or selectivity of our assays. Interestingly, these proteins were recently linked to mechanotransduction and hippo signaling, along with the PTPRK interactor MINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). An interesting future line of research will be to determine whether PTPRK is an upstream regulator of this new mechanotransduction pathway.</p><p>The cell junction organizers PARD3, Afadin and PLEKHA6 were all trapped by the C1089S mutant. Our immunoblots also highlighted phosphorylation-dependent enrichment of p120<sup>Cat</sup> and PKP4 on this trap. These five proteins were subsequently found to be hyperphosphorylated in PTPRK KO cells, suggesting that the C1089S mutant was effective in identifying substrates. However, we also found hyperphosphorylation of other PTPRK-binding partners in KO cells, indicating the traps alone were too restrictive in identifying substrates. Indeed, the PTPRK pseudophosphatase D2 domain was sufficient for substrate recognition, which may have masked the effect of the substrate traps, particularly as we have shown that D2 domain binding to most proteins is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. By considering the entire PTPRK interactome, we could include the armadillo family proteins PKP3, PKP4 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> as substrates. Our criteria were quite conservative, and it is likely that ABLIM3, PLEKHA6, Girdin, KIAA1217 and PKP2 are also substrates, all of which are also linked to junction organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gallegos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we cannot rule out the existence of additional PTPRK substrates, for example, that are expressed in different cellular contexts, particularly as we observed divergent interactomes between epithelial and fibroblast cells.</p><p>Strikingly, most of the candidate PTPRK substrates identified here have orthologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yet the R2B receptor family first appears in chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that rather than co-evolving with its substrates, PTPRK regulates pre-established functional protein complexes. In this way, PTPRK would have introduced new regulation, and perhaps function, to existing signaling networks for chordate and vertebrate-specific organization. Indeed, there are genetic links between orthologs for RAPGEF6, PARD3 and Afadin in the regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> AJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonello et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, PARD3 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs have been linked to the control of E-Cadherin internalization and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bulgakova and Brown, 2016</xref>). Several PTPRK substrates belong to the δ-catenin family, which undergoes significant expansion from one gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to seven in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carnahan et al., 2010</xref>). We did not detect ACRVF, PKP1 or δ-catenin (CTNND2) in MCF10A total proteomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>); however, these might be additional R2B family substrates in other cell types, such as neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paffenholz and Franke, 1997</xref>). PKP2 was an interactor and hyperphosphorylated in PTPRK KO cells, but its dephosphorylation was not assessed. PKP3 has been proposed to promote the stability of desmosomes upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gurjar et al., 2018</xref>). PKP4 is targeted to both adherens junctions and desmosomes, but its role is less well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatzfeld et al., 2003</xref>). Our finding that PTPRK promotes junctional integrity raises the possibility that dephosphorylation of substrates, such as p120<sup>Cat</sup>, would stabilize cadherin-based junctional assemblies. Interestingly, our ultrastructural analysis showed that PTPRK KO cells have leakier junctions and are shorter and less organized. This is reminiscent of the proposed role of p120<sup>Cat</sup> in controlling epithelial cell lateral domain expansion and shape maturation by balancing junctional contractility and maturation through regulation of E-Cadherin and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), which reportedly depends on p120<sup>Cat</sup> tyrosine phosphorylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Castaño et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fukumoto et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, we show that PTPRK dephosphorylates p120<sup>Cat</sup> in cells, and that PTPRK phosphatase activity is necessary to rescue junctional deficits.</p><p>Afadin appears to be a unique PTPRK substrate; it was not dephosphorylated by the very closely related PTPRM and it had the highest fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in PTPRK KO cells. Strikingly, this specificity is determined in large part by the PTPRK D2 pseudophosphatase domain, which was sufficient to recruit Afadin for dephosphorylation by the PTPRM D1 domain. This might reflect the greater identity between the PTPRK and PTPRM active D1 domains than the D2 domains (78% vs 73.6%). In line with this, we found little evidence for a PTPRK substrate consensus sequence other than a bias against basic residues immediately adjacent to the phosphotyrosine site, similar to previous reports for other PTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). Several RPTPs have tandem intracellular PTP domains and the precise function of the inactive D2 domains remain to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tonks, 2006</xref>). The Janus kinases have a similar tandem arrangement where a pseudokinase domain regulates kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babon et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, regulation of the PTP D1 by D2 domains has been suggested for several RPTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Toledano-Katchalski et al., 2003</xref>). We do observe a three-fold reduction in PTPRK ICD enzyme activity compared to the D1 domain alone. However, when free D2 domain was added to free D1 domain, we saw no impact on activity. Instead, we find a key role for the pseudophosphatase domain in substrate recognition, similar to findings for CD45/PTPRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nam et al., 2005</xref>). We further show that unlike LAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nam et al., 1999</xref>), the PTPRK D2 domain could not easily be reactivated by mutation. Additionally, we rule out a role for the D2 domain in phosphotyrosine recognition using dephosphorylated lysates, vanadate competition and a PTPRK homology model. Several previous reports have shown that wildtype PTPs can interact with substrates, which are presumably in a dephosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and Bennett, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Timms et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, PTPRK might serve as a scaffold for dephosphorylated proteins either by recruiting non-phosphorylated proteins, or by dephosphorylating already phosphorylated proteins upon recruitment. It is likely that the combination of recognition and dephosphorylation is important for full PTPRK function. Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of PTPRK protein recruitment will be an important next step.</p><p>PTPRK and PTPRM both dephosphorylated PARD3, p120<sup>Cat</sup>, PKP3 and PKP4 in lysates. Despite this, hyperphosphorylation of sites on each of these proteins were found in PTPRK KO cells, indicating that PTPRM cannot fully compensate for PTPRK loss. This could be due to lower PTPRM expression levels in MCF10A cells, possible differences in site selectivity or its intrinsically lower catalytic activity (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>). Vertebrate genomes all encode at least 4 R2B family members, with distinct expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For example, by in situ hybridization the receptors display divergent expression patterns in the adult mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besco et al., 2004</xref>). Assuming they are regulated similarly by cell-cell contact, our results indicate that receptor expression patterns will determine subtly distinct responses to cell contact.</p><p>Several phosphosites that are regulated by PTPRK have been characterized previously. p120<sup>Cat</sup>-Y228 is phosphorylated in response to EGFR and a construct with N terminal phosphorylation-deficient mutations (including Y228F) is capable of rescuing adhesion phenotypes caused by p120<sup>cat</sup> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mariner et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, a phosphomimetic p120<sup>Cat</sup> -Y228E mutant increased recruitment of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Castaño et al., 2007</xref>). Afadin Y1237 phosphorylation, the rat equivalent of Human Afadin Y1230, has been shown to mediate recruitment of SHP2, implicating it in Ras-Mitogen activated protein kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakata et al., 2007</xref>). This supports the role of PTPRK-mediated dephosphorylation of this site in tumor suppression.</p><p>PTPRK is the only R2B family member implicated by transposon-based mouse forward genetics in the progression of several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">March et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Starr et al., 2009</xref>) and has been proposed to function as a tumor suppressor. Moreover, specific gene fusions result in its promoter driving the expression of oncogenic RSPO3 in a subset of colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seshagiri et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with PTPRK being the predominant R2B receptor expressed in the mouse intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings of abrogated junction organization, spheroid overgrowth and invasive behavior in PTPRK-deficient cells support its role as a tumor suppressor. Several of the PTPRK substrates identified here have been linked to cancer, including PARD3 loss-of-function in invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de la Rosa et al., 2017</xref>), and oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles for p120<sup>Cat</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schackmann et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, their combined dysregulation could contribute to pathological phenotypes in a PTPRK mutant setting. Compromised epithelial barrier integrity is also linked to inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility; therefore, PTPRK SNPs linked to celiac disease should be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trynka et al., 2011</xref>). Our analysis of PTPRK KO cells showed downregulation of epithelial markers such as Keratin14, and upregulation of several mesenchymal markers such as vitronectin (VTN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). PTPRK is a TGFβ target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and our data suggest it functions to suppress epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), indicating a negative feedback role that could lead to pathological effects if perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brabletz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results provide evidence for cross-talk between PTPRK and growth factor signaling. Although PTPRK does not dephosphorylate EGFR in our assays, consistent with previous peptide assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2009</xref>), we did observe an interaction by BioID. Indeed, EGFR family interactions with R2B receptors have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Growth factor stimulation leads to PTPRK tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>) and it has been suggested that RTK-induced PTP inhibition by oxidation impacts cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reynolds et al., 2003</xref>). PTPs are well-placed to fine-tune and tailor responses to particular cellular contexts. Several PTPRK substrates are phosphorylated in a Src-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>). PTPRK might therefore provide feedback in the context of cell contact by dephosphorylating its substrates to promote junctional integrity. Indeed, overexpression of v-Src in epithelial cells leads to junction disassembly and EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woodcock et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, such PTPs could act as interpreters of the cellular context. Interestingly, an analogous role for the contact-sensing RTK EphA2 was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stallaert et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, by defining the substrate repertoire of human PTPRK, we reveal mechanistic insight into its putative tumor suppressor role through its control of cell-cell junctions and suppression of EMT. Our study raises new questions about the phosphoregulation of junctional proteins and implicates PTPRK as a direct sensor and mediator of cell adhesion. We show that the PTPRK D2 domain is critical for substrate recognition, yet binds proteins independently of phosphorylation status. It will be of great interest to determine whether these findings hold true for other RPTPs. In addition, it is unknown whether the R2B receptor extracellular regions, which were previously described as spacer clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aricescu et al., 2007</xref>), affect phosphatase activity or substrate recruitment. Finally, we show that PTPRK, like other PTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2013</xref>), does not recognize a peptide consensus sequence, unlike certain serine/threonine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shi, 2009</xref>), highlighting the need for the approach we have taken. Thus, we provide a framework for systematically identifying RPTP substrates, which in turn will advance our knowledge of these poorly characterized, yet important enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Image analysis was carried out using Fiji. The Pearson correlation coefficient for two images was determined using the Coloc2 plugin; whilst the fluorescence intensity of an image was analyzed using a custom macro: run(‘Auto Threshold’, ‘method = Default ignore_black white’); run(‘Set Measurements...‘, ‘integrated limit display redirect = None decimal = 3’); run(‘Measure’).</p><p>For spheroids, aberrant spheroids were quantified using bright field images of 6 independent wells of WT and PTPRK KO MCF10A spheroids. three non-overlapping images from each well were manually counted for aberrant spheroids. Spheroid diameter was calculated using the circle measurement tool in Zen Pro (Zeiss). A circle was traced around individual spheroids in whole slide images for WT and PTPRK KO MCF10A spheroids using the Hoechst channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>BrdU incorporation ELISA</title><p>In a 96-well plate, 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> MCF10A cells per well were seeded in 90 μl of complete growth medium and cultured for 2 days. A final concentration of 10 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was added to each well and left to incorporate for 2 hr. A BrdU-based cell proliferation ELISA was then performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Germany). Absorbance was measured at 370 nm (reference wavelength 492 nm) using a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER)</title><p>5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded in 500 μl of complete growth medium onto the apical side of a 0.4 μm pore size Transwell filter (Corning) inserted into a 24-well companion plate containing (Corning) 500 μl of complete growth medium. Cells were cultured for 6–7 days to allow formation of a complete monolayer, with a media change day three and then every day thereafter. Growth medium was replaced 24 hr prior to TEER assessment; 5–10 readings were taken using a Millicell ERS-2 Volt/Ohm meter (Merck Millipore) and a mean was calculated. TEER value was calculated as follows: (Sample average TEER measurement (Ω) – Blank average TEER measurement (Ω)) x Trans-well surface area (0.3 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran cell permeability assay</title><p>Cells were seeded on the apical side of transwell filters as described for TEER experiments. Growth medium was replaced 24 hr prior the addition of 250 kDa-FITC-dextran (3 mg/ml final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich) to the apical side of the insert; cells were then incubated for 24 hr. After 24 hr inserts were removed and the basal media was mixed by gentle pipetting. Per condition, 4 × 100 μl samples were transfer into a 96-well plate and the fluorescence intensity was measured using a 96-well plate fluorimeter (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices) at excitation 494 nm and emission at 515 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Accession codes</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vizcaíno et al., 2016</xref>) with the dataset identifier PXD013055.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank FJ de Sauvage, A-C Gingras, V Pham, J Lill, D Ron and M Weekes for reagents and expertise; M Gratian and M Bowen for microscopy expertise; the CIMR flow cytometry core facility, in particular R Schulte and C Cossetti for their advice and support in cell sorting; G Griffiths, D Larrieu, S Munro, and A Schuldt for critical reading of the manuscript.

Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.

However, we would encourage you to resubmit if you can provide an additional piece of data, as described below.</p><p>The paper presents a detailed study of a receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPRK, which was suspected to form homophilic interactions and respond to cell contact. PTPRK gene fusions are found in some cancers, and expression is induced by TGFb. The authors used quantitative proteomics with a &quot;substrate trapping&quot; mutant, expressed in bacteria, to pull out and identify potential substrates. Specificity was confirmed by Westerns, using the related PTP, PTPRM, as a specificity control. They then made PTPRK KO MCF10A cells and identified pY sites undergoing increased phosphorylation. There was an increase in several cell-cell junction proteins, including ones identified as binding to the substrate trapping mutant. BioID confirmed interactions between PTPRK and the proposed substrates in confluent MCF10A cells. Substrates were then tested for dephosphorylation by PTPRK in vitro. MCF10A cell lysates were incubated with recombinant PTPRK. p120Ctn and Afadin (AF6) were dephosphorylated and the sites identified. Three other substrates were identified with high confidence and several others as good candidates. They demonstrate the importance of the pseudophosphatase domain, as well as the phosphatase domain, in substrate recognition. Finally, PTPRK KO alters junction status in MCF10A cells, and alters growth and 3D acini formation. The data showing discrete colocalization of PTPRK and junctional proteins are also nice.</p><p>What sets this paper apart is that many different proteomics approaches were used to identify proteins that appear to be substrates in vivo. The use of MCF10A knockouts and reconstituting with wildtype PTPRK or the phosphatase dead mutant is a real plus. However, what is missing is direct evidence of the importance of any of the identified PTPRK sites in cell-cell junction proteins in the integrity of cell-cell junctions, or whether D1 PTP activity is required to reverse the observed MCF10A cell phenotypes. Reviewers are bound to ask and it would not be productive send it for review only to have it rejected because the significance of the phosphatase activity isn't clear. We would not expect the relevance of individual substrates or pY sites to be established, but it is important to test whether the PTP activity is required.</p><p>Less major points include whether the in vitro interactions with the WT PTPRK ICD or the substrate trapping mutant D1 domains were in fact dependent on pTyr residues, i.e. they did not treat the lysate with recombinant PTP prior to doing the pulldowns. A significant number of proteins bound selectively to the WT PTPRK ICD vs beads, but since the D1 catalytic domain was active, presumably these interactions were not pTyr dependent. This raises the general issue of the extent to which PTPRK interacting proteins associate directly via a target pTyr as opposed to secondary interactions, for instance those with the inactive D2 domain. In this regard, their model that D2 might recruit targets for D1 does not make much sense, unless the protein has two pTyr residues, since a pTyr bound to D2 would be protected from dephosphorylation by D1.</p><p>Another issue that is not discussed is whether there is a primary sequence preference for sites dephosphorylated by D1 – they have a number of identified sites but there is no sequence comparison.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for in depth peer review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The homophilic receptor PTPRK selectively dephosphorylates multiple junctional regulators to promote cell-cell adhesion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They have used a wide variety of different approaches to achieve this goal, including recombinant substrate trapping protein pull down AP-MS proteomics combined with BirA tagging BioID detection of proteins in the vicinity of PTPRK in cells, and pTyr proteomics with PTPRK knockout MCF10A cells, reconstituted with WT or a catalytically-dead PTPRK mutant, to identify pTyr sites that changed when PTPRK activity was increased or decreased. These studies led to the identification of Afadin, PARD3, p120 catenin and PKP3 and PKP4, proteins that are all functionally linked to cell-cell junctions, as candidate specific substrates for PTPRK. By in vitro dephosphorylation of cell lysate proteins with recombinant PTPRK-ICD, using recombinant PTPRM-ICD as a specificity control, they identified two pTyr sites in p120 catenin that could be directly dephosphorylated by PTPRK. Finally, using the MCF10A PTPRK knockout cells, they showed that these cells exhibit defects in E-cadherin junctional contacts, and that re-expression of WT, but not catalytically-dead PTPRK, was able to partially restore the presence of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions.</p><p>The identification of a small set of specific pTyr substrates for PTPRK is an advance in our understanding of this receptor PTP. The known junctional functions of the specific substrates clearly points towards a role for PTPRK in controlling cell-cell junctions, and the confirmatory evidence that PTPRK D1 catalytic activity is required for formation of proper cell-cell junctions and establishment of transepithelial electrical resistance is reasonable, although the rescue observed upon re-expression of PTPRK in the knockout cells was only partial. However, although in the resubmitted version, which now contains a massive amount of data, the authors addressed many of the concerns raised about the original version of the paper, they have fallen short of establishing that PTPRK-mediated dephosphorylaion of any of one the identified substrates is important for cell-cell junctions. It would strengthen the paper if they could provide evidence for this by expressing a mutant form of one (or more) of their substrates in which the PTPRK pTyr sites are mutated.</p><p>1) All the proteomic experiments were carried out with exogenously expressed PTPRK constructs. Did the authors carry also out a conventional IP/MS analysis of proteins associated with endogenous PTPRK using the anti-PTPRK mAb they have generated (an alternative would be to knock a tag into the PTPRK locus) to compare with the substrate trapping lysate pull down data and confirm interaction with the identified targets? Admittedly, this will be more challenging, but the endogenous PTPRK will be physically adjacent to likely interactors at epithelial junctions, and this could promote interactions not so readily detectable by pull downs from cell lysates where the proteins will be diluted and the contents of all the different cellular compartments will be mixed. In part their BioID data are informative in establishing that some of the candidate substrates are in the vicinity of PTPRK in the cell, but they did not use BioID to look for additional substrates for PTPRK.</p><p>2) Did the authors compare pTyr proteomes of confluent and sparse WT and knockout MCF10A cells to determine if cell-cell contact triggers PTPRK-dependent dephosphorylation events?</p><p>3) The evidence that some of the substrate-PTPRK interactions are independent of catalytic function implies, as the authors suggest, that PTPRK also has a scaffolding unction. However, they provide no insights into how these scaffolding interactions occur (i.e. what domains are involved?), and so we do not learn how important such interactions are for dephosphorylation of these substrates in the cell (or in vitro).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an informative and rather heroic paper that identifies potential substrates for the membrane-bound receptor tyrosine phosphatase K (RPTPK). The authors identify and reasonably-validate a number of substrates and illustrate the complexities of tackling this problem (phosphatase-independent interactions etc). Many of these candidates are interesting proteins found at cell-cell junctions (as might be predicted from the junctional localization of RPTPK) and they include proteins, such as afadin, for which the functional consequences of dynamic phosphorylation are not well characterized. Overall, I think that the manuscript already presents a valuable resource for the community that will be the basis for future research.</p><p>Given the wealth of data that is already here, I hesitate to ask for more. But a limitation is that the authors don't have evidence for functional significance of any of the dephosphorylation events that they document. They show that RPTPK supports aspects of junctional integrity (especially barrier function) in a PTP-dependent fashion, but the impact of the manuscript would be enhanced if they could test the principle that one/some of their substrates contributes to this phenotype. The obvious candidate here is p120-catenin which they show to have increased phosphorylation on Y228 and Y904 in RPTPK KO cells. Is this hyperphosphorylation contributing to the epithelial phenotype that they document? One way to test this hypothesis would be to express Y228A/Y904A p120 in their PRPTK KO cells. (Most elegantly on a p120 RNAi background – for which there are good siRNAs available; but overexpression may be effective.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>General comments on the manuscript:</p><p>The general interest of this manuscript to characterize specific substrates, is very important on a larger scheme of understanding RPTP (R2Bs) mechanism of action. This search for PTPRK substrates has also significant importance considering the &quot;tumor suppressive&quot; activities associated with PTPRK function in many cancers. It is in part answering the need to identify PTPRK substrates as potential mechanism of oncogenic development.

The workflow drawings are simple and useful.

The use of MCF10A knockouts and reconstituting with wildtype PTPRK or the phosphatase dead mutant is a real plus. However, what is missing is direct evidence of the importance of any of the identified PTPRK sites in cell-cell junction proteins in the integrity of cell-cell junctions, or whether D1 PTP activity is required to reverse the observed MCF10A cell phenotypes. Reviewers are bound to ask and it would not be productive send it for review only to have it rejected because the significance of the phosphatase activity isn't clear. We would not expect the relevance of individual substrates or pY sites to be established, but it is important to test whether the PTP activity is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that linking alterations in signaling to the observed phenotypes will raise the impact of this work, and as you point out, would be an obvious reviewer comment. However, these experiments are particularly challenging because of a lack of expression level uniformity, which one would anticipate to be particularly important for cell-cell adhesion proteins. Nevertheless, we now include experiments that show that PTPRK partially rescues TEER and colocalization of E-Cadherin and F-actin in MCF10A PTPRK KO cells, in a phosphatase-dependent manner. Unfortunately, we could not detect induction of PTPRK in MCF10A spheroids after 14 days, which would be a key control required to interpret any changes. We conclude that phosphatase activity is an important part of the PTPRK cell adhesion phenotype, however, we also believe there is a key scaffolding function for this receptor, which is highlighted by experiments outlined below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Less major points include whether the in vitro interactions with the WT PTPRK ICD or the substrate trapping mutant D1 domains were in fact dependent on pTyr residues, i.e. they did not treat the lysate with recombinant PTP prior to doing the pulldowns. A significant number of proteins bound selectively to the WT PTPRK ICD vs beads, but since the D1 catalytic domain was active, presumably these interactions were not pTyr dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we too had assumed initially that interactions would depend on phosphotyrosine. The two traps used do have different properties, one allows the formation of a phosphocysteine intermediate (DA), the other relies on the increased affinity of enzyme for its substrate over product (CS). We agree with your analysis that binding of proteins to the WT ICD suggests phosphotyrosine is not critical for the recruitment of most substrates. There are examples in the literature, now included in our Discussion, where binding of substrates to other active, wildtype classical PTPs is observed. In the case of MAP4K4, which was trapped on the DA mutant, we have now demonstrated that this interaction can be completed by vanadate, suggesting it is trapped by phosphotyrosine. In addition, PARD3, PKP4 and p120<sup>Cat</sup> all show reduced binding to the CS trap after pulldowns from calf intestinal phosphatasetreated pervanadate lysates, again suggesting a role for phosphorylation in trapping. Surprisingly, however, we show that most substrates still bind efficiently to PTPRK domains in the absence of phosphorylation. In addition, our data support a key role for the pseudophosphatase domain in recognizing several substrates, which leads to the next issue highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This raises the general issue of the extent to which PTPRK interacting proteins associate directly via a target pTyr as opposed to secondary interactions, for instance those with the inactive D2 domain. In this regard, their model that D2 might recruit targets for D1 does not make much sense, unless the protein has two pTyr residues, since a pTyr bound to D2 would be protected from dephosphorylation by D1.</p></disp-quote><p>We had also initially anticipated that the D2 domain would function as a pTyr trap. This is because key residues in catalytic motifs of the D2 domain (HCS, WPD and Q loop) deviate from D1 sequences and resemble canonical substrate trapping mutants. Previously, the D2 domain of PTPRF (LAR) was reactivated by reverting particular sequences to those found in D1 domains. In fact, we tried exactly this with PTPRK but did not see any effect on D2 activity or binding of key substrates (data now included). This matches with recent results for PTPRE, where the D2 domain could not be reactivated by similar mutations (Lountos et al. PMID:30289412). We also noted that for existing D2 domain crystal structures, the catalytic cysteine is largely occluded (e.g. CD45; Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Unfortunately, there is not a PTPRK-family phosphatase D2 domain structure available, however, we have included a homology model that indicates significant changes in surface charge compared to the D1 such that it would be unlikely to accommodate a phosphate group. Finally, orthovanadate or lysate dephosphorylation was ineffective at depleting Afadin from the D2 domain. We think substrate recognition, in a phosphorylation-independent manner, will be an important area for future research and indicates a putative scaffolding role for these receptors, comprising dephosphorylated proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another issue that is not discussed is whether there is a primary sequence preference for sites dephosphorylated by D1 – they have a number of identified sites but there is no sequence comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a consensus sequence using our high confidence and “likely” substrates and now present a weblogo (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The predominant trend we observe is the absence of basic residues in the pTyr-1 and pTyr+1 positions, which is consistent with the highly positively charged nature of the PTPRK active site excluding interactions with such amino acids. Similar attempts to map a substrate consensus sequence for PTP1B also show a preference for acidic or negatively charged residues N-terminal of the pTyr (Li et al. PMID: 23674824). Thus, there are probably permissive substrate primary sequences, however, given the exquisite selectivity of PTPRK it seems unlikely that primary sequence is the major specificity determinant. As an aside, we revisited work by Barr et al. (PMID: 19167335) that showed PTPRK does not dephosphorylate an EGFR-pY1068 peptide, supporting our work at the protein level where we do not observe dephosphorylation of this site. This is a particularly important negative result as EGFR-pY1068 is one of the most highly cited PTPRK substrates (Xu et al. PMID: 16263724).</p><p>In terms of significance, this is the first unbiased proteomic approach to identify substrates for a classical PTP. Our data suggest that the domains beyond the active enzyme play a key role in substrate recognition, which has also been suggested for some individual PTP substrates (e.g. Timms et al. PMID: 9632768). Our work is of high quality and provides a key step forward for the phosphatase field, by challenging general assumptions about RPTPs, for example, as thresholders of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (e.g. Lee and Bennett PMID: 25319894) and raises the possibility that they function as core signaling scaffolds, similar to RTKs. Moreover, we have shown that PTPRK is a convincing and exciting new player in cell-cell adhesion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. It has the potential to function as a sensor of cell contact, and associates with several known mechanotransduction molecules such as MAP4K4 and RAPGEF6. Thus, two major new questions arise from our work: How (and why) do RPTP pseudophosphatase domains recognize substrates? Is PTPRK an upstream component of mechanosensing and/or mechanotransduction pathways?</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to in depth peer review follow]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The identification of a small set of specific pTyr substrates for PTPRK is an advance in our understanding of this receptor PTP. The known junctional functions of the specific substrates clearly points towards a role for PTPRK in controlling cell-cell junctions, and the confirmatory evidence that PTPRK D1 catalytic activity is required for formation of proper cell-cell junctions and establishment of transepithelial electrical resistance is reasonable, although the rescue observed upon re-expression of PTPRK in the knockout cells was only partial. However, although in the resubmitted version, which now contains a massive amount of data, the authors addressed many of the concerns raised about the original version of the paper, they have fallen short of establishing that PTPRK-mediated dephosphorylaion of any of one the identified substrates is important for cell-cell junctions. It would strengthen the paper if they could provide evidence for this by expressing a mutant form of one (or more) of their substrates in which the PTPRK pTyr sites are mutated.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we show that PTPRK phosphatase activity is required to rescue signalling and cell adhesion phenotypes in KO cells, we agree that additional evidence showing that substrate hyperphosphorylation directly influences junctional integrity would substantially strengthen the paper. However, this would be a significant undertaking, out of scope for this initial study (as agreed by the editors). We believe this would be challenging for several reasons. There are many phosphosites requiring characterisation (&gt; 15 upregulated in PTPRK KO cells), which may, in combination, contribute to the observed phenotypes. Therefore, rescues with phosphorylation-deficient mutant substrates might be masked by the effects of other hyperphosphorylated substrates. Moreover, some substrates have multiple phosphosites to functionally analyse, such as p120<sup>Cat</sup> where 4 phosphosites are altered in PTPRK KO cells. The ideal experiment would be to overexpress phosphomimetic mutants to see if the KO phenotypes are recapitulated on a WT background, but such mutants are unreliable for phosphotyrosine.</p><p>In an attempt to further strengthen the notion that substrate hyperphosphorylation is contributing to the PTPRK KO junctional phenotype, we have added data showing that p120<sup>Cat</sup> (hyperphosphorylated under these conditions) exhibits reduced junctional intensity by immunofluorescence in PTPRK KO vs WT MCF10A. In addition, there are several papers that have investigated the functions of some of the dysregulated sites in other settings, including p120<sup>Cat</sup>-Y228 and Y904 and Afadin Y1230, therefore we have expanded our Discussion to include these references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) All the proteomic experiments were carried out with exogenously expressed PTPRK constructs. Did the authors carry also out a conventional IP/MS analysis of proteins associated with endogenous PTPRK using the anti-PTPRK mAb they have generated (an alternative would be to knock a tag into the PTPRK locus) to compare with the substrate trapping lysate pull down data and confirm interaction with the identified targets? Admittedly, this will be more challenging, but the endogenous PTPRK will be physically adjacent to likely interactors at epithelial junctions, and this could promote interactions not so readily detectable by pull downs from cell lysates where the proteins will be diluted and the contents of all the different cellular compartments will be mixed. In part their BioID data are informative in establishing that some of the candidate substrates are in the vicinity of PTPRK in the cell, but they did not use BioID to look for additional substrates for PTPRK.</p></disp-quote><p>The PTP substrate trapping approach requires hyperphosphorylated substrates, which is readily achieved using pervanadate. IP/MS and BioID/MS approaches are less suitable than pull downs, as pervanadate would interfere with substrate binding for a D&gt;A mutant in a cellular context. Indeed, phosphorylation of some putative PTPRK substrates was critical for successful enrichment using substrate-trapping mutants (e.g. MAP4K4 binding to the D1057A substrate-trapping mutant). However, we now know that phosphorylation-independent interactions between PTPRK and its substrates occur meaning IP/MS and BioID would identify PTP substrates. The Gingras lab has already performed a PTPRK BioID screen (St Denis et al., 2016) and reassuringly several of our PTPRK interactors (and substrates) overlap including PKP2, KIF14, DLG5, DNAJA3, PKP4, PLEKHA5 and PTPN14, despite the use of different cell lines. Recently, IP/MS was also used to identify PTP interactors (Kumar P et al., 2017) in HEK293T cells. This is a less favourable approach for the receptor PTPs due to compromises between solubility and preserving interactions. Indeed, Kumar et al. did not enrich for junctional interactors for PTPRM by IP/MS from HEK293T cells, however, PTPRU interacted with some junctional proteins including Afadin. Overall, the number of interactors is notably fewer for PTPRM and PTPRU than we find for PTPRK. Our main aim was to identify high-confidence substrates for PTPRK, however, we agree that a combination of approaches, in different cell lines, would identify additional substrate candidates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Did the authors compare pTyr proteomes of confluent and sparse WT and knockout MCF10A cells to determine if cell-cell contact triggers PTPRK-dependent dephosphorylation events?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not do this experiment; however, it is an interesting suggestion. Wild type MCF10A cells experience cell-cell contact when subconfluent, tending to grow in tightly associated ‘islands’ that collectively migrate to form a confluent monolayer. PTPRK localises to filopodial contacts between individual cells. In line with the presence of PTPRK at early contacts, we note that PTPRK KO cells do not coalesce to the same extent as wildtype cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting an early adhesion defect. It is therefore likely that signaling differences are occurring even at this early stage and would be worth analysing, with the caveat that contact-mediated kinase signaling (e.g. Eph receptors) might be compromised at low confluence.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44597.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44597-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The evidence that some of the substrate-PTPRK interactions are independent of catalytic function implies, as the authors suggest, that PTPRK also has a scaffolding unction. However, they provide no insights into how these scaffolding interactions occur (i.e. what domains are involved?), and so we do not learn how important such interactions are for dephosphorylation of these substrates in the cell (or in vitro).</p></disp-quote><p>We do provide evidence that the D2 domains of PTPRK and PTPRM can determine interaction specificity (NUFIP2, Afadin), however, we concede that the domains of PTPRK substrates that determine their interactions have not been mapped. These will be important future experiments to understand the full range of signalling that can be mediated by these receptors through their substrates and interaction partners.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Given the wealth of data that is already here, I hesitate to ask for more. But a limitation is that the authors don't have evidence for functional significance of any of the dephosphorylation events that they document. They show that RPTPK supports aspects of junctional integrity (especially barrier function) in a PTP-dependent fashion, but the impact of the manuscript would be enhanced if they could test the principle that one/some of their substrates contributes to this phenotype. The obvious candidate here is p120-catenin which they show to have increased phosphorylation on Y228 and Y904 in RPTPK KO cells. Is this hyperphosphorylation contributing to the epithelial phenotype that they document? One way to test this hypothesis would be to express Y228A/Y904A p120 in their PRPTK KO cells. (Most elegantly on a p120 RNAi background – for which there are good siRNAs available; but overexpression may be effective.)</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comments addressing a similar point from reviewer #1. This is a great suggestion, however, one of the challenges we could anticipate is achieving similar levels of expression in neighbouring confluent cells to achieve a rescue of junctional integrity. Constructs for p120<sup>Cat</sup> with phosphorylation-deficient mutants at Y174, Y228, Y904 and Y865 would have to be stably integrated via lentiviral transduction or introduced via a safe harbour site (as suggested by reviewer #3) into PTPRK KO MCF10A cells. This experiment has been done in part demonstrating that phosphorylation deficient mutants affecting tyrosines 112, 228, 257, 280, 291, 296, 302 could rescue p120<sup>Cat</sup> null adhesion phenotypes (Mariner et al., 2004). This is at least consistent with the idea that dephosphorylated p120<sup>Cat</sup> promotes adhesion. It might be simpler to test the impact of Y1230F on Afadin. However, Afadin knockdown has a dramatic impact on cell-cell adhesion meaning the mutant form would have to rescue this first, which might make interpreting PTPRK KO junctional phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, Afadin is a large protein (&gt;1800 AAs) presenting additional challenges with cell line generation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Considering the rebuttal letter, four specific questions were answered by authors in this resubmission.</p><p>- Comments on answer to “However, what is missing is direct evidence of the importance of any of the identified PTPRK sites in cell-cell junction proteins in the integrity of cell-cell junctions, or whether D1 PTP activity is required to reverse the observed MCF10A cell phenotypes.”.</p><p>These are indeed valuable experiments.

Indeed, studies on DLAR suggest its D2 domain binds phosphopeptides (Madan et al., 2011). The PTPRK D2 domain possesses a WPD&gt;WAS mutation in its WPD-Loop, resembling a D&gt;A substrate trapping mutant.
