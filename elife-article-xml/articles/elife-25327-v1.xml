Fusion involves complex formation between SNARE proteins anchored to adjacent membranes. How and in what form interacting SNARE proteins reach their sites of action is virtually unknown. We have addressed this problem in the context of plant cell division in which a large number of TGN-derived membrane vesicles fuse with one another to form the partitioning membrane. Blocking vesicle formation at the TGN revealed <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes. These inactive cytokinetic SNARE complexes were already assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum and, after passage through Golgi/TGN to the cell division plane, transformed into fusogenic SNARE complexes. This mode of trafficking might ensure delivery of large stoichiometric quantities of SNARE proteins required for forming the partitioning membrane in the narrow time frame of plant cytokinesis. Such long-distance trafficking of inactive SNARE complexes would also facilitate directional growth processes during cell differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25327.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25327.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SNARE complex</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ju 179/19-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jürgens</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SNARE proteins are delivered as complexes already from the endoplasmic reticulum along the secretory pathway to the cell division plane to mediate the formation of the partitioning membrane by vesicle fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokinesis partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. In non-plant eukaryotes, a contractile actomyosin ring strongly reduces the area of contact between the forming daughter cells. Consequently, little membrane expansion has to be supported by membrane traffic and fusion, which can largely be afforded by local recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nakayama, 2016</xref>). In contrast, dividing plant cells lack the contractile actomyosin ring and thus have to make a large partitioning membrane – named cell plate – which is progressively formed from the centre to the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Müller and Jürgens, 2016</xref>). The cell plate originates from membrane vesicles that fuse with one another upon delivery to the plane of cell division along the highly dynamic microtubules of the phragmoplast. Membrane fusion during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cytokinesis requires a cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE (aka syntaxin) named KNOLLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lauber et al., 1997</xref>), which forms two distinct functionally overlapping SNARE complexes by interaction with different sets of promiscuous SNARE partners: (i) QaQbcR-complex containing Qbc-SNARE SNAP33 and R-SNARE VAMP721 or VAMP722, and (ii) QaQbQcR-complex containing Qb-SNARE NPSN11, Qc-SNARE SYP71 and R-SNARE VAMP721 or VAMP722 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">El Kasmi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Heese et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>). The formation of these <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes requires the cytokinesis-specific action of the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) protein KEULE, which interacts with monomeric KNOLLE but not with the assembled KNOLLE-containing SNARE complex at the plane of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Park et al., 2012</xref>). It is not known in what form the SNARE proteins reside on the vesicles prior to the action of the SM protein. One possibility is that each SNARE protein is trafficked separately and kept in its monomeric form until fusion. Alternatively, one or more SNARE proteins might form inactive complexes. Or there might be a mixture of vesicles, some bearing the R-SNARE and others a preassembled Q-SNARE complex. Here, we examine in what form – monomers or complexes – SNARE proteins are present on the cytokinetic vesicles and where along the trafficking pathway complexes of cytokinetic SNARE proteins might be formed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE KNOLLE is made during late G2/M phase and turned over rapidly at the end of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lauber et al., 1997</xref>). Newly synthesised KNOLLE protein is inserted into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffics along the secretory pathway via Golgi stack and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) to the plane of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>). Upon cell-plate formation, KNOLLE is endocytosed and targeted via multivesicular body (MVB) to the vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike the situation in mammals, yeast and most flowering plants, secretory traffic in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is insensitive to the fungal toxin brefeldin A (BFA). BFA inhibits the ARF-activating guanine-nucleotide exchange reaction of sensitive ARF-GEFs, thus preventing the formation of transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mossessova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Renault et al., 2003</xref>). We have engineered in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> a BFA-inducible system with which secretory traffic can be blocked at two specific sites along the route, ER and TGN. Relevant BFA-insensitive ARF-GEFs, human GBF1-related GNL1 or human BIG1-related BIG3, were eliminated by mutation, leaving BFA-sensitive GNOM and BIG1,2,4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Richter et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2014</xref>). Consequently, BFA treatment of <italic>gnl1</italic> mutant plants prevents recruitment of COPI coat complexes to the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi membrane, causing collapse of the ER-Golgi traffic. Qa-SNARE KNOLLE is thus retained in the ER and cytokinesis is impaired, resulting in binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Richter et al., 2007</xref>). Late-secretory traffic from the TGN to the plane of cell division requires the formation of AP-1 complex-coated transport vesicles, which depends on the action of four functionally overlapping ARF-GEFs BIG1 to BIG4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Richter et al., 2014</xref>). Mutational inactivation of the sole BFA-resistant ARF-GEF BIG3 renders AP-1 vesicle formation BFA-sensitive. KNOLLE is thus retained at TGN membrane aggregates called BFA compartments and cytokinesis is impaired, resulting in binucleate cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Richter et al., 2014</xref>). To examine in what form – monomeric or part of complex – KNOLLE is delivered to the plane of cell division, we inhibited secretory traffic by BFA treatment of <italic>gnl1</italic> and <italic>big3</italic> mutants. However, BFA treatment would inhibit secretory traffic in some dividing cells but not in others because the cells in the developing seedling root divide asynchronously. To overcome this limitation, we used β-estradiol (EST)-inducible expression of KNOLLE SNARE partners NPSN11 or SNAP33 fused to a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zuo et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, neither YFP:NPSN11 nor GFP:SNAP33 was expressed without EST treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), which is a prerequisite for the detection of newly-made cytokinesis-specific SNARE complexes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25327.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Site-specific inhibition of SNARE protein trafficking to the cell-division plane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Qa-SNARE KNOLLE trafficking route in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reichardt et al., 2007</xref>).

Seedlings were then live-imaged for YFP:NPSN11 or GFP:SNAP33. The two fusion proteins accumulated in TGN-containing BFA compartments; this was in contrast to the strong labeling of cell plates in wild-type seedlings expressing BFA-resistant BIG3 ARF-GEF or in <italic>big3</italic> mutant seedlings not treated with BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). The frequency of cells undergoing cytokinesis was not altered by BFA treatment of wild-type or mutant seedlings, as evidenced by immunostaining of phragmoplast microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of BFA-treated <italic>big3</italic> mutant seedlings expressing EST-inducible YFP:NPSN11 revealed the presence of Qb-SNARE NPSN11 fused to YFP, Qa-SNARE KNOLLE, Qc-SNARE SYP71 and R-SNARE VAMP721/722 as well as the absence of Qbc-SNARE SNAP33 in the anti-GFP precipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, only the members of the KNOLLE-NPSN11-SYP71-VAMP721/722 complex were co-immunoprecipitated whereas the SNARE partner SNAP33 from the other KNOLLE-containing SNARE complex was not. The converse was observed in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis of <italic>big3</italic> mutant seedlings expressing the EST-inducible Qbc-SNARE member of the other KNOLLE complex, GFP:SNAP33. Qc-SNARE SYP71 was not detected in the co-immunoprecipitate, in contrast to the members of the trimeric KNOLLE complex Qbc-SNARE GFP:SNAP33, Qa-SNARE KNOLLE and R-SNARE VAMP721/722 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, the interaction detected by co-immunoprecipitation was exclusively confined to members of the KNOLLE-containing complex that contained the EST-induced SNARE partner, strongly suggesting that only direct interactions between SNARE complex members were detected. Further co-immunoprecipitation experiments with non-EST-induced seedlings demonstrated that co-immunoprecipitation of KNOLLE indeed required the EST-induced expression of YFP:NPSN11 or GFP:SNAP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, to rule out that these complexes might have formed during the immunoprecipitation procedure, we mixed the protein extracts with varying amounts of extract from <italic>KNOLLE::mCherry:KNOLLE</italic> transgenic seedlings before immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP beads. Neither 1x nor 10x mCherry:KNOLLE addition changed the amount of KNOLLE-containing SNARE complex formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also addressed whether BFA treatment might stimulate the formation of KNOLLE-containing SNARE complexes. To this end, we compared protein extracts from untreated wild-type seedlings with those from BFA-treated wild-type seedlings. No obvious difference in KNOLLE complex formation was detected between treated and untreated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As an additional control, we examined whether EST-induced KNOLLE-partners GFP:SNAP33 and YFP:NPSN11 co-immunoprecipitated the Qa-SNARE PEP12 (aka SYP21). PEP12 is normally located at the multivesicular body (MVB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">da Silva Conceição et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Müller et al., 2003</xref>), and was also relocated to the same BFA compartments as was YFP:NPSN11 in BFA-treated <italic>big3</italic> mutant seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Neither SNAP33 nor NPSN11 interacted with mRFP-tagged PEP12 whereas both did interact with KNOLLE, confirming the specificity of the co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results indicate that KNOLLE forms part of a SNARE complex before the initiation of the fusion process at the plane of cell division. Thus, KNOLLE seems to be transported as part of two different <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes from the TGN to the plane of cell division. These assembled SNARE complexes comprise either (i) KNOLLE, SNAP33 and VAMP721/722 or (ii) KNOLLE, NPSN11, SYP71 and VAMP721/722.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25327.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Interaction analysis of cytokinetic SNAREs with traffic blocked at the TGN.</title><p>Wild-type (WT) and <italic>big3</italic> mutant seedlings carrying estradiol-inducible <italic>YFP:NPSN11</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) or <italic>GFP:SNAP33</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) transgenes were treated with 50 µM BFA for 30 min followed by 50 µM BFA + 20 µM estradiol for 210 min (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>).

This implies that <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes (i.e. residing on the same membrane) are delivered to the division plane where they are transformed into fusogenic <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complexes linking adjacent membrane vesicles. These observations also explain the requirement for the SM protein KEULE during cell-plate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Breaking up <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes by the action of NSF ATPase, which normally occurs following the fusion of membrane vesicles with the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rizo and Südhof, 2012</xref>) would result in back-folding of the monomeric Qa-SNARE to prevent re-formation of the <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complex. In cytokinesis, however, SM protein KEULE interacts with Qa-SNARE KNOLLE to keep it open as a prerequisite for the formation of the fusogenic <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Park et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25327.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Trafficking of <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes during cytokinesis (model).</title><p>Two different types of cytokinetic <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes are assembled on the ER, recruited into COPII vesicles and passed on to the Golgi stack/TGN.

The four-helical bundle of the SNARE domains is very stable, requiring ATP hydrolysis for its disassembly. Because of its stability, the assembled <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complex is physiologically inactive, not interacting with other SNARE proteins. (ii) Moreover, this might be a highly economic strategy of meeting the sharply rising demand for membrane-fusion capacity during cytokinesis when the equivalent of about one-third of the cell surface area has to be produced in the plane of cell division in a narrow time frame of about 30 min. In animal cytokinesis, the problem is largely solved by reducing the surface area through the constriction by the contractile ring that pulls in the plasma membrane. The remaining gap in the centre of the division plane is then closed by vesicle fusion that is mediated by plasma membrane SNARE proteins present throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Low et al., 2003</xref>) and/or by ESCRTIII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014</xref>). Apart from plant cytokinesis, any major expansion of the eukaryotic cell surface area requires enhanced membrane fusion capacity that cannot easily be matched by the local recycling of plasma membrane-resident SNARE proteins whereas the long-distance delivery of inactive <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complexes proposed here would meet the requirement.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plant material, Growth Condition and Transformation</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [NCBITaxon:3702] wild-type (Columbia, Col), <italic>pKNOLLE::mCherry:KNOLLE</italic> or mutant plants were grown on soil or media (1/2 MS medium, 0.1% MES, pH 5.6) at 23°C in continuous light condition. <italic>big3</italic> homozygous plants were transformed with <italic>pMDC7::GFP:SNAP33</italic> or <italic>pMDC7::YFP:NPSN11</italic> using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> [NCBITaxon:358]-mediated floral dipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Clough and Bent, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Richter et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mohan Balsubramanian as Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.

The use of a combination of approaches including genetics, imaging, biochemistry, and inhibitor studies was also appreciated. However, a few issues have been raised, all of which should be possible to be accomplished with the tools already available in your laboratory.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The possibility that SNARE molecules could assemble into the complexes during procedures of immunoprecipitation should be ruled out.

It would be effective to add excessive amounts of purified proteins of or plant lysates containing KNOLLE and/or VAMP721 with specific tags into the reactions to show the exogenous proteins do not affect the amounts of the SNARE complexs.</italic> </p><p>This criticism questions the general reliability of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, which are believed to reveal protein-protein interactions that occur in the living cell before its destruction.</p><p>In our study, we took care to reveal specific interactions by using two relevant controls:</p><p>1) KNOLLE forms 2 different SNARE complexes, as reported by us before (El Kasmi et al., 2013,): (i) KNOLLE, NPSN11, SYP71, VAMP721/722; (ii) KNOLLE, SNAP33, VAMP721/722. Furthermore, we have shown that those two complexes both contribute to cell plate formation. By immunoprecipitating the member of one complex (e.g. YFP-NPSN11) we co-immunoprecipitated other SNARE partners from the same KNOLLE complex (e.g. SYP71) but not a member of the other complex (e.g. SNAP33) and vice versa.</p><p>2) We also checked for the presence of the endosomal syntaxin (aka Qa-SNARE) PEP12 (aka SYP21) in the precipitate, again a negative result. Thus, we can exclude the possibility that our extraction procedure might disrupt selective protein-protein interactions and/or might lead to false positive signals because of insufficient solubilisation of the membranes on which the SNARE proteins reside. We hope that these controls are sufficient to demonstrate specificity of SNARE interaction in our co-IP experiments.</p><p>We would like to mention yet another evidence for the reliability of our co-IP procedure. We have reported that the linker sequence of KNOLLE is a binding site for the regulatory SEC1-like SM protein, KEULE, as shown by yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation (Park et al., 2012). In that experiment, only KNOLLE was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-KEU but not tagged KNOLLE lacking its authentic linker sequence. Furthermore, the constitutively active form of KNOLLE was not co-immunoprecipitated with HA-KEU in the same experimental condition. These findings essentially rule out the possibility of non-specific assembly of SNARE complexes during protein preparation under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Due to limited material, we have used KN::mCherry:KNOLLE rather than KN::Myc-KN. We have performed the mixing experiment as proposed by adding to the experimental extract the same amount or 10x the amount of extract from <italic>KN::mCherry-KN</italic> transgenic seedlings before immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP beads. The results are shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and mentioned in the text as follows: &quot;In addition, to rule out that these complexes might have formed during the immunoprecipitation procedure, we mixed the protein extracts with varying amounts of extract from <italic>KN::mCherry:KNOLLE</italic> transgenic seedlings before immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP beads. Neither 1x nor 10x mCherry:KNOLLE addition changed the amount of KNOLLE-containing SNARE complex formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>)&quot;.</p><p><italic>2) The immunoprecipitation experiments should be also accompanied by control using non-induced plants, Y:N11 and G:S33 plants without the EST treatment, which is useful to firmly show that authors detected only de-novo-synthesized proteins.</italic> </p><p>We showed images of non-induced seedling root cells in which the KNOLLE signal was present at the cell plate but no signal of YFP-NPSN11 or GFP-SNAP33 was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>).</p><p>We have performed the control experiments proposed, and the results of the immunoprecipitation analysis of non-induced seedlings are shown in a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and referred to in the text as follows: &quot;Further co-immunoprecipitation experiments with non-EST-induced seedlings demonstrated that co-immunoprecipitation of KNOLLE indeed required the EST-induced expression of YFP:NPSN11 or GFP:SNAP33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (comment #2).&quot; Because the co-IP experiment covers the Western blot analysis of total protein extract proposed above the latter has been omitted.</p><p><italic>3) It will be interesting to know if Keule is present in any of your GFP immune complexes, given its important role in cell plate formation.</italic> </p><p>We have shown before that SEC1-like SM protein KEULE only interacts with monomeric KNOLLE, but not with the assembled KNOLLE complexes (using co-IP as well as pull-down from lysate with recombinant proteins). In addition, KEULE and KNOLLE only meet at the cell plate, but not prior to their arrival at that site (Park et al., 2012). When trafficking is blocked with BFA, KEULE still gets to the plane of division. Consistently, KEULE is not required for targeting of KNOLLE to the cell plate, and KNOLLE is not required for KEULE to get to the division plane (Waizenegger et al., Curr. Biol. 10, 1371; Park et al., 2012).</p><p><italic>4) The entire manuscript is based on drug treatments and it remains a possibility that BFA induces certain identity changes to the compartments or cytokinetic cells. Hence, the drug itself could actually stimulate complex assembly, which may not occur in its absense. It would be very nice if the authors could show the SNARE complexes at the ER in the absence of BFA. There are possibly several possibilities to follow, but overexpression of SEC12 could for example retain the SNARE complex in a drug free manner.</italic> </p><p>We admit that there is a theoretical possibility that BFA might stimulate complex assembly. However, we consider this highly unlikely because of our several years of experience with BFA interference of membrane trafficking. The primary target of BFA has been identified as the SEC7 domain of ARF-GEFs in yeast and in Arabidopsis, and in both systems, BFA-sensitive ARF-GEFs have been rendered BFA-resistant. By rendering all three yeast ARF-GEFs (Gea1, Gea2, Sec7) BFA-resistant, yeast was enabled to grow on BFA-containing medium, indicating that there are no other essential BFA targets in yeast (Peyroche et al., 1999, Mol Cell 3, 275-285). We have also rendered BFA-sensitive ARF-GEFs BFA-resistant and vice versa by introducing single amino acid residue changes (M to L or L to M) (Geldner et al., 2003, Cell 112, 219-230; Richter et al., 2007; Richter et al., 2011, Nat Cell Biol 14, 80-86; Richter et al., 2014). In addition, the structure of the SEC7 domain complexed with the GDP-GTP exchange inhibitor BFA has been resolved (Mossessova et al., 2003; Renault et al., 2003). From a functional perspective, we have shown that BFA treatment resulting in BFA compartments can selectively effect either non-polar secretion of newly-synthesised auxin-efflux carrier PIN1 or the polar recycling of PIN1, depending on which of the endosomal ARF-GEFs, BIG3 or GNOM is (rendered) BFA-resistant (Richter et al., 2014). This specific example clearly demonstrates that the specific BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF(s) determines the physiological outcome of BFA treatment.</p><p>To address the possibility that BFA itself might stimulate SNARE complex assembly, we compared SNARE complex formation in BFA-treated with non-treated wild-type seedlings that expressed YFP-NPSN11 or GFP-SNAP33 by immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP beads. The results are shown as a new panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and mentioned in the text as follows: &quot;We also addressed whether BFA treatment might stimulate the formation of KNOLLE-containing SNARE complexes. To this end, we compared protein extracts from untreated wild-type seedlings with those from BFA-treated wild-type seedlings. No obvious difference in KNOLLE complex formation was detected between treated and untreated seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>)&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
