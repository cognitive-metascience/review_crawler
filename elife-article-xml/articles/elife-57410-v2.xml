specific responses through a common, extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent cascade. It has been suggested that signaling specificity can be achieved through precise temporal regulation of ERK activity. Given the wide distrubtion of ERK susbtrates across different subcellular compartments, it is important to understand how ERK activity is temporally regulated at specific subcellular locations. To address this question, we have expanded the toolbox of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based ERK biosensors by creating a series of improved biosensors targeted to various subcellular regions via sequence specific motifs to measure spatiotemporal changes in ERK activity. Using these sensors, we showed that EGF induces sustained ERK activity near the plasma membrane in sharp contrast to the transient activity observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, EGF-induced plasma membrane ERK activity involves Rap1, a noncanonical activator, and controls cell morphology and EGF-induced membrane protrusion dynamics. Our work strongly supports that spatial and temporal regulation of ERK activity is integrated to control signaling specificity from a single extracellular signal to multiple cellular processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERK</kwd><kwd>PC12</kwd><kwd>spatiotemporal</kwd><kwd>EGF</kwd><kwd>Rap1</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA197622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK073368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12GM068524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trejo</surname><given-names>JoAnn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An individual extracellular signal regulates multiple cellular actions through differences in the temporal dynamics of spatially distinct populations of the central signaling enzyme, extracellular-signal regulated kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to its central role in signal transduction, extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) has been the subject of intense study for over three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seger and Krebs, 1995</xref>); this research has elucidated many of the key mechanisms of ERK regulation. This pathway is utilized by a host of different extracellular cues to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keshet and Seger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roskoski, 2012</xref>). However, studies have shown that ERK is also critically involved in regulating many other cellular processes, such as cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendoza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>), cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chambard et al., 2007</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jo et al., 2014</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>), insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozaki et al., 2016</xref>), or even apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cagnol and Chambard, 2010</xref>). The variety of processes induced through the ERK pathway presents a conundrum: how do extracellular cues specifically regulate the ERK pathway to induce the proper cellular response?</p><p>The canonical mode of regulation is activation by phosphorylation at the end of a kinase cascade. ERK is phosphorylated by the protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), which is first activated by the protein kinase Raf. Raf kinases are activated through the GTPase Ras, which is activated downstream of extracellular signals such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roskoski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canagarajah et al., 1997</xref>). However, because ERK is activated by phosphorylation by a host of divergent extracellular signals, more complex modes of regulation must exist in order to direct ERK activity toward appropriate responses.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that different extracellular signals induce distinct temporal patterns of ERK activation to encode specific signaling information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref>). For example, in model cell lines such as PC12 or MCF7, EGF treatment leads to transient ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation, whereas alternate extracellular signals such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) or heregulin, respectively, induces sustained ERK phosphorylation and cell differentiation. In the case of PC12 cells, the latter includes neurite formation and an enlarged cell body, modeling differentiated neurons. However, previous studies primarily used immunoblotting techniques to monitor ERK activation dynamics. While this technique has yielded crucial information, it is ultimately limited in its spatiotemporal resolution and unable to resolve single-cell behavior or differential dynamics between subcellular compartments.</p><p>ERK substrates have been identified in many subcellular compartments including at the Golgi Apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jesch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shaul and Seger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wainstein and Seger, 2016</xref>), at the mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagdas et al., 2019</xref>), and near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendoza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>). However, studies investigating the spatial regulation of ERK have primarily focused on understanding its activation and role in shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, leaving the regulation and function of ERK in other subcellular compartments relatively unexplored. We hypothesize that spatial compartmentalization of ERK activity is required for signaling specificity in order for signals such as EGF to regulate different functional responses via distinct compartmentalized ERK activity. To test our hypothesis, we utilized genetically encoded molecular tools to visualize and perturb the activities of specific subcellular pools of endogenous ERK. Using this native biochemistry approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sample et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mehta and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), we discovered that ERK activity associated with the plasma membrane exhibits distinct temporal dynamics in contrast to cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of ERK. We further dissected the mechanism of this distinct regulation and discovered that plasma membrane ERK activity is required for regulating Rac1 and controlling actin protrusion dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EGF-induced ERK activity is transient in the cytoplasm but sustained near the plasma membrane</title><p>While previous studies revealed that the temporal dynamics of ERK activation play a pivotal role in promoting specific cellular responses to extracellular stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herbst et al., 2011</xref>), studies on the spatial activation of ERK in signal transduction has been mostly focused on its translocation to the nucleus despite the fact that ERK has hundreds of substrates in other subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoon and Seger, 2006</xref>). For example, ERK has several known substrates near the plasma membrane, including Focal Adhesion Kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>) and the actin-effector Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we sought to determine whether a single extracellular signal could induce different activity dynamics of spatially distinct pools of ERK to promote functional cellular processes. To address this question, we developed a new toolset of genetically encoded, spatially localized fluorescent biosensors based on the ERK Kinase Activity Reporter (EKAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herbst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>), an engineered fluorescent ERK substrate that will exhibit different FRET properties in response to phosphorylation by ERK. These biosensors consist of two fluorescent proteins flanking a WW phosphopeptide-binding domain, a linker region, and an ERK-specific substrate domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon phosphorylation of the substrate sequence by ERK, the WW phosphopeptide-binding domain interacts with the phosphorylated substrate sequence, bringing the two fluorescent proteins into close proximity, thereby increasing FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stryer, 1978</xref>). Thus, by expressing the biosensor within cells, one can monitor ERK activity in living cells in real-time by exciting the donor fluorescent protein and measuring the changes in the ratio of acceptor to donor fluorescence, yellow over cyan (Y/C), which is often reported as a percent increase over basal signal. Previous versions of EKAR include EKAR-EV, EKAR2G, and EKAR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fritz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sparta et al., 2015</xref>). While each of these biosensors has improved upon past biosensors, each of their reported average response to EGF is below 50%, which limits their utility to be used when targeted to specific subcellular locations. In seeking to develop a new EKAR biosensor with sufficient dynamic range in order to maximize signal when the biosensor is restrained to specific locations, we found that switching the positions of the fluorescent proteins within the EKAR-EV biosensor such that Ypet was positioned C-terminally and ECFP was positioned N-terminally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) yielded a biosensor that generated an 74.5 ± 2.3% increase in the Y/C emission ratio in PC-12 cells (n = 83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also directly compared EKAR4 to EKAR2G1 and EKAR-EV in HEK-293 cells and observed a significantly improved dynamic range from the previous biosensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that this enhanced EKAR, which we have termed EKAR4, can then be targeted to specific subcellular locations, such as the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, or nucleus, to enable reliable tracking of ERK temporal dynamics in these specific locations. Thus, we used a Nuclear export signal (NES) to create a cytosolic targeted EKAR4 (cytoEKAR4), a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) to create a nuclear targeted EKAR4 (nuclearEKAR4), and the hypervariable region of KRas including a polylysine and CAAX box sequence to create a plasma membrane-localized EKAR4 (pmEKAR4), each of which displayed correct localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Herbst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeted, FRET-based ERK biosensors reveal differential temporal dynamics of subcellular ERK activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of improved ERK-kinase activity reporter (EKAR4).

In this time course, we observe a dramatic increase in phosphorylated ERK 7.5 min after EGF treatment, followed by a dramatic decrease by 15 min. It is interesting that after 15 min we see a slight increase in phospho-ERK at the 30- and 40 min time points. The activation profile is broadly similar to the EKAR response. The decrease in phospho-ERK is faster than the EKAR signal, likely because the EKAR biosensor signal dynamics is dependent on both ERK and phosphatase activities.</p><p>To test if the sustained response at the plasma membrane requires continuously active ERK at the plasma membrane, we treated the cells with a membrane permeable ERK inhibitor SCH772984 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morris et al., 2013</xref>) and examined the pmEKAR4 responses. We found that addition of 10 µM SCH772984, but not of DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), either at 10 min after EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> blue curve) or at 40 min post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> orange curve) resulted in an immediate change in the slope of pmEKAR4 signal, indicating that ERK was still actively phosphorylating pmEKAR4 at these time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, inhibitor addition at these different time points appears to exhibit different slopes of decay, which we surmise to be due to changing phosphatase activities between these time points. Furthermore, addition of U0126, an inhibitor of the upstream kinase MEK, at 10 min or 40 min post EGF also led to decreases in the slope of pmEKAR4 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating MEK was also active.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sustained ERK activity at the plasma membrane is required for observed pmEKAR4 signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PC12 cells treated with the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 (10 µM) after EGF treatment at 10 min (n = 8) or 40 min (n = 8) post-EGF resulted in an immediate change in the slope of pmEKAR4 signal.

The classical pathway of ERK activation is through the Ras family of GTPases, including K-ras, H-ras, and N-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, it has been shown that Rap1, a GTPase in the Ras family, can in some cases specifically interact with B-Raf and lead to sustained ERK activity under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">York et al., 1998</xref>). For example, NGF-induced sustained ERK activation in PC12 cells is mediated through Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">York et al., 1998</xref>). More recent reports suggest that while Ras activates a rapid and intense ERK response, Rap1 induces a slow and steady ERK response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2016</xref>), mimicking the observed kinetic difference between responses of pmEKAR4 and cytoEKAR4. In addition, Wang et al. showed that in order for Rap1 to activate the ERK pathway, Rap1 needs to be localized near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that a plasma membrane-associated pool of active Rap1 exists to regulate plasma membrane ERK activity.</p><p>The classical way to measure GTPase activation involves affinity capture of the active GTPase and subsequent immunodetection for the presence of the GTPase in the precipitated fraction. We reasoned that because the plasma membrane-associated pool of Rap1 may be relatively small compared to the cytosolic and perinuclear pools of Rap1, this classical method involving affinity-capture would not be suitable to test whether EGF induces Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obara et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, O’Shaughnessy et al. reported novel dual-chain biosensors for both of the isoforms of Rap1, Rap1A and Rap1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2019</xref>). In these biosensors known as Rap1A/B-FLARE, either Rap1A or Rap1B is fused to the donor fluorophore, mCerulean3, on its N-terminus and the Rap1-binding domain (RBD) from RalGDS is fused to the acceptor fluorophore Ypet. Rap1 activation leads to intermolecular binding between Rap1 and RBD, thereby increasing FRET. Using these biosensors in PC12 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> for diagram of pathway including inhibitors and biosensors utilized throughout this study), we observed that EGF consistently induced increases in Y/C emission ratios, indicating activation of both Rap1A (25.4 ± 4.7%, n = 11) and Rap1B (26 ± 3.4%, n = 8); this effect was completely abrogated by either co-expression of the Rap1-specific GTPase-activating protein Rap1GAP, which selectively inactivates Rap1 by inducing the hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, red curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brinkmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1997</xref>), or by GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor that has been used to inhibit the processing, and thus action, of Rap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chenette and Der, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 1996</xref>).

For this assay, we utilized the RBD from diffusible, FP-tagged RalGDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). We also co-expressed a membrane-targeted variant of RFP, mCherry, in PC12 cells in order to aid in finding cells in TIRF microscopy and to control for changes in fluorescence intensity due to cell spreading and/or movement. In these cells, EGF induced an average maximum response of 64.8 ± 11% (n = 11) increase in ratio of EGFP to mCherry at the basal membrane, while control cells expressing EGFP showed no changes in EGFP fluorescence intensity at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We used several different approaches to inhibit Rap1. First, Rap1GAP-mediated inhibition of both Rap1A and Rap1B led to a dramatic dampening of EGF-induced ERK activity near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, Rap1GAP had no effect on cytosolic ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>), indicating that the effect of Rap1GAP is plasma membrane specific. Secondly, we expressed Rap1A and Rap1B dominant-negative isoforms (Rap1A N17 and Rap1B N17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maly et al., 1994</xref>). While Rap1A N17 was not able to inhibit Rap1A activation, Rap1B N17 dramatically decreased Rap1B activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B,D</xref>) and led to a similar effect on pmEKAR response as Rap1GAP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5F,G</xref>). In addition, acute Rap1A inhibition by GGTI-298 also resulted in a drastically decreased pmEKAR4 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data indicate that Rap1 is critically involved in regulating plasma membrane ERK activity. However, we note that Rap1 inhibition does not completely abrogate plasma membrane ERK response. We thus used HRas-N17, a dominant negative form of H-Ras that inhibits all Ras isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matallanas et al., 2003</xref>), to probe how inhibition of Ras affects both cytosolic and plasma membrane localized ERK. We found that cytosolic ERK activity was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>). We also found that plasma membrane localized ERK activity was altered, but not abolished like the cytoEKAR4 response. Instead of an initial peak response approximately 10 min after EGF followed by a slow decay, we observed a slowly increasing plasma membrane ERK response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C,D</xref>). Interestingly, the amplitude of pmEKAR4 at 40 min was not different between HRas-N17 expressing cells and control cells, indicating that Rap1, not Ras, is responsible for plasma membrane ERK activity at later time points. This mechanism is notably different from the canonical Ras-mediated activation of ERK, which appears to regulate the cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Plasma membrane ERK activity regulates cellular morphology and EGF-induced protrusion dynamics</title><p>After identifying a distinct pool of ERK with different temporal dynamics and pathway of activation than cytosolic or nuclear pools of ERK, we sought to identify the function of this pool of ERK near the membrane. We utilized an ERK monobody binder (EMBer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mann et al., 2013</xref>) that interacts with ERK and inhibits its activity but does not interact with JNK or p38, kinases from the same family as ERK.

In cells expressing pmEMBer, we first observed an apparent change in cell morphology from primarily circular to primarily elliptical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We quantified this morphological change by measuring the ratio of the minor to major axes of each cell, comparing between pmEMBer expressing cells and non-pmEMBer expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Left panel). In cells without pmEMBer, 58% of imaged cells have a minor:major axes ratio greater than 0.8, indicating that the majority of cells were nearly perfectly round. Only ~8% of cells without pmEMBer had a ratio below 0.6. In contrast, 42% of pmEMBer expressing cells had a ratio below 0.6.

To quantitate these observations, we co-expressed either pmEMBer or plasma membrane targeted mCherry with LifeAct-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hertel et al., 2016</xref>) to visualize actin dynamics. In each of these conditions, cells were treated with EGF and imaged every 30 s for up to 45 min after stimulation. To quantitate the differences in protrusion dynamics, lines were drawn across the major axis of each cell and a kymograph was generated to quantitate the spatial and temporal aspects of protrusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Under control conditions, EGF induced relatively short-lived, evenly distributed small protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle, right panels). However, under conditions of selective plasma membrane inhibition of ERK activity near the plasma membrane, cells exhibited longer and polarized protrusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle, right panels). Specifically, in normal conditions, 28% of cells had protrusions longer than 5 µm and the protrusions of 25% of these cells lasted for longer than 15 min. In contrast, in plasma mebrane ERK (pmERK)-inhibited conditions, 70% of cells had protrusions longer than 5 µm and 75% of pmERK-inhibited cells had protrusions lasting longer than 15 min.</p><p>As described earlier, there are known ERK substrates near the membrane that could have the observed effect on cell morphology and protrusions, such as WASP, FAK, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ünal et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, it is well established that the Rho family of GTPases, Rac1 and RhoA, are significant players in cell protrusion and migration processes. Importantly, Rac1 is a known substrate for ERK, and EGF-induced Rac1 phosphorylation by ERK in COS-7 cells was shown to lead to inhibition of Rac1 and its removal from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we sought to examine how inhibition of plasma membrane ERK affected Rac1 and RhoA activity in PC12 cells.</p><p>In order to monitor Rac1 and RhoA activation, we took advantage of established single-chain Rac1 and RhoA biosensors: Rac1-2G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fritz et al., 2015</xref>) and RhoA-DORA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Unen et al., 2015</xref>). Rac1-2G consists of mTFP (variant of CFP) on the N-terminus, a circularly permutated variant of Venus, with the PAK effector binding domain in between the two fluorescent proteins and a full length Rac1 at the C-terminal end; upon Rac1 binding with GTP, the PAK effector domain will interact with Rac1-GTP, bringing the two fluorescent proteins into close proximity to increase FRET. The RhoA biosensor has a similar design, with a circularly permutated Rho-binding domain of PKN1 on the N-terminus, followed by cpVenus, a linker region, Cerulean, and then full-length RhoA. We expressed either of these biosensors in cells along with either plasma membrane targeted mCherry (control) or pmEMBer. Although we could not observe RhoA activity under either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D,E</xref>), using Rac1-2G we did observe a robust 6.4 ± 0.7% increase in response to EGF (n = 19, control; n = 24, with pmEMBer) under pmERK-inhibited conditions but not under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), indicating endogenous pmERK inhibits Rac1 activation. This observation is consistent with previous reports in which ERK phosphorylation of Rac1 on T108 inhibits Rac1 and leads to relocalization of Rac1 away from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2013</xref>) and indicates that plasma membrane ERK activity inhibits Rac1, which could contribute to the regulation of membrane protrusion dynamics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although ERK is ubiquitously utilized by a host of different cellular processes, the majority of studies on ERK focus on its primary role in proliferation and survival. Previous studies often focus on investigating the extent of ERK phosphorylation and its effect on transcription factors in the nucleus. However, ERK is known to have hundreds of substrates localized in different subcellular compartments and play key roles in differentiation, migration, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roskoski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ünal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maik-Rachline et al., 2019</xref>). Despite our knowledge of substrate localization, little is known about the regulation of ERK in specific subcellular compartments outside of the nucleus. This is largely due to the traditional method of using phospho-specific antibodies on whole lysates, which are equated, perhaps erroneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keyes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>), with full activity, and may mask subpopulations of ERK amidst the majority population. While we know that temporal dynamics plays a major role in determining cellular processes resulting from an extracellular cue, we have been unable to critically assess whether an individual extracellular signal can induce distinct temporal dynamics among two or more different subcellular compartments.</p><p>In this study, we established the use of fluorescent, FRET-based biosensors to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK activity by targeting the biosensors to specific subcellular regions, particularly the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus. Using this technique, we discovered that EGF simultaneously activates at least three divergent sub-populations of ERK with unique temporal dynamics from each other: the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the Plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Indeed, the nuclear EKAR4 response exhibits the most transient of the targeted EKAR4 biosensors, followed by cytoEKAR4, with the pmEKAR4 exhibiting an apparent persistent response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). By using a membrane-permeable ERK inhibitor, we confirmed that the sustained pmEKAR4 signal was a direct result of continued ERK phosphorylation of the biosensor and not because the biosensor was unable to be dephosphorylated by a lack of phosphatases near the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, we utilized subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting to confirm the presence of sustained ERK phosphorylation in the plasma membrane fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>).</p><p>To delineate into the mechanism by which ERK activity at the membrane is activated, we examined the upstream GTPase responsible for ERK activation and discovered a noncanonical Rap1-mediated pathway. Past studies have linked Rap1 to ERK signaling because Rap1 is able to interact with and activate B-Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). However, this point has been controversial and it is not clear whether or not Rap1 actually activates ERK in a cellular environment, with studies giving disparate reports on whether EGF induces Rap1 activation in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zwartkruis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bouschet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2006</xref>). These contradicting observations are likely due to the fact that the traditional biochemical method for measuring enzyme activation may not capture transient or specific subcellularly localized activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, with the use of recently reported Rap1 biosensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2019</xref>) and our live-cell TIRF-based EGFP-RalGDS translocation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), we were able to show that, in PC12 cells, EGF does indeed activate Rap1 at the plasma membrane. Using Rap1GAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>), a dominant negative form of Rap1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), and the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), combined with our plasma membrane ERK activity reporter, we further showed that Rap1 is critically involved in regulating plasma membrane ERK activity but does not appear to contribute to the Ras-dependent cytosolic or nuclear ERK activities, whereas Ras appears to primarily contribute to the initial, but not sustained, component of plasma membrane ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Future studies will test the involvement of Rap1 GEFs and B-Raf in Rap1-mediated plasma membrane ERK activation.</p><p>Furthermore, our study provides a striking example where an individual extracellular signal, such as EGF, can temporally regulate subcellular ERK populations to control distinct cellular processes. We showed that inhibition of membrane-localized ERK activity potentiates EGF-induced Rac1 activation and leads to enhanced membrane protrusion dynamics. These data suggest that EGF, in addition to inducing cell proliferation, also stimulates plasma membrane ERK activity to suppress Rac1 activity to prevent unwanted membrane protrusions and polarization. The latter effect likely requires the sustained ERK activity at the plasma membrane. It is tempting to speculate that the ERK-suppressed morphology and protrusions are related to PC12 cell differentiation, due to the qualitative resemblance of shape and protrusion dynamics for pmEMBer-expressing cells compared to cells shortly after NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robinson et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, spatial and temporal dynamics are intricately linked to encode specific signaling information and regulate distinct cellular processes that result from individual extracellular signals such as EGF. With the genetically targeted molecular tools for both visualization and manipulation of specific signaling events, our work also lays the foundation to enable future studies to further elucidate the mechanisms of regulation and functional roles of distinct subcellular populations of ERK.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SCH772984</td><td>selleckchem</td><td>S7101</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>U0126</td><td>Sigma</td><td>U120</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Epidermal Growth <break/>Factor (EGF)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>E9644</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-phosphoERK1/2 rabbit, polyclonal</td><td>Cell Signalling Technology</td><td>Cat# 9102 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_330744">AB_330744</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000) dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-ERK1/2 rabbit, polyclonal</td><td>Cell Signalling Technology</td><td>Cat# 9101 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331646">AB_331646</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000) dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or Kit</td><td>Lipofectamine-2000</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>11668019</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA Reagent</td><td>pCDNA3 EKAR-EV</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976697">21976697</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA Reagent</td><td>pTriEx4 Rap1A-FLARE</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444239">31444239</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA Reagent</td><td>pTriEx4 Rap1B-FLARE</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31444239">31444239</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA Reagent</td><td>pcDNA3 Flag-Rap1GAP</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23946483">23946483</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA Reagent</td><td>pcDNA3 EMBer7.1</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23227961">23227961</ext-link></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Cell Line <break/>(<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>PC-12</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1065897">1065897</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0481">CVCL_0481</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Cell Line <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293-T</td><td/><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FIJI</td><td/><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014294">SCR_014294</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MetaFluor</td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>ERK inhibitor SCH772984 was obtained from Sellek chemicals.

sensor. The authors demonstrate that cell surface signaling to ERK is mediated initially by both Ras and Rap pathways, but long-term ERK activation is mediated by the Rap pathway. This finding provides novel insight into ERK signaling dynamics and clarifies the relative roles of the Ras and Rap pathways.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Signaling diversity enabled by Rap1-regulated plasma membrane ERK with distinct temporal dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation among the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, the reviewers concluded that revision of your manuscript would require more than 2 months, and thus we cannot formally invite a revised version according to <italic>eLife</italic> policy. Nevertheless, the reviewers remain interested in your study and are willing to consider a new version of this manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review.</p><p>This manuscript describes a new probe for ERK activity (EKAR4) that is employed to probe ERK signaling in live cells. A focus of the analysis is a demonstration that cell surface ERK activity is dependent upon the Rap1 signaling pathway. These are elegant and interesting studies. However, further characterization of EKAR4 was requested by the reviewers and additional data to support the conclusions concerning the role of Rap1 are required. These concerns are elaborated in the appended reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study that describes the use of an improved biosensor for ERK activity (EKAR4) to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK activity in response to treatment of PC12 cells with EGF. Many of the observations do not break new ground. However, the analysis of the role of Rap1 in cell surface activation of ERK does contribute to an unresolved area of previous research. The authors present data indicating the cell surface ERK activity is sustained and that this depends on Rap1.</p><p>The authors show that Rap1 is activated by EGF and that both RapGAP and dnRap1 suppresses cell surface activation of ERK. The function of cell surface ERK activation was probed using a targeted ERK monobody to demonstrate a role in membrane protrusion that may be mediated by a Rac1-dependent process. The analysis presented uses elegant optical probes and is interesting. However, the depth of mechanistic insight is limited – thus is a problem for a controversial area of research. For example, a caveat on the interpretation of the RapGAP and dnRap1 studies is that the transfection protocol may cause long-term changes in EGFR signaling due to trafficking or some other EGFR signaling property. It is therefore not certain that Rap1 mediates the effects of EGF on cell surface ERK activity rather than some indirect action of Rap1 on EGFR signaling. Control studies are needed. First, does blocking the Ras pathway prevent cell surface ERK activation? Presumably, if Rap1 (and not Ras) is required for cell surface ERK activation, then blocking Ras would not alter cell surface ERK activation. Second, does acute Rap1-deficiency prevent cell surface ERK activation – for example using induced Rap1 protein degradation. These studies are required to strengthen the conclusions of the current study and are important because of the existing controversy in this field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment of work:</p><p>This manuscript reports a new genetically encoded FRET sensor for ERK, named EKAR4, which has enhanced dynamic range compared to previous EKAR versions. The EKAR4 construct targeted to the plasma membrane is used to reveal novel evidence for sustained activation of membrane-localized ERK. The sensor is used in combination with inhibitors of Rap1 (Rap1-GAP and DN-Rap1) to address a previous claim that Rap1 is needed for ERK activation, which has been controversial and difficult to corroborate. The results show convincingly that plasma membrane associated ERK is partially dependent on Rap1-GTP. A plasma membrane targeted ERK monobody (EMBer) is used to demonstrate the importance of plasma membrane ERK on cell morphology and membrane protrusions.</p><p>This manuscript represents an important contribution to the signaling field, by describing a new probe for ERK signaling and using it to address long held ambiguities about the activation and function of plasma membrane associated kinase. The experiments are carefully done and the results will be of broad interest.</p><p>A number of points are raised to improve accuracy and clarity.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Results paragraph one. It is unclear how the figure shows a 74.5% increase in Y/C emission ratio. Needed is a panel showing the direct comparison of EKAR4 against the previous generation EKARs, to document performance of the new sensor.</p><p>2) Figure 2B,C. The Western blot in panel B looks as if phosphoERK at the membrane nearly returns to baseline after 40 min, while phosphoERK in the cytosol remains higher than baseline at 40 min. This seems inconsistent with the quantitative data in panel C.</p><p>3) Figure 3—figure supplement 2 panel F. The experiments showing that Rap1GAP does not affect cytoEKAR (EKAR4-NES?) were averaged from n=15, whereas pmEKAR experiments were averaged from n=40. Data for pmEKAR with Rap1GAP showed a wide range of responses, where many time courses overlapped those of control. Concievably cytoEKAR might also show the same, if assayed to the same depth. Alternatively, the Rap1BN17 experiments should be performed with EKAR4-NES to confirm that the cytoplasmic sensor is unresponsive to Rap1 inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Keyes et al. describe a refinement of the EKAR genetically encoded biosensor for Extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Using similar technology that was used to engineer the original biosensor, the authors have improved sensitivity as evidenced by a 74 % increase in the Y/C emission ratio. More direct comparison to conventional methods of evaluating ERK activation should be also included. While there is no doubt that the development of this new reporter is valuable, the utilization of EKAR4 in this study does not reveal any substantial biological advances.</p><p>1) Experiments in Figure 1 suggest that the signal to noise ratio of the membrane associated EKAR4 is less than cytoplasmic. Control experiments need to be included to ensure that the sustained activity metric presented in Figure 1E is really significant. Cytoplasm is spelt wrong in the title of Figure 1C.</p><p>2) Additional drug experiments with MEK inhibitors should be added to the data in Figure 2A. Targeting this upstream kinase in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is a more standard method of pathway inhibition. These experiments could be used to further justify the development of another ERAR and establish if there are any MEK independent effects.</p><p>3) The usage of multiple fluorescent biosensors to detect events upstream ERK signaling such as Rap 1 activations makes this work harder to follow. Also, can the authors show that activation of Eapc1 is involved in this process by treating with selective cAMP analog activators.</p><p>4) It is stated in the discussion &quot;we found that ERK activation in the nucleus was transient, slightly more sustained in the cytoplasm and drastically more sustained near the plasma membrane&quot;. This seems a rather obvious statement since the agonist used to stimulate ERK activation is delivered from the plasma membrane. The authors need to provide more compelling evidence and rational for this conclusion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Signaling Diversity Enabled by Rap1-Regulated Plasma Membrane ERK with Distinct Temporal Dynamics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The findings of the revised manuscript are significant and at a level appropriate for this journal.</p><p>Two minor issues should be addressed by the authors before the paper is published.</p><p>1) The new supplemental data presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 6 appears to be noisy (particularly figure D). It might help interpretation if the analyses used the same scale for the quantification of the Y/C ratio as figure C.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an interesting study that describes the use of an improved biosensor for ERK activity (EKAR4) to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK activity in response to treatment of PC12 cells with EGF. Many of the observations do not break new ground. However, the analysis of the role of Rap1 in cell surface activation of ERK does contribute to an unresolved area of previous research. The authors present data indicating the cell surface ERK activity is sustained and that this depends on Rap1.</p><p>The authors show that Rap1 is activated by EGF and that both RapGAP and dnRap1 suppresses cell surface activation of ERK. The function of cell surface ERK activation was probed using a targeted ERK monobody to demonstrate a role in membrane protrusion that may be mediated by a Rac1-dependent process. The analysis presented uses elegant optical probes and is interesting. However, the depth of mechanistic insight is limited – thus is a problem for a controversial area of research. For example, a caveat on the interpretation of the RapGAP and dnRap1 studies is that the transfection protocol may cause long-term changes in EGFR signaling due to trafficking or some other EGFR signaling property. It is therefore not certain that Rap1 mediates the effects of EGF on cell surface ERK activity rather than some indirect action of Rap1 on EGFR signaling. Control studies are needed. First, does blocking the Ras pathway prevent cell surface ERK activation? Presumably, if Rap1 (and not Ras) is required for cell surface ERK activation, then blocking Ras would not alter cell surface ERK activation. Second, does acute Rap1-deficiency prevent cell surface ERK activation – for example using induced Rap1 protein degradation. These studies are required to strengthen the conclusions of the current study and are important because of the existing controversy in this field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for the detailed and thoughtful comments. We have performed additional experiments, which have led to a more complete understanding of the roles of Ras and Rap1 in regulating ERK.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we performed additional experiments to test how inhibition of Ras, via use of HRas-17N dominant negative overexpression, effects ERK responses. We found Ras inhibition affects both pmEKAR4 and cytoEKAR4 responses. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 6, HRasN17 expression completely abolishes cytosolic ERK response and decreased the plasma membrane ERK response by 57% at normal peak signal (~10-15 min) but 0% at 40 minutes post EGF, suggesting that Ras is not required for the sustained ERK response at the plasma membrane but required for regulating both cytosolic ERK and the initial activation of plasma membrane ERK. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3C, Rap1GAP expression does not completely abrogate pmEKAR4 response. Given that expression of Rap1GAP was shown to abolish Rap1 activation (Figure 3A and 3B), this data, combined with Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 6, suggests that both Rap1 and Ras contribute to the plasma membrane ERK response but Rap1, not Ras, is responsible for plasma membrane ERK activity at later time points. We discuss these results in paragraph two of subsection “Rap1 GTPase significantly contributes to plasma membrane ERK activity” and Discussion paragraph three.</p><p>We tested different approaches to achieve acute inhibition of Rap1. We attempted to create a cell line where we could more acutely inhibit the Rap1 pathway using either a targeted degradation system or a cell line in which we could induce the overexpression of Rap1GAP. However, we were unsuccessful in creating a stable PC12 cell line expressing either of these constructs due to significant cell death after viral transduction. We thus utilized GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor that has been used to inhibit the processing and thus action of Rap1 (Chenette and Der, 2011; Ke et al., 2019; McGuire et al., 1996). Because Rap1, but not Ras, is geranylgeranylated, GGTI-298 is used as a semi-specific inhibitor for Rap1 (Chenette and Der, 2011). We found that 30 μM pretreatment of GGTI-298 150 minutes before EGF treatment effectively abrogated Rap1 signaling as measured using the Rap1A biosensor (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, C, E) and had a dramatic effect on pmEKAR4 response (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, D, F). While we acknowledge that GGTI-298 could have off target effects, we noted that 150-min pretreatment with GGTI-298 leads to a similar pmEKAR4 response as Rap1GAP overexpression and included this data as a supporting piece of evidence for the role of Rap1 in regulating plasma membrane ERK. We include discussion using GGTI-298 in subsection “Rap1 GTPase significantly contributes to plasma membrane ERK activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>General assessment of work:</p><p>This manuscript reports a new genetically encoded FRET sensor for ERK, named EKAR4, which has enhanced dynamic range compared to previous EKAR versions. The EKAR4 construct targeted to the plasma membrane is used to reveal novel evidence for sustained activation of membrane-localized ERK. The sensor is used in combination with inhibitors of Rap1 (Rap1-GAP and DN-Rap1) to address a previous claim that Rap1 is needed for ERK activation, which has been controversial and difficult to corroborate. The results show convincingly that plasma membrane associated ERK is partially dependent on Rap1-GTP. A plasma membrane targeted ERK monobody (EMBer) is used to demonstrate the importance of plasma membrane ERK on cell morphology and membrane protrusions.</p><p>This manuscript represents an important contribution to the signaling field, by describing a new probe for ERK signaling and using it to address long held ambiguities about the activation and function of plasma membrane associated kinase. The experiments are carefully done and the results will be of broad interest.</p><p>A number of points are raised to improve accuracy and clarity.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1, . Results paragraph one. It is unclear how the figure shows a 74.5% increase in Y/C emission ratio. Needed is a panel showing the direct comparison of EKAR4 against the previous generation EKARs, to document performance of the new sensor.</p></disp-quote><p>Per reviewer 2’s request, we obtained EKAR-EV (Komatsu et al., 2011), EKAR2G1, (Fritz et al., 2013), and EKAR 3 (Sparta et al., 2015), and the yet unpublished EKAR3.5 from John Albeck (UC Davis), which is an improved version of EKAR3. We used HEK-293T cells to directly compare the dynamic ranges of these different EKARs. We found that the dynamic range of EKAR4 is significantly improved over previous generations of EKAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We were unable to express EKAR 3, and because EKAR3.5 is yet unpublished, we did not include it in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, which shows the significant improvement in dynamic range of EKAR4 over EKAR-EV and EKAR2G1. We discuss these results in paragraph one of the Results section.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>EKAR4 exhibits improved dynamic range over existing EKAR constructs.</title><p>A) Average line traces of EKAR responses to EGF in Hek-293T cells.

The Western blot in panel B looks as if phosphoERK at the membrane nearly returns to baseline after 40 min, while phosphoERK in the cytosol remains higher than baseline at 40 min. This seems inconsistent with the quantitative data in panel C.</p></disp-quote><p>Per reviewer 1 and 2’s concerns, we reviewed and repeated the fractionation and western blots and replaced the previous representative image with a replicate whose image is more representative of the quantified data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3—figure supplement 2 panel F. The experiments showing that Rap1GAP does not affect cytoEKAR (EKAR4-NES?) were averaged from n=15, whereas pmEKAR experiments were averaged from n=40. Data for pmEKAR with Rap1GAP showed a wide range of responses, where many time courses overlapped those of control. Concievably cytoEKAR might also show the same, if assayed to the same depth. Alternatively, the Rap1BN17 experiments should be performed with EKAR4-NES to confirm that the cytoplasmic sensor is unresponsive to Rap1 inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for reviewer 2’s thoughtful consideration of replicate numbers and the variation in the pmEKAR response in Figure 3—figure supplement 2E. We have repeated the cytoEKAR4 experiment with Rap1GAP expression to reach the same N number (n=40) and concluded that Rap1GAP has no significant effect on cytosolic EKAR response. Changes are reflected in Figure 3 D, F, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2F. (Note the change in Figure supplement number due to addition of the diagram figure as Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Keyes et al. describe a refinement of the EKAR genetically encoded biosensor for Extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Using similar technology that was used to engineer the original biosensor, the authors have improved sensitivity as evidenced by a 74 % increase in the Y/C emission ratio. More direct comparison to conventional methods of evaluating ERK activation should be also included. While there is no doubt that the development of this new reporter is valuable, the utilization of EKAR4 in this study does not reveal any substantial biological advances.</p></disp-quote><p>Per reviewer request, we included immunoblot time course data in Figure 1—figure supplement 5. The immunoblots were from whole cell lysate, which is the more traditional method of measuring ERK activation.</p><p>In this time course, we observe a dramatic increase in phosphorylated ERK 7.5 minutes after EGF treatment, followed by a dramatic decrease by 15 minutes. It is interesting that after 15 minutes we see a slight increase in phospho-ERK at the 30- and 40-minute time points. The activation profile is broadly similar to the EKAR response. The decrease in phospho-ERK is faster than the EKAR signal likely because the EKAR biosensor signal dynamics is dependent on both ERK and phosphatase activities. However, it is important to note that measurements of ERK phosphorylation is an indirect measure of ERK activity and that the phospho-ERK immunoblot is a measure of phosphorylated ERK from all compartments of all cells. We include discussion of this in the manuscript in paragraph two of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Experiments in Figure 1 suggest that the signal to noise ratio of the membrane associated EKAR4 is less than cytoplasmic. Control experiments need to be included to ensure that the sustained activity metric presented in Figure 1E is really significant. Cytoplasm is spelt wrong in the title of Figure 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that pmEKAR4 has a lower dynamic range than cytoEKAR4. We thus included a new supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) in which we show no significant correlation between amplitude and SAM40, indicating that the lower amplitude in pmEKAR does not affect the SAM40 measurement.</p><p>We also fixed the spelling in Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional drug experiments with MEK inhibitors should be added to the data in Figure 2A. Targeting this upstream kinase in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is a more standard method of pathway inhibition. These experiments could be used to further justify the development of another ERAR and establish if there are any MEK independent effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to use an ERK inhibitor to determine if ERK is still actively phosphorylating pmEKAR4 at a given time. But indeed MEK inhibition is a more widely used method to inhibit the pathway. Per reviewer request, we have included data using MEK inhibitor U0126 as a supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) and including brief discussion of the results in paragraph four of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The usage of multiple fluorescent biosensors to detect events upstream ERK signaling such as Rap 1 activations makes this work harder to follow. Also, can the authors show that activation of Eapc1 is involved in this process by treating with selective cAMP analog activators.</p></disp-quote><p>To make it easier to follow, we have now included a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to illustrate the pathway and the various biosensors and inhibitors used in this study, referred to in subsection “Rap1 GTPase significantly contributes to plasma membrane ERK activity”.</p><p>We appreciate reviewer 3’s question concerning the involvement of Epac. Based on the literature (Liu et al., 2010; Obara et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006), we believe that C3G is a more likely candidate than Epac for the EGF-induced activation of Rap1 in this system owing to the localization of Epac away from the membrane. However, investigation of the mechanism of Rap1 activation, which involves specific inhibition of different GEFs, we feel, is beyond the scope of this current manuscript and more appropriately aligned with ongoing follow up studies, which we mention in paragraph three of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is stated in the discussion &quot;we found that ERK activation in the nucleus was transient, slightly more sustained in the cytoplasm and drastically more sustained near the plasma membrane&quot;. This seems a rather obvious statement since the agonist used to stimulate ERK activation is delivered from the plasma membrane. The authors need to provide more compelling evidence and rational for this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>To address reviewer 3’s concern, we modified the wording in paragraph two of the Discussion to more accurately reflect our observations on the apparent transience or persistence of ERK activity using the targeted EKAR4 biosensors. We also slightly modified the wording in the same paragraph to emphasize how experiments in Figure 2 support the stated conclusion that ERK phosphorylation and activity is sustained near the plasma membrane.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two minor issues should be addressed by the authors before the paper is published.</p><p>1) The new supplemental data presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 6 appears to be noisy (particularly figure D). It might help interpretation if the analyses used the same scale for the quantification of the Y/C ratio as figure C. There is a similar issue, but to a lesser extent, with Figure 3—figure supplement 6 (A and C).</p></disp-quote><p>We modified Figure 3—figure supplement 6 such that Panels A and B have the same scale on the Y-axis, and Panels C and D have the same Y-axis scale as each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) New immunoblot data presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 5. Please confirm in the figure legend that this figure panel represents the same extract examined in separate blots for ERK and pERK and that this is why two tubulin loading controls are presented. Otherwise, please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for aiding in clarifying this supplemental figure. There were two sets of immunoblots, pERK1/2 + tubulin (top) and ERK1/2 + tubulin (bottom) that are from separately run gels. As indicated in the revised figure, the columns represent the two biological replicates, and the samples in a given column are from the same set of lysates. Each tubulin blot is a loading control for the associated ERK immunoblot. We clarified this in the figure legend and modified the figure itself to clarify the reason for the two tubulin blots.</p></body></sub-article></article>
