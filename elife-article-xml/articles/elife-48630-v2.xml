Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of full-length insulin receptor (IR) and insulin complex in the active state. This structure unexpectedly reveals that maximally four insulins can bind the ‘T’-shaped IR dimer at four distinct sites related by 2-fold symmetry. Insulins 1 and 1’ bind to sites 1 and 1’, formed by L1 of one IR protomer and α-CT and FnIII-1 of the other. Insulins 2 and 2’ bind to sites 2 and 2’ on FnIII-1 of each protomer. Mutagenesis and cellular assays show that both sites 1 and 2 are required for optimal insulin binding and IR activation. We further identify a homotypic FnIII-2–FnIII-2 interaction in mediating the dimerization of membrane proximal domains in the active IR dimer. Our results indicate that binding of multiple insulins at two distinct types of sites disrupts the autoinhibited apo-IR dimer and stabilizes the active dimer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>insulin receptor</kwd><kwd>site 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR160082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiao-chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP120717-P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP160667-P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Hongtao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The identification of the insulin binding site 2 by high resolution cryo-EM analysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin receptor (IR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that plays essential roles in glucose metabolism and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ullrich et al., 1985</xref>). Dysregulation of IR signaling is linked to many human diseases, such as diabetes and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Olefsky, 1976</xref>). Unlike most RTKs, IR forms a stable homodimer covalently linked by multiple disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schäffer and Ljungqvist, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sparrow et al., 1997</xref>). Previous mutagenesis and binding studies have suggested that IR has two distinct insulin-binding sites with different affinities for insulin, termed sites 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Meyts, 1994</xref>). It has been further proposed that a single insulin molecule simultaneously engages site 1 of one IR promtomer and site 2 of the other, thus bridging the two IR protomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Meyts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schäffer, 1994</xref>). A second insulin molecule binds to the equivalent, symmetry-related site in the IR dimer. These two insulins effectively crosslink the two IR protomers to activate IR.</p><p>The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of IR (comprising L1, CR, L2, FnIII-1,–2,−3 domains) in the absence of insulin was solved first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McKern et al., 2006</xref>), revealing an inverted ‘V’ shaped architecture. The crystal structure of the IR extracellular domain bound to insulin was subsequently determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Menting et al., 2013</xref>), showing that one insulin molecule binds to the primary site, which consists of the L1 domain and the C-terminal helix of the α chain (α-CT). This primary site has been proposed to represent site 1. Recently, three groups, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM), showed that insulin binding induces a large conformational change in IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weis et al., 2018</xref>) and converts the overall architecture of IR dimer from an autoinhibited inverted ‘V’ shape to a ‘T’ shape. This conversion has been proposed to bring the two kinase domains of the IR dimer into close proximity to enable efficient trans-autophosphorylation and activation. Two of the three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weis et al., 2018</xref>) also identified a new IR–insulin interface involving a loop of FnIII-1. This interface has been proposed to represent site 2 of IR. Thus, those structures revealed that the IR dimer binds to one or two insulins, with each insulin contacting the L1 domain of one protomer and α-CT and the FnIII-1 loop of the other. These findings seemingly support the ‘crosslinking’ model for IR activation, which posits that each insulin molecule simultaneously engages sites 1 and 2 of IR.</p><p>Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human IR–insulin complex at an overall resolution of 3.2 Å. Unexpectedly, our structure reveals that each ‘T’-shaped fully liganded IR dimer can bind maximally four insulins at four sites that are related by a two-fold symmetrical axis. Sites 1 and 1’ are formed by the L1 domain of one IR protomer and α-CT and the FnIII-1 loop of the other. Sites 2 and 2’ are located on the back of a main β sheet of the FnIII-1 domain of each protomer. Our mutagenesis, binding and cellular assays, along with insulin mutations in the previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Meyts, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kristensen et al., 1997</xref>), confirm this new IR–insulin interface as the authentic site 2. Therefore, our results revise and extend the widely accepted ‘crosslinking’ model of IR activation, and indicate that binding of multiple insulin molecules to two distinct types of sites on each IR dimer breaks the auto-inhibited state and fully activates IR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of full-length human IR bound to insulin</title><p>We expressed and purified the full-length human insulin receptor (IR) using human HEK293F cells as the expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).), and reconstituted the IR–insulin complex in vitro. To improve the expression yield, we introduced several mutations in the intracellular domain of IR, including the D1120N mutation that inactivates its kinase activity and the Y960F mutation that has been shown to reduce clathrin-mediated endocytosis of IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">White et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the detergent micelles could affect insulin binding, we performed in vitro insulin binding assays. Recombinant IR isolated with detergent binds insulin with high affinity and displays strong negative cooperativity (Hill coefficients of ~0.62), comparable to our and other’s cell-based insulin-binding results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Meyts et al., 1973</xref>).</p><p>During cryo-EM image processing, initial 3D classification was produced without any symmetry imposed.

As a result, the resolution for the top part of the complex was improved to 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), allowing us to build a nearly complete atomic model for this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The cryo-EM densities for the FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains were less well resolved, presumably due to structural flexibility. Nevertheless, the crystal structures of FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains can be unambiguously docked into the cryo-EM density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), based on clear secondary structural features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The cryo-EM density for the transmembrane domain (TM) can only be visualized after further 3D classification with local angular search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4B</xref>), but cannot be modeled due to the lack of side-chain densities. The densities of kinase domains were completely unresolved in the cryo-EM map.</p><p>In the full-length IR–insulin complex, the IR dimer exists in an extended ‘T’-shaped arrangement with 2-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in agreement with the 2D class averages of full-length IR in the presence of insulin obtained previously by negative-stain EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gutmann et al., 2018</xref>) as well as the recently solved cryo-EM structure of the IR extracellular domain bound to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>). The horizontal part of the ‘T’ is composed of the L1, CR and L2 domains of both IR promoters. The vertical piece of the ‘T’ consists exclusively of the FnIII-1, FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains of the IR dimer.</p><p>The apo-form of the IR dimer exhibits an inverted ‘V’ shape, with the two FnIII-3 domains separated by ~120 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McKern et al., 2006</xref>). Because the FnIII-3 domain is connected to the transmembrane (TM) domain and intracellular kinase domains through a short linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the two kinase domains are likely separated by a long distance and cannot undergo efficient trans-autophosphorylation in this autoinhibited conformation. The distance between the two FnIII-3 domains in the ‘T’-shaped insulin-bound IR dimer, however, is reduced to ~40 Å. In addition, the partially resolved density for the single-pass TM domain suggests that the two TM domains may dimerize in the IR–insulin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The two intracellular kinase domains are thus expected to be in close proximity in this ‘T’-shaped conformation, enabling their trans-autophosphorylation. Therefore, this conformation of the IR dimer represents an active form.</p><p>Strikingly, we can identify four insulins bound to four sites in the fully liganded IR dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because of the 2-fold symmetry, there are two distinct types of insulin and insulin-binding sites in the complex, denoted as insulins 1, 1’, 2, and 2’; and sites 1, 1’, 2, and 2’. For simplicity, we will only describe insulins 1 and 2, which bind to sites 1 and 2 on one side of the ‘T’-shaped dimer. Insulin 1 at site 1 and insulin 2 at site 2 bury 706 and 394 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent-exposed surface areas of IR, respectively. Thus, site 1 likely has higher affinity in insulin binding than site 2.</p><p>Insulin has a molecular weight of ~6 kDa, which is much smaller than that of IR. The initial global 3D classification with coarse angular sampling may not be able to identify subsets of particles that exhibit partially liganded IR conformations. To separate the particles with different numbers of bound ligands, we applied our previously developed approaches—symmetry expansion in combination with focused classification on insulin with signal subtraction of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). As the insulin molecules are too small to be aligned on their own, during the focused classification, the orientations of the insulins were kept fixed as those determined by the C2 refinement of the entire complex. As a result, we can identify two major classes having different stoichiometries for insulin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In particular, 63% of the particles have four insulins bound (two each at sites 1 and 2), while 33% of the particles have three insulins bound (two at site 1; one at site 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). There is only a subtle difference between the structures of IR with three or four insulins bound, which indicates that binding of insulins to both sites 2 and 2’ is not required for the maintenance of the T-shaped IR dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Importantly, the vast majority (96%) of the T-shaped particles have at least one insulin bound to site 2 or 2’, suggesting that insulin binding to site 2 is important for IR to adopt the active T shape.</p><p>During the revision of this manuscript, another study deposited in the preprint server bioRxiv also showed a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the IR extracellular domain with four insulins bound at sites 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gutmann et al., 2019</xref>). The 3:1 or 4:1 stoichiometry of insulin binding to the IR dimer and the two types of binding sites are consistent with previous IR–insulin binding assays that indicated the coexistence of high- and low-affinity insulin-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schäffer, 1994</xref>). Those results were, however, interpreted with a binding equilibrium of 2:1 stoichiometry, and in light of our findings here may need to be reexamined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A tripartite interface between insulin 1 and site 1 stabilizes the active IR dimer</title><p>Insulin 1 binds mainly through the primary site formed by the L1 domain and α-CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). Based on our cryo-EM map, we cannot distinguish whether the α-CT is from the same protomer or the neighboring one, as the density of the linker between L1 domain and α-CT is completely missing in our structure. Nevertheless, based on previous biochemical and structural results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2007</xref>), IR is an intertwined domain-swapped homodimer. Thus, the two elements that constitute this primary site, the L1 domain and α-CT, are from two different IR protomers.

This secondary interface was first observed in the previously reported cryo-EM study of the IR extracellular domain bound to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>), but could not be accurately modeled due to the low-resolution density map and had been erroneously assigned as site 2. Our significantly improved cryo-EM map allowed the delineation of this new interface in near-atomic detail. To distinguish this interface from the authentic site 2 described in the next section, we propose to name the primary interface as site 1a and this new secondary interface as site 1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel).</p><p>At site 1b, two disulfide-bonded cysteines (Cys A7 and Cys B7) and His B5 of insulin pack against Pro495, Phe497, and Arg498 in the IR FnIII-1 domain through hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). In addition, insulin binding induces the formation of a new interface between the FnIII-1 domain and α-CT of the same protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel), which only exists in the ‘T’-shaped active dimer. This interface involves a cluster of charged residues, including Asp496, Arg498 and Asp499 in the FnIII-1 domain and Lys703, Glu706 and Asp707 in α-CT, which form multiple salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). Notably, an IR D707A mutation has been found in patients with leprechaunism, a rare genetic disease with severe insulin signaling defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart et al., 1996</xref>). This mutation may affect IR activation by disrupting this interface.</p><p>To test the functional relevance of site 1b, we mutated the residue Phe497 of IR (which contacts insulin) to alanine, and tested its effect on IR activation. The F497A mutant showed markedly reduced insulin-dependent IR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, and 2C</xref>). We next introduced several point mutations (D496A, R498E, K703A, and D707A) into IR, which were designed to break the interaction between α-CT and the FnIII-1 domain. The D496A, R498E, D707A (the disease-causing mutation), and K703A mutants all showed greatly reduced activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, and 2C</xref>). These results validate the functional importance of the interactions at site 1b in IR activation.</p><p>Taken together, binding of insulin 1 to IR site 1 involves a tripartite interface: insulin–L1/α-CT (site 1a), insulin–FnIII-1 loop (site 1b), and α-CT–FnIII-1 loop (site 1b). Thus, insulin 1 simultaneously engages site 1a and 1b to bridge the two IR protomers. We propose that this strong tripartite interaction is critical for the formation of the ‘T’-shaped active IR dimer by driving the rearrangement of the two IR protomers. Conceptually, the binding mode of insulin 1 is reminiscent of the ‘crosslinking’ model proposed previously, except that this insulin crosslinks two sub-sites of site 1, as opposed to sites 1 and 2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Insulin 2 binds to a novel binding site on the FnIII-1 domain of IR</title><p>We have identified a novel insulin-binding site for insulin 2 binding, which is located on the back side of a major β sheet of the FnIII-1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, and 3C</xref>).

Furthermore, both cell-based and in vitro insulin-binding assays showed that the IR site 2 K484E/L552A mutant indeed exhibited much weaker insulin-binding affinity, as compared to wild-type IR, particularly at the physiological concentrations of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

In particular, Glu287 and Lys310 form a salt bridge to stabilize the insulin-bound loop conformation. Along with the conformational change of the hinge loop, the L1/CR domains of IR rotate ~90° toward the L2 domain upon insulin binding, creating two new inter-domain contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, and 4C</xref>). The first contact is formed by Glu697 and Phe701 in the N-terminal portion of α-CT and Arg345 and Gly346 on the lateral surface of the β sheet in the L2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As a result, α-CT can simultaneously engage both L1 and L2 domains of the other IR protomer, tethering these two domains together. Another new contact is formed mainly through the interaction between a loop (residues 85–90) of the L1 domain and the first α-helix (residues 323–331) of the L2 domain.</p><p>Another hinge motion upon insulin binding occurs around the linker between the L2 and FnIII-1 domains, resulting in a new inter-domain interaction between residues 454–460 of L2 and residues 572–578 in a loop of FnIII-1. Consequently, FnIII-1,-2, and -3 domains as a rigid body rotate away from the L2 domain by ~50° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Through the combination of these two hinge motions, the overall architecture of the IR protomer is converted an inverted ‘J’ shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Two such promoters make the ‘T’ shaped active dimer.</p><p>The α-CT domain plays a critical role in stabilizing the active conformation of the IR protomer.

In contrast, mutation of a neighboring residue Glu695 in α-CT that was not involved in inter-domain interactions had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, and 4F</xref>).

The FnIII-2–FnIII-2 interaction is mediated by residues 647–653 in an extended loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Due to the lack of the side chain densities, the details of this interaction are unclear. This interaction is likely to be functionally important, however, as mutation of Lys649, which is located in the center of this dimer interface, diminished IR activation, whereas mutation of Lys652, which is at the periphery of this interface, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, and 2F</xref>). Similar homotypic interactions between membrane-proximal domains have been found in other RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuzawa et al., 2007</xref>).

However, due to the long flexible linker between the CR and L2 domains, the inter-apo-protomer interaction 2 between the L2 and FnIII-1 domains on the top part of the inverted ‘V’-shaped dimer still exists, even with IGF bound at site1a. This result indicates that one IGF molecule cannot completely break the autoinhibited conformation of IGF-1R. By analogy, one insulin molecule is likely to be insufficient to break the autoinhibited IR dimer.</p><p>We next superimposed insulin 2 and the FnIII-1 domain of insulin-bound IR dimer onto that of apo-IR dimer. Thr A8 and Ser A9 of insulin 2 bound at site 2 clashes with a β-turn motif in the L2 domain of the apo-IR dimer. Thus, insulin binding to site 2 will destabilize the inter-apo-protomer interaction 2 between the L2 domain of one protomer and the FnIII-1 domain of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the two insulins bound to sites 1a and 2 in the apo-IR clash with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These additional steric clashes, generated by the simultaneous binding of two insulins to sites 1a and 2, may further drive the two apo-IR protomers apart and completely destabilize the autoinhibited IR dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This could explain why the full activation of IR requires the binding of both insulins 1 and 2.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48630.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed working model of insulin induced activation of IR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of a working model for insulin-induced IR activation.

Based on the current models, it is still unclear how the two ‘J’-shaped protomers form the ‘T’-shaped dimer. This process has to involve coordinated structural rearrangements and inter-protomer rotations. The ‘T’-shaped active dimer is predominantly stabilized by a tripartite interface between insulin 1, L1, α-CT, and FnIII-1 domains, without the involvement of insulin 2. Moreover, the membrane proximal regions from both protomers is brought together by a homotypic interaction between the two FnIII-2 domains. Finally, these structural rearrangements promote the lateral TM-TM interaction, and enable trans-autophosphorylation between the two intracellular kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). An endocytosis pathway, which involves the binding of MAD2-BUBR1 as well as the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 to the IR intracellular domain, then triggers the internalization of the active IR dimer and stops insulin signaling at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our structural and functional analyses indicate that binding of maximally four insulins to two distinct types of sites disrupt the autoinhibited IR dimer. The relaxed IR dimer with insulin bound then undergo structural rearrangements to form a ‘T’-shaped active dimer, which is stabilized by a tripartite interaction between insulin 1, L1, α-CT, and FnIII-1 domains. This binding mode strongly supports the previous insulin ‘cross-linking’ model. Additionally, we observed that the ‘T’-shaped IR active dimer is further stabilized the homotypic interaction between the two FnIII-2 domains from the two protomers. This specific conformation of IR dimer facilitates the dimerization of the TM domain, thereby bringing the two kinase domains into close proximity for trans-autophosphorylation. Our study provides key mechanistic insight into the initiation of insulin signaling and paves the road for the eventual therapeutic intervention of diseases caused by insulin dysregulation.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Meyts et al. (1973)</xref> have proposed that the binding of multiple insulins to IR occurs with negative cooperativity. The 2:3 or 2:4 stoichiometry of insulin binding to the IR and the two types of binding sites are consistent with previous IR–insulin binding assays that indicated the coexistence of high- and low-affinity insulin-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schäffer, 1994</xref>). To understand the cooperativity between the binding of multiple insulins to different sites, we obtained a dose-response curve of insulin-dependent activation of IR WT and the site 2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Both dose-response curves of IR WT and site 2 mutant could be fitted with the Hill equation, with Hill coefficients of ~0.64 and~0.42, respectively, which are indicative of negative cooperativity in insulin binding to IR. Similar results were obtained by in vitro insulin binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because the IR site 2 mutant exhibits even stronger negative cooperativity and because insulin binding to site 2 is required for maximum insulin binding and full activation of IR, our results suggest that insulin binding to site 2 might dampen the anti-cooperativity between insulin binding to site 1 and site 1’. The combination of cooperative binding between sites 1 and 2 and anti-cooperativity binding between sites 1 and 1’ likely underlies the complicated shapes of the binding curves between IR and insulin. This unique system allows IR to respond differently to a wide range of insulin concentrations that various tissues experience at different metabolic states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Our functional analyses indicate that site 1 and site 2 are both required for optimal IR activation. It remains unknown which site is occupied first. Based on the different binding affinities between these two sites and all the existing structural models, we speculate that one insulin binding to site 1 happens first, but may only lead to a partially active IR with an asymmetrical conformation. The subsequent binding of one insulin to site 2 facilitates the binding of the second insulin 1 to site 1’, and thereby driving the formation of the symmetrical dimer and full IR activation. This hypothesis is partially supported by our new structural model that binding of two site-1 insulins and at least one site-2 insulin is necessary to promote the formation of the ‘T’-shaped IR dimer. Solving the structures of IR site 1 and 2 mutants is needed to further test this hypothesis.</p><p>We also do not know for certain how many insulins are required for IR activation. It is possible that, at low insulin concentrations, IR with partial insulin occupancy (e.g. one insulin at site 1) can achieve asymmetric conformations and exhibit different levels of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weis et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, insulin can trigger both the metabolic and mitogenic responses through IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Meyts, 2000</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the conformational differences of IR caused by different stoichiometries of bound insulins may provide a mechanism in defining insulin signaling specificity, which could potentially allow the same ligand (i.e. insulin) to generate distinct signaling outputs from the same receptor (i.e. IR). Future biophysical and in vivo experiments, preferably those involving single-molecule techniques, are required to define the intermediate steps of IR activation. Our structure of the fully liganded IR-insulin complex serves as an important guide for designing these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Each micrograph was dose-fractionated to 30 frames under a dose rate of 4 e<sup>-</sup>/pixel/s, with a total exposure time of 15 s, resulting in a total dose of about 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image processing</title><p>The detailed image processing statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Motion correction was performed using the MotionCorr2 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), and the CTF parameters of the micrographs were estimated using the GCTF program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Initially,~2000 particles were picked with EMAN2 from a few micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). All other steps of image processing were performed using RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Scheres, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012b</xref>). Class averages representing projections in different orientations selected from the initial 2D classification were used as templates for automatic particle picking from the full datasets. Extracted particles were binned three times and subjected to 2D classification. Particles from the classes with fine structural features were selected for 3D classification. Approximately 20,000 particles were selected to generate the initial model in RELION. Particles from the 3D classes showing good secondary structural features were selected and re-extracted into the original pixel size of 1.07 Å. 3D refinements with C2 symmetry imposed resulted in 3D reconstructions to 3.2 Å resolution. To improve the resolution, we performed another round of 3D refinement with a soft mask around the top part of complex, leading to improved resolution for this region. Moreover, we classified the refined particles set by using local search in combination with small angular sampling, resulting a new class showing improved density for TM domain.</p><p>To separate the particles with different insulin occupancies, we performed focused classification with symmetry expansion and signal subtraction, as described in our previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). We duplicated each particle and rotated the second copy of each particle around the two fold symmetrical axis for 180° to put the site 1/2 and site 1’/2’ in the same position for focused classicization. The symmetry expanded particles set was classified with a local mask around site 1 or two without any angular alignment. As IR is much larger than insulin, the density corresponding to IR was subtracted from each experimental particle for consistent comparison. The resulting classes show similar level of intensity for insulin 1, but different levels of intensities for insulin 2. The C1 refinement was performed for particles from the classes having weak insulin two density.</p><p>All resolutions were estimated by applying a soft mask around the protein density using the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheres and Chen, 2012c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>Model building of the IR–insulin complex was initiated by docking each individual domain derived from the crystal structures of IR (PDB ID: 4ZXB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Croll et al., 2016</xref>) and insulin (PDB ID: 1MSO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2003</xref>) into the high-resolution map from the focused refinement in the program Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The model was manually adjusted in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and refined against the map by using the real space refinement module with secondary structure and non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in the Phenix package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). To check for potential model overfitting, the coordinates in the model were refined against one of the half maps calculated from half of the dataset in RELION. The FSC curve from this model and map was only slightly worse than that calculated from the refined model and the summed map, suggesting no overfitting. The crystal structures of FnIII-2/3 domains were rigid-body fitted into the cryo-EM density in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), showing good agreement.

Cells were free from mycoplasma contamination. Plasmid transfection was performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). After 1 day, the cells were serum starved for 14 hr and treated with 10 nM of human insulin (I2643, Sigma) or the indicated concentrations for 5 min. The cells were washed with cold PBS and incubated with the cell lysis buffer [50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) Glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)] supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and PhosSTOP (Roche) on ice for 1 hr. After centrifugation at 20,817 g at 4°C for 20 min, the concentrations of cell lysate were measured using Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Cell lysates (50 µg total proteins) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Anti-IR-pY1150/1151 (19H7, Cell signaling; labeled as pY IRβ) and anti-MYC (9E10, Roche; labeled as IRβ) were used as primary antibodies. For quantitative Western blots, anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H+L) (Dylight 800 conjugates) and anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Dylight 680 conjugates) (Cell signaling) were used as secondary antibodies.

Insulin and the dye were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:2 and incubated for 12 hr at 4°C. Labeled Insulin was separated from the free dye by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA. The insulin-binding assay was performed as described previously with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murphy et al., 1982</xref>). Briefly, plasmid transfection was performed with LipofectamineTM 2000 into 293FT cells. After 1 day, the cells were serum starved for 14 hr. To inhibit insulin receptor endocytosis, the plates were then changed to serum free DMEM containing the IR/IGF1R inhibitor BMS536924 (1 μM; Tocris) for an additional 1 hr before insulin treatment. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing Alexa Fluor 488-labeled insulin at the indicated concentrations. After 5 min of incubation in CO<sub>2</sub> incubators at 37°C, the medium was removed and the plates were washed with cold PBS. Cells were dissociated in 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS at 37°C for 5 min, transferred into conical tubes, centrifuged for 5 min at 200 g at 4°C. After two more washes with cold PBS, the cells were resuspended in 300 μl of cold PBS and transferred into tubes for FACS analysis. Samples were kept on ice and analyzed within 30 min. The samples were analyzed on a Cytoflex Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). At least 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Nikolaus Grigorieff, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Uchikawa et al. describe cryo-EM studies of the full-length insulin receptor (in DDM micelles). By focusing on the extracellular region alone, their structure does provide some new insights that are important for the field. It has long been proposed that each IR has two binding sites for insulin, and here – with excess/saturating insulin – the authors observe that there two sites on each receptor occupied. This is the first structural view of the 'second' binding site – which was previously identified only through alanine scanning and other biochemical techniques. However, revisions are required to ensure that the 2-fold symmetry is not an image processing artifact, and certain statements should be toned down and qualified, as outlined in the points below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cryo-EM work looks solid. However, since one of the main points of the manuscript is the number of insulin molecules bound to the receptor, it is important to make sure that there are no image processing artifacts. Insulin has a molecular mass of about 5 kDa, small for cryo-EM purposes. This means detecting the presence of insulin at any of the binding sites might not be completely reliable. The authors rely in their analysis on the 3D classification without symmetry, concluding that their complex has 2-fold symmetry because the one good class they obtained does not display significant asymmetry. However, it is uncertain if asymmetric binding of the 5 kDa insulin would have been detected by this classification. It is a bit surprising that the authors apparently did not find even a minor class with sub-stoichiometrically bound insulin. This would have validated that classification can distinguish different binding site occupancies. The authors should double-check the classes and particle selections. If their classification procedure cannot make this distinction, the reconstruction shown by the authors could represent a mixture of occupied and unoccupied sites, averaging to the same overall ligand density in all sites and giving the false impression of 2-fold symmetry and four bound insulins. Ideally, to test if image processing can detect asymmetric binding, the authors could perhaps collect a dataset of receptor titrated with insulin to a level that is known to yield sub-stoichiometric binding, showing that they can detect this with their 3D classification.</p><p>2) The authors should also comment on the identity of the 926,144 particles that were initially picked but later discarded. The current analysis assumes that the activated state of the receptor is represented by a single, well-ordered conformation. Is it possible that there are other conformations hidden among the discarded particles that are more disordered and therefore did not yield &quot;good&quot; class averages? How can the authors exclude this possibility?</p><p>3) The horizontal part of the &quot;T&quot; (and site 1 occupancy) seems to be precisely the same as that published in previous studies – there is nothing new there. The arguments presented in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Overall structure of full-length human IR bound to insulin” supporting the idea that the structure described here is <italic>the</italic> 'active' form (based largely on TM domain proximity in Figure 1—figure supplement 4B) are not convincing, though – and this presumption seems to limit the way in which the authors interpret their findings. The description of the structure and conformational changes – and associated mutation data – all seem fine and interesting. For site 1 binding, this echoes previous work. The description of the importance of site 2 binding seems more speculative. The clashes suggested in Figure 5 seem to make sense, but the model in Figure 7 (and Supplementary Video 1) are highly speculative, and how the 'two J-shaped protomers can spontaneously to form the T-shaped dimer through inter-protomer rotations' is not described at all. These aspects are just supposition. The authors should also try to put the potential activation mechanism in a better literature context – in light of the specific proposals made by De Meyts, Schafer, and others. At present, the authors present data that site 1 and site 2 are both important, but they do not present any data to suggest that 4:2 (Ins:IR) binding is important for activation (rather than 3:2 or even 2:2). Please soften the text where required and discuss these points.</p><p>4) Did the authors analyze insulin binding to the protein used for their EM studies? A crucial question – related to their discussion in the subsection “A tripartite interface between insulin 1 and site 1 stabilizes the active IR dimer” – is whether IR in these micelles behaves like IR in membranes or like the isolated extracellular region. Does this protein prep display negative cooperativity? Or is this complex one step beyond the 3:2 (Ins:IR) complex that De Meyt's proposed for the intact receptor in cells? Assessment of ligand binding characteristics – in the DDM micelles as used for EM (not in cells) – is essential for putting this structure in context.</p><p>5) The results presented in Figure 6 seem superfluous and superficial, and lack key controls. They would best be omitted. It is frequently the case that mutations in RTKs cause misfolding and aggregation in the ER – leading to constitutive activation that is not informative. The C647A mutation seems a likely candidate for such a mutation, since it involves a residue that is involved in maturation of the IR. No controls for this possibility (probability) are provided. Do the C647A variants make it to the cell surface? Do they even bind insulin? These are crucial controls that are currently absent – making the result uninterpretable at present.</p><p>6) Physiological Insulin concentrations sufficient to activate IR are in the 300 pM-1 nM range, and the authors' samples were prepared at &gt;20 μM IR/Insulin concentrations-or concentrations &gt;10,000 fold higher than physiological concentrations. The decreased but not abolished IR activity in IR variants with amino-acid substitutions at the second interface may also be explained by effects on the large and complex interdomain rearrangements that the author's and earlier IR/Ins structures show occur when ligand binds. Please comment and discuss.</p><p>7) A related structural study to this work was also recently deposited by Coskun's group to bioRxiv, adding confidence to the structural findings. Please comment and discuss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48630.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cryo-EM work looks solid.

We completely agree with the reviewers that the initial 3D classification with coarse angular sampling may not be good enough to separate the particles with different numbers of bound ligands, due to the fact that insulin is much smaller than IR. To address this issue, we performed symmetry expansion in combination with focused classification on insulin with signal subtraction of the receptor (a similar approach has been described in our previous works, Bai et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015). As the insulin molecules are too small to be aligned on their own, during focused classification, the orientations of the insulins were kept the same as those determined by the consensus C2 refinement of the entire complex. As a result, we can identify two major classes having different stoichiometries for insulin binding. In particular, 63% of the particles have 4 insulins bound (two each at sites 1 and 2), while 33% of the particles have 3 insulins bound (two at site 1; one at site 2). We performed another 3D refinement with C1 symmetry applied for the particles with only 3 insulin bound, and found that there is only a subtle difference between the structures of IR with 3 or 4 insulins bound, which indicates that binding of insulins to both sites 2 and 2’ is not required for the maintenance of the T-shaped IR dimer. This notion is consistent with our structural analysis that the T-shaped dimer is mainly stabilized by the tripartite interface formed between insulin 1 and several domains of IR. Importantly, the vast majority (96%) of the T-shaped particles have at least one insulin bound to site 2 or 2’, suggesting that insulin binding to site 2 plays an important role in promoting the conformational change of IR to form the active T shape. We have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 5) and a new paragraph in the main text to describe this new 3D classification result in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the great suggestion of collecting cryo-EM data on a series of IR samples with different insulin concentrations. In this way, we may be able to solve the structures for intermediate conformational states of IR that have one or two insulins bound. This will be our next major goal. In parallel, we also plan to use the site 2 mutations to trap IR in these intermediate states. This is clearly beyond the scope of this particular paper, however. We hope the reviewers would agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should also comment on the identity of the 926,144 particles that were initially picked but later discarded. The current analysis assumes that the activated state of the receptor is represented by a single, well-ordered conformation. Is it possible that there are other conformations hidden among the discarded particles that are more disordered and therefore did not yield &quot;good&quot; class averages? How can the authors exclude this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this critical comment. Among the 926,144 particles, 868,657 particles were discarded after the 2D classification. To explain the criteria used to discard particles, we show all the class averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, with some representative classes not chosen for further processing highlighted in red. The majority of 868,657 discarded particles were empty detergent micelles and mis-picked junk particles. To prevent bias in selecting class averages, we chose nearly all remaining classes for subsequent 3D classification. On the other hand, the extreme hydrophobic air-water interface on the cryo-EM grids can potentially damage our protein complex. This type of protein damage can be more severe to cell receptors with an elongated shape, such as IR. This could explain why some of the 3D classes show similar shapes to the “good” classes, but were only resolved at low resolution. Discarding particles from such “bad” classes may remove damaged particles from the dataset, thereby improving the quality for the final 3D reconstruction. As excess insulin was added to the final sample to saturate IR binding, we believe that our cryo-EM sample used in this work is relatively homogenous, which facilitates the generation of high-resolution cryo-EM maps.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>EM analysis of IR.</title><p>Some representative classes that are not selected for further processing are highlighted in red box.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48630-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The horizontal part of the &quot;T&quot; (and site 1 occupancy) seems to be precisely the same as that published in previous studies – there is nothing new there.

We completely agree with the reviewers that we do not know for certain that the T-shaped dimer is the only active form of IR. It is likely that IR with different numbers of insulin bound may adopt different active conformations. Indeed, our cell-based assays show that the IR site 2 mutant exhibits approximately 50% activity as compared to IR WT, not completely inactive. We have changed the text from “the active form” to “one of its active forms”.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that, due to the lack of structures of intermediate states of IR, we do not know how the two J-shaped protomers undergo structural rearrangements to form the T-shaped dimer. We have removed the speculative text, and stated that “Based on the current models, it is still unclear how the two “J”-shaped protomers form the “T”-shaped dimer.” in the revised manuscript. We have removed Supplementary Video 1 from supplementary materials and modified the working model in Figure 6 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Based on the current results, the dual roles of insulin 1 binding for IR activation have been well defined. Insulin binding to site 1 is required to disrupt the auto-inhibited apo-state, and it subsequently stabilizes the active dimer by simultaneously contacting multiple domains of both IR protomers. This activation mechanism involving insulin 1 binding strongly supports the long-known “cross-linking” model first proposed by Schafer in 1994. On the other hand, the functional role of insulin 2 is not completely understood. Based on our new structural model, we propose that insulin binding to site 2 of the apo-state of IR may help to disrupt the auto-inhibited conformation, which promotes the formation of the active state of IR. Moreover, a characteristic feature of insulin binding to IR is negative cooperativity, which was firstly observed by De Meyts in 1973. Interestingly, our dose-response activity assays show that the IR site 2 mutant exhibits stronger negative cooperativity than IR WT, suggesting that insulin binding to site 2 reduces the negative cooperativity between site 1 and site 1’. Thus, we propose that following the binding of the first insulin to site 1, insulin binding to site 2 may facilitate the binding of the second insulin 1 to site 1’, thereby driving the formation of the symmetrical T-shaped IR dimer and full IR activation. Consistent with this hypothesis, our new focused 3D classification results suggest that binding of two site-1 insulins and the forming the T-shaped IR dimer require the binding of at least one site-2 insulin. Solving the structures of IR site 1 and 2 mutants in the presence of insulin is needed to further test this hypothesis.</p><p>We have softened our text and added discussion about these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors analyze insulin binding to the protein used for their EM studies?

As suggested, we have tested insulin binding to the same full-length IR sample used for cryo-EM analysis. Our binding results showed that recombinant IR isolated with the detergent DDM binds insulin with high affinity and displays negative cooperativity, comparable to our cell-based insulin-binding results. This finding suggests that DDM does not change insulin-binding behaviors. We have incorporated the new results into Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>In addition, the cryo-EM structure of IR extracellular domain (ECD) bound with 4 insulins recently solved by another group displays a nearly identical architecture to our DDM-isolated full-length IR/insulin complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The results presented in Figure 6 seem superfluous and superficial, and lack key controls. They would best be omitted. It is frequently the case that mutations in RTKs cause misfolding and aggregation in the ER – leading to constitutive activation that is not informative. The C647A mutation seems a likely candidate for such a mutation, since it involves a residue that is involved in maturation of the IR. No controls for this possibility (probability) are provided. Do the C647A variants make it to the cell surface? Do they even bind insulin? These are crucial controls that are currently absent – making the result uninterpretable at present.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this result is peripheral to our main conclusions. We have removed the data and discussion on the C647A mutation in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Physiological Insulin concentrations sufficient to activate IR are in the 300 pM-1 nM range, and the authors' samples were prepared at &gt;20 μM IR/Insulin concentrations-or concentrations &gt;10,000 fold higher than physiological concentrations. The decreased but not abolished IR activity in IR variants with amino-acid substitutions at the second interface may also be explained by effects on the large and complex interdomain rearrangements that the author's and earlier IR/Ins structures show occur when ligand binds. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this critical comment, and completely understand their concern. To ease this concern, we would like to point out that all our cell-based IR activation and insulin binding assays for wild-type IR, IR site 1 mutants and IR site 2 mutants were done at insulin concentrations ranging from 0.8 nM to 80 nM, which is close to the blood insulin concentrations, as mentioned by the reviewer. The results show that insulin binding at site 2 is important for full IR activation at physiological insulin concentration. In fact, IR site 2 mutants exhibited even greater insulin binding deficiency at low insulin concentrations (0.8 nM), as compared to that at higher insulin concentrations, confirming that insulin binding at site 2 occurs at physiologically relevant insulin concentrations.</p><p>The structure of FnIII-1 of insulin-bound IR can be superimposed perfectly onto that of apo-IR, suggesting that these surface residues at the second interface in FnIII-1 domain are unlikely to play any roles in driving the interdomain rearrangements during IR activation. Furthermore, previous mutagenesis analyses of insulin have identified the insulin residues responsible for binding to site 2. These insulin residues are located at the new IR-insulin interface at site 2 in our structure. Thus, mutations of interface residues of both IR (by us in this study) and insulin (reported previously by others) confirm the functional importance of the new site 2 in insulin-dependent activation of IR, and completely exclude the possibility that the site 2 identified in this work is a structural artifact.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the IR site 2 mutations only decreased, but did not abolish, IR activity. One possible explanation is that, at low insulin concentrations, IR with partial insulin occupancy (e.g. one insulin at site 1) can achieve asymmetric conformations and partial activation. Increased insulin occupancy at site 2 promotes the formation of the T-shaped symmetric conformation and full activation. It is tempting to speculate that the conformational differences of IR caused by different stoichiometries of bound insulins may provide a mechanism in defining insulin signaling specificity, which could potentially allow the same ligand to generate distinct signaling outputs from the same receptor. Future biophysical and in vivo experiments, preferably those involving single-molecule techniques, are required to define the intermediate steps of IR activation.</p><p>We have toned down our conclusions and added discussion about these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A related structural study to this work was also recently deposited by Coskun's group to bioRxiv, adding confidence to the structural findings. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this good point. Indeed, this cryo-EM structure of IR ECD bound with 4 insulins shows nearly identical architecture to our full-length IR/insulin complexes, supporting our new finding. Nevertheless, our cryo-EM map was resolved at much higher resolution, which provides more structural details. Our functional studies are also more thorough. We have cited and discussed this preprint in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
