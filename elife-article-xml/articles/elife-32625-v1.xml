areas. In this study in Burkina Faso, we assessed natural exposure to mosquitoes by matching the genotype of blood meals from 1066 mosquitoes with blood from residents of local households. We observed that the distribution of mosquito bites exceeded the Pareto rule (20/80) in two of the three surveys performed (20/85, 76, and 96) and, at its most pronounced, is estimated to have profound epidemiological consequences, inflating the basic reproduction number of malaria by 8-fold. The distribution of bites from sporozoite-positive mosquitoes followed a similar pattern, with a small number of individuals within households receiving multiple potentially infectious bites over the period of a few days. Together, our findings indicate that heterogeneity in mosquito exposure contributes considerably to heterogeneity in infection risk and suggest significant variation in malaria transmission potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anopheles</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AFIRM OPP1034789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name><name><surname>Drakeley</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>016.158.306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heterogeneity in exposure to malaria vectors, including sporozoite-infected mosquitoes, contributes to the variation in human infection risk and amplifies the local transmission potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria epidemiology is doubly dependent on the frequency and efficiency of contacts between human hosts and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, which link the number of mosquito infections caused by an infectious human host and the rate at which uninfected humans acquire infections. Describing the variability in the frequency of human sampling by malaria vectors is therefore essential to understand parasite transmission from and to humans. While at a local level vector density determines average mosquito exposure, even within the same locality individuals may not be equally likely to be bitten by <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindsay et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knols et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carnevale et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muirhead-Thomson, 1951</xref>). Exposure to malaria vectors is influenced by host availability (i.e., amount of time an individual remains unprotected against mosquito bites in an environment where anopheline mosquitoes are present) and attractiveness to mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yakob, 2016</xref>). Availability determines when and where individuals might be sampled by mosquitoes: a multicentre study in Africa that collected entomological and human behavioural data estimated that more than three quarters of human exposure to anopheline mosquito bites occur when individuals are indoors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huho et al., 2013</xref>). For individuals who are accessible to malaria vectors, age and body surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carnevale et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Port et al., 1980</xref>) are two major determinants of attractiveness to mosquitoes, although other factors also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knols et al., 1995a</xref>).</p><p>The multifactorial nature of mosquito exposure in malaria endemic areas indicates that, while experimental and quasi-experimental, for example involving modified tents and huts, entomological studies are valuable, they will not accurately capture inter-individual variation in actual exposure. Identifying transmission heterogeneities, especially extreme heterogeneities, is however critical to better inform infectious disease epidemiology and well-established theory has elucidated their implications for pathogen spread and control measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woolhouse et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we describe the variability in natural exposure to malaria vectors by linking, through DNA fingerprinting, blood meals of wild-caught mosquitoes to humans living in the households where they were collected. Previously we have shown that these mosquitoes fed more often on adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). We now extend this analysis to assess the degree of heterogeneity in the distribution of mosquito bites in the population at different times during the transmission season. We also present the frequency of <italic>Anopheles</italic> species-specific mosquito bites, and potential parasite inoculations (i.e., sporozoite-positive mosquito bites) per individual.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study households</title><p>We performed indoor resting collections of anopheline mosquitoes in an area with seasonal malaria transmission in Burkina Faso. Thirty-five households were included in this analysis. The median number of individuals living in each study household was 3 (range, 2–8). Reported bed net use among the study participants was high (111/126, 88.1%). At enrolment (October – December 2013), most (79.2%) individuals were parasite-positive by <italic>18S</italic> qPCR. In 21/35 houses, all sampled individuals were malaria-infected. We collected 325, 620 and 190 bloodfed <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes at the start (2014), peak (2014) and end (2013) of the transmission season, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). During the 2013 survey, 21/35 houses had at least one bloodfed mosquito collected; in 2014, 19/20 and 20/20 households had fed mosquitoes collected at the start and peak of the transmission season, respectively. The average number of bloodfed mosquitoes collected per day in each household was higher at the start (median 2.3, interquartile range [IQR] 0.7–5.5) and peak (median 3.9, IQR 2.1–8.5) compared to the end (median 0.1, IQR 0–0.6 mosquitoes per day) of the transmission season (p=0.001 and&lt;0.001, respectively). There was no correlation between the average number of bloodfed mosquitoes collected per day and the number of individuals living in each household (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, 0.14, 0.09 and 0.05 for the first, second and third surveys respectively; all p&gt;0.05). Of note, at the end of the 2013 transmission season, most mosquito collections performed after mid-November were unsuccessful, suggesting a village-wide reduction in mosquito abundance during this period.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32625.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Study surveys</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">First survey</th><th valign="bottom">Second survey</th><th valign="bottom">Third survey</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Start Date</td><td valign="bottom">October, 2013</td><td valign="bottom">June, 2014</td><td valign="bottom">September, 2014</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of sampling days</td><td valign="bottom">54</td><td valign="bottom">20</td><td valign="bottom">20</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Timing</td><td valign="bottom">End of transmission season</td><td valign="bottom">Start of transmission season</td><td valign="bottom">Peak of transmission season</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of households</td><td valign="bottom">35*</td><td valign="bottom">20</td><td valign="bottom">20</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of participants</td><td valign="bottom">127</td><td valign="bottom">81</td><td valign="bottom">77</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"><italic>N (%)</italic></td><td valign="bottom"><italic>N (%)</italic></td><td valign="bottom"><italic>N (%)</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Age categories<sup>†</sup></td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> <italic>&lt;5 years</italic></td><td valign="bottom">20 (15.9)</td><td valign="bottom">12 (14.8)</td><td valign="bottom">12 (15.6)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> <italic>5–15 years</italic></td><td valign="bottom">62 (49.2)</td><td valign="bottom">39 (48.2)</td><td valign="bottom">37 (48.0)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> <italic>&gt;15 years</italic></td><td valign="bottom">44 (34.9)</td><td valign="bottom">30 (37.0)</td><td valign="bottom">28 (36.4)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Gender</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Male</td><td valign="bottom">41 (32.5)</td><td valign="bottom">22 (27.2)</td><td valign="bottom">21 (27.3)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"> Female</td><td valign="bottom">85 (67.5)</td><td valign="bottom">59 (72.8)</td><td valign="bottom">56 (72.7)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Prevalence of falciparum parasites</td><td valign="bottom">99 (79.2)</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Prevalence of falciparum gametocytes</td><td valign="bottom">79 (64.2)</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Number of bloodfed mosquitoes collected</td><td valign="bottom">190</td><td valign="bottom">325</td><td valign="bottom">620</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Demographic information not available for individuals living in 5/40 households (first survey only);</p><p><sup>†</sup>Age at enrolment (first survey).</p></fn><fn><p>Parasite prevalence was determined by <italic>18S</italic> qPCR; gametocyte prevalence by <italic>Pfs25</italic> mRNA qRT-PCR.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Heterogeneity in exposure to malaria vectors</title><p>DNA extracted from mosquito blood meals and blood samples from individuals living in study households were genotyped using a microsatellite-based assay (see Materials and methods). Most (1,066/1,135, 93.9%) collected bloodfed mosquitoes had their blood meal analysed. One hundred mosquitoes did not produce discernible amplification products. Mosquito blood meals with multiple human DNA sources (N = 153), and typed blood meals that were not matched to residents of study houses (N = 139) were not included in this analysis. Estimates of mosquito exposure were based on 68.9% (666/966) of the successfully typed blood meals; this percentage was consistent across surveys (64.9%, 71.7% and 69.8% at the start, peak and end of transmission season). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the distributions of the number of mosquito bites each individual received during different study surveys are presented. Approximately 20% of individuals, of all ages, provided 85.1%, 76.0% and 95.5% of single mosquito blood meals at the start, peak and end of the transmission season, respectively. Throughout the study, a small number of individuals, mostly adults, were matched to considerably higher numbers of blood meals compared to the rest of the population. Conversely, 32.0–76.2% of study participants were not linked to bloodfed mosquitoes during the surveys, including 15/77 individuals present in all surveys who were never matched to collected fed mosquitoes. Reported bed net use and parasite and gametocyte carriage at enrolment were not significantly associated with mosquito exposure during our study (incidence rate ratio of 0.70 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.22–2.20, p=0.55] for reported bed net use versus no net use in a model adjusted for survey and of 3.42 [95% CI 0.50–23.45, p=0.21] and 0.99 [95% CI 0.32–3.10, p=0.99] for parasite and gametocyte carriage at enrolment respectively in models that only included data from the first survey). In an analysis of data from all surveys, negative binomial regression with mixed effects better explained the distribution of mosquito bite counts than mixed effects Poisson models (p&lt;0.001), after adjustments for age, which influences <italic>Anopheles</italic> exposure in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>), survey and intra-household data correlation. In sensitivity analyses that assigned blood meals with multiple human DNA sources to the least exposed individuals in each household, the ~20% of the population with most mosquito bites were linked to at least 70% of matched blood meals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also performed an analysis that assigned multiple source blood meals to study participants based on minimal genetic distances to those meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). This approach results in a similar pattern:~20% of the population received 78.6, 76.3% and 94.2% of all mosquito bites at the start, peak and end of the transmission season, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32625.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inter-individual variation in exposure to <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.</title><p>In (<bold>a</bold>) the frequency distributions of mosquito blood meals matched to each study participant are presented for the three different surveys.

We observed significant differences in the numbers of bloodfed mosquitoes matched to study participants that are consistent with or even exceeding the Pareto rule, with ~20% of individuals being the source of more than 80% of all singly-matched blood meals. This heterogeneity was also apparent within-household, where the individual who received the most bites often contributed more than 50% of anopheline meals. Exposure to potentially infective mosquito bites also followed an aggregated pattern: 5.1, 13.9% and 6.5% of the population experienced 80% of parasite inoculations at the start, peak and end of the transmission season, respectively. Taken together, our observations indicate that relatively few individuals at different timepoints disproportionally contribute to malaria transmission by being repeatedly sampled and infected by malaria vectors. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms that lead to heterogeneity in human malaria infection risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bejon et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mwakalinga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kangoye et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several previous studies have quantified inter-individual differences in attractiveness and exposure to mosquitoes using a range of methodologies. While studies involving experimental huts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindsay et al., 1993</xref>) and olfactometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukabana et al., 2002a</xref>) demonstrated the influence of individual-level factors such as pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lindsay et al., 2000</xref>) and infection status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lacroix et al., 2005</xref>) on attractiveness to mosquitoes, community-wide assessments of wild-caught mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Port et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soremekun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vazquez-Prokopec et al., 2016</xref>) are necessary to quantify variation in exposure to malaria vectors over larger scales. A study in The Gambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Port et al., 1980</xref>) in the 1980's used ABO group and haptoglobin typing to identify the sources of mosquito blood meals; the small number of variants in these markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukabana et al., 2002b</xref>) limited the selection of households. In Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soremekun et al., 2004</xref>), microsatellites were used to link blood meals to humans to assess the protection afforded by bed nets against mosquitoes; a high proportion of the ~250 analysed bloodfed mosquitoes were matched to individuals sleeping in the same room where they were collected, including in the village with bed nets, and 80% of matched blood meals came from less than 20% of the population. In our study, we matched 666 blood meals to individual study participants and observed that the distribution of mosquito bites was highly overdispersed in relation to a Poisson assumption, with 76.0–95.5% of singly matched blood meals originating from ~20% of the study population. These results corroborate the findings of the study in Tanzania and of a different study in western Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2006</xref>), where 16% of the study participants were matched to 58% of <italic>Anopheles</italic> blood meals. By examining mosquito exposure repeatedly in an area of pronounced seasonality, we demonstrate even more unequal exposure patterns across three timepoints in the season. Applying simple, well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Churcher et al., 2015</xref>) methods, we estimated that the observed degree of mosquito biting heterogeneity could be linked to a 3-fold or higher increase in malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> compared to a random-mixing system. This suggests that in settings with considerable variation in mosquito exposure, heterogeneity in biting is likely to be a major determinant of the coverage of vector control interventions required to reduce and interrupt transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). These <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>-focused calculations however have limitations. Firstly, although there is a positive relationship between <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> and variability in <italic>Anopheles</italic> biting, in finite populations increasing aggregation in exposure does not necessarily equate to increasing community-wide infection burden, since in areas with highly heterogeneous mosquito biting a high proportion of parasite inoculations will be on already-infected individuals. Additionally, the framework used here does not account for previously observed interactions between frequency of exposure to infected mosquitoes and rates of immunity acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bejon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke et al., 2002</xref>), which could influence blood stage parasite burden and potentially the production of transmission stages in highly exposed, highly immune individuals. Development of detailed mathematical models that explicitly incorporate immunity and spatial dependencies (see next paragraph) would allow more precise estimation of the long-term influence of the observed variation in mosquito exposure on malaria transmission dynamics.</p><p>The fact that the majority of human-mosquito encounters in each survey involved only a few individuals is a consequence of both between- and within-household variation in exposure. Indeed, at the peak of the transmission season, the household with the highest number of fed mosquitoes had ~150 times more than the household with the lowest number. Household characteristics such as construction material, number of windows, eaves as well as geographical proximity to mosquito breeding sites have all been previously associated with increased exposure to mosquitoes indoors and explain some of the between-household variation in mosquito abundance. To understand the implications of our current findings for malaria control, data on geographical and temporal clustering of <italic>Anopheles</italic> exposure, malaria infection and disease are needed. A study in Kenya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bejon et al., 2014</xref>) showed that foci of clinical malaria are unstable and that one-month surveillance data, for example, might only have predictive value of higher-than-average transmission over short periods of time. This is consistent with our observation that the ranking of households according to the number of infected mosquito bites per individual varies over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and poses considerable challenges to sustainably targeting high exposure households for maximum community benefit.</p><p>We also found that household heterogeneity is compounded by inter-individual variation in frequency of sampling by mosquitoes for people in the same house. At the peak of the transmission season, the maximum difference in numbers of matched meals for participants in the same house ranged from 1 to 51, that is a difference of up to ~10 mosquito bites per day. Age and body size can partially explain differences in attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muirhead-Thomson, 1951</xref>) yet we often noted age-matched individuals in the same house with dissimilar mosquito exposure. Other individual-level characteristics such as odours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukabana et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>), (effective) use of protective measures or behaviour will be relevant; in our study, bed net use and gametocyte carriage were not significantly associated with the number of mosquito bites an individual received though this study was not designed to assess the influence of these factors on mosquito exposure. Of note, the age distribution of our study population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) might not reflect the true demography of the region. Whilst our results are in agreement with previous studies, we cannot exclude that a difference in age composition related to the fact that only houses with at least one child were included in the study may have influenced our heterogeneity estimates. Furthermore, we observed that blood meals from 8.2% of tested mosquitoes did not amplify for human DNA. Although it is possible that some of these mosquitoes fed on domestic animals, since it is unlikely that non-human biting would divert bites from specific hosts, we do not expect this to bias our individual-level estimates.</p><p>A technical limitation of this study was that our analyses only used data from ~70% of all successfully typed mosquito meals. Of those not matched, 139/292 were single blood meals from individuals not in our study houses and 153/292 had evidence of multiple blood meals. The distribution of these bites, each representing at least two host-vector encounters, is likely to be an important determinant of <italic>Anopheles</italic> exposure, in particular if some individuals are over-represented in these mixed meals, for example due to frequent defensive behaviour that leads to interrupted mosquito feeding and multiple probing. However, in a conservative sensitivity analysis that assigned these meals to the individuals with lowest exposure in each household, most mosquito bites were still linked to a small proportion of the population. Those mosquitoes whose blood meals did not match residents of study houses are likely to have fed in neighbouring houses or outdoors before entering study houses. The genetic profiles of these unmatched blood meals also suggest a heterogeneous feeding pattern: in the three houses with more than 10 unmatched mosquitoes, 16/41, 8/13 and 31/33 blood meals had the same profile. The only study house where a resident did not provide blood sample for matching had 8/10 unmatched meals presumably from the same human source. Concurrent collection of fed mosquitoes indoors and outdoors would help to understand how biting behaviour influences overall exposure.</p><p>Broad differences in anthropophily between mosquito species are well recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takken and Verhulst, 2013</xref>) however there are fewer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knols et al., 1995b</xref>) on whether different <italic>Anopheles</italic> species have different feeding preferences with regards to individual humans. In this study, we analysed blood meals in mosquitoes from three species: <italic>A. gambiae s. s.</italic>, <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> and <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>. Although seasonal differences in species abundance were evident, we observed aggregation in human biting irrespective of vector species and exposure to one species was positively associated with exposure to the others. Though we only collected endophillic mosquitoes, it suggests that where vectors are anthropophilic heterogeneity in exposure to anopheline mosquitoes is a common epidemiological phenomenon including in areas with mixed vector species. Additionally, we observed that the most numerous species in our study area, <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> and <italic>A. gambiae s. s.,</italic> differed in two key parameters that influence the transmission potential of mosquitoes: the likelihood of feeding on multiple individuals and the prevalence of sporozoites. There is evidence from membrane feeding experiments performed in Senegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ndiath et al., 2011</xref>) that <italic>A. gambiae s. s.</italic> mosquitoes might be more susceptible to malaria infection, although this association was not observed in another transmission study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gnémé et al., 2013</xref>). Another possible explanation for the observed species-related difference in sporozoite prevalence could be variation in mosquito survival and consequently age structure. The higher frequency of falciparum infection in <italic>A. gambiae s. s.</italic> mosquitoes confirms, together with its relatively high abundance, the prime importance of this species for malaria transmission in the study setting. The contributions of the different <italic>Anopheles</italic> species to the mosquito infectious reservoir also depend on the number of potential parasite inoculations per mosquito-time: mosquitoes with multiple blood meals are more likely to infect more than one individual on a single night compared to mosquitoes with single-source blood meals, assuming sufficient quantities of sporozoites are inoculated during the probing of the different hosts. The higher proportion of blood meals with multiple human DNA sources suggests that <italic>A. coluzzii</italic> mosquitoes also contribute significantly to the incidence of infection in humans. Importantly, as species composition of local vector populations varies in the course of the rainy season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dao et al., 2014</xref>), these differences might impact the rate of infection propagation in human populations over the course of a single transmission season as relative abundances of the different vector species change.</p><p>We also determined how the frequency of host-vector contacts might influence malaria infection risk in human populations. In our study area, there was considerable variation in household-specific exposure to sporozoite-positive mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At the individual level, a few individuals received multiple potentially infective bites while between 75% and 90% of the study participants were not matched to feeding by infected mosquitoes during the three study periods. Whilst this does not represent all infected mosquito bites these individuals receive during an entire transmission season, it does highlight the degree of heterogeneity in likely parasite inoculations and the limitations of using population- or region-wide entomological measures of transmission that do not capture this small-scale variation. These results also suggest that the use of blood meal genotyping with concurrent assessment of mosquito sporozoite carriage during epidemiological studies could improve our understanding of the heterogeneity in clinical malaria risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mwangi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loucoubar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ndungu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, whilst we observed a positive association between the total number of mosquito bites and the number of bites from sporozoite infected mosquitoes at the individual level, our data suggest clustering of sporozoite-positive mosquito bites at the household level that was not related to local mosquito abundance. This phenomenon could be linked to (i) a correlation between prevalence of infection in mosquitoes and in humans in the same households assuming limited mixing of mosquitoes and humans (e.g. due to the presence of breeding sites near houses, reducing the distances travelled by mosquitoes between consecutive blood meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Menach et al., 2005</xref>], or to feeding site-fidelity in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCall et al., 2001</xref>]) or possibly to (ii) factors which affect mosquito survival on a very local scale, since mosquito age is associated with cumulative risk of sporozoite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lines et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>In summary, although studies have assessed natural exposure to vectors of other infections, such as <italic>Aedes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liebman et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>Culex</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Michael et al., 2001</xref>), only limited data are available for <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soremekun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2006</xref>). In our field site, characterized by high malaria transmission intensity, we show significant heterogeneity both between and within households in terms of the number of mosquito blood meals and the distribution of potentially infectious mosquito feedings; these patterns are consistent with the 20/80 rule and support the design of interventions that aim to reduce transmission by targeting a small proportion of the population. Opportunities to specifically target high-exposure households depend on the operational feasibility to identify these households and the stability in exposure over time. A quantitative understanding of the processes leading to heterogeneity in mosquito exposure and its temporal variability would inform at which level such interventions may be targeted in different settings; this would require quantification of the relative contributions of household-level factors, differential attractiveness to mosquitoes and human behavioural factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study area and mosquito collections</title><p>This study was conducted in Balonghin (health district of Saponé, Burkina Faso). The main economic activities in this area are subsistence farming and keeping livestock . Malaria transmission is seasonal, occurring between August and December following rainfall between June and September (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ouédraogo et al., 2013</xref>), and falciparum parasite prevalence is high, above 80% by <italic>18S</italic> qPCR, during the transmission season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>). At the time of this study, seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis was not part of national guidelines in Burkina Faso. Indoor mosquito collections were performed at the end of the 2013 transmission season (October – December), and at the start (June – July 2014) and peak (September 2014) of the following wet season. Every week mosquito collections were performed in five households. Forty households with at least one household member &lt;15 years of age were included in the first survey. For each household, mosquitoes were collected between 7 and 9 AM by mouth aspiration from walls and ceilings for a maximum of 15 min per sampling morning for seven days or until 30 bloodfed <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes were collected. In 2014, mosquito collections were performed in 20 of these 40 initial households over 10 days (5 days in July, and five in September).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marc Lipsitch as Reviewing Editor and Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Lipsitch (Reviewer #1); William Hawley (Reviewer #2); Richard Paul (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that quantifies the uneven distribution of bites by malaria vectors within and between households in a village in Burkina Faso. With the specific exceptions noted below it appears to be a well-done study that is one of only few to document this phenomenon in the field using a large survey and capturing the detail (vector species, infected vs. total bites, within and between households, demographic predictors). The phenomenon has been shown theoretically to be important, so documenting how large it is makes a significant contribution to the field, which will be interesting to anyone concerned about malaria and to others interested in the role of heterogeneity in infectious diseases.</p><p>Revisions below are requested to improve the understanding of readers (including non-specialists) of the context and precise implications of the finding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion and some of the Results presentation should be modified to consider the following perspectives:</p><p>The authors cite compelling theoretical demonstrations that <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is massively inflated with this level of heterogeneity, compared to all behavior being average (random biting). It is not clear to me for an infection with slowly-developing immunity that <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is the best measure of impact. Suppose in the extreme case that all the mosquitoes exclusively bit 2 people of the 100 in a community. That would certainly make for a high <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> and make control by say mass vaccination or mosquito control challenging (in proportion to <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> inflation). It wouldn't however increase the burden of disease much and might decrease it, as these people would rapidly become immune, making bites on them less productive of gametocytes and further transmission (to the extent that immunity impacts transmission). Moreover (as in STI models) extreme specialization of this sort increases <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> but not necessarily prevalence because some &quot;nonspecialized&quot; bloodfeeding is necessary to disperse infection into the wider community. This is an important limitation of the <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>-focused presentation. This paper is not the place to develop the theory further, but I think emphasizing the impact on <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> means the discursive parts of the manuscript should focus on the difficulty of control (which is proportional to <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>) not &quot;transmission&quot; or &quot;endemicity&quot; generally, which does not follow in a simple way.</p><p>Another perspective on the same issue: It might be worthwhile to state that the absolute values of <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, as calculated, are notional in the sense that these are the values that would pertain in the absence of any control and any population immunity. In the case of Burkina, there's plenty of both control effort and immunity, so the actual <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is considerably less. The important lesson is that some means for better targeting control measures might be considered. Some of these are by now anodyne – we can't merely target children, but adults must be included in our efforts. We are already know that poor housing and poverty are associated with higher prevalence of malaria. While this paper very convincingly tells us that there is individual level variability in transmission – strongly associated with spatial factors – we don't yet know whether the observed spatial heterogeneity in transmission is temporally stable. If it isn't, then targeting of interventions will be hard to accomplish. But for the purposes of publication decision, this is not really of importance, as the paper presents splendid data confirming some long-held theoretical and field-based suspicions.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The reviewers had divergent opinions on the figures. Two of us found this figure in particular quite confusing. Another wrote &quot;The figures are lovely, creative, and informative, once their code is understood.&quot; It is up to the authors to consider whether greater clarity can be achieved without sacrificing information or readability. Also it would be helpful to describe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> more explicitly in the text.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We don't understand how there are 3 different curves since 1/k should give a single curve. This must be because the fold increase depends on more than 1/k, and I just don't follow the figure legend, which should provide the formula.</p><p>4) “…in our study, bed net use did not significantly influence the number of mosquito bites an individual received (P = 0.72)…”. This result should not be presented for the first time in the Discussion. A p value with no mention of effect size or CIs is bad statistical practice. More generally, the list of factors considered as potential risk factors should be presented with univariate association measures provided (point and CI); as it is we don't know what the authors tried and only know that one association was null, but not whether it was convincingly close to null or just underpowered (narrow or wide CI respectively).</p><p>5) The fifth paragraph of the Discussion is hard to understand – could not identify the main point.</p><p>6) Subsection “Study area and mosquito collections”. We would like more information. I don't understand what was done. How were households chosen and individuals in them identified? Was sleeping in the household the night of the mosquito collection necessary for inclusion (if not, maybe some heterogeneity is just because someone wasn't there). What is the mosquito trapping protocol (I don't know about mouth aspiration but want more detail anyway about how long, where, what kind of traps etc.)?</p><p>7) The paper's penultimate sentence looms over this effort: &quot;…support the design of interventions that aim to reduce transmission by a targeting a small proportion of the population.&quot; The theoretical literature already admonishes us to do this, but your data help us to grapple with the question – should we be targeting households or individuals? I think the data clearly support the former, and would suggest that your Discussion say so. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and your regression analysis – &quot;there was no evidence of individual level clustering after adjustment for household related variability (p = 0.50)” – all support the conclusion that the challenge to programs is to identify houses that attract the most mosquitoes, and not, thankfully, the most attractive individuals within houses. To gain this understanding, you advocate for &quot;studies that combine mosquito blood meal typing and parasitological and clinical follow up&quot;; in an earlier phrase &quot;factors which affect mosquito survival on a very local scale&quot; are mentioned. What about the distribution and productivity of larval habitats?

It is not clear to me for an infection with slowly-developing immunity that R<sub>0</sub> is the best measure of impact. Suppose in the extreme case that all the mosquitoes exclusively bit 2 people of the 100 in a community. That would certainly make for a high R<sub>0</sub> and make control by say mass vaccination or mosquito control challenging (in proportion to R<sub>0</sub> inflation). It wouldn't however increase the burden of disease much and might decrease it, as these people would rapidly become immune, making bites on them less productive of gametocytes and further transmission (to the extent that immunity impacts transmission). Moreover (as in STI models) extreme specialization of this sort increases R<sub>0</sub> but not necessarily prevalence because some &quot;nonspecialized&quot; bloodfeeding is necessary to disperse infection into the wider community. This is an important limitation of the R<sub>0</sub>-focused presentation. This paper is not the place to develop the theory further, but I think emphasizing the impact on R<sub>0</sub> means the discursive parts of the manuscript should focus on the difficulty of control (which is proportional to R<sub>0</sub>) not &quot;transmission&quot; or &quot;endemicity&quot; generally, which does not follow in a simple way.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the fold-changes in <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, do not necessarily reflect the true relationship between heterogeneity in vector exposure and local human infection burden (prevalence or incidence). We would also concur that highly heterogenous transmission can result in an extreme scenario where the infection burden is concentrated in, or even confined to, a very small proportion of the population. Therefore, <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is more representative of the coverage level of non-targeted vector control interventions required to interrupt transmission.</p><p>To clarify this and the subsequent comment, we have modified the following paragraph in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Applying simple, well-established (Smith et al., 2007; Churcher, Trape and Cohuet, 2015) methods, we estimated that the observed degree of mosquito biting heterogeneity could be linked to a 3-fold or higher increase in malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> compared to a random-mixing system. […] Development of detailed mathematical models that explicitly incorporate immunity and spatial dependencies (see next paragraph) would allow more precise estimation of the long-term influence of the observed variation in mosquito exposure on malaria transmission dynamics.”</p><p>We have also replaced the title of the subsection “Effect of exposure heterogeneity on transmission” (Results section) with “Effect of exposure heterogeneity on malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>”, and modified its contents (some of the modifications in this paragraph relate to other comments):</p><p>“The impact of biting heterogeneity on the resilience of vector-borne disease transmission to control interventions can be estimated using the methods described in (Dietz, 1980; Dye and Hasibeder, 1986): compared to uniform biting, the basic reproduction number (<italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>) of a vector-borne disease, which corresponds to the number of secondary infections generated by an infectious individual in the absence of any control and any population immunity, is inflated by the factor (1 + α), where α is the squared coefficient of variation of the human biting rate. […] <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is high even when the skew is reduced by the conservative sensitivity analysis that allocates multiply fed mosquitoes’ meals to the least exposed individuals, yielding <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> increases by a factor of 3.3, 3.2 and 5.7 at the start, peak and end of the transmission season, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another perspective on the same issue: It might be worthwhile to state that the absolute values of R<sub>0</sub>, as calculated, are notional in the sense that these are the values that would pertain in the absence of any control and any population immunity. In the case of Burkina, there's plenty of both control effort and immunity, so the actual R<sub>0</sub> is considerably less. The important lesson is that some means for better targeting control measures might be considered. Some of these are by now anodyne – we can't merely target children, but adults must be included in our efforts. We are already know that poor housing and poverty are associated with higher prevalence of malaria. While this paper very convincingly tells us that there is individual level variability in transmission – strongly associated with spatial factors – we don't yet know whether the observed spatial heterogeneity in transmission is temporally stable. If it isn't, then targeting of interventions will be hard to accomplish. But for the purposes of publication decision, this is not really of importance, as the paper presents splendid data confirming some long-held theoretical and field-based suspicions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that absolute values of <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> should be interpreted in the context of interventions that reduce the actual reproduction number. Because of this obvious discordance, we did not estimate local malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, opting instead to present changes in <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> (relative to a homogenous-biting system) estimated from the new data on biting variation.</p><p>As noted in the response to the previous comment we have revised the Discussion to point out 1) that <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> calculations concern scenarios where no control measures are in place in a population of immunologically naïve individuals, 2) that malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> might not be the best measure to assess the impact of biting heterogeneity on local malaria burden, 3) that <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> amplification due to variation in mosquito exposure determines requirements for control strategies to be effective, and 4) that more complex mathematical models that account for correlations between malaria exposure and rate of immunity acquisition might inform how the distribution of mosquito bites influences different human malaria metrics.</p><p>In addition to these modifications related to <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, we also agree with the reviewers that characterising the temporal variation in the spatial distribution of mosquito bites is essential to determine the feasibility of spatially targeted interventions. Bejon and colleagues showed that foci of clinical malaria are unstable and that one-month surveillance data might only have predictive value of future hotspots for short periods of time (A micro-epidemiological analysis of febrile malaria in Coastal Kenya showing hotspots within hotspots. <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). This is consistent with our observation that the ranking of houses according to the number of infected mosquito bites per individual varies over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To this, we add that determining the spatial scale of malaria transmission is also important. The average distance between locations where consecutive blood meals of the same mosquito take place is likely to influence the contribution of different households to community-wide transmission, and consequently is a measure of the maximal efficacy of spatially targeted interventions (see Perkins et al. Heterogeneity, Mixing, and the Spatial Scales of Mosquito-Borne Pathogen Transmission. PLOS Computational Biology 2013 for a detailed discussion on spatial scale of malaria transmission; see McCall et al. Evidence for memorized site-fidelity in <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2001 and Le Menach et al. The unexpected importance of mosquito oviposition behaviour for malaria: non-productive larval habitats can be sources for malaria transmission. Malaria Journal 2005 for possible mechanisms influencing the scale of transmission).</p><p>We modified the following paragraph to emphasize the need to quantify temporal variation in the spatial distribution of mosquito bites. These changes are equally relevant to comment 7.</p><p>“The fact that the majority of human-mosquito encounters in each survey involved only a few individuals is a consequence of both between- and within-household variation in exposure. […] We also found that household heterogeneity is compounded by inter-individual variation in frequency of sampling by mosquitoes for people in the same house.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The reviewers had divergent opinions on the figures. Two of us found this figure in particular quite confusing. Another wrote &quot;The figures are lovely, creative, and informative, once their code is understood.&quot; It is up to the authors to consider whether greater clarity can be achieved without sacrificing information or readability. Also it would be helpful to describe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> more explicitly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to present temporal variation in exposure in one single panel.

We don't understand how there are 3 different curves since 1/k should give a single curve. This must be because the fold increase depends on more than 1/k, and I just don't follow the figure legend, which should provide the formula.</p></disp-quote><p>The different curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> represent the effect of aggregation (<italic>1/k</italic>) on malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> in areas with mosquito exposure levels (i.e. average number of mosquito bites) similar to those observed in our study (i.e. start [blue], peak [orange] and end [green] of transmission season). These calculations are not intended to reflect seasonal biting variation, but rather to provide estimates of <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> amplification in theoretical settings with vector densities and biting variation similar to those observed at different times in our study area. To clarify this, we have modified the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and the Results section (see below).</p><p>Additionally, when addressing this comment, we found an error in the calculations of the <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> inflations. Essentially, the coefficient of variation was miscalculated as the variance divided by the mean bite rate when it should have been the standard deviation divided by the mean. While the biting variation recorded in the field still inflates <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> considerably, the inflations are attenuated (now resulting in 4 to 8-fold increases in <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> relative to homogenous mixing). We have corrected the sub-section “Effect of exposure heterogeneity on malaria <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>” in the Results section to reflect this change. These do not alter the overall message of the manuscript or the large majority of the presented results. The corrected <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> calculation resulted in changes in the last paragraph of the Results section and one paragraph in the Discussion section, the actual presentation of all entomological data is unaltered and correct.</p><p><italic>“</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

This result should not be presented for the first time in the Discussion. A p value with no mention of effect size or CIs is bad statistical practice. More generally, the list of factors considered as potential risk factors should be presented with univariate association measures provided (point and CI); as it is we don't know what the authors tried and only know that one association was null, but not whether it was convincingly close to null or just underpowered (narrow or wide CI respectively).</italic> </p><p>We previously showed that age influences mosquito exposure in this area (Gonçalves et al. Examining the human infectious reservoir for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in areas of differing transmission intensity. Nature Communications 2017). Here, we also assessed the effect of bed net use on mosquito exposure, although as we mentioned in the Discussion section, the study was not designed for this. We modified the Results section to describe the analysis that includes bed net use. Additionally, to address another comment (see “Optional major revision”), we have now included a statement on the effect of parasite carriage on mosquito biting.</p><p>“Throughout the study, a small number of individuals, mostly adults, were matched to considerably higher numbers of blood meals compared to the rest of the population. […] In an analysis of data from all surveys, negative binomial regression with mixed effects better explained the distribution of mosquito bite counts than mixed effects Poisson models (P &lt; 0.001), after adjustments for age, which influences <italic>Anopheles</italic> exposure in this population (Goncalves et al., 2017), survey and intra-household data correlation.”</p><p>We have also modified the <italic>Discussion section</italic>:</p><p>“… in our study, bed net use and gametocyte carriage were not significantly associated with the number of mosquito bites an individual received though this study was not designed to assess the influence of these factors on mosquito exposure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fifth paragraph of the Discussion is hard to understand – could not identify the main point.</p></disp-quote><p>In this paragraph, we discuss the effect of the heterogeneity described on the distribution of potentially infectious bites from mosquitoes. As with total mosquito counts, most sporozoite-positive mosquito blood meals were matched to a small proportion of participants. An unexpected finding was that infected bites clustered at the household level after adjustment for the number of mosquitoes collected. We believe this observation is important since it might be linked to previously unrecognized epidemiological phenomena. Indeed, possible explanations for this include 1) household-level differences in mosquito survival and average age, where mosquito age is associated with cumulative risk of infection (Lines et al. Human malaria infectiousness measured by age-specific sporozoite rates in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> in Tanzania. Parasitology 1991), and 2) a time-lagged correlation between prevalences of infection in mosquitoes and in humans in corresponding households. Explanation 2 implies limited movement of mosquitoes in some areas, i.e. the distance travelled by mosquitoes between consecutive blood meals is small. This might occur for example in houses located near breeding sites, which allow oviposition after blood feeding and might increase the probability that mosquitoes feed in the same house afterwards. Another mechanism could involve feeding site-fidelity as previously described (McCall et al. Evidence for memorized site-fidelity in <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2001).</p><p>We have improved the clarity of this paragraph. We have removed the statement that contrasted the proportion of the study population linked to potentially infective blood meals and the prevalence of infection in this population, since these two quantities are not directly comparable (we assessed exposure to infected mosquitoes during one week at the end of the transmission season, while infections in humans can last several months [Felger et al. The Dynamics of Natural <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Infections. PLoS ONE 2012]). We also included additional information about the clustering of infected mosquitoes at the household level.</p><p>“We also determined how the frequency of host-vector contacts might influence malaria infection risk in human populations. In our study area, there was considerable variation in household-specific exposure to sporozoite-positive mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). […] This phenomenon could be linked to i) a correlation between prevalence of infection in mosquitoes and in humans in the same households, assuming limited mixing of mosquitoes and humans (e.g. due to the presence of breeding sites near houses, reducing the distances travelled by mosquitoes between consecutive blood meals (Le Menach et al., 2005), or to feeding site-fidelity in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (McCall et al., 2001)), or possibly to ii) factors which affect mosquito survival on a very local scale, since mosquito age is associated with cumulative risk of sporozoite infection (Lines, Wilkes and Lyimo, 1991).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Study area and mosquito collections”. We would like more information. I don't understand what was done. How were households chosen and individuals in them identified? Was sleeping in the household the night of the mosquito collection necessary for inclusion (if not, maybe some heterogeneity is just because someone wasn't there). What is the mosquito trapping protocol (I don't know about mouth aspiration but want more detail anyway about how long, where, what kind of traps etc.)?</p></disp-quote><p>Households with at least one child were eligible for inclusion in the first entomological survey. Residents in study houses were enrolled and asked to provide a finger prick blood sample that was used to match mosquito blood meals to humans. In the second and third surveys, twenty houses from the first survey with no changes in the number of residents (e.g., no births or deaths) were sampled again for bloodfed mosquitoes; priority was given to houses with highest mosquito exposure in the first survey. For the duration of catching in each survey we recorded whether each participant was present in the study house during the nights preceding mosquito collections. We used this information as exposure variable in statistical models of mosquito biting, including in the negative binomial models, and to exclude individuals with limited exposure data from some of the figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We have now modified the Materials and methods section to give more details about mosquito collections:</p><p>“This study was conducted in Balonghin (health district of Saponé, Burkina Faso). […] Bloodfed mosquitoes had their head-thoraces stored for species confirmation and malaria infection assessment by PCR (see below), and their abdomens containing blood meal material squeezed onto filter paper that was stored with desiccant until DNA extraction and further analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The paper's penultimate sentence looms over this effort: &quot;…support the design of interventions that aim to reduce transmission by a targeting a small proportion of the population.&quot; The theoretical literature already admonishes us to do this, but your data help us to grapple with the question – should we be targeting households or individuals? I think the data clearly support the former, and would suggest that your Discussion say so. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and your regression analysis – &quot;there was no evidence of individual level clustering after adjustment for household related variability (p = 0.50)” – all support the conclusion that the challenge to programs is to identify houses that attract the most mosquitoes, and not, thankfully, the most attractive individuals within houses. To gain this understanding, you advocate for &quot;studies that combine mosquito blood meal typing and parasitological and clinical follow up&quot;; in an earlier phrase &quot;factors which affect mosquito survival on a very local scale&quot; are mentioned. What about the distribution and productivity of larval habitats? In a paper about heterogeneity, this is an essential and extremely heterogeneous (spatially and temporally) fact of nature that should be considered if we are to figure out how to target the individuals living in high transmission houses. Even if you don't agree with my interpretation of your data, I think it would be worthwhile to address the 'what do we need to target? – individuals or households?' question more directly if the intent is to inform research of programmatic usefulness.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our results indicate that exposure to infected mosquitoes is highly variable at the household level. In particular, at the start of the transmission season, a period which may determine the malaria burden during the subsequent transmission season, only a few houses had infected mosquitoes collected. As the reviewer suggests, targeting a proportion of households (and not targeting a proportion of individuals within households) could have a significant impact on potential transmission. The issue of the identification of households associated with high exposure to mosquitoes is obviously key. As mentioned by the reviewer, the spatial distribution of larval breeding sites is one likely factor determining spatial heterogeneity in transmission, as it determines both abundance and feeding after oviposition, which has an effect on the scale of transmission (see Le Menach et al. The unexpected importance of mosquito oviposition behaviour for malaria: non-productive larval habitats can be sources for malaria transmission. Malaria Journal 2005 for a detailed discussion). However, as several studies have shown, other factors such as household construction and adherence to existing vector control will also play roles in this and that identification of factors will be ecotype dependent. Whilst we did not find evidence for statistically significant associations between bed net use and vector exposure, it is an intuitively important factor in determining mosquito exposure and one we cannot rule out as determinant. Our response to comment 1 (modifications made in the third and fourth paragraphs of the Discussion) are relevant to this comment. We have also modified the final paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“In summary, although studies have assessed natural exposure to vectors of other infections, such as Aedes (Harrington et al., 2014; Liebman et al., 2014) and Culex (Michael et al., 2001), only limited data are available for <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (Soremekun et al., 2004, Scott et al., 2006). […] A quantitative understanding of the processes leading to heterogeneity in mosquito exposure and its temporal variability would inform at which level such interventions may be in different settings; this would require quantification of the relative contributions of household-level factors, differential attractiveness to mosquitoes and human behavioural factors.”</p><p>Of note, demographic groups are targeted in some settings primarily for morbidity reduction -SMC, IPTp,<sub>I</sub> etc., though some of the data from SMC suggest there may also be a community effect on parasite prevalence in targeting children under 10. In a related analysis, we estimated the contribution of different age groups to transmission after accounting for the age structure of the population, relative infectivity and heterogeneity in exposure. Extending drug delivery to older groups via SMC or through schools represents a logistically attractive complimentary approach to vector control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be helpful to summarize key features of malaria transmission in this area: what is the prevalence of parasitemia or other measures of transmission, and what is the nature and extent of interventions in place?</p></disp-quote><p>Data from a recent epidemiological study showed that the prevalence of falciparum parasites during malaria transmission season was 83.8% by molecular methods, which is similar to the prevalence of 79.2% during the first mosquito collection survey.
