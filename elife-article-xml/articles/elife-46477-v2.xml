Systemic hyper-inflammation is characteristic in people with TB and concurrent DM (TBDM) at baseline, but the impact of TB treatment on this pattern has not been determined. We measured 17 plasma cytokines and growth factors in longitudinal cohorts of Indian and Brazilian pulmonary TB patients with or without DM. Principal component analysis revealed virtually complete separation of TBDM from TB individuals in both cohorts at baseline, with hyper-inflammation in TBDM that continued through treatment completion at six months. By one year after treatment completion, there was substantial convergence of mediator levels between groups within the India cohort. Non-resolving systemic inflammation in TBDM comorbidity could reflect delayed lesion sterilization or non-resolving sterile inflammation. Either mechanism portends unfavorable long-term outcomes including risk for recurrent TB and for damaging immune pathology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46477.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from infection worldwide. The bacteria that causes tuberculosis infect one in every four people on the planet, though most never develop the disease. People with diabetes are more likely to develop tuberculosis and they develop more severe symptoms, which may contribute to further spread of the disease. As diabetes rates are growing worldwide, particularly in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis, it is becoming to increasingly important to understand how these two conditions interact.</p><p>People with diabetes often have more severe inflammation at the time they are diagnosed with tuberculosis than tuberculosis patients without diabetes. Inflammation can cause permanent lung damage in patients with tuberculosis, which can have serious consequences. Learning more about how treatment for tuberculosis affects inflammation in people with diabetes could help improve the outcomes for these patients.</p><p>Now, Kumar, Fukutani et al. show that people with diabetes experience higher levels of inflammation than patients without diabetes throughout the course of treatment for tuberculosis. The analysis compared 17 markers of inflammation in tuberculosis patients with and without diabetes at diagnosis, and at two time periods during the 6-month course of treatment. Kumar, Fukutani et al. also looked at two separate groups of patients, one from India and one from Brazil. Inflammation was measured in the patients in India one year after the completion of treatment. One-year after treatment for tuberculosis in India, inflammation levels were the same in patients with and without diabetes.</p><p>Persistently higher levels of inflammation likely explain why patients with diabetes experience more severe symptoms and suggests they may have more permanent lung damage after tuberculosis. Scientists are currently developing new treatments that can be used with antibiotics to more quickly cure tuberculosis and protect the lungs by reducing inflammation. Patients with diabetes and tuberculosis may benefit from these new treatments or from existing drugs like metformin or statins that may reduce inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004419</institution-id><institution>CRDF Global</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>USB1-31149-XX-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornfeld</surname><given-names>Hardy</given-names></name><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>Vijay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI115940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>Bruno B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukutani</surname><given-names>Kiyoshi F</given-names></name><name><surname>Alves</surname><given-names>Thabata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006181</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silveira-Mattos</surname><given-names>Paulo S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukutani</surname><given-names>Kiyoshi F</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>Bruno B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systemic inflammation is greater in individuals with concurrent TB and diabetes than in euglycemic individuals with TB, and this disparity persists through the full 6-month course of anti-tubercular treatment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is now well established that diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased the risk to become infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), to progress from latent infection to active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) disease, and to suffer adverse TB outcomes including delayed sputum conversion on treatment, treatment failure, death, and recurrent TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Critchley et al., 2017</xref>). The biochemical and cellular mechanisms of increased TB susceptibility in DM are incompletely understood. Emerging evidence ties the complication of diabetic immunopathy to the well-studied diabetic complications of microvascular, macrovascular and renal disease driven by pathways primary driven by chronic hyperglycemia and related oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giacco and Brownlee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez and Kornfeld, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pulmonary TB disease with concurrent DM is associated with a higher burden of immune pathology and systemic inflammation compared to TB in euglycemic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez and Kornfeld, 2014</xref>). Restrepo et al. were the first to describe increased expression of a broad range of cytokines from antigen-stimulated whole blood from patients with concurrent TB and DM as compared to TB alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Restrepo et al., 2008</xref>). This was subsequently verified by several studies reporting higher plasma cytokine levels and higher frequencies of cytokine-expressing T cells assessed by flow cytometry in samples from individuals with TBDM comorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kumar et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumar et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prada-Medina et al., 2017</xref>). Published studies have focused on samples obtained at baseline, before or shortly after the initiation of anti-TB treatment (ATT). We hypothesized that the hyperinflammatory phenotype of TBDM comorbidity is driven by a higher lung bacterial burden and/or by impaired counter regulatory mechanisms that normally limit bystander tissue injury from protective immune responses. To test the prediction that the DM would be associated with delayed resolution of inflammation during TB treatment, we conducted a longitudinal assessment of plasma cytokine and growth factor levels in cohorts of adult pulmonary TB patients with and without DM recruited in India and Brazil.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics of the study populations</title><p>Adults suspected to have pulmonary TB disease were screened for participation in the Effects of Diabetes on Tuberculosis Severity (EDOTS) study on presentation to the government clinic system in Chennai, India.

Compared to the normoglycemic TB group, the TBDM group had higher median age and higher body mass index (BMI). The median and interquartile range of BMI in the normoglycemic TB group fell below the WHO cutoff for undernutrition of 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">WHO Expert Consultation, 2004</xref>). Trends for higher likelihood of self-reported current or past smoking in the normoglycemic TB group did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in the proportion of TB or TBDM participants who reported current or past alcohol consumption. The median HbA1c in TBDM participants was 10.0%, indicating poor glycemic control. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, smoking or alcohol consumption between TBDM participants with DM newly diagnosed during screening for this (NDM) study vs known DM diagnosis prior to incident TB (KDM), but median BMI was higher in the KDM group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). All participants in the non-diabetic TB group were classified as euglycemic based on oral glucose tolerance test but sixteen had HbA1c ≥ 5.8%, placing them in the prediabetic range by American Diabetes Association criteria. There was no difference in median 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between TB and TBDM participants, although the median for both groups fell below a common threshold for insufficiency (20 ng/mL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thacher and Clarke, 2011</xref>).

Our goal for the current study was to investigate longitudinal trends in plasma levels of these mediators over the course of treatment for drug-sensitive pulmonary TB in participants rigorously classified as diabetic or normoglycemic at baseline. Plasma samples from two ongoing observational cohort studies, one in India and one in Brazil, were available for this investigation. Seventeen plasma mediators were measured by a combination of Luminex and conventional ELISA. Results from baseline samples were consistent with the previously reported hyper-inflammatory state of TB with concurrent DM prior to the initiation of ATT. Despite clinically efficacious antimicrobial chemotherapy, we found that the hyperinflammatory profile of TBDM participants persisted in both Indian and Brazil cohorts through the intensive phase of TB treatment at two months and treatment completion at six months. Samples obtained from the India cohort one year after treatment completion showed substantial overlap mediator levels between the TBDM and TB groups, consistent with eventual resolution of TB-related inflammation in the majority of TBDM participants.</p><p>While TBDM was associated with higher levels of many plasma mediators compared to normoglycemic TB participants in the India and Brazil cohorts, lower IL-10 at baseline was the most important parameter accounting for differences between the TBDM and TB groups. IL-10 is a key anti-inflammatory mediator, inhibiting the generation of diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines in myeloid and lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robb et al., 1985</xref>). Even in the absence of concurrent infection, hyperglycemia is associated with a systemic inflammatory state characterized by elevated ratios of diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines to IL-10 in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butkowski and Jelinek, 2017</xref>). Hyporesponsiveness to IL-10 signaling is an additional factor contributing to chronic low-grade inflammation in type 2 DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry et al., 2016</xref>). A causal relationship between low IL-10 at baseline in TBDM and high levels of pro-inflammatory cannot be established with the data available from our cohort study but there was striking switch from relatively lower to higher IL-10 levels in TBDM following the initiation of ATT. While low IL-10 is commonly associated with greater susceptibility to TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Redford et al., 2011</xref>), emerging evidence suggests that poorly controlled inflammation provides a host environment that supports rather than limits <italic>Mtb</italic> replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mishra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the cytokines analyzed for this study, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-b participate in the resolution of infection-related pulmonary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosurgi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schett and Neurath, 2018</xref>). While there was some variation in the levels of specific analytes across the cohorts, an overall trend for declining levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and increasing levels of pro-resolving mediators was observed in the TBDM and TB groups alike. The data suggest that DM comorbidity is associated with hyperinflammation prior to TB treatment, which resolves more slowly than in normoglycemic TB but is not sustained indefinitely. Plasma cytokine elevation in DM is restricted to the setting of active TB disease since Kumar et al. reported that ESAT-6 or CFP10 stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from individuals with DM and latent TB infection have lower intracellular expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines compared to T cells from latently infected normoglycemic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the excessive and prolonged inflammation in TBDM comorbidity is driven by a higher lung bacterial load stimulating innate and adaptive responses and/or a defect in counterregulation intrinsic to the diabetic host that maintains inflammatory foci despite sterilizing antimicrobial treatment. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. In support of the high bacterial burden hypothesis, animal studies of the TBDM interaction consistently show higher plateau levels of <italic>Mtb</italic> colony-forming units in the lung, along with quantitatively more pulmonary immune pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to normoglycemic control animals with TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Podell et al., 2014</xref>). Clinical studies have variously reported higher sputum smear and culture scores and greater radiographic severity in TBDM comorbidity, which constitute crude surrogates for bacterial burden and immune pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jiménez-Corona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moreno-Martínez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, bacterial burden as reflected by sputum smear score was higher in TBDM than TB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In support of an intrinsic propensity for hyperinflammatory responses in TBDM, naïve T cells from chronically hyperglycemic mice were shown to have increased proliferation and production of a broad range of cytokines following antigen-receptor activation; a phenotype attributed to basal chromatin decondensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martinez et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, impaired wound healing is common diabetic complication that is due, in part, to impaired resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltzis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our study had several limitations. While the cohorts providing clinical data and samples were recruited for prospective longitudinal investigation, the projects were not initially designed for cross-cohort comparison and radiographic scores and plasma samples from one year after TB treatment completion were not available for the Brazil cohort. The sample sizes for these two cohorts was sufficient for comparison of plasma analytes but underpowered for logistic regression. Higher median BMI and higher representation of female sex in the Brazil cohort could account at least in part for lower cytokine levels compared to the India cohort, although there was no difference in radiographic severity of disease between the two cohorts overall and more cavitary TB in the Brazil cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Finally, the normoglycemic TB arm of the EDOTS study featured high prevalence of undernutrition that is an independent risk factor for adverse TB outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinha et al., 2019</xref>). This might account for the lack of differences in radiographic severity scores between the TBDM and TB groups in the India cohort.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that individuals with TBDM comorbidity not only have heightened levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines prior to ATT, but they maintain this state through the course of TB treatment. The clinical significance of excessive and prolonged inflammation in TBDM comorbidity stems from that observation that morbidity and mortality in pulmonary TB largely reflects the consequences of immune-mediated lung damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ravimohan et al., 2018</xref>). On that basis, we predict that pulmonary impairment after TB will be greater in patients with concurrent DM. We further speculate that sustained inflammation contributes to increased risk for TB-related mortality that is associated with DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reed et al., 2013</xref>). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in immune-mediated lung matrix destruction in TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ong et al., 2014</xref>). The anti-diabetic drug metformin was reported to exert a host-protective anti-inflammatory effect, including reduced MMP expression in normoglycemic mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> by aerosol, and metformin is associated with reduced risk of cavitary TB and mortality in people with concurrent DM by mechanisms that appear to be independent of any effect on glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Degner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>). We previously reported that TBDM comorbidity is associated with higher plasma MMP levels compared to TB without DM, and that TBDM patients using metformin had significantly lower MMP levels than those on anti-DM treatment regimens without metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that ant-inflammatory host-directed therapies, including metformin, may be particularly beneficial in the large and growing population of TB patients with concurrent DM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Multiplex ELISA, Bio-Plex <break/>Pro Human Cytokine <break/>17-plex Assay</td><td valign="top">Bio-Rad</td><td valign="top">#m5000031yv</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All research presented here was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

For the current investigation, data from 26 TB patients with type-2 DM (HbA1c ≥ 6.5%) from whom cryopreserved plasma samples were available for the immunoassays at month 0 (pre-ATT), month 2 and month 6 of therapy were selected.

Diagnosis of TB at IBIT follows the guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology and Tisiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conde et al., 2009</xref>), which is similar to WHO recommendations. For the present study, TB diagnosis was performed at IBIT’s microbiology referral laboratory as the following: three sputum smears were examined by fluorescence microscopy, processed by the modified Petroff’s method and cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. All patients were ≥18 years old, BCG-vaccinated, HIV-unexposed (confirmed with negative serology), had no prior diagnosis of TB, were diagnosed with DM at the time of study enrollment, and were not taking DM drugs. Exclusion criteria were age &lt;18 years, previous diagnosis/treatment of TB or DM, self-reported pregnancy, and presence of psychiatric disease that might hamper proper application of the clinical questionnaire.

Fisher's exact test was used to compare frequencies between the study groups. Continuous variables were compared between the study groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (2-group comparisons), or the Kruskall-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons ad hoc test (between three or more groups). Hierarchical cluster analyzes were performed using the Ward's method with bootstrap (100X) of z-score normalized values of soluble biomarkers. Dendograms represent Euclidean distance. A principal component analysis model using data on all the soluble biomarkers was performed to compare and visualize the grouping between TBDM and TB. Fold Change Analysis of TBDM patients versus TB patients of log2-transformed and t-test comparisons were performed with the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing set at 1%. Decision trees were employed to identify a minimal set of targets allowing separation between the TBDM from TB. This method analyzes all the phenotypic attributes and selects the most relevant attributes that allow group classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukutani et al., 2017</xref>). As input for tree construction, we used data on all the markers. The J48 algorithm implemented in the WEKA program (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, version 3.6.11, University of Waikato, New Zealand). To estimate the classification accuracy of the decision tree models, we employed a 10-fold cross validation methodology. The sensibility and specificity were measured from the confusion matrix, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and viewed in the scatter plot with the decision tree cutoffs. Correlations were examined using the Spearman test. P value below 0·05 was considered statistically significant after adjustments for multiple comparisons (FDR 1%). The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), JMP 13.0 (SAS, Cary, NC, USA), and R 3.5.1 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) programs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Greater Chennai Corporation, Dr. Senthil Kumar (City Health Officer), and Dr. Lavanya J (RNTCP Program Officer) for permission to conduct the study in the TB Units of Chennai.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Persistent inflammation during anti-tuberculosis treatment with diabetes comorbidity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Wallis (Reviewer #2); Blanca Restrepo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has emerged as a strong risk factor for developing active tuberculosis (TB), with associated predictions of poor outcomes and recovery of respiratory capacity. Kornfeld and colleagues undertake a longitudinal analysis of cytokines production in TB diseased individuals with and without DM in India and Brazil. The authors measure 17 plasma cytokines and growth factors in samples collected prospective from two observational cohorts of TB.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) Prior to the initiation of TB treatment, individuals with DM has significantly higher cytokine levels for most of the pro-inflammatory markers measured in the blood compartment.</p><p>2) This systemic level of hyper-inflammation was sustained over the period of TB treatment.</p><p>3) The observation was noted in two distinct cohorts.</p><p>4) There appears to be a delay in the induction of pro-resolving cytokines (that dampen inflammation) in individuals with DM.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>Individuals with DM and TB have higher levels of system inflammation, at baseline and completion of TB treatment, than those with TB alone. This high level of inflammation most likely contributes to pathogenesis and disease severity, an effect that can be exploited by host directed therapies that modulate inflammation.</p><p>The following needs to be addressed:</p><p>Major comments.</p><p>1) The paper will benefit from additional information to help resolve the question as to whether persistent inflammation was due to persistent infection. This could include baseline indicators of heavy bacterial burden, or evidence of delayed culture conversion during treatment.</p><p>2) State the proportion of patients whose DM had already been diagnosed and treatment initiated prior to the TB diagnosis, and whether outcomes in these patients were different in any way.</p><p>3) The conclusion of longer persistence of inflammation is supported by the findings in the Indian cohort, but weakly corroborated by the Brazilian cohort. While pro-inflammatory cytokines do persist in the Brazilian cohort, there are only a few cytokines up-regulated at a given time point, and there is no consistency for any given cytokine that remains high throughout the treatment. Can the authors provide an explanation?</p><p>4) The different results between both cohorts with respect to TBDM vs TB may be due to &quot;genetic, demographic, and behavioural characteristics&quot; as the authors point out. Please expand on the major demographic differences between the TBDM vs TB group in India, such as older age and higher BMI, which are known to be associated with higher inflammation (independent of diabetes). It is unclear that the authors account for these important differences in their statistical analysis. In contrast, careful matching of TBDM vs TB was done for these factors in the Brazilian cohort. Therefore, these demographic variations between cohorts may explain the clear differences in inflammation in the Indian cohort, but weaker differences in the Brazilian cohort. Clarify the influence of diabetes versus other host factors on the observed inflammation.</p><p>5) The Results section is misleading regarding the method for DM classification at both study sites. It is only in the Materials and methods that the reader realizes that the oral glucose tolerance test was only done in those without DM history in the Indian cohort, but not the Brazilian cohort. The Results section needs to be edited accordingly.</p><p>6) Figure 3B. It would be easier to follow the change in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, if listed in such an order (similar to the order reported for the Indian cohort in Figure 2B).</p><p>7) &quot;[…] switch from relatively higher to relatively lower IL-10 levels in TBDM following the initiation of ATT&quot;. &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; seemed to be the opposite of what was reported.</p><p>8) Discussion. This sentence is unclear: &quot;Further supporting the notion that DM is not invariably associated with hyper-responsiveness to Mtb, Kumar et al. reported that ESAT-6 or CFP10 stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from individuals with DM and latent TB infection have lower intracellular expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines compared to T cells from latently infected normoglycemic individuals (Kumar et al., 2016).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46477.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments.</p><p>1) The paper will benefit from additional information to help resolve the question as to whether persistent inflammation was due to persistent infection.

We performed comparisons, now shown in the Results (Figure 1), demonstrating that sputum smear grades were higher in TBDM patients compared to normoglycemic TB controls. In addition, we compared frequency of individuals remaining culture‐positive at month 2 of anti‐TB treatment but found no difference between TBDM and TB groups in India or in Brazil.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) State the proportion of patients whose DM had already been diagnosed and treatment initiated prior to the TB diagnosis, and whether outcomes in these patients were different in any way.</p></disp-quote><p>All participants in the Brazilian cohort were newly diagnosed with DM at the time of TB screening and none were taking antidiabetic drugs. Of 43 participants in the Indian cohort, 29 were diagnosed with DM prior to incident TB while 14 were newly diagnosed with DM when screened for enrolment in the EDOTS study. Of the 29 known‐DM participants, 23 were taking some form of antidiabetic treatment at the time of enrolment, including 8 taking metformin and the remaining 15 on diabetes treatment regimens that did not contain metformin. TB treatment outcomes were similar between the known‐DM and new‐DM individuals; all competed the 6‐month anti‐TB regimen with bacteriological cure. Two of 29 known‐DM and one of 15 new‐DM participants had recurrent TB within one year after treatment completion. The revised manuscript presents a comparison of new vs known DM participant characteristics (Table 2) as well as a new figure showing that the fold‐change in cytokines of new vs known DM participants was not significantly different (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This additional analysis does not alter our original conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion of longer persistence of inflammation is supported by the findings in the Indian cohort, but weakly corroborated by the Brazilian cohort. While pro-inflammatory cytokines do persist in the Brazilian cohort, there are only a few cytokines up-regulated at a given time point, and there is no consistency for any given cytokine that remains high throughout the treatment. Can the authors provide an explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>While there are overall quantitative differences between cytokine levels in the Indian and Brazilian cohorts, the important finding conveyed in our analysis is that in both cohorts, the TBDM and TB groups were identifiable by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis as discrete populations based on cytokine levels at all time points during TB treatment. Virtually all clinical studies in human populations find high degrees of individual variability in the levels of specific cytokines, which reflect a very broad range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The important point from our data is that systemic inflammation as reflected by plasma cytokine levels is persistently higher in TBDM than in TB patients before and through the course of TB treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The different results between both cohorts with respect to TBDM vs TB may be due to &quot;genetic, demographic, and behavioural characteristics&quot; as the authors point out. Please expand on the major demographic differences between the TBDM vs TB group in India, such as older age and higher BMI, which are known to be associated with higher inflammation (independent of diabetes). It is unclear that the authors account for these important differences in their statistical analysis. In contrast, careful matching of TBDM vs TB was done for these factors in the Brazilian cohort. Therefore, these demographic variations between cohorts may explain the clear differences in inflammation in the Indian cohort, but weaker differences in the Brazilian cohort. Clarify the influence of diabetes versus other host factors on the observed inflammation.</p></disp-quote><p>New tables (Table 4 and Table 5) in the revised manuscript provide additional details in the comparison of the cohorts from India and Brazil. The factors with statistically significant differences that might also be biologically significant in the context of TB are higher mean BMI and a greater proportion of female participants in the Brazilian cohort. While these factors might attenuate the severity of TB disease and contribute to lower cytokine levels in the Brazilian vs Indian cohorts, that would not alter our conclusion that diabetes is associated with a higher level of systemic inflammation that persists through the course of TB treatment. That this finding was made despite differences in the cohorts only strengthens that conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The Results section is misleading regarding the method for DM classification at both study sites. It is only in the Materials and methods that the reader realizes that the oral glucose tolerance test was only done in those without DM history in the Indian cohort, but not the Brazilian cohort. The Results section needs to be edited accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The Results section has been revised to indicate that DM classification in the Brazilian cohort was based on HbA1c only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3B. It would be easier to follow the change in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, if listed in such an order (similar to the order reported for the Indian cohort in Figure 2B).</p></disp-quote><p>The analyses were performed using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, which orders the markers based on concentration profiles in the study groups/timepoints. We understand that the reviewer’s point, but the nature of our analyses precludes changing the order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;[…] switch from relatively higher to relatively lower IL-10 levels in TBDM following the initiation of ATT&quot;. &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; seemed to be the opposite of what was reported.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion. This sentence is unclear: &quot;Further supporting the notion that DM is not invariably associated with hyper-responsiveness to Mtb, Kumar et al. reported that ESAT-6 or CFP10 stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from individuals with DM and latent TB infection have lower intracellular expression of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines compared to T cells from latently infected normoglycemic individuals (Kumar et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to point out that in the absence of active TB disease, individuals with DM do not have increased levels of plasma cytokines. This was included to address the question whether cytokine elevation is an inherent feature DM alone. The text has been revised to try make this point more clearly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
