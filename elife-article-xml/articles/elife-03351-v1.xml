In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the conserved LIC domain, which binds the motor heavy chain, from a thermophilic fungus. We show that the LIC has a Ras-like fold with insertions that distinguish it from Ras and other previously described G proteins. Despite having a G protein fold, the fungal LIC has lost its ability to bind nucleotide, while the human LIC1 binds GDP preferentially over GTP. We show that the LIC G domain binds the dynein heavy chain using a conserved patch of aromatic residues, whereas the less conserved C-terminal domain binds several Rab effectors involved in membrane transport. These studies provide the first structural information and insight into the evolutionary origin of the LIC as well as revealing how this critical subunit connects the dynein motor to cargo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03351.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03351.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03351.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells are constantly bustling with activity. They take in nutrients, carefully split their genetic information between new cells when they divide, and move their internal components into the right positions. To move these cargos around, the cell uses proteins—such as dynein—that essentially walks along the cell's internal scaffolding by making step-like movements. However, how a dynein motor protein is tethered to its cargo is not known in detail.</p><p>One part of the dynein structure thought to play an important role in binding the motor to its cargo is called the light intermediate chain (LIC). Schroeder et al. used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the light intermediate chain of dynein motors from a fungus. This information with other experimental techniques reveals that the LIC subunit has two distinct regions: one that binds to three different proteins that serve as adapters for cargo attachment, and one that binds to the rest of the dynein motor.</p><p>The structure of the LIC includes a fold that is also found in many proteins belonging to a family of enzymes called GTPases, suggesting that the LIC evolved from this family. GTPases use a molecule called GTP to release energy and often act as on–off switches for various processes inside cells. However, the fungal LIC subunit cannot bind to molecules called nucleotides—which can act as energy sources—the way GTPases do. This prevents the LIC subunit from acting as a molecular switch.</p><p>In contrast, the human version of the LIC is able to bind to some nucleotides, in particular one called GDP. However, since the LIC cannot bind to the high-energy nucleotide GTP, the human LICs most likely also do not act as on–off switches: Schroeder et al. instead propose that the LIC may use GDP only to stabilize the protein.</p><p>It remains to be seen how cargo attachment to the LIC is regulated. Further structural work and biochemistry with the LIC bound to the dynein motor and cargo will provide more insight into the mechanism of intracellular cargo transport.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03351.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03351.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>molecular motor</kwd><kwd>G protein</kwd><kwd>intracellular motility</kwd><kwd>Rab effector</kwd><kwd>dynein subunit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM038499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001127</institution-id><institution>Genentech Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hertz</surname><given-names>Nicholas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Courtney M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vale</surname><given-names>Ronald D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AI099243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ostrem</surname><given-names>Jonathan ML</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dynein light intermediate chain is a member of the G protein superfamily and links the motor to several intracellular cargo adaptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular motors transport a variety of cargos, including membranous organelles, proteins, mRNA, and chromosomes, along cytoskeletal tracks throughout the cell. Long distance transport in animal cells occurs primarily along microtubule tracks using kinesins (primarily, plus-end-directed) and cytoplasmic dyneins (minus-end-directed) as motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan, 2011</xref>). The cytoplasmic dyneins are divided into two distinct subclasses. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is employed broadly for many different types of retrograde microtubule transport within animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan, 2011</xref>). Cytoplasmic dynein 2, in contrast, specifically carries out retrograde intraflagellar transport in cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is a large homodimer that consists of a heavy chain (&gt;500 kDa) and several smaller associated subunits, each present in two copies. The dynein heavy chain includes an N-terminal elongated ‘tail’ domain followed by ∼350 kDa motor domain that also contains the microtubule-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). The heavy chain ‘tail’ domain binds the associated subunits, which include the intermediate chain (IC), the light intermediate chain (LIC), and the light chains (LC): Tctex1, LC8, and LC7/roadblock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allan, 2011</xref>). A variety of studies have implicated these associated subunits in cargo binding, either directly, such as with rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tai et al., 1999</xref>), or indirectly by adaptors, such as dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karki and Holzbaur, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schroer, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The LIC subunits, which are present in all cytoplasmic dyneins described thus far but absent from axonemal dyneins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inaba, 2007</xref>), are thought to play important roles in cargo transport. Invertebrates contain a single cytoplasmic dynein 1 LIC isoform while mammals have two LIC genes (LIC1 and LIC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>), which may define two distinct cytoplasmic dynein 1 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tynan et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). Cytoplasmic dynein 2 is associated with a third LIC isoform (LIC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grissom et al., 2002</xref>) that is required for retrograde intraflagellar transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2004</xref>). Knockdown studies have implicated LIC1 and 2 in membrane trafficking toward the endosomal-recycling compartment (ERC) in the cell center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horgan et al., 2010b</xref>), ER export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kong et al., 2013</xref>), lysosomal localization and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), and axonal retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koushika et al., 2004</xref>). During mitosis, LIC1/2 are required for many cytoplasmic dynein 1 functions including centrosome anchoring, dynein localization to the kinetochore, progression through the spindle assembly checkpoint, and chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mische et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sivaram et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</xref>). Several proteins implicated in membrane trafficking have been suggested to interact with LICs, including Rab4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bielli et al., 2001</xref>) and FIP3, a Rab11-family interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horgan et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2010b</xref>). LIC1 and LIC2 appear to have largely redundant roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</xref>), although the centrosome protein pericentrin was reported to only bind to LIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tynan et al., 2000a</xref>) and Par3 binds specifically to LIC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmoranzer et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to mediating cargo binding, the LIC may be important for the stability of the dynein heavy chain; the LIC is the most stably bound subunit to the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">King et al., 2002</xref>) and is necessary for the stable expression and solubility of the recombinant human dynein heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trokter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sequence comparisons show that the LICs are most conserved in the N-terminal half of the protein and that this conserved region contains a P-loop, a canonical nucleotide-binding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perrone et al., 2003</xref>). Based upon the high similarity to the P-loops of the ATP-hydrolyzing ABC transporters, it was suggested that the LIC may be an ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>). However, bioinformatic databases, such as Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finn et al., 2014</xref>), place the LIC in the same family as Ras-like, GTP-binding proteins. Several studies investigated the role of potential nucleotide hydrolysis by mutating a critical lysine residue in the P-loop but did not find a phenotype on cytoplasmic dynein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tynan et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoder and Han, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2004</xref>). However, beyond sequence analysis, little biochemical or structural information exists for the LIC subunits.</p><p>In this study, we report the crystal structure of the conserved N-terminal domain of the LIC from a thermophilic hyphal fungus, <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>, and show that it is composed of a canonical G protein fold. However, unlike most small GTP-binding proteins, the nucleotide pocket is empty, the P-loop exhibits a closed conformation and our biochemical experiments confirm that the fungal LIC G domain does not bind nucleotide. In contrast, we find that the human LIC1 G domain is capable of binding guanine nucleotides, particularly GDP. Our results reveal that the cytoplasmic dynein LIC evolved from the small G protein superfamily and show biochemical differences between fungal and metazoan LICs that may play a role in dynein cargo transport. We further show how the LIC links the dynein motor domain to its multiple cargos.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of a thermophilic yeast LIC domain</title><p>We originally attempted to crystallize full-length human LIC1 but were unable to obtain diffraction-quality crystals.

the difficulty in reproducing the crystals, we were unable to obtain crystals with selenomethionine-labeled protein or heavy metal derivatives in order to obtain experimental phases. To produce the crystals with selenomethionine-labeled protein, we attempted in situ proteolysis during crystallization, as reported in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). After testing a number of proteases, we found that chymotrypsin produced similar proteolysis products to those observed with our original crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we performed in situ proteolysis of selenomethionine-labeled <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC in crystallization drops (molar ratio of 1:1000, chymotrypsin to LIC). Selenomethionine crystals appeared in 3 days and diffracted to 3.6 Å, and the subsequent dataset was phased by Multi-wavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and used to build an initial low-resolution model for the structure. This model was then successfully used in a molecular replacement search to phase the native 2.1 Å data set, previously obtained from our initial unlabeled protein crystals. After multiple rounds of refinement, we obtained a final 2.1 Å structure with an R-work of 17.4 and R-free of 22.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Arg44 and Thr394 were the N-terminal and C-terminal residues that were visible in the electron density map; the molecular weight of the intervening polypeptide chain corresponds approximately to the highest molecular weight band (∼33 kDa) seen from the crystals by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the additional two polypeptide fragments seen by SDS-PAGE of the crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggest that internal cleavage also occurred, most likely in regions where electron density is missing from our structure (74–88, 202–210, and 346–374).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The conserved LIC domain has a Ras-like fold</title><p>While the only sequence analysis in the literature suggested that the LIC might be an ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>), the Pfam sequence database classifies the LICs as belonging to the Ras-like, GTP-binding protein superfamily. The crystal structure of the conserved 33-kDa fragment of the LIC indeed supports this similarity with Ras. The LIC structure revealed a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which in comparison with other protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the Dali server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</xref>), is most similar to the G domain of small GTP-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>). Like Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pai et al., 1990</xref>), the prototype of small G proteins, LIC has six β-strands in the core of the structure (five parallel and one anti-parallel) as well as five similarly placed α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). As a result of this structural similarity, we refer to this region as the LIC G domain. However, the LIC G domain also has conspicuous differences from Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). In addition to the five-α-helices found in Ras, the LIC G domain has two-α-helical insertions (α-helix 3a and 4a) that extend from the core of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Rab28 and Rab33 also have a similar α-helix 4a insertion, and the Dali server identifies these Rabs, followed by Rab32, as the most similar to the LIC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The LIC G domain also has three additional α-helices at the C-terminus (α-helix 6, 7, and 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) that interact with the core G domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and has a short seventh β-strand that extends the β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These results indicate that the LIC is related to the Ras GTPase superfamily.</p><p>Despite structural similarity with G proteins, the LIC sequence has highly diverged from G proteins. Using a structure-based sequence alignment, the sequence similarity is only 12%, 8%, 8%, and 10% between the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC and Rab33, Rab28, Rab32, and H-Ras, respectively; the similar residues are mostly hydrophobic amino acids populating the central β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also performed a phylogenetic analysis of fungal and metazoan LICs within the Ras superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>).

A similar glycine demarks the start of the P-loop at the end of β1.

Unusual for G proteins, the ‘P-loop’ and ‘switch 2’ of the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC G domain interact with one another; the side chain of Q60 in the P-loop hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl of G54 and the side chain of T116 in switch 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To test these ideas, we directly assayed for nucleotide-binding by <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC and human LIC1 G domains purified after <italic>E. coli</italic> expression (see ‘Materials and methods’). When the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC G domain was injected onto a C18 column for reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) with acetonitrile, no 260 nm adsorbing molecule eluted from the column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which is consistent with the lack of nucleotide in the crystal structure. In contrast, when the same experiment was performed with the human LIC1 G domain, a small molecule eluted with a retention time that did not match either GDP or GTP but which had an adsorption spectrum characteristic of a guanine nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Within the margin of variation of different chromatographic runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the retention time of 150 µM ppGpp was similar to that of the guanine nucleotide co-purifying with 150 µM human LIC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To determine if the nucleotides were truly identical, we combined and injected 150 µM ppGpp and 150 µM human LIC1 G domain. Only one peak was detected, which corresponded to the sum of the absorbances of the commercial ppGpp and the nucleotide co-purifying with the human LIC1 G domain injected separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, the nucleotide in the human LIC1 G domain co-purifies precisely with ppGpp in the same chromatographic run. The eluted human LIC1 nucleotide was not successfully identified by mass spectrometry, most likely due to its high negative charge and low quantity following extraction, and thus additional information on its identity could not be obtained by this method. However, with indistinguishable RPLC elution times and a guanine-like absorption spectrum, we believe that ppGpp is the most likely candidate for the LIC-bound nucleotide.</p><p>The nucleotide ppGpp can reach millimolar concentrations under bacterial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>), as can occur during the growth conditions for protein overexpression. However, ppGpp is thought to only exist in bacteria and plants and not human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>). Thus, we do not believe that ppGpp is a natural ligand for the human LIC, but that binding of this ligand reflects an unnatural situation of bacterial expression. Nevertheless, ppGpp binding indicates that the metazoan LIC is indeed competent to bind nucleotide and also raised questions of its nucleotide specificity, especially since we did not detect bound GTP, which is present in millimolar concentrations in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckstein et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that human LIC1 might have a higher affinity for guanosine diphosphates than triphosphates. As was observed in the crystal structure of Arl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), LIC1 might bind only one of the two diphosphates of ppGpp, which can be more abundant than GDP during bacterial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>). To test whether the human LIC1 G domain can indeed also bind GDP, the protein was incubated with 1 mM GDP and 5 mM EDTA (to promote the release of bound ppGpp). After quenching the exchange reaction with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and removing the unbound nucleotide, the protein was subjected to RPLC to analyze the composition of the bound nucleotide. Two peaks were now detected corresponding to the retention times of GDP and ppGpp, indicating that GDP in solution had partially exchanged for the ppGpp bound to the protein after bacterial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In a similar nucleotide exchange experiment, we found that ADP did not bind to human LIC1 indicating that this G domain is indeed guanine-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, when the identical GDP exchange was performed with the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC G domain, the GDP in solution did not bind to the fungal protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, the human LIC1 G domain, but not <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC, is capable of binding GDP and is most likely binding one diphosphate of ppGpp, as found previously with Arl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Note, approximately 2.5 mg/ml of LIC1 was required to detect nucleotide above the noise in the described RPLC method; therefore, it is possible that GDP also may co-purify with bacterially expressed human LIC1, but its abundance is below our detection limit.</p><p>We next examined relative affinity of the LIC G domain for guanosine diphosphates versus triphosphates. We incubated 150 µM human LIC1 G domain with 5 mM EDTA and a 10-fold excess of GMPPNP (5 mM) to GDP (0.5 mM GDP); the non-hydrolyzable GMPPNP was used to prevent any possibility of binding and conversion to GDP by enzymatic hydrolysis. GMPPNP binds to many G proteins and has been widely used as a non-hydrolyzable analogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>). After quenching the exchange reaction with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the protein was analyzed by RPLC. The eluted material contained a mixture of GDP and non-exchanged ppGpp but no GMPPNP was detected despite its 10-fold excess to GDP in the starting reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We also repeated the same exchange reaction with hydrolyzable GTP (again in 10-fold excess to GDP) but did not detect any GTP bound to human LIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, these experiments reveal that the human LIC1 G domain has a higher affinity for guanosine diphosphates than guanosine triphosphates.</p><p>The nucleotide exchange experiments suggested that human LIC1 most likely is bound to GDP and not GTP in its native environment. To test this further, we expressed the human LIC1 G domain in HEK-293T cells, a human cell line. After purifying the protein, any potentially bound nucleotide was released by boiling. LC-MS analysis of the non-proteinaceous supernatant clearly revealed the presence of GDP, but no detectable GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Porcine brain tubulin was used as a positive control to demonstrate that the LC-MS could detect both GDP and GTP. Thus, human LIC1 expressed in human cells co-purifies with GDP alone. Thus, our results collectively suggest that metazoan LIC preferentially binds guanosine nucleotides containing a diphosphate (either GDP or ppGpp) that extends into the binding pocket.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Regions of conservation in the LIC G domain</title><p>We next sought to examine the positions of conserved residues on the surface of the LIC G domain, which might be candidate residues that participate in binding to other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We classified residues as (1) conserved throughout all LICs, (2) LIC1/2-specific, or (3) LIC3-specific (considered conserved if 80% similar in each category) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The fragments tested were an N-terminal fragment of the LIC G domain (a.a. 1–389, which terminates after a predicted helix that may correspond to α8) and a C-terminal fragment (a.a. 389–523). We found that the N-terminal fragment, a.a. 1–389, bound the heavy chain with a comparable efficiency to the full-length human LIC but the C-terminal domain did not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also tested a longer C-terminal fragment starting after α7 (a.a. 355–523) and also saw no binding (data not shown).

The mutant LIC1s were then expressed in HEK-293T cells and tested for heavy chain binding by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Strikingly, the mutations of the universally conserved aromatic residues exhibited dramatically decreased binding to the heavy chain; the double mutant Y101A/Y103A exhibited decreased binding to the dynein heavy chain, and the binding appeared to be almost entirely disrupted in the triple mutant Y101A/Y103A/W120A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The inability of these mutants to incorporate into the dynein holoenzyme complex was also verified by probing for the dynein intermediate chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, the other five double or triple mutations tested bound normally to the dynein heavy chain.

We purified the LIC1 G domain (a.a. 1–389), the C-terminal domain (a.a. 389–523), and the full-length human LIC1 from bacteria to determine the binding site for cargo in vitro. The GST-tagged domains and full-length LIC1 were bound to glutathione beads and incubated with recombinant GFP-tagged FIP3, RILP, or BicD2. Binding was determined by centrifuging the beads and immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody. All three Rab effectors bound to the full-length LIC1 but not to untreated beads. This result also clearly establishes that BicD2 can bind directly to the LIC. Interestingly, FIP3, RILP, and BicD2 each bound the C-terminal domain almost as equally well as to full-length LIC1 but showed no interaction with the G domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). The assay was also conducted with GFP alone, which showed no binding to the full-length LIC1 or its truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We show that the dynein LIC contains a conserved domain with a G protein fold. However, in comparison to Ras, the LIC domain contains two helical insertions in the core structure, a short extra β-strand and additional C-terminal helices that pack against the core, which collectively define a unique G domain topology that sets the LIC apart from previously described G protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>). The fungal LICs further differentiate themselves from other small G proteins by their closed P-loops and inability to bind nucleotide, while the metazoan LICs also show an unusual strong preference for binding GDP over GTP. Interestingly, the C-terminal half of the protein is involved in binding Rab effectors, whereas the G domain is the docking site for the dynein heavy chain. Collectively, these results provide insights into the evolutionary origin of the LIC and how this subunit participates in dynein functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nucleotide's role in LIC function</title><p>The evidence that human LIC1 can bind nucleotide, unlike its fungal homologues, raises the question as to whether or not metazoan LIC acts as a GTPase switch. Most small GTP-binding proteins change their binding affinity for protein partners between GTP and GDP states, and one could envision a similar role for a nucleotide switch in cargo selection and binding by metazoan LICs. However, our data suggest that LICs do not function as GTPase switches. One reason is that the canonical GTPase switch 2 motif (DxxG), which plays a critical role in GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>), appears to be absent from the equivalent loop in metazoan LICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, human LIC1 binds guanosine diphosphate preferentially over guanosine triphosphate; even when GMPPNP or GTP is in 10-fold excess over GDP, little or no GTP binding to the LIC is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This preference for guanosine diphosphates explains why human LIC1 co-purifies with ppGpp from bacteria, even though the GTP concentration is approximately 1.6 mM in <italic>E. coli</italic> during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckstein et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the well-characterized GTPase Ras has a 10-fold higher affinity for GTP than GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">John et al., 1990</xref>). There are examples of G proteins that prefer guanosine diphosphates, such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), which has a &gt;25-fold higher affinity for GDP than GTPγS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss et al., 1989</xref>). ARF can exchange GTP for GDP under particular conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiss et al., 1989</xref>), and it is possible that metazoan LICs can do so as well. However, given the combination of preferential GDP binding and the lack of a canonical switch 2 sequence, we find it unlikely that the LIC is a true GTPase. While metazoan LIC may not switch between a GDP-bound and a GTP-bound state, it is possible that it reversibly exchanges GDP and adopts an apo form. Small GTPases are stable in the apo form only when bound to a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor, or GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cherfils and Chardin, 1999</xref>); by analogy, LIC1 may release GDP upon binding the dynein heavy chain. This idea could be tested in the future by examining the nucleotide state of the LIC when in complex with the dynein heavy chain.</p><p>Another hypothesis for the role of nucleotide binding by metazoan LIC is simply to provide structural stability. In support of a role of nucleotide in structural stability, we have found that human LIC1 is unstable with point mutations that interfere with nucleotide binding (K80A in the P-loop or D248A in the G4 motif; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Surprisingly, overexpression of the P-loop K80A mutation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> rescued the null LIC1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoder and Han, 2001</xref>), but endogenous expression levels may reveal a phenotype associated with instability of the mutant protein. The fungal LICs appear to have evolved another strategy for achieving protein stability in the absence of bound nucleotide. Two residues, Gln60 and Thr116, in the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC appear to play an important role in stabilizing a nucleotide-free state and preventing nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Gln60 replaces the P-loop lysine, which is critical for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, and Thr116 replaces the aspartate found in switch 2 (DxxG), which contacts the nucleotide-bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion via a water molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011</xref>).</p><p>‘Pseudo-ATPase’ is a recently coined term for proteins with a structure typical of ATPases but which does not catalyze ATP hydrolysis and uses nucleotide for protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrain and Freeman, 2012</xref>). For example, the kinetochore nucleotide-binding protein BUBR1 does not hydrolyze ATP in carrying out its function in the mitotic checkpoint complex but rather requires ATP for its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that metazoan LIC may be a ‘pseudo-GTPase’, where nucleotide is used for stability rather than in a cycle of conformational change. Another protein that also has a common G-protein fold with no nucleotide-binding or hydrolysis capability is CheY, a bacterial chemotactic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artymiuk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1990</xref>). A recent study also identified the kinetochore protein, CENP-M, as a ‘pseudo-GTPase’, since it contains a G protein fold but does not contain bound nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three identified ‘pseudo-GTPases’, LIC, CENP-M, and CheY, are all most similar to the Rab and Ras subfamilies of the G protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interactions of the LIC with the dynein motor and cargos</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the G domain alone binds the heavy chain and identified a groove of highly conserved, aromatic residues that are involved in this interaction. However, since this hydrophobic patch is conserved among all LICs, other residues must determine the targeting of LIC1/2 to cytoplasmic dynein 1 and LIC3 to cytoplasmic dynein 2. Our structure, combined with sequence analysis, provides some clues on residues that might be involved in the selective recognition of a particular dynein heavy chain. For example, the LIC3s have several class-conserved and mostly hydrophobic residues (conserved among LIC3s but not LIC1/2) that surround the hydrophobic groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). LIC1/2 exhibits fewer class-conserved residues on the face of the G domain with the hydrophobic groove, although a few such residues exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Future structure–function binding studies with cytoplasmic dynein 1 and 2 and LIC1 and LIC3 will be needed to fully understand the nature of this selective interaction.</p><p>Our studies show that the LIC's C-terminal domain is involved in binding three different cargo adapter proteins, FIP3, RILP, and BicD2, and thus appears to contain multiple recognition sites for distinct adapter proteins. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain is predicted to be disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The LIC domain structure has interesting parallels with the dynein intermediate chain, which has a well-ordered WD repeat domain that interacts with the heavy chain and a less conserved disordered region that binds the dynein light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nyarko et al., 2004</xref>) and cargo-adaptors like dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vaughan and Vallee, 1995</xref>). A number of disordered proteins become ordered upon binding other proteins. It will be interesting to determine what structure the C-terminal tail of the LIC adopts before and after binding to Rab effectors. While this study points to the C-terminal tail of LIC as a cargo binding site, it is possible that adapter proteins may be discovered in the future that bind to the G domain, perhaps via LIC1/2 specific residues.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest a working model in which the LIC domains are specialized for distinct functions. The G domain is docked onto the dynein heavy chain, while the C-terminal domain binds many of the LIC's protein partners, specifically Rab effectors involved in membrane transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Recent studies have shown that these Rab effectors, in addition to linking dynein to membrane cargos, link dynein to dynactin to create an ultraprocessive motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the LIC may have a critical role in the mechanism of generating an ultraprocessive dynein–dynactin complex. While the LIC may simply serve as a docking site for Rab effectors, it is also possible that the LIC N- and C-terminal domains communicate allosterically in some way with other dynein chains and dynactin to affect their activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification and crystallization</title><p>The homologous dynein LIC in <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> (EGS22626.1) was PCR-amplified from <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> cDNA, generously given by Peter Walter's lab at UCSF.

We believe that your data showing that LIC is a bipartite protein containing an N-terminal G-domain that mediates the interaction with Dynein, and a C-terminal region linking Dynein to Rab effectors is an important step forward in the field.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There were two major points that were brought up.</p><p>1) First there is the issue of to what extent the fold can simply be identified by bioinformatics, and the fact that the paper seems to gloss over this point. Many proteins, including proteins in bacteria (e.g. CheY), share the fold of Ras-type GTPases but do not bind or hydrolyze GTP and do not bear sufficient sequence identify with GTPase to allow discerning evolutionary relatedness. But the concept is per se not novel. What is missing in this manuscript is a more detailed analysis of the position of the LIC GTPase in the Ras superfamily. It is important to show a structure-based alignment of the LIC sequence with Ras and other selected members of the Ras family. What level of sequence identity is present? Is it possible to hypothesize, based on sequence identity/similarity, from which branch of the Ras superfamily has the LIC domain originated? Similarity of the DLIC sequence with small Ras-family GTPases can be quite easily evinced from browsing the NCBI web site, where family pfam05783 (LIC) is clearly indicated as a member of the superfamily cl17170 (Ras superfamily). This relationship can be easily identified by BLASTing segments of the sequence of LIC. This does not diminish the importance of the work, but we feel that you should give a fair representation of the state of the art and acknowledge that the relationship has been simply overlooked until now, and is not being revealed here for the first time though.</p><p>2) Secondly, we had a concern about whether the LIC G domain picks up in bacteria is not ppGpp. Whatever it is that the protein binds to, it elutes closely but not exactly where the ppGpp standard elutes, whereas if you look at other nucleotides the overlap is perfect. For instance we compared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D and 4F</xref>. 4D is particularly revealing because it shows that if you mix ppGpp to the LIC G domain it elutes exactly with the standard, whereas the nucleotide bound to the LIC1 G domain purified from bacteria elutes a bit earlier. Same in panel F, it is a reproducible difference. So in essence we don't think that the authors can conclude from this figure that ppGpp is the better binder, because there is no direct comparison. We are worried that for your current model to hold up, you need to prove that ppGpp is indeed a better binder than GDP. However this depends to a certain extend on whether ppGpp is present in human cells or specific to bacteria. You could also express it using baculoviral expression (or better yet human cells) and confirm whether or not GDP nucleotide is bound.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03351.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) First there is the issue of to what extent the fold can simply be identified by bioinformatics, and the fact that the paper seems to gloss over this point.

Thus, we have now acknowledged the Pfam database’s classification of the LIC in both the Introduction and the Results section. Furthermore, we have pointed out in the Discussion that CheY and CENP-M (recently published in <italic>eLife</italic>) also have Ras-like folds without nucleotide binding capabilities, thus revealing the presence of other “pseudo-GTPases”.</p><p>The referees also requested a more detailed analysis of the LIC’s position in the Ras superfamily. We used the Dali server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</xref>) to compare the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> LIC structure to all other structures in the PDB. The structure of the LIC was found to be most similar to certain Rab proteins, specifically Rab33, Rab32 and Rab28. Despite the structural similarity, the sequence identity is quite low (approximately 10%). The structural and sequence alignments with the top three Dali server hits are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> and are described in the Results section.</p><p>To determine the LIC’s placement in the Ras superfamily, we have conducted a similar phylogenetic analysis to that described in the recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper “The pseudo GTPase CENP-M drives human kinetochore assembly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). We first performed a structure-based alignment of fungal and metazoan LICs to 167 Ras superfamily representatives used in a bioinformatics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). We also included the sequences of pseudo-GTPases CheY and CENP-M from a number of species in the alignment. This alignment was used to generate a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with 300 bootstraps to determine clade probability. The tree shows that the LICs may share common ancestry with the Ras and Rab subfamilies, as was found with CENP-M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basilico et al., 2014</xref>). We have displayed the phylogenetic tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, and it is described in the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) Secondly, we had a concern about whether the LIC G domain picks up in bacteria is not ppGpp. Whatever it is that the protein binds to, it elutes closely but not exactly where the ppGpp standard elutes, whereas if you look at other nucleotides the overlap is perfect. For instance we compared</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figures 4D and 4F</italic></xref><italic>. 4D is particularly revealing because it shows that if you mix ppGpp to the LIC G domain it elutes exactly with the standard, whereas the nucleotide bound to the LIC1 G domain purified from bacteria elutes a bit earlier. Same in panel F, it is a reproducible difference. So in essence we don't think that the authors can conclude from this figure that ppGpp is the better binder, because there is no direct comparison. We are worried that for your current model to hold up, you need to prove that ppGpp is indeed a better binder than GDP. However this depends to a certain extend on whether ppGpp is present in human cells or specific to bacteria. You could also express it using baculoviral expression (or better yet human cells) and confirm whether or not GDP nucleotide is bound</italic>.</p><p>The major comment here was ascertaining whether GDP is indeed the nucleotide bound to human LIC when this protein is expressed in human cells (since we used human LIC, we agreed that human cells would be the ideal choice for this experiment). We should add that ppGpp is thought to be specific to bacteria and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>) and not human cells. In this revision, we expressed the human LIC1 G domain in human HEK-293T cells; the purified G domain was denatured by boiling, and the supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS. The mass spec clearly detected GDP with little or no GTP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, GDP is indeed the primary nucleotide bound to human LIC1 in its native environment.</p><p>This comment also states that our model claims that ppGpp is a “better binder” than GDP. However, we do not claim that ppGpp is a better binder than GDP (our model states that LIC binds GDP preferentially over GTP, which is supported by the data in the paper). We believe that ppGpp most likely binds with equal affinity as GDP. In the crystal structure of Arl5 with bound ppGp (a remnant of ppGpp), only the one diphosphate is bound in the active site, while the other phosphate is solvent exposed and not making contact with the protein (see structure below; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>)). We speculate that the same situation applies to LIC1, where one of the diphosphates of ppGpp is bound to LIC1 (like GDP), while the other diphosphate extends into the solvent. We have now clarified these points.</p><p><italic>Crystal structure of Arl5</italic>-<italic>GDP3'P</italic></p><p>GDP3'P, a likely remnant of ppGpp, makes contacts with residues of Arl5 with only one diphosphate, analogous to GDP (PDB: 1ZJ6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-03351-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>So why does human LIC1 co-purify with ppGpp when expressed in bacteria but GDP when expressed in human cells? When bacteria are stressed with high protein expression, ppGpp can reach millimolar quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>), indeed much higher than the approximate 200 µM GDP in exponential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckstein et al., 2008</xref>). As described earlier, ppGpp is an alarmone that is unique to bacteria and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>) and not found in animal cells. Thus, we would like to emphasize that the co-purification of ppGpp with human LIC1 is simply an artifact of its purification from bacteria. It is also important to note that approximately 2.5 mg/mL of protein at a minimum is required to detect nucleotide above the noise in the RPLC method described, and thus GDP may also co-purify with bacterially expressed human LIC1, though in quantities below our detection limit. Nonetheless, the finding of ppGpp gave us the important clue that human LIC1 binds guanosine diphosphates preferentially over guanosine triphosphates, which we demonstrate with purified protein in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. We thank the referees for expressing their concerns, and we have made these points clearer.</p><p>The referees also raised the point that ppGpp might not be the nucleotide co-eluting with bacterially expressed human LIC1 due to the slight mismatch of the retention time with commercial ppGpp. The referees raise a valid point that the retention times of the LIC1 nucleotide shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref> are not exactly the same as commercial ppGpp, whereas the commercial GDP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> appears exactly the same between two HPLC runs. However the retention times of nucleotides do vary among HPLC runs, as was also noted in an earlier study using the same assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this revised manuscript, we quantified the retention time of all standards and the LIC nucleotide for more than 3 runs and display the standard deviation as error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1 C</xref>. The retention time of LIC1’s nucleotide has a higher standard deviation (±0.355 min) than the commercial ppGpp (±0.138 min), yet this variability is less than seen with even GMP, GDP and GTP (±0.893, 0.494, and 0.643 min, respectively). Furthermore, the difference in retention times seen for the LIC nucleotide and ppGpp is not significantly different (p = ∼0.2). Furthermore, the retention time of the LIC nucleotide shows that it is more electronegative than GTP, making ppGpp a good candidate. Of course, mass spectrometry would be more definitive, but ppGpp is technically very difficult to identify by mass spectrometry. In the revised manuscript, we now state, “…with indistinguishable RPLC elution times and a guanine-like absorption spectrum, we believe that ppGpp is the most likely candidate for the LIC-bound nucleotide.” Furthermore, since we now show that GDP binds the LIC when expressed in human cells, it also becomes less essential to have complete certainty of the bacterially expressed nucleotide. The overall data (from bacterial expression, human cell expression and exchange studies with purified nucleotide) collectively suggest that the LIC has a preference for binding a diphosphate rather than triphosphate guanine nucleotides.</p></body></sub-article></article>
