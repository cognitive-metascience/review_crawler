Antibody-dependent functions may include neutralization of parasite–host interactions, complement activation, and activation of Fc receptor functions. A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in protection from malaria has not been established. Here we show that IgG isolated from adults living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent growth inhibition. RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture with uninfected RBCs. Human antibodies to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition. As these results implicate acquired immunity through NK-mediated ADCC, antibody-based vaccines that target bloodstream parasites should consider this new mechanism of action.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36806.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. The parasite infects red blood cells, causing fever with flu-like symptoms. In some people, particularly pregnant women and children, the disease may be very serious and even lead to death. An effective malaria vaccine is urgently needed because malaria parasites are developing resistance to current drugs.</p><p>People living in areas where malaria is common develop specific proteins called antibodies that protect them from malaria. Learning more about how the antibodies achieve this, could help to develop better vaccines. Scientists already know some antibodies bind to the malaria parasites and prevent them from entering red blood cells. Some vaccines have been based on these antibodies. Other antibodies bind to infected cells flagging them for destruction by cells of the immune system. Immune cells called natural killer cells can eliminate viruses or cancer cells this way, but it was not clear if they could also eliminate malaria parasite-infected red blood cells.</p><p>Now, Arora et al. show that natural killer cells can selectively destroy malaria-infected red blood cells flagged with antibodies from people who live in areas where malaria is common. In laboratory experiments, natural killer cells from US volunteers, who were never exposed to malaria, did not kill normal or malaria-infected red blood cells. Adding antibodies collected from malaria-resistant volunteers from Africa allowed these natural killer cells from unexposed people to selectively seek out and destroy malaria-infected cells and leave uninfected red blood cells intact.</p><p>Arora et al. also found that the antibodies from the malaria-resistant volunteers bound to parasite proteins on the surface of infected blood cells. The experiments suggest that vaccines designed to stimulate the production of antibodies to malaria proteins that are displayed on infected red blood cells, could destroy the parasite in infected people and help prevent disease and save lives.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>P.falciparum</kwd><kwd>ADCC</kwd><kwd>NK</kwd><kwd>RBC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 AI000525-30 LIG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Eric O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Red blood cells infected by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are destroyed by human natural killer cells in the presence of antibodies from people who have acquired clinical immunity to malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum.)</italic>, the causative agent of malaria, expresses proteins that are displayed at the surface of infected red blood cells (RBCs). Some of these proteins promote sequestration of <italic>P.f.-</italic>infected RBCs (iRBCs) through adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Humans living in malaria-endemic areas generate, over years of repeated infections, antibodies (Abs) to <italic>P.f</italic>. proteins that contribute to the gradual protection from malaria symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bull and Marsh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mayor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). One of the main objectives in malaria research is to define the mechanisms by which naturally acquired Abs provide protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crompton et al., 2014</xref>). Acquired immunity to malaria is complex as it requires a balance of parasite growth inhibition and control of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Neutralizing Abs that prevent <italic>P.f</italic>. merozoite invasion of RBCs have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Douglas et al., 2011</xref>). However, as merozoites released from late-stage iRBCs rapidly invade uninfected RBCs (uRBCs), high antibody titers are likely needed for inhibition. Abs bound to iRBCs promote phagocytosis by myeloid cells, and Abs bound to merozoites activate the complement pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouharoun-Tayoun et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rowe et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells constitute about 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. They kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells through engagement of an array of germ-line encoded co-activation receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryceson et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerwenka and Lanier, 2001</xref>). In addition to their innate ability to eliminate transformed and infected cells, NK cells perform Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) through the low-affinity IgG receptor FcγRIIIa (also known as CD16), thereby killing IgG-coated target cells and secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. A clear role of NK cells in contributing to protection from malaria, and whether iRBCs could be eliminated through ADCC by NK cells, has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). Earlier studies have described direct lysis of iRBCs by NK cells in the absence of Abs or Ab-dependent inhibition of <italic>P.f.</italic> growth by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mavoungou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Orago and Facer, 1991</xref>). However, other studies have not confirmed such results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we present a detailed study of the activity of primary, unstimulated human NK cells mixed with RBCs, infected or not by <italic>P.f</italic>., and evaluate the NK cell responses using several different quantitative assays. We found that IgG in plasma from subjects living in a malaria-endemic region in Mali bound to iRBCs and induced their rapid lysis through NK-mediated ADCC. Naturally acquired IgG specific for the major <italic>P.f.</italic> antigen PfEMP1 was sufficient to promote NK-dependent inhibition of <italic>P.f</italic>. growth in RBCs. Our results demonstrated that primary human NK cells alone are capable of controlling parasite growth in vitro in response to IgG from subjects exposed to malaria. This may represent an important component of Ab-dependent clinical immunity to <italic>P.f</italic>. blood-stage infection that could be exploited in the development of malaria vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary human NK cells are activated by <italic>P.f.</italic>-infected RBCs in presence of plasma from malaria-exposed individuals</title><p>RBCs infected with <italic>P.f.</italic> strain 3D7 were enriched for the presence of knobs at the RBC surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Notably, potent NK cell degranulation occurred with iRBCs in the presence of Mali plasma, whereas US serum induced degranulation in a very small fraction of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). NK cell expression of intracellular interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was also stimulated equally well by rabbit anti-RBC serum and Mali plasma, whereas US serum did not induce cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Following merozoite invasion of RBCs, <italic>P.f.</italic> proteins begin to appear at the RBC surface after 16–20 hr and remain exposed until infectious merozoites are released. Once released, merozoites rapidly invade fresh RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyle et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that high Ab titers are needed to neutralize merozoites and block entry into RBCs. In contrast, RBCs harboring non-infectious <italic>P.f.</italic>, as it progresses through trophozoite and schizont stages, display <italic>P.f.</italic> antigens at their surface for more than 24 hr, and ADCC responses activated by FcγRIIIa in primary human NK cells are rapid, strong and independent of coactivation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryceson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Evidence of NK cell activation and RBC lysis was obtained with three different assays: (1) NK cell degranulation and cytokine production by flow cytometry, (2) loss of intact <italic>P.f.</italic>-iRBCs by live imaging, and (3) RBC lysis by measurement of Hb release. NK cell degranulation in a co-culture with <italic>P.f.</italic>-iRBCs, selectively induced by Abs from malaria-exposed individuals, was just as strong as that obtained with rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against human RBCs. Furthermore, using Hb-release assays and rabbit anti-RBC serum, it was possible to show that iRBCs are not inherently more resistant or sensitive than uRBCs to NK-mediated lysis. Live imaging of a coculture of NK cells, uRBCs and <italic>P.f.</italic>-iRBCs, in the presence of plasma from malaria-exposed individuals, revealed selective lysis of iRBCs, with no 'bystander' lysis of uRBCs.</p><p>Natural cytotoxicity of NK cells towards <italic>P.f</italic>.-iRBCs was not detected in our assays with resting NK cells. A recent study in humanized mice reconstituted with human lymphocytes and injected with <italic>P.f</italic>.-infected human RBCs, reported some lysis of <italic>P.f</italic>.-iRBCs by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that under specific stimulatory conditions, including soluble factors and contact with other cells, human NK cells exhibit natural cytotoxic responses towards <italic>P.f</italic>.-iRBCs. However, considering that clinical immunity to malaria depends in large part on Abs, and that development of an effective vaccine is a high priority, we chose to focus on ADCC by NK cells. Signaling in NK cells by FcγRIIIa alone, independently of other co-activation signals and of integrin-dependent adhesion, is sufficient to induce strong responses, unlike other NK activation receptors, which require synergy through combinations of co-activation receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryceson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2006b</xref>). The Ab-mediated activation of NK cell cytotoxicity described here is adding a strong effector mechanism to the other mechanisms by which Abs may confer protection against malaria, including neutralizing Abs and Abs that activate the complement pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that NK cell-mediated ADCC inhibits the growth of <italic>P.f.</italic> in RBC cultures in the presence of Abs to <italic>P.f.</italic> antigens expressed at the surface of iRBCs in a standard growth inhibition assay (GIA) by co-incubation of iRBCs and NK cells with a large excess of uRBCs. To distinguish inhibition by NK cells from other Ab-dependent functions, such as merozoite neutralization and activation of complement, we developed a two-step GIA to evaluate inhibition that had occurred prior to iRBC rupture and reinvasion of fresh RBCs. As inhibition of <italic>P.f.</italic> growth occurred in the presence of purified IgG from plasma of malaria-exposed individuals, other serum components were not required for NK-mediated inhibition. The modified GIA for ADCC could help define <italic>P.f.</italic> antigens that induce Abs of sufficient titer and quality for FcR activation (e.g. IgG isotype, glycosylation). The GIA-ADCC is well-suited to large screens of plasma from subjects in malaria vaccine trials or in studies of naturally acquired immunity to malaria.</p><p>Previous work has shown that IL-2 produced by T cells following malaria infection or injection of a malaria vaccine activates IFN-γ production by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, <italic>P.f</italic>. infection activates IL-18 secretion by macrophages. Through IL-18 and direct contact with macrophages NK cells are activated to produce IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baratin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the effector functions of NK cells we describe here are independent of external signals, since unstimulated primary NK cells respond directly to activation by multivalent IgG Fc binding to FcγRIIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryceson et al., 2005</xref>). Experiments performed here used NK cells freshly isolated from human blood, without stimulation prior to incubation with RBCs and Abs. In summary, we have shown that human NK cells have the potential to control <italic>P.f.</italic> parasitemia through IgG-dependent activation of NK cellular cytotoxicity, and thus contribute to protection from blood-stage malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifier</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Human IgG (H + L) Alexa <break/>Fluor 488</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>A-11013</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti Rabbit Ig, FITC</td><td>Southern Biotech, AL</td><td>4010–02</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human CD56 PE Cy5.5</td><td>Beckman Coulter, CA</td><td>Clone N901,</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human CD235a FITC</td><td>Biolegend, CA</td><td>Clone H1264</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human CD45 PE</td><td>Biolegend, San Diego, CA</td><td>Clone H130</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human IFN-γ−APC</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>Clone B27</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human TNF-α−PE</td><td>BD Bioscience</td><td>Clone 6401.1111,</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti human CD107a-PE</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>Clone H4A3,</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-human <break/>red blood cell antibody</td><td>Rockland Immunochemicals <break/>Inc.

PBMCs were first isolated using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), washed with PBS twice, and resuspended in PBS, with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA. NK cells were isolated from PBMCs by depletion of non-NK cells using an NK cell isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Cambridge, MA). The manufacturer’s protocol was modified as follows. PBMCs were resuspended at 2 × 10<sup>8</sup>, per ml and 2.5 μl/ml of anti-CD3 biotin (STEMCELL Technologies) was added to the 50 μl/ml of the non-NK cocktail to increase NK cell purity. Resting NK cells were resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% human serum (Valley Biomedical, Winchester, VA), and were used within 1 to 4 days after isolation.

Similarly, uRBCs were stained with eFluor 450 dye at 2.5 μM concentration for 5 min in PBS at 37°C. NK cells were washed, suspended in diluent C and stained with 1 μM PKH67 membrane dye (PKH67 green fluorescent green linker kit, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times with media containing serum (e.g., RPMI with 10% FBS). For imaging, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% Albumax-II in the absence of Phenol Red. Cells were added in 8-well Lab-Tek I Chambered cover glass (Nunc) and allowed to settle for 15 min. Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope while maintaining incubation condition at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in a humidified chamber. Images were acquired at 30 s interval for 6 hr. Time-lapse image stacks were imported into the Imaris software. A threshold algorithm eliminated background noise from each channel, and a Gaussian filter was applied to smooth the texture, and to easily segment the regions of interest (ROIs). After filtering, a surface channel was created from each color channel for each cell population, with surface threshold based on intensity. The surface generator was set to run a watershed algorithm. The seed-points diameter was set to 4.5 μm for iRBCs and uRBCs, and 6.0 μm for NK cells. In order to weed out unwanted particles that passed the intensity threshold, a surface ROI was considered to be one with voxel size greater than 110 voxels.

There is no evidence for spontaneous cytotoxicity of NK cells against infected RBCs in the absence of antibodies, and the effect requires use of serum from patients in a malaria-endemic area. The studies are well done and convincing.

There is no evidence for spontaneous cytotoxicity of NK cells against infected RBCs in absence of antibodies, and the effect requires use of serum from patients in a malaria-endemic area. The studies are well done and convincing. The primary issue is that it is difficult to know how important this mechanism is in actual control of malaria infection in vivo but that would require in vivo human studies that are not feasible. On the other hand, this appears to be an important conceptual advance to guide the development of effective malaria vaccines.</p><p>It would be of interest to know if the KIR phenotype of the human NK cells is related to response to infected RBCs, and to the corresponding HLA alleles of the NK cells. But this is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Long and colleagues investigate whether NK cells can recognize and target <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected RBCs by ADCC. They use a complementary assay, including a newly developed GIA-ADCC assay, to interrogate the ability of NK cells to kill infected cells. Their data clearly demonstrates that NK cells can mediate ADCC by naturally occurring serum and IgG from infected patients. They demonstrate that this can be mediated by naturally-occurring antibodies to PfEMP1 and VAR2CSA, as well as with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the RIFIN antigen. The authors conclude that NK-mediated recognition of infected RBCs and inhibition of parasite growth is an important anti-malarial mechanism to investigate when considering vaccine strategies.</p><p>Overall, experiments are well-controlled, and the hypotheses and results are clear and well-written. There has been some conflicting information in the field with regards to the potential for NK cells to recognize infected RBCs, and these studies using freshly isolated NK cells and serum from infected patients should clarify this.</p><p>There was a recent publication describing RIFIN proteins binding to inhibitor receptors as a mechanism of immunoevasion (Saito et al., 2017).

There is no evidence for spontaneous cytotoxicity of NK cells against infected RBCs in absence of antibodies, and the effect requires use of serum from patients in a malaria-endemic area. The studies are well done and convincing. The primary issue is that it is difficult to know how important this mechanism is in actual control of malaria infection</italic> in vivo <italic>but that would require</italic> in vivo <italic>human studies that are not feasible. On the other hand, this appears to be an important conceptual advance to guide the development of effective malaria vaccines.</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be of interest to know if the KIR phenotype of the human NK cells is related to response to infected RBCs, and to the corresponding HLA alleles of the NK cells. But this is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be interesting to examine the impact of HLA and KIR genes on susceptibility to malaria. One question is whether NK cell licensing through inhibitory KIR makes for stronger ADCC responses to infected RBC. It could be tested by multi-color flow analysis of NK cell phenotypes and ADCC function, preferably with samples from malaria-exposed individuals. One difficulty here is the extensive polymorphism of KIR genes, which is particularly high in Africa. Standard antibodies to specific members of the KIR family coul miss some of the polymorphic alleles. Nevertheless, such a study is feasible. A phenotypic and functional analysis of NK cells with samples from Africa would have to be done with priority given to KIR and NKG2A phenotypes, as this alone would require a fairly large number of antibodies. We have not performed such a study yet. As mentioned by the reviewer, it would be outside the scope of this paper.</p><p>Another question is whether specific combinations of KIR and HLA haplotypes are associated with resistance to malaria. It should be studied with large cohorts of individuals for which good clinical data and genetic analysis of their HLA and KIR genes are available. This specific question, which is not related to the main topic of our manuscript, has not been addressed on a large scale yet.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Long and colleagues investigate whether NK cells can recognize and target Plasmodium falciparum infected RBCs by ADCC. They use a complementary assay, including a newly developed GIA-ADCC assay, to interrogate the ability of NK cells to kill infected cells. Their data clearly demonstrates that NK cells can mediate ADCC by naturally occurring serum and IgG from infected patients. They demonstrate that this can be mediated by naturally-occurring antibodies to PfEMP1 and VAR2CSA, as well as with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the RIFIN antigen. The authors conclude that NK-mediated recognition of infected RBCs and inhibition of parasite growth is an important anti-malarial mechanism to investigate when considering vaccine strategies.</p><p>Overall, experiments are well-controlled, and the hypotheses and results are clear and well-written. There has been some conflicting information in the field with regards to the potential for NK cells to recognize infected RBCs, and these studies using freshly isolated NK cells and serum from infected patients should clarify this.</p><p>There was a recent publication describing RIFIN proteins binding to inhibitor receptors as a mechanism of immunoevasion (Saito et al., 2017). The authors use a monoclonal ab against RFIN and a control with a mutation in the Fc domain to demonstrate specificity for ADCC. While the controlled study here demonstrates that the NK cytotoxic effect is most likely due to impaired activation, rather than blocking an inhibitory receptor ligand, a discussion and reference of this recent manuscript seems appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now mentioned this interesting paper and the potential of NK cell inhibition by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> RIFIN proteins. However, RIFIN does not bind the wild-type LAIR-1 that is expressed on NK cells. Furthermore, we did observe hemoglobin release after mixing NK cells with <italic>P.f</italic>.-infected RBCs that had been selected for high expression of RIFIN, in the presence of a human monoclonal Ab to RIFIN. We can be certain that NK activation was not due to the masking of RIFIN by the mAb (and release from inhibition) but to activation of ADCC by the human IgG1 mAb because the same antibody lacking FcR binding did not activate NK cells. This is now discussed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript Arora et al., report that human NK cells can efficiently lyse red blood cells infected by Plasmodium falciparum via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</p><p>Overall, the authors present a set of well-designed experiments that are easy to interpret, the data support their conclusions and form a cohesive story on a subject matter that is of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>I have a few comments that I think will help to further strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>- The authors use US serum, but Mali plasma: I think it would be useful to explain in the discussion why serum was used for the US control group and whether this difference could at all affect the experimental outcome (increase or decrease ADCC)</p></disp-quote><p>In the Mali cohort, blood samples are anticoagulated to allow for the isolation of both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma. Serum pooled from multiple U.S. donors was obtained from Valley Biomedical and used as control. The main advantage of using a pooled serum lot is that it provides continuity in our experiments and does not introduce the variability inherent to individual human donors. To directly address the point raised by the reviewer, we purified IgG Abs from Mali plasma and U.S. serum. These purified IgG gave results similar to those obtained with plasma and serum, respectively. Specifically, IgG from U.S. controls did not bind to infected RBCs and did not activate NK cells, whereas IgG from Malian individuals bound to infected RBCs and inhibited parasite growth in a growth inhibition assay for ADCC (GIA-ADCC).

The point raised by the reviewer has been discussed and the Mpina et al. paper has been cited in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. In a separate, unpublished study, we have examined NK cells in a cohort of individuals living in a malaria-endemic region. In general, NK cells had good functionality, including ADCC toward infected RBCs. Given the small amount of blood collected from these individuals, it would not have been possible to use it to perform the experiments described in the present manuscript. Although we are not mentioning these unpublished results in the revised manuscript, they give us confidence that our results are relevant to disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I do not have the expertise to fully evaluate the parasite strains used in Figure 3 and Figure 4, but I am wondering if overall parasite protein expression in iRBCs could change with the deletion or enhanced expression of the protein of interest (which would affect the interpretation of the data)</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 shows data obtained with the <italic>P.f</italic>. strain DC-J, which lacks expression of PfEMP1.</p><p>As a result, most of the reactivity with Abs from Mali adults was lost with DC-J-infected RBCs.

Experiments in Figure 4 used iRBC enriched for expression of RIFIN, or RBC infected with a strain that expresses the var2CSA variant of PfEMP1. Since these experiments were carried out using Abs specific to each of these antigens, either RIFIN or var2CSA, they were not intended to sample overall parasite proteins on iRBC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Statistical analysis: please indicate in each figure legend when a t test vs. anova was done</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
