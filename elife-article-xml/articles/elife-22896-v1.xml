Animals with complex nervous systems utilize multiple sensory modalities such as vision, touch, and hearing to perceive spatial patterns that reflect the physical structure of their environment. But can animals with much simpler nervous systems detect and discriminate spatial patterns in their environment as well? To address this question, we investigated the roundworm <italic>C. elegans,</italic> which feeds and reproduces in decomposing fruits and plant stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrière and Félix, 2014</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has only 302 neurons and lack vision and hearing, mainly relying on smell and touch to sense their environment. <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses the sense of touch (or mechanosensation) to detect physical contact with external objects. For example, touch to the worm body or nose elicits reflex withdrawal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie and Sulston, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalfie and Wolinsky, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sulston et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Way and Chalfie, 1989</xref>), which allows the worms to quickly avoid potential danger. Beyond reflex, mechanosensation could also provide important information about the physical structure of the environment, aiding in navigation and spatial orientation. Indeed, mechanosensory detection of food elicits a slowing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion, increasing the time spent where food is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensation is limited to such binary distinctions between the presence and absence of food, or whether it enables more general and refined perception of particular spatial patterns, and if so, how this depends on context and experience. These questions are important for determining to what extent a simple animal can sense the spatial arrangement of physical features in its surroundings, providing general insights about how animals perceive spatial patterns.</p><p>Here, we report that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has the ability to discriminate spatial patterns using mechanosensory-dependent dopamine signaling. This spatial pattern selectivity is not a fixed behavior. Instead, it is modified by experience and by internal states such as starvation. Among <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild isolates, the absolute degree of spatial pattern preference is tuned by natural variations in the mechanosensory channel TRP-4 and the dopamine receptor DOP-3, leading to differential behavioral responses to identical environmental settings. These results suggest that the sense of the physical surroundings may undergo rapid evolutionary expansion to diversify the choice of preferred habitat, and perhaps to benefit the survival of the species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study how spatial patterns in its surroundings may impact worm behavior, we examined worm locomotion in microfluidic chambers comprising four patterns of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pillars, designated quad-chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pillar density increased in the four patterns from zero pillars (Pattern I) to the highest density of pillars (Pattern IV). We found that the Bristol N2 strain exhibits a strong preference for pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Approximately 63% of N2 worms were found in the section containing pattern IV 60 min after entering the chamber. By contrast, we observed only 9–15% of worms in each of the other sections I, II and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with lower pillar densities. The strong preference for pattern IV was also indicated by a high positive value of a spatial pattern preference index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Methods). To investigate the robustness of this pattern selectivity, we quantified N2 preference for pattern IV at various time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Pattern IV preference was very stable between 60 and 90 min, but was reduced at 120 min. This decrease was likely due to starvation, as addition of food (OP50 bacteria) into the chamber prolonged the preference for pattern IV, which lasted at least 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with this notion, worms that had already been starved prior to the experiment exhibited a significant reduction in pattern IV preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that feeding state (starvation) can override an inherent preference for pattern selectivity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22896.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits spatial pattern selectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic drawing of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber used in the spatial pattern preference assay.

Single-worm pattern preference index values were similar to those obtained in population experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that pattern selectivity is an individual rather than group behavior. To identify the sensory modality used for pattern selection, we analyzed mutant worms that have defects in either oxygen or touch sensation. <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits aggregation behavior at optimal oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). We thus examined whether oxygen sensation might play a role in the observed clustering within pattern IV. To this end, we tested mutant worms that lack the GCY-35 soluble guanylate cyclase and are defective in oxygen-dependent aggregation, bordering, and social feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). However, these mutant <italic>gcy-35</italic> worms continued to show preference for pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that pattern IV selectivity was independent of possible variations in oxygen levels and oxygen sensing. By contrast, mutant worms with dysfunctional MEC-10 DEG/ENaC channels showed a significant reduction in their preference for pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To understand where MEC-10 functions, we performed cell-specific rescue experiments. As expected, single-copy <italic>Pmec-10::mec-10</italic> transgenes that drive MEC-10 expression in the six touch receptor neurons and in PVD and FLP neurons fully restored the preference for pattern IV. Expression of MEC-10 under <italic>Pegl-44</italic> in FLP and HSN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2001</xref>) also rescued the defects in <italic>mec-10(tm1552)</italic> mutant worms. By contrast, MEC-10 expression in the six touch receptor neurons (driven by <italic>Pmec-18</italic>) did not recover the preference for pattern IV. Together, these data indicate that MEC-10 acts in the polymodal nociceptive FLP neurons to support the selection of pattern IV.</p><p>To determine whether pattern selectivity depends on the particular absolute pillar density of pattern IV, we used a chamber consisting of patterns I and III only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In this chamber, N2 worms showed a clear preference for pattern III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), even though this is a non-favored pattern in the quad-chamber. We therefore conclude that pattern selectivity is based on comparison between different spatial patterns <italic>i.e.,</italic> environmental context, rather than on the specific structural arrangement of pattern IV.</p><p>We next investigated the strategies that worms use to select pattern IV in the quad-chamber. First, we considered local effects occurring at the boundaries between adjacent patterns. We tracked worms that left pattern IV and entered into the less desired pattern III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and found that these worms re-crossed back into the preferred pattern IV at a much higher rate than worms already within pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also found an increase in both reversal and turning rates when worms cross the IV-to-III boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, worms sense local changes in pattern density, and respond quickly to unfavorable changes by reorientation, reinforcing our finding of their ability to make decisions based on comparisons of spatial density. Second, we examined whether worm locomotion within pattern IV was affected by the presence of neighboring patterns. We hypothesized that preceding experience of alternative spatial configurations would have a lasting impact on worm behavior within preferred pattern IV. To test this hypothesis, we designed an additional chamber (designated uni-chamber; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) containing only a pattern IV pillar configuration throughout its surface and no other patterns. We compared the speed and pause rates of worms within pattern IV in both quad- and uni- chambers. We found that worms in pattern IV of the quad-chamber moved more slowly and paused more than worms in the uni-chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). Such slowing and pausing could prolong the stay of worms in pattern IV. Together, these data suggest that the clustering of worms in pattern IV is due to both real-time responses to pattern changes upon boundary crossing and to longer-lasting effects caused by the experience of other less desired patterns. Thus, without vision or hearing, <italic>C. elegans</italic> can take advantage of mechanosensory information to compare and select between spatial patterns in its environment.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22896.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Boundary experience impacts <italic>C. elegans</italic> spatial pattern selectivity.</title><p>Crossing the boundary from pattern IV to pattern III stimulates worms to return to pattern IV.

Several features of this behavior prompted us to investigate the contribution of dopamine signaling. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, dopamine regulates a variety of behaviors including locomotion, mechanosensation, food availability, touch habituation, and the swim-to-crawl transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calhoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kindt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanyal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vidal-Gadea et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, dopamine signals decrease locomotion rates when worms enter a food source (a lawn of bacteria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>), and increase returning frequency when worms leave the bacteria lawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hills et al., 2004</xref>). To test whether dopamine is required also for spatial pattern selectivity, we examined <italic>cat-2(e1112)</italic> animals, which lack the CAT-2 tyrosine hydroxylase and are defective in dopamine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lints and Emmons, 1999</xref>). We observed that <italic>cat-2</italic> mutant animals have disrupted pattern selectivity, as they showed reduced preference for pattern IV in the quad-chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Addition of exogenous dopamine restored the accumulation of <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants within pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), demonstrating that the defect in spatial pattern selectivity of <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants is due to the lack of dopamine. To determine the dopamine receptor responsible for the selectivity, we analyzed mutant worms with impaired dopamine receptors.

The physical structure of the environment is another important feature that varies with habitat. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains from different natural habitats might differ in their selectivity of spatial patterns. We thus examined a wild isolate of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Hawaiian CB4856 (designated HW) in the spatial pattern preference assay. Interestingly, we found that unlike N2, HW worms failed to aggregate in pattern IV of the quad-chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), and their returning behavior at boundaries was significantly reduced in comparison to N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, HW worms exhibited similar traveling speed and pause rates in uni- and quad-chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that mechanosensory experience had little impact on HW behavior.

The <italic>trp-4</italic> gene is located on chromosome I in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. An N2/HW hybrid strain that carries the HW Chromosome I in an N2 background behaved like the HW strain in the spatial pattern preference assay. However, hybrid strains that carry other HW chromosomes in the N2 background were indistinguishable from N2 worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), with the exception of those with HW Chromosome X, which showed a minor but significant reduction in the preference for pattern IV. These data are consistent with a role of <italic>trp-4</italic> in determining the natural variation in spatial pattern selectivity. They also suggest that other gene(s) on Chromosome X may contribute to the polymorphic behavior. Next, we isolated recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a cross between N2 and N2/HW hybrids that carry the HW Chromosome I. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, two RIL strains behaved differently in the spatial pattern preference assay; one that carries the N2 <italic>trp-4</italic> gene showed preference for pattern IV, but another one with HW <italic>trp-4</italic> did not.

These data confirm that N2 TRP-4 is required for the spatial pattern preference observed in the Bristol strains. To test whether N2 TRP-4 is sufficient for endowing the HW strains with spatial pattern selectivity, we overexpressed N2 TRP-4 in HW worms. Because TRP channels are expected to form tetramers, we reasoned that overexpression of N2 TRP-4 might replace the HW TRP-4 channels. Indeed, we found that N2 TRP-4 but not HW TRP-4 overexpression caused HW worms to show spatial pattern selectivity similar to that of N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22896.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Polymorphisms in the mechanotransduction TRP-4 channel contribute to the variation of spatial pattern selectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon illustrating the amino acid substitutions (M36I, G41S, and E67G) in HW TRP-4.

To understand whether the three residue substitutions alter TRP-4 properties, we recorded electrophysiological responses of the dopaminergic CEP neurons to small mechanical displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). The mechanoreceptor current in CEP neurons is mediated by TRP-4, and the amplitude of the current depends on the strength of the applied mechanical force. In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2010</xref>), a displacement of 0.5 μm was sufficient to elicit TRP-4 mediated current in N2 worms, and the current was saturated at 3 μm displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the sensitivity of HW TRP-4 to mechanical stimuli was significantly reduced. Larger mechanical displacement was required to generate currents with similar amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). These results are consistent with the findings that the N-terminal region of the TRP-4 homologue NOMPC is required for mechanogating in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). It is worth noting that, when mechanical stimuli are sufficiently strong, the HW TRP-4 is fully active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Silicon wafers were patterned with various designs using SU8-100 (Stanford microfluidic foundry, CA) and photolithography. PDMS was poured on top of the patterned silicon wafer, and was cured at 80°C for 2 hr. Cured PDMS was carefully lifted away from the silicon wafer. Sharpened stub needles (0.070 mm OD, 22G) were used to create the fluid inlet and outlet paths on the PDMS device. A plasma cleaner PDC-32G (Harrick Scientific, NY) was used to treat the PDMS device for 1 min. Glass slides (1 mm thick) were immediately bound to the devices after treating. Distilled water was added to the devices within 5 min. Before loading the worms, the devices were washed with an ample amount of M9 buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavior assay for spatial pattern preference</title><p>Worms were synchronized for the behavioral assays. Fifty gravid adult worms were transferred onto a 10 cm NGM plate seeded with OP50 to lay eggs for an hour. Then adult worms were removed by picking. Eggs were grown at 20°C for 72 hr to reach the young adult stage for behavioral tests. The PDMS chambers were washed with M9 buffer. Synchronized worms (72 hr) were transferred using glass Pasteur pipettes into Eppendorf tubes. After settling by gravity, worms were washed once to remove residual bacteria OP50. Approximately 30–70 worms were loaded into the inlet, and were allowed to freely explore the chamber. The location of the worms was recorded for 10 s using a Moticam 2500 CCD camera mounted on a stereo microscope (Leica, Germany) at various time points as indicated in the study.</p><p>Worm preference for each pattern was quantified as the percentage of worms occupying that pattern in the quad-chambers and, in addition, using a spatial pattern preference index. The index was calculated for each pattern using the following formula: [# of worms in one pattern – (# of worms in the other three patterns/3)] ÷ total # of worms. An index value of 0 indicates in all patterns equal distribution among the different patterns. An index of −0.33 for a certain pattern indicates no worms found in that pattern. An index of 1 for a certain pattern indicates that all worms are present in that pattern. Each experiment was replicated 3–5 times. ‘n’ indicates the number of independent repeats of a particular experiment. Results were analyzed in a blind manner. To analyze the speed of locomotion and the pause rate, worm behavior in quad-chambers (between 58 to 61 min) was recorded using a Moticam 2500 digital camera that was mounted on a Leica S6D microscope. Videos were processed offline using MATLAB scripts developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht and Bargmann (2011)</xref>. The animal’s locomotory state (forward, reverse, and turn) at boundaries was determined by visual inspection of the video.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The following statistic methods were used to analyze behavioral data. For single pairwise comparisons, we used the Student's <italic>t</italic> test. For analyses that require comparisons between multiple means to a control mean, we used one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. For analyses that require comparisons among all possible pairs of means, we used the Tukey-Kramer method. Statistical analysis was performed using Igor Pro 6. Mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) are reported. Results were considered statistically significant when the p-value was &lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>Young adult worms were immobilized on sylgard-coated coverslips using a cyanoacrylate glue Histoacryl Blue (Aesculap, PA). Worm dissection was performed in extracellular solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2015</xref>). To expose the cell body of the CEP neuron, a small piece of the worm cuticle was cut open as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). Dissected animals were mounted onto a fixed stage upright fluorescence BX51WI microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with a 60x/1.0NA water immersion objective lens, Nomarski-DIC optics, an X-cite 200DC light source (Excelitas, MA), and a ORCA-Flash2.8 CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Corp., Japan). All worms carried a Pdat-1::GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lints and Emmons, 1999</xref>) enabling CEP identification by green fluorescence.</p><p>Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, CA). These pipettes had resistances of ~15 MΩ when filled with internal solution (135 CH3O3SCs, 5 CsCl, 5 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 0.25 CaCl2, 10 HEPES and 5 Na2ATP, adjusted to pH 7.2 using CsOH). Extracellular solution contained (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 10 HEPES, titrated to pH 7.3 with NaOH, 330 mOsm with sucrose. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma.</p><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (holding potential at −75 mV) were carried out by using HEKA EPC-10 double amplifier controlled by HEKA Patchmaster software at 20°C. The junction potential was measured by ±10 mv 5 ms square testing signals. After the pipette tip was inserted into the bath solution, the junction potential was corrected using the ‘Auto V0’ function, which calls a procedure for automatic zeroing of the pipette current. Just before the pipette touched the cell membrane for the seal, the ‘Auto V0’ was used again to make sure the junction potential was well corrected. The currents were amplified and acquired using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Germany). The signal was digitized at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using Patchmaster (HEKA, Germany). A glass stimulus probe was mounted to a piezo-driven actuator (Physik Instrumente, Germany) held by a micromanipulator. Displacement was triggered and controlled by the piezo amplifier E625 (PI), which is synchronized with programmed signals from HEKA Patchmaster software. A voltage step of 222 mV was used to trigger each 1 µm displacement of the probe. Series resistance was compensated to 70%. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Igor Pro 6 (Wavemetrics, OR).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The comments of the two reviewers can be found below. You will see that the reviewers have convergent comments that I request you to address. In essence these are the two sets of key experiments that we would want to see in a revised version:</p><p>1) Validate their results with (null) alleles of <italic>mec-10</italic> and <italic>trp-4</italic>.</p><p>2) Rescue of the <italic>mec-10</italic> phenotype to determine its currently very unclear focus of action (determination of focus of action of <italic>dop-3</italic> does not need to be performed, but possible site of action in VNC MNs should be discussed).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors demonstrate a role for dopaminergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a behavior though which worms preferentially accumulate in environments with particular mechanosensory characteristics. Specifically, they use specially fabricated microfluidic environments to show that worms prefer regions with a high density of mechanical obstacles, and that this behavior requires the mechanosensory <italic>trp</italic> channel <italic>trp-4</italic> and the dopamine receptor <italic>dop-3</italic>. They also show that natural variation in these two genes contributes to variability in the observed behavior; in the case of <italic>trp-4</italic>, they go on to show that the genetic variants have altered sensitivity of <italic>trp-4</italic>-mediated mechanotransdution.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting story that brings together a variety of experimental threads to provide a convincingly simple and straightforward explanation of a seemingly complex behavior. I do think there are a few small missing pieces which if added to the study would make the molecular and cellular explanation of the behavior significantly more complete.</p><p>1) In the manuscript, the authors state that &quot;worms sense localchanges in pattern density, and respond quickly to unfavorable changes by reorientation,&quot; (Results). However, I don't think the authors present any direct evidence that reorientation (i.e. turning/reversal rates) change when crossing from higher to lower obstacle density. In principle, could the accumulation in more dense environments simply involve an orthokinesis mechanism, by which locomotion rates are higher in low-density and lower in high-density environments? This seems particularly relevant as dopamine (and <italic>dop-3</italic>) are known to control speed but not to my knowledge reorientation. It would be good for the authors to directly test turning/reversal rates (with a correction for the known differences in speed).</p><p>2) Although there is a significant amount of data in the paper about the role of <italic>dop-3</italic>, they surprisingly never do cell-specific rescue experiments to see where the DOP-3 receptor is acting. The previous work of Chase et al. suggests it could function in ventral cord motorneurons, and it would be straightforward to see if expression there is sufficient to rescue their phenotypes. This could fill in a missing gap to provide a satisfying molecular/circuit model for the behavior.</p><p>3) The authors show that <italic>mec-10</italic> mutants are defective in the behavior and cite this as evidence that mechanosensation is involved. But MEC-10 is not known to play a direct role in mechanosensation by the dopamine neurons and indeed is not even expressed in those cells. The only plausible explanation I can think of is that since <italic>mec-10</italic> functions in the FLP neurons, and the FLPs and CEPs are known to modulate each other's activity through a gap junction circuit of nose touch neurons (Chatzigeorgiou 2011, Rabinowitch 2013), <italic>mec-10</italic> could influence CEP activity indirectly through this circuit. They could test this easily by seeing if the <italic>mec-10</italic> phenotype rescues under an FLP promoter. As with point 2, this could tie what now seems like a random observation into a convincing circuit model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript from Han et al. evaluates the ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes to use surface texture as a navigational aid (a process called thigmotaxis in other literature). The study introduces a behavioral assay for texture preference based on an arena fabricated using soft-lithography techniques and evaluates the effect of mutations in two ion channel genes-<italic>mec-10</italic> and <italic>trp-4</italic>. Additionally, the work links mechanosensation to dopaminergic signaling and its reception by the DOP-3 receptor. The <italic>mec-10</italic> gene encodes a pore formingsubunit of the sensory mechanotransduction channel in the gentle touch receptor neurons (TRNs) and the <italic>trp-4</italic> gene encodes a pore-forming subunit of the sensory mechanotransduction channel expressed by texture-sensing and proprioceptive neurons (CEP, ADE, PDE). The TRP-4 protein is homologous to <italic>Drosophila</italic> NOMPC and is predicted to form a non-selective cation channel activated by mechanical force. The main findings are that <italic>C. elegans</italic> nematodes perform thigmotaxis, that this behavior differs among wild isolates and depends on TRP-4 ion channels as well as dopaminergic signaling.</p><p>The data are presented in a clear and engaging manner, certain findings rely on mutant alleles that do not cleanly or clearly eliminate the cellular or molecular function in question (see below). For this reason, this reviewer believes that additional experimental work is essential to support the current conclusions.</p><p>1) The role of <italic>mec-10</italic>-expressing mechanoreceptor neurons in quadrant assays (part 1)</p><p>The preference defect in <italic>mec-10(ok1104</italic>) mutants is as strong as that found for <italic>trp-4(ok1605</italic>) mutants (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, it is puzzling that the authors report the <italic>mec-10</italic> result as supplementary material and even more puzzling that they have chosen to focus exclusively on <italic>trp-4</italic>. Given that these genes are expressed in non-overlapping sets of mechanoreceptor neurons, it seems essential to understand determine whether or not these genes act together to mediate the observed thigmotaxis behaviors.</p><p>2) The role of <italic>mec-10</italic>-expressing mechanoreceptor neurons in quadrant assays (part 2)</p><p>The authors study <italic>mec-10(ok1104</italic>) and find that these animals have altered responses to pillar arrays. This conclusion is predicated on the notion that the <italic>ok1104</italic> mutation disables mechanosensation – (Results): &quot;mutant worms with dysfunctional MEC-10 DEG/ENaC mechanosensory channels showed a significant reduction in their preference for pattern IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), demonstrating that spatial pattern selectivity requires proper mechanosensation.&quot; But, the situation is much more complex. First, <italic>mec-10</italic> is expressed in three classes of mechanoreceptor neurons, the touch receptor neurons (TRN), PVD and FLP. Which neurons are responsible for this effect? Second, the <italic>ok1104</italic> allele has very mild effects on TRN-mediated mechanosensation. In fact, Arnadottir et al. (J Neurosci, 2011) showed that <italic>ok1104</italic> mutants retain nearly normal behavioral responses to touch and mechanoreceptor currents. Additionally, the <italic>ok1104</italic> allele deletes 143bp of the gene and allows for the transcription of at least a single transcript encoding an abberant protein. Thus, the <italic>ok1104</italic> allele is unlikely to be null. Thus, the observed defects in behavioral assays could be due to the expression of a defective protein in the TRNs, PVD, or FLP. At a minimum, the authors need to communicate this complexity and uncertainty to readers. It would be better, however, to evaluate additional alleles, including <italic>tm1552</italic>, a different deletion in <italic>mec-10</italic> and <italic>u253</italic> a deletion in <italic>mec-4</italic> that eliminates mechanosensory currents in the TRNs and behavioral sensitivity.</p><p>3) The contribution of <italic>trp-4</italic> to responses to pillar assays</p><p>There are three alleles encoding deletions in the <italic>trp-4</italic> gene available from the CGC stock center: <italic>gk341, sy695</italic>, and <italic>ok1605</italic>. It is unfortunate that the authors have chosen <italic>ok1605</italic> for this study-this allele encodes an in-frame deletion that may not be null. Thus, the behavioral deficit observed could be the result of an aberrant TRP-4 protein rather than the absence of TRP-4. The interpretation of the authors' examination of <italic>trp-4</italic> and its genetic polymorphisms depends on resolving this uncertainty.</p><p>4) Differences in current-displacement curves in N2 and HW</p><p>The recordings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are presented in an ambiguous manner and critical information about the recording conditions are missing.</p><p>Did the authors record from CEP neurons in wild-type N2 and HW worms?

It would be useful to distinguish between the apparent preference and how this preference is produced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22896.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) In the manuscript, the authors state that &quot;worms sense localchanges in pattern density, and respond quickly to unfavorable changes by reorientation,&quot; (Results).
