required to initiate salamander limb regeneration. Yet little is known about the roles of the early wound epidermis during the initiation of regeneration and the mechanisms governing its development into the apical epithelial cap (AEC), a signaling structure necessary for outgrowth and patterning of the regenerate. Here, we elucidate the functions of the early wound epidermis, and further reveal <italic>midkine</italic> (<italic>mk</italic>) as a dual regulator of both AEC development and inflammation during the initiation of axolotl limb regeneration. Through loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that <italic>mk</italic> acts as both a critical survival signal to control the expansion and function of the early wound epidermis and an anti-inflammatory cytokine to resolve early injury-induced inflammation. Altogether, these findings unveil one of the first identified regulators of AEC development and provide fundamental insights into early wound epidermis function, development, and the initiation of limb regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>A. mexicanum</italic></kwd><kwd>limb regeneration</kwd><kwd>blastema</kwd><kwd>wound epidermis</kwd><kwd>midkine</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melton</surname><given-names>Douglas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidation of the molecular basis of early wound epidermis dependence during salamander limb regeneration reveals midkine as a key modulator of wound epidermis development and wound-healing resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Salamanders possess the impressive ability to regenerate their limbs with high fidelity throughout their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flowers et al., 2017</xref>). While most mammals respond to traumatic limb injuries including amputation with a fibrotic scarring response, salamanders instead form a blastema, a transient cellular structure comprised of progenitors derived from different non-epithelial tissues (muscle, connective tissue etc.) that eventually reconstructs the new limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kragl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandoval-Guzmán et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>). Determining the mechanisms required for blastema formation has the potential to provide valuable insights into improving repair and regenerative outcomes in less regenerative-species including humans.</p><p>Classical salamander limb regenerative experiments determined that initiation of blastema formation requires the presence of a wound epidermis for both formation and maintenance of the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goss, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thornton, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thornton, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>). Immediately post-amputation, epithelial cells from the intact peripheral skin migrate radially over the exposed stump tissues and form a thin wound epithelium covering the amputation plane within 12 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hay and Fischman, 1961</xref>). Unlike normal full thickness skin that contains two layers (epidermis and dermis), the wound epidermis only contains an epithelial layer comprised primarily of keratinocytes, allowing for direct communication between the wound epidermis and underlying stump tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Repesh and Oberpriller, 1978</xref>). This thin wound epidermis persists through the initial wound healing stages of regeneration. As the blastema forms during later stages of regeneration, the early wound epithelium gradually expands into a stratified epidermis commonly called the apical epithelial cap (AEC), which is a signaling structure that maintains blastemal outgrowth and directs patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boilly and Albert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen and Tassava, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>). This expansion occurs primarily via proliferation and subsequent distal migration of epithelial cells in the peripheral skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hay and Fischman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell and Crews, 2008</xref>). Classical studies showed that inhibiting early wound epidermis formation by either suturing or grafting full thickness skin over the amputation plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>) or immediately inserting the amputated limb into the body cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goss, 1956a</xref>) blocked blastema formation. However, if the amputated limb was inserted into the body cavity after the wound epidermis formed, regeneration proceeded normally, demonstrating an early need for the wound epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goss, 1956b</xref>). Furthermore, preventing AEC development by either continuous removal of the wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thornton, 1957</xref>) or daily irradiation to inhibit proliferative expansion also hindered limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thornton, 1958</xref>). Together, these findings established the necessity for a wound epidermis/AEC throughout different stages of limb regeneration.</p><p>The nature of wound epidermis dependence has been more well explored during later blastemal stages of regeneration. The AEC expresses mitogens and patterning factors that help to maintain blastemal cell proliferation and pattern the regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boilly and Albert, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell and Crews, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Satoh et al., 2008</xref>). However, the roles of the wound epidermis during early stages of regeneration are less clear. Moreover, the early wound epidermis is likely to be functionally distinct from the AEC as the wound healing micro-environment differs substantially from that of the blastema. Preventing early wound epidermis formation was shown to affect the maintenance, but not the onset of proliferation of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), though it is worth noting that the early wound epidermis does express molecules capable of inducing proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sugiura et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, some dedifferentiation of muscle, bone and cartilage tissue was still observed when wound epidermis formation was prevented, although not to the same extent as normal regenerating limbs. Altogether these studies indicated that the early wound epidermis is involved in maintaining progenitor cell cycling and may also play a role in tissue histolysis.</p><p>More recently, bulk and single cell transcriptional limb regeneration studies have further characterized gene expression in the early wound epidermis and AEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leigh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, it remains unknown what gene expression programs in regenerating tissues depend on the presence of the early wound epidermis. The initiation of blastema formation is a complex event with inflammation, tissue histolysis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and cell cycle re-entry of progenitors all transpiring concurrently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCusker et al., 2015</xref>). Aside from the induction of proliferation, whether and to what extent the early wound epidermis may regulate these other processes remains relatively unexplored. Furthermore, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the transition from the early wound epithelium into the AEC, a major milestone for successful limb regeneration.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we sought to deconvolute the functional roles of the wound epidermis from the rest of the regenerating limb tissues by revisiting the classical full skin flap surgical model to inhibit wound epidermis formation during limb regeneration. Using modern-day transcriptional approaches, we illuminate the roles of the early wound epidermis and identify distinct wound epidermis-dependent transcriptional programs in dividing progenitors and the surrounding regenerating tissues. In addition to the discovery of putative regulators of wound epidermis formation and function, our approach enabled us to identify <italic>midkine</italic> (<italic>mk</italic>) as a regulator of both AEC development and early inflammation, key events during the initiation of blastema formation. Altogether, these findings provide important insight into the molecular basis for wound epidermis dependence and further advance our understanding of wound epithelium/AEC biology during limb regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The wound epithelium is a major regulator of inflammation, ECM remodeling, and tissue histolysis during early stages of regeneration</title><p>We previously developed a method leveraging differential DNA content during the cell cycle to enrich for dividing progenitors during early stages of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>), facilitating analysis of the distinct transcriptional programs active in blastemal progenitors apart from those of the surrounding tissues (non-dividing cells in stump tissues and the wound epidermis). To examine the functional roles of the early wound epidermis, we asked how the transcriptional programs of these three populations changed when wound epidermis formation was prevented. To do this, we utilized the classical full skin flap (FSF) surgical model pioneered by Anthony Mescher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>). We performed full skin flap surgeries on regenerating axolotl limbs to prevent epithelial cell migration and contact with exposed stump tissues, inhibiting both wound epidermis formation and limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Since preventing early wound epidermis formation via full skin flap surgery does not affect induction of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), we applied our method here to profile blastemal progenitors and the surrounding regenerating tissues in full skin flap sutured limbs at 5 days post-amputation (dpa), around the onset of proliferation. By leveraging the data generated from our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>), we were able to compare the gene expression programs in full skin flap sutured regenerating limbs to both intact limbs and normal regenerating limbs from the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Pathway analysis revealed that while non-dividing cells exhibited no major differences, dividing cells (i.e. enriching for progenitors) exhibited a loss in predicted activation of canonical Wnt, HIPPO, and TGF-beta signaling. Many components of these pathways were also expressed at lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the wound epidermis induces transcriptional activation of these pathways in dividing progenitors. Interestingly, some components of these pathways including <italic>tgfb1</italic> and <italic>twist1</italic> were not transcriptionally affected, suggesting that their expression in progenitors is wound epidermis-independent. Notably, the overall transcriptional profiles of dividing progenitors in both cases were relatively similar (596 differentially expressed transcripts, 313 annotated) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), signifying that while the wound epidermis activates key signaling pathways, the overall gene expression programs in early progenitors are largely wound epidermis-independent. This lends transcriptional evidence to reinforce the notion that the earliest transcriptional programs of progenitors are likely driven in response to the injury itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tassava and Loyd, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the dividing progenitors, the transcriptional programs of the surrounding tissues diverged considerably. We found that 3911 transcripts (982 annotated) were differentially expressed in non-dividing cells in regenerating stump tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The majority of these transcripts pertained to genes involved in ECM regulation, inflammation, and tissue histolysis. Many ECM-components and regulators that maintained expression in intact and normal regenerating tissues were aberrantly down-regulated (e.g. <italic>fbn2</italic>, <italic>finc</italic>, <italic>has2</italic>), and regenerative ECM components as well as degrading enzymes (e.g. <italic>tenascin</italic>, <italic>mmp2,</italic> and <italic>mmp13</italic>) failed to be induced, indicating defects in ECM remodeling. Furthermore, there was a high representation of mis-regulated immune-related transcripts, both pertaining to pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. In particular, components of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways including toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and interferon α/β/γ signaling, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways including PPARα/RXRα signaling and <italic>anxa1</italic> signaling were dysregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Enzymes involved in tissue histolysis were mis-expressed as well. Notably, expression of the major bone matrix degrading enzyme <italic>catk</italic> failed to be induced, while the major bone and cartilage matrix component <italic>col1a1</italic> maintained expression, indicating potential defects in bone resorption, a process that begins during the first week of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischman and Hay, 1962</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the wound epidermis is a major regulator of inflammation, ECM remodeling, and tissue histolysis in regenerating stump tissues during early stages of limb regeneration.</p><p>The presence of the dermis in full skin flap sutured limbs additionally presented a crude, yet effective opportunity to identify epithelial transcriptional programs dependent on direct contact between the wound epidermis and regenerating stump tissues. We found that 1060 transcripts (480 annotated) were differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Similar to the non-dividing cells in regenerating stump tissues, many transcripts involved in ECM regulation and inflammatory signaling (both pro- and anti-inflammatory) were also dysregulated in full skin flap epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Components of interferon and cytokine signaling failed to be induced in full skin flap derived epithelial cells, while anti-pathogenic mucins including <italic>muc5a</italic> and <italic>muc5b</italic> were overexpressed, suggesting dysregulation of inflammatory processes. Interestingly, <italic>mpeg1</italic> commonly failed to be induced in the full skin flap epithelium as well as non-dividing cells in regenerating stump tissues, potentially indicating a defect in macrophage infiltration during early regeneration. Furthermore, ECM components expressed in intact skin (e.g. <italic>otoan, k1c15, k1c19, k2c5</italic>) lost expression in full skin flap epithelia, and other ECM regulators including <italic>finc, palld,</italic> and <italic>mmp3</italic> were also differentially expressed. These data strongly suggest that direct communication between regenerating mesenchymal tissues and epithelial cells is crucial for proper modulation of early inflammatory responses and ECM remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Midkine is highly expressed in the basal layers of the wound epidermis/AEC and blastemal progenitors</title><p><italic>Midkine</italic> (<italic>mk</italic>) is a pleiotropic growth factor cytokine that has been shown to regulate a variety of processes including development, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muramatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weckbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gramage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karaman and Alitalo, 2017</xref>).

Specifically, while <italic>mk</italic> expression in regenerating stump tissues was lower, <italic>mk</italic> failed to be transcriptionally induced in full skin flap epithelial cells.

Hence, we chose to further explore the role of <italic>mk</italic> during limb regeneration.</p><p>To determine when and in which cell types <italic>mk</italic> is expressed during limb regeneration, we performed a series of single and double in situ hybridizations. Time course in situ hybridization of <italic>mk</italic> confirmed that it is highly expressed during limb regeneration, but not in full skin flap sutured regenerating limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–G</xref>). In non-regenerating intact limbs, <italic>mk</italic> was lowly expressed in cells interspersed throughout the muscle and dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A’</xref>). During regeneration, <italic>mk</italic> became strongly expressed in both the basal layers of the wound epidermis and mesenchymal cells within regenerating stump tissues beginning at 3 dpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C’</xref>). To determine whether <italic>mk</italic> expression was first up-regulated in regenerating stump tissues or the wound epidermis, we performed a more detailed analysis of the onset of <italic>mk</italic> expression prior to 3 dpa. In situ hybridization of <italic>mk</italic> at 24 and 56 hours post-amputation (hpa) revealed a small population of <italic>mk</italic><sup>+</sup> cells interspersed throughout regenerating stump tissues with little to no expression of <italic>mk</italic> in the basal layers of the wound epidermis until 72 hpa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Together, these data indicate that <italic>mk</italic> is first expressed in regenerating stump tissues prior to the induction of expression in the wound epidermis.

Interestingly, we also noticed relatively strong <italic>mk</italic> expression within the non-regenerating tissue at the base of the blastema (Figure F-F’), suggesting <italic>mk</italic> may play a role in differentiation during later stages of regeneration.

Because we had observed <italic>mk</italic><sup>+</sup> cells interspersed in the muscle and dermis of intact tissues, we surmised that <italic>mk</italic> may be expressed at low homeostatic levels in subsets of connective tissue, muscle, or endothelial cells. To examine this possibility, we performed double in situ hybridization of <italic>mk</italic> with <italic>prrx-1</italic>, <italic>pax7</italic>, and <italic>pecam</italic>, which are markers for connective tissue cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerber et al., 2018</xref>), muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sandoval-Guzmán et al., 2014</xref>), and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Whited et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. Indeed, our analysis revealed that approximately 96.4% of <italic>mk</italic><sup>+</sup> expressing cells in non-regenerating tissues were comprised of <italic>prrx-1<sup>+</sup></italic> connective tissue cells (~43.8% of <italic>mk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells), <italic>pax7</italic><sup>+</sup> satellite cells (~44.9% of <italic>mk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells), and <italic>pecam</italic><sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (~7.7% of <italic>mk<sup>+</sup></italic> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we observed a relatively similar breakdown of <italic>mk</italic><sup>+</sup> cells across all three cell types during early stages limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). At both 3 and 7 dpa, <italic>mk</italic>-expressing cells could be divided into connective tissue cells (~53–54%), satellite cells (~36–37%), and a small percentage of endothelial cells (4–5%). Given heavy immune cell infiltration during wound healing stages of regeneration, we also investigated whether <italic>mk</italic> was expressed in monocytes by performing double in situ hybridization with <italic>csf1-r</italic>, a monocyte marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grayfer et al., 2014</xref>).

Our study has revealed the functional roles of the early wound epithelium by examining how the separate transcriptional programs of blastemal progenitors and the surrounding tissues change in its absence. Here, we identified both early wound epidermis-dependent transcriptional programs as well as wound epithelial gene expression programs likely to be dependent on signaling from regenerating stump tissues. Importantly, our approach enabled us to identify <italic>mk</italic> as dual regulator of wound epidermis expansion during AEC development and the resolution of inflammation - two events that are essential for proper initiation of blastema formation.</p><p>The global transcriptional profiles of dividing progenitors are largely wound epidermis-independent during the initial stages of regeneration. Rather, we find that the transcriptional profiles of the surrounding tissues are more heavily affected when wound epidermis formation is prevented. A majority of these dysregulated transcripts are predominantly involved in inflammation, ECM remodeling, and tissue histolysis, indicating that the wound epidermis heavily modulates these processes during early stages of regeneration. Many characteristics of the initial wound healing stages post-amputation mirror those of mammals including activation of canonical inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>). Yet while most mammals activate a fibrotic scarring response post-wound healing, salamanders initiate blastema formation, suggesting there exist key differences during wound healing resolution. It is well known that differences in immune responses and ECM composition can tip the balance between scarring and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godwin et al., 2014</xref>). In light of our data, we propose that the early wound epidermis orchestrates the proper pro-regenerative niche during wound healing that is necessary for blastema formation by regulating early inflammation, ECM remodeling, and tissue histolysis.</p><p>Given that the initial cell cycle re-entry of progenitors during regeneration is independent of the wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), our data provide transcriptional evidence to support the notion that the onset of progenitor activation is stimulated by processes inherent to the injury itself such as blood clotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanaka and Brockes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>). However, even though the overall transcriptional profile of early dividing progenitors is relatively wound epidermis-independent, we find that transcriptional activation of HIPPO, Wnt, and TGF-beta signaling in dividing progenitors is dependent on the wound epidermis. The loss of activation of not one, but all three pathways, when wound epidermis formation was prevented strongly suggests potential common regulation and synergism between these pathways, similar to other developmental and tumorigenic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNeill and Woodgett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attisano and Wrana, 2013</xref>). As the wound epidermis/AEC is known to maintain blastemal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tassava and Garling, 1979</xref>), it is therefore possible that it does so by inducing and/or sustaining activation of HIPPO, canonical Wnt, and TGF-beta signaling in dividing progenitors. Thus, dissecting the functional interplay between these three pathways will likely elucidate the mechanisms that control early blastemal cell behaviors critical for the initial phases of blastema formation.</p><p>Common down-regulation of the macrophage marker <italic>mpeg1</italic> in both the non-dividing cells and epithelia of full skin flap sutured limbs further indicates that the wound epidermis may play a role in macrophage recruitment during early stages of regeneration. Macrophage depletion during early stages of limb regeneration inhibits blastema formation and results in abnormal ECM deposition reminiscent of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting a tight interplay between the immune system and scarring. We find that many critical regenerative ECM remodeling enzymes and components, including various matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vinarsky et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>tenascin</italic>, fail to be strongly induced in regenerating stump tissues in the absence of the wound epidermis. Our data therefore suggest the possibility that the wound epidermis may mediate ECM remodeling indirectly through immune cells including macrophages. Interestingly, cross-talk between the wound epithelium and macrophages through <italic>interleukin one beta</italic> (<italic>il1b</italic>) signaling is important for early stages of fish fin fold regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>). Our data also indicate that contact between epithelial cells and underlying regenerating stump tissues is important for proper regulation of inflammation and ECM remodeling during salamander limb regeneration. In addition, we found signatures reminiscent of defects in bone resorption, indicating that the wound epidermis may play a role in mediating early skeletal remodeling. As this area has been understudied during limb regeneration, it will be interesting to explore the potential involvement of the wound epidermis in the regulation of this process in future studies.</p><p>Notably, we identify the pleotropic growth factor cytokine <italic>mk</italic> as a dual regulator of AEC development and the resolution of early inflammation. <italic>Mk</italic> is an important mediator of a variety of processes including development, tumorigenesis, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muramatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weckbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorrelle et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrate that <italic>mk</italic> controls early wound epidermis expansion during AEC development by acting as a cell survival signal. Increased cell death in the wound epidermis of both iMDK-treated and <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> regenerating limbs leads to a thin wound epithelium that exhibits aberrant gene expression and likely impaired functionality. Mis-expression of wound epidermis genes including <italic>chs1</italic>, which is normally only expressed during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leigh et al., 2018</xref>), also demonstrates a lack of normal wound epidermis progression from early to blastemal stages. Others have shown the role of <italic>mk</italic> as a survival factor in several contexts including neural crest cell development, immune cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muramatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vieceli and Bronner, 2018</xref>), suggesting that it may be a conserved function. In fact, <italic>mk</italic> signaling through one of its most well-studied receptors <italic>ptprz</italic> regulates cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our data, it is likely that <italic>mk</italic>-dependent <italic>ptprz</italic> signaling similarly modulates cell survival during AEC development in limb regeneration given its wound epidermis-specific expression pattern. Furthermore, <italic>mk</italic> induced anti-apoptotic signaling has been linked to activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade in B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Owada et al., 1999</xref>), and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2006</xref>). As the inhibitor iMDK also inhibits PI3K phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masui et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that PI3K/AKT signaling acts downstream of <italic>mk</italic> in AEC development. Furthermore, <italic>ptprz</italic> modulates endogenous phosphorylated ß-catenin levels through its phosphatase activity, which becomes inactive upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meng et al., 2000</xref>). Since Wnt signaling is essential for limb regeneration and Wnt ligands are also expressed in the wound epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawakami et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yokoyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knapp et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>mk</italic> may also act in concert with and/or up-stream of Wnt signaling to regulate wound epidermis development.</p><p>In a variety of other contexts, <italic>mk</italic> also acts as a mitogen to stimulate tumor growth, tissue growth during organogenesis, and tissue repair/regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calinescu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gramage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karaman and Alitalo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). For example, <italic>mk</italic> has been shown to induce proliferation of Müller glia in an autocrine manner during zebrafish photoreceptor regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gramage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we were surprised to find that <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants did not display differences in wound epidermis or blastemal cell proliferation, despite observing lower levels in iMDK-treated limbs. We also observed higher cell death in blastemal cells that eventually resolved in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants, but not iMDK-treated limbs. In all, these data suggested that genetic compensation may be occurring in the mutant and <italic>mk</italic> is likely not required for general proliferation or blastemal cell survival. While it is tempting to assume compensation is the sole cause for these differences, we cannot discount the possibility that they may have been caused by non-specific effects of the inhibitor given the exact inhibitory mechanism and direct target of iMDK remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masui et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, while not required for proliferation, <italic>mk</italic> was sufficient to affect proliferation at high levels. Most notably, overexpression during regeneration induced a striking ectopic expansion of the wound epidermis. Interestingly, innervation of the wound epidermis has also been shown to regulate keratinocyte proliferation in the AEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Satoh et al., 2012</xref>). While our data suggest <italic>mk</italic> does not affect innervation, <italic>mk</italic> may act in parallel with nerve-derived factors to finely control cell death/proliferation dynamics during early wound epidermis expansion. Unexpectedly, overexpression of <italic>mk</italic> decreased blastemal cell proliferation. Despite ample evidence of the role of <italic>mk</italic> as a mitogen, <italic>mk</italic> has been shown to have anti-proliferative activities in some contexts. For example, MK exerts an anti-proliferative effect on dental mesenchyme during mouse tooth development, yet a proliferative effect if combined with FGF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitsiadis et al., 1995a</xref>), indicating that MK activity can differ depending on the presence of other growth factors in the micro-environment. Hence, <italic>mk</italic> may act cooperatively with other secreted molecules that modulate blastema formation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Currie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farkas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sugiura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant et al., 2017b</xref>) to exert stage- and cell-type specific effects during regeneration.</p><p>Notably, both loss- and gain-of-function of <italic>mk</italic> additionally led to signs of persistent inflammation including higher monocyte density, altogether suggesting that <italic>mk</italic> levels need to be tightly controlled for proper regulation of inflammation during early regeneration. Many relatively recent studies have focused on the pro-inflammatory role of <italic>mk,</italic> driving chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weckbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorrelle et al., 2017</xref>). Removing or reducing <italic>mk</italic> activity in mouse models in these contexts led to less inflammation attributed to decreased leukocyte recruitment. In contrast, our data suggest that <italic>mk</italic> acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine to resolve injury-induced inflammation during the initiation of limb regeneration. While inflammation is required for regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kyritsis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsarouchas et al., 2018</xref>), prolonged inflammation can be detrimental. Recent studies have shown that macrophages play a role in resolving inflammation in both zebrafish and salamanders, by acting as a source of anti-inflammatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsarouchas et al., 2018</xref>). Our data further suggest that both blastemal progenitors and the wound epidermis may be additional sources of anti-inflammatory molecules including <italic>mk</italic> that aid in resolving inflammation during early stages of limb regeneration. Moreover, it is possible that <italic>mk</italic> expression may be induced by macrophage-derived factors, an interesting future avenue of investigation. These findings thus highlight the need to advance our understanding of the complex molecular cross-talk between the immune system and various regenerating tissues during wound healing to gain insight into what leads to regenerative versus non-regenerative outcomes.</p><p>Finally, both overlapping and non-overlapping expression of <italic>mk</italic> and its receptors indicates that <italic>mk</italic> is likely acting through both autocrine and paracrine signaling in limb regeneration. The epithelial-mesenchymal dual expression of <italic>mk</italic> has been known for decades in the development of various organs including the lungs, gut, and limb buds of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitsiadis et al., 1995b</xref>). Although the expression pattern is suggestive of inductive signaling between the epithelium and developing mesenchyme, the exact functional nature of <italic>mk</italic> in these contexts remains largely unknown. While we did not examine <italic>mk</italic> expression in developing axolotl limbs, it is possible that <italic>mk</italic> exhibits a similar expression pattern in both the limb bud ectoderm and mesenchyme. As such, the up-regulation of <italic>mk</italic> in blastemal progenitors and the wound epidermis may signify the re-induction of a developmental program during the initiation of limb regeneration. Additionally, <italic>mk</italic> is first expressed in blastemal progenitors prior to the wound epidermis and failed to be strongly up-regulated when wound epidermis formation was prevented. Therefore, <italic>mk</italic> up-regulation during the initiation of limb regeneration may depend on positive feedback signaling between <italic>mk<sup>+</sup></italic> blastemal progenitors and the wound epidermis. Moreover, <italic>mk</italic> receptors are expressed in intact epithelial cells and our rescue data suggest the wound epidermis is responsive to <italic>mk</italic> from non-epithelial sources. Hence, it is possible that <italic>mk</italic> secreted from blastemal progenitors may first induce <italic>mk</italic> expression in the wound epidermis through paracrine signaling, which is then self-sustained through autocrine signaling.</p><p>While our <italic>mk</italic> receptor expression data suggest that <italic>mk</italic> likely directly signals to the wound epidermis to regulate AEC development, how <italic>mk</italic> regulates inflammation remains less clear. To the best of our knowledge, besides moderate levels of <italic>integrin b1</italic>, we were not able to identify robust expression of <italic>mk</italic> receptors on populations of immune cells in our data or published single cell data. Thus, it is possible that <italic>mk</italic> may regulate monocyte activity directly through the low expression of these or as of yet unidentified receptor(s), indirectly through other tissues, or both. Given the data, it is likely that both regulatory mechanisms are at play. As <italic>mk</italic> receptors are more highly expressed throughout many other cell types and tissues, it is possible that <italic>mk</italic> indirectly regulates the resolution of inflammation by stimulating the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors in these tissues that then signal directly to monocytes. One likely example of such a tissue may be the wound epidermis. As we have shown that the early wound epidermis is immunomodulatory, it is conceivable that the prolonged inflammation we observed in both <italic>mk</italic> loss- and gain-of-function contexts was indirectly or partially caused by an impaired wound epidermis/AEC, opening up the possibility that <italic>mk</italic> may regulate the resolution of inflammation in an indirect manner. In all, the widespread expression of <italic>mk</italic> receptors throughout regenerating limb tissues underscores the complexity of <italic>mk</italic> function and makes it clear that future studies using tissue-specific inducible <italic>mk</italic> and receptor knockout models will be necessary to deconvolute the exact nature of cell-type specific <italic>mk </italic>signaling during regeneration.</p><p>To conclude, we have revealed the functional roles of the early wound epidermis during the initial stages of limb regeneration and further identified <italic>mk</italic> as a key regulator of both AEC development and the resolution of inflammation. The early expression of <italic>mk</italic> in both blastemal progenitors and the basal wound epidermis, key cell types that coordinate limb regeneration, suggests its expression may be linked with the ability to regenerate. As <italic>mk</italic> is highly conserved in other vertebrates, examining whether it plays similar roles in other appendage regeneration models and if it is differentially activated in non-regenerative systems will be important future lines of questioning. In all, we believe the findings presented here provide a solid foundation to further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of wound epidermis biology in appendage regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) husbandry and surgeries were performed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines at Harvard University. Sub-adult white and albino axolotls (15–18 cm) provided by the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC, University of Kentucky, KY) were used for the RNA-sequencing experiment of full skin flap sutured regenerating limbs. Juvenile white axolotls (3–6 cm animals) were utilized for the midkine inhibitor (iMDK) (Tocris Bio) experiments and <italic>mk</italic> overexpression experiments. <italic>Mk</italic> mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 in the white background and genotyped/analyzed as juveniles as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animal surgeries and drug treatments</title><p>For amputations, animals were anesthetized in 0.1% tricaine (Sigma Aldrich) until unresponsive to a tail pinch. The limb was then amputated at the mid-radius/ulna level using sterilized dissection scissors. All of the limb amputations were performed on naïve regenerating animals that is animals that had not regenerated before. The amputations for all functional experiments were performed at the mid-radius/ulna level of axolotl forelimbs. For the transcriptional profiling experiment of full skin flap sutured limbs, amputations were performed at the mid-zeugopodial level (radius/ulna or –tibia/fibula) and full skin flap surgeries were performed on all four limbs of nine animals immediately post-amputation as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mescher (1976)</xref>. Briefly, limbs were amputated in the distal zeugopodial region and skin was carefully peeled back. The exposed underlying non-epithelial tissues were then amputated at the mid-zeugopodial level and the excess skin was sutured directly over the amputation plane using 9–0 sutures (Ethicon).</p><p>For iMDK experiments, limbs of animals were amputated and the animals were immersed in DMSO or 10 uM iMDK solution beginning at either 0 or 7 dpa. Drug solution was changed daily for the duration of the inhibitor experiments and animals were fed normally every other day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA isolation and sequencing</title><p>For RNA-sequencing of full skin flap sutured limbs, approximately 2–3 mm of tissue directly proximal to the amputation plane was collected at 5 dpa. Twelve limbs (6 forelimbs and 6 hindlimbs) were pooled for each replicate per timepoint and the experiment was performed in triplicate. Pooling was necessary to collect enough cells for RNA isolation.. Dissociation, DAPI cell cycle analysis, and RNA isolation from the dividing and non-dividing cells in the non-epithelial stump tissues as well as the full thickness skin flap was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al. (2019)</xref>. Briefly, the wound epidermis or full skin flap at the distal amputation plane was carefully micro-dissected off of regenerating limb tissue and dissociated in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, while the remaining non-epithelial stump tissues along with some intact skin proximal to the amputation plane were dissociated in a mixture of collagenase, dispase, and glucose in 80% PBS. Both dissociated populations underwent DAPI staining and FACS was performed on the stained non-epithelial stump tissue fraction to sort the population into 2N and 4N fractions. RNA was isolated from the 3 DAPI stained cellular populations of wound/full skin flap epithelial cells, dividing cells (4N) and non-dividing cells (2N) from regenerating non-epithelial stump tissues. cDNA was synthesized using the NuGEN Ovation RNAseq System V2 protocol (Integrated Sciences) using 10 ng of starting material and cDNA libraries were generated using the Wafergen PrepX Complete ILMN DNA Library kit (Takara Bio). Library concentrations were measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermofisher Scientific) and Kapa Illumina Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems). The samples (regenerating and full skin flap samples) were pooled altogether and sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 system (Illumina) (125 bp reads) at the Harvard Bauer Core Sequencing Facility. The regenerating dataset (data from 0 and 5 dpa) presented in this study used for comparison was previously published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsai et al.

Raw TPM values from each sample were analyzed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Differentially expressed transcripts were filtered for fold change &gt;2 and adjusted p-value&lt;0.05. For pathway analysis, Uniprot IDs of blastx hits from different species for all differentially expressed transcripts were converted to human Uniprot IDs using HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and/or Uniprot ID conversion tools online. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) analysis was performed on differentially expressed transcripts to determine growth factor signaling pathway activation or inhibition for the following comparisons: 0 dpa 2N vs 5 dpa 2N, 0 dpa 4N vs 5 dpa 4N, 0 dpa epi vs 5 dpa wound epidermis (WE), 0 dpa 2N vs 5 dpa FSF 2N, 0 dpa 4N vs 5 dpa FSF 4N, and 0 dpa epi vs 5 dpa FSF epi. Heatmaps of normalized TPM levels for differentially expressed transcripts in each fraction (2N, 4N, or epidermis) were generated in RStudio utilizing the ComplexHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2016</xref>) or gplots packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Warnes et al., 2015</xref>).

Tissue was homogenized in Trizol and RNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. We collected the samples in biological triplicate for each condition. Quality and quantity of RNA were assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 pico kit and run on a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Sequencing libraries were then synthesized using the Illumina Nextera XT kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a Nextseq 500 at the Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School. Fastq data were filtered, trimmed, and aligned as described above. Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For the differential expression analysis, the cutoff was set at an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 and fold change &gt;2. K-means clustering of the transcripts was performed using the Complex Heatmap package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2016</xref>) and pathway analysis of DMSO- or iMDK-enriched transcripts was performed on differentially expressed transcripts using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of mk mutants and genotyping</title><p>In order to generate the <italic>mk</italic> mutants, CRISPR-cas9 technology was utilized and the start codon of the <italic>mk</italic> locus was targeted with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) (ATG start is bolded): 5’<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGCCCCCACAACTGCATCC</named-content> −3’. This sequence was also unique within the axolotl genome. The <italic>mk</italic> crRNA and generic tracrRNA were ordered from IDT and reconstituted according to their instructions.

Fastq data were then analyzed utilizing CRISPResso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pinello et al., 2016</xref>). For the genotyping analysis, mutants in which less than 1% of wildtype alleles were detected were deemed null (most had mosaic null genotypes), with up to 10–15% wildtype alleles deemed low % wildtype, and greater than 15% deemed high % wildtype (most of these animals were actually closer to 80–90% wildtype).

tissues. To help clarify the role of the wound epidermis in the early stages of limb regeneration, the authors use a classic full-skin-flap suture assay, which prevents wound epidermis formation, combined with transcriptional profiling of distinct cell populations to identify genes with wound epidermis-dependent expression in the axolotl limb. Here, they focus on one such gene, encoding the growth factor midkine. Genetic ablation of midkine results in impaired limb regeneration, defects in development of the wound epidermis, elevated cell death, and persistent inflammation. Overexpression of midkine also impaired regeneration, with overgrowth of the wound epidermis, decreased proliferation in the blastema, and prolonged inflammation. This work provides an important step in understanding the mechanisms by which the wound epidermis and underlying tissues signal to each other, as well as how inflammation is regulated during regeneration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Midkine is essential for wound epidermis development during the initiation of limb regeneration&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by Phillip Newmark as Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>All of the reviewers recognized the significance of this work for understanding the role of the wound epidermis in regeneration, but agreed that more evidence was required to clarify the role of midkine. If such additional evidence is provided, this work would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following essential revisions should be included in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Grafting experiments between wild-type and midkine null animals to examine whether wild-type epithelia can rescue the defects in midkine null limbs or if midkine-null epithelia would suffice to recapitulate the null phenotype;</p><p>2) Additional consideration should be given to the effects of midkine perturbations on immune cell recruitment and blastemal cells. Does midkine overexpression lead to increases in monocytes? How do midkine perturbations affect blastemal cell survival and proliferation? Why does skin flap suture lead to a loss of macrophages while midkine inhibition leads to increased monocytes? Could looking at midkine expression during earlier time points in regeneration provide hints about the order in which it is acting in different tissues?</p><p>3) The authors suggest that the discordance between phenotypes observed after iMDK treatment and in midkine null limbs is due to genetic compensation (subsection “Mk is sufficient, but not required, for wound epidermis proliferation”), however, it seems equally (or more) plausible that these differences are due to non-specific effects of the drug. According to PubChem, high-throughput studies have identified several other targets of this drug (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/15991416). At a minimum, this caveat is worth mentioning. Depending on the drug's mode of action and the level at which midkine is overexpressed, would it be possible to partially rescue drug treatment with midkine overexpression to help rule out such specificity concerns? Alternatively, are there structurally related compounds that do not inhibit midkine that can serve as better specificity controls?</p><p>To help you address their comments and clarify aspects of the manuscript that may have been unclear to the reviewers, we have included the complete reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Tsai and colleagues build on their former transcriptional analysis (Tsai et al., 2019) with a targeted look at the role of the wound epidermis during axolotl limb regeneration. The wound epidermis has been known to be one of the essential components that allows blastema formation, although little is known about the molecular mechanisms that make it so crucial for regeneration to occur. The authors perform a classic full thickness skin flap suture over the stump tissue which prevents migration of keratinocytes and formation of the specialized wound epidermis. The wound epidermis is marked by a thickened epithelia, and importantly, no basement membrane between the epithelia and the underlying limb mesenchyme. By transcriptional profiling they find that several major signaling pathways (Wnt, TGF-B, and Hippo) are suppressed as well as a host of other differentially-expressed genes. The authors focus on midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor that has pleiotropic effects on inflammation, tumorigenesis, and tissue repair. The authors find that pharmacological and genetic perturbation can inhibit or delay limb regeneration, respectively, and loss of midkine reduces the proliferation of epithelia and mesenchymal cells while increasing apoptosis of epithelial cells and leading to a reduced thickness of the wound epidermis.</p><p>Overall, the transcriptional analysis and insights derived from the authors' work are a wonderful resource for the community and the rationale for experiments and later analysis are every bit as well done as their previous work published this year.</p><p>My primary concern is the focus on midkine as a &quot;critical regulator of blastema formation&quot; (taken from the impact statement). In general, I find such a conclusion to be a bit lacking given the data presented. One of the most interesting insights from the author's transcriptional analysis is that preventing wound epidermis formation primarily effects recruitment of monocytes/immune cells and their downstream activities such as activation of inflammation pathways, tissue histolysis, and ECM degradation (via MMPs). This makes me wonder why the authors decided to focus on midkine instead of the immune-epithelial crosstalk that seems to be the primary transcriptional alteration. The phenotype seen in both the skin flap suture as well as the midkine perturbations could be directly related to the loss of immune cells during regeneration. The phenotype looks very similar to the macrophage depletion described in Godwin et al., 2013, including a reduction in MMP and TGFB expression and with no loss of Twist expression.</p><p>Additionally, there are some contradictory data that should be explained -</p><p>The skin flap suture shows a loss of macrophages (by loss of mpeg1 expression) and midkine expression. However, the <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> animals and pharmacologically-inhibited animals display higher densities of monocytes. This needs to be explained in some way, either as a technical difference in experiments or a difference in biology.</p><p>The authors propose that midkine is needed for epithelial survival and wound epidermis development. Yet, one of the most confusing aspects is the fact that midkine, a ligand, is expressed in the epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be signalling to another cell type. Or do the authors propose that midkine is signaling in an autocrine fashion? This should be explained. I also think it is a bit misleading that some of the strongest in situ signal for midkine comes from the stump tissue, which is not discussed. The high in situ signal for midkine in the stump tissue is also at timepoints (7 and 14days post amputation) that are later than the authors transcriptomic analysis (0 and 5 dpa).</p><p>The authors only briefly discuss the possibility of a role for midkine in immune cell function at the very end of the Discussion section. “Alternatively, it is also possible that <italic>mk</italic> may directly modulate the immune system&quot; To my mind, this seems like the most logical conclusion that there is some immune-epithelial crosstalk mediated in part by midkine.</p><p>I think some possible revisions that could illuminate this would be:</p><p>– Does ectopic expression of midkine result in elevated monocytes or recruit immune cells? This should be done in a regenerating context as well as in intact limbs (injection of the constructs into non-regenerating tissue). Likewise, looking at monocyte numbers in the author's already-generated ectopic expression tissue (Figure 7) might give them some clues.</p><p>– Grafting experiments between <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> and wildtype animals. Taking advantage of one of the key aspects of the axolotl system, the authors could transplant epithelial tissue between a <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> animal and wildtype host animal (perhaps GFP+). This would inform you if 1) WT epithelia is sufficient to rescue the regeneration delay in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> animals, and 2) if only lacking MK expression in the epithelia can lead to the same phenotypes (limited proliferation, increased apoptosis) observed in the completely null animal. I think this could go a long way toward proving the essential nature of midkine for AEC development.</p><p>– Does ablation of macrophages by chlodronate liposomes also inhibit midkine expression similarly to skin flap suture?</p><p>– Do midkine-disrupted animals form a proper wound epidermis without a basement membrane or is it similar to the full skin flap suture? Deposition of collagens along the wound epidermis was also observed after macrophage depletion (Godwin et al., 2013) and this could link midkine and regeneration phenotype observed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a significant study which introduces Midkine as a new player in the development of the wound epidermis, a critical signaling center for salamander limb regeneration. As such, it would be of interest to researchers studying regeneration, development and related topics. Nevertheless, there are a few issues to consider prior to the publication of this work:</p><p>– In order to substantiate that the phenotypes observed following chemical and genetic <italic>mk</italic> perturbation are due to the specific loss of <italic>mk</italic> -particularly given the discrepancies of phenotypes observed between <italic>mk</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and iMDK-, a rescue experiment (eg overexpression of <italic>mk</italic> through electroporation in KO -expected to rescue- or iMDK-treated animals -expected not to rescue if the treatment is sustained-) should be conducted.</p><p>– To discard non-specific effects of CRIPR targeting, data from animals generated with a second gRNA (targeting a different site) should be presented.</p><p>– The authors show that iMDK treatment does not affect innervation, but does <italic>mk</italic> expression itself depend on innervation? This should be address by presenting <italic>mk</italic> analysis in denervated vs innervated limb blastemas.</p><p>– The authors focus on the role of MK during the expansion of the wound epidermis into the AEC, however they do not touch on the possible roles of MK itself in the blastema (notably, <italic>prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells display substantial MK expression, and loss of MK leads to increased inflammation in the entire regenerate, which could significantly impact blastema cell behaviour). This should be discussed and supported by data whenever possible. For example, EdU and TUNEL data should be shown for blastema progenitors, not just for the wound epidermis, as <italic>mk</italic> is also expressed in blastemal <italic>prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> connective tissue.</p><p>– Furthermore, they fail to explore a possible dynamic interaction between the wound epidermis and blastema cells through MK: this is evident on Figure 8, where MK receptors <italic>sdc-1</italic> and <italic>ptprz</italic> are expressed at different times in either the wep and/or blastema cells. At 7dpa, it seems that <italic>ptprz</italic> is expressed in blastema cells exclusively (also, <italic>sdc-1</italic> is expressed in blastema cells at 14dpa but not at 7dpa) and could represent an example of paracrine interaction where MK secreted by the wound epidermis affects blastema cells. Unfortunately, these issues are neither explored nor discussed, but are important in order to understand MK function.</p><p>– In this connection, it would be helpful to add additional timepoints between 1 and 3 dpa in Figure 2 in order to define whether <italic>mk</italic> expression comes first in the wound epidermis, in connective tissue cells, or in both at the same time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Tsai et al. use elegant techniques to identify genes expressed in the wound epidermis during regeneration. They identify midkine as a potential regulator of limb regeneration initiation.</p><p>The results are potentially interesting but I have concerns over the interpretation of some results.</p><p>1) The main results are that inhibition of midkine results in a loss of regeneration due to a loss of maintenance of proliferation. However in the CRISPR knockout the blastema still forms, it is smaller. Another possibility that is not considered is that cell division still proceeds but is slower. If the CRISPR regenerations are examined after much longer time periods does it complete regeneration?</p><p>2) In situ hybridization and immune identifies midkine to be expressed in blastema cells, which are also prxx positive, the interpretation is that 60% of the midkine positive cells are &quot;connective tissue blastema cells&quot;. The authors need to look at other markers of cell types that contribute to the blastema like dermal fibroblasts (vimentin), satellite cells(<italic>Pax7</italic>). Figure 1A shows midkine expression in uninjured cells, what cells are these, maybe satellite cells?</p><p>3) Figure 7H claims that overexpression of midkine results in increased proliferation of wound epidermis cells, however in the figure it is clear that the Edu positive cells are in the blastema not the wound epidermis.</p><p>4) In what cells is midkine overexpressed? What percentage of the cells in the blastema is it overexpressed?</p><p>5) Can overexpression of midkine rescue the CRISPR knockout phenotype.</p><p>6) Are the limbs of the CRISPR knockout animal the same size as a wild type control and does the embryo develop at the same rate. A figure should be included to show these data.</p><p>7) The Discussion focuses a lot on the potential interplay between midkine and the immune system, although the RNA seq data suggests this there is very little data in the paper to support this. Does the overexpression of midkine then have an effect on the number of monocytes present or only on cell proliferation? The Discussion should be modified to reflect more the data present in the paper and then put in the broader context of regeneration</p><p>8) There is data from the zebrafish field on the role of midkine in retina regeneration this should be referred to in the Discussion.</p><p>9) In general the N for a lot of experiments is very low, in some animal experiments the N=4, which means the data are not statistically relevant. The n should be increased to a minimum of 10 for all animal experiments.</p><p>10) The Material and methods section is incomplete, RNAscope is used for several figure but there is no methods for it included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50765.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I think some possible revisions that could illuminate this would be-</p><p>– Does ectopic expression of midkine result in elevated monocytes or recruit immune cells?

We performed additional experiments to address this point. We found that ectopic expression of midkine in a regenerating context also led to an elevated density of monocytes. While control tdT-overexpressing limbs exhibited a significant decrease in the number of monocytes, from 6 -16 dpa, <italic>mk</italic>-overexpressing limbs showed consistently high level of monocytes, indicating aberrantly high levels of <italic>mk</italic> can induce persistent inflammation. These additional data have now been included in Figure 7K-M. We also performed <italic>mk</italic> overexpression experiments in intact limbs and saw no difference in proliferation or monocyte density, suggesting <italic>mk</italic> overexpression in this context is not sufficient to regulate these processes during homeostasis. The data from these experiments are described in the manuscript and presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 4. Altogether, these data provide supportive evidence that <italic>mk</italic> levels must be tightly regulated for proper resolution of inflammation during regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Grafting experiments between mk-<sup>null</sup> and wildtype animals.

On this note, we had originally thought about conducting this exact experiment, however we decided for several reasons that the results from grafting experiments would be confounding. Grafting just the wound epidermis alone is technically difficult and has a very low success rate. To perform this experiment in the most reproducible manner, we would instead graft a cuff of full thickness skin from a <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutant to a wildtype intact limb and vice versa, then amputate through the graft and observe regeneration. Grafting full thickness skin would also include <italic>prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> dermal fibroblasts that highly express <italic>mk</italic> and are major contributors to the blastema (Kragl et al., 2009, Gerber et al., 2018). Therefore, if we observed normal wound epidermis expansion when grafting wildtype epithelia onto mutant limbs, we could not conclude that the rescue in phenotype was due to the presence of <italic>mk</italic> in only the epithelia. While performing this grafting experiment could not directly address the question posed, we did agree that this was an important issue. Therefore, we asked the converse question of whether <italic>mk</italic> derived from stump tissues is sufficient to rescue the mutant phenotypes. To do this, we exploited the fact that electroporating constructs into the limb epidermis is difficult and only occurs at extremely low efficiency (Fei et al., 2016). We performed a rescue experiment, in which we overexpressed either tdTomato (as a control) and/or <italic>mk</italic> in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants. As expected, the majority of <italic>mk</italic> was expressed and secreted from regenerating stump tissues as can be seen in Figure 6—figure supplement 3. Overexpression of <italic>mk</italic> in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants was sufficient to rescue the delayed regeneration, AEC developmental defects (thin wound epidermis/high cell death), and high monocyte density. These data altogether suggest 1) that the wound epidermis is responsive to <italic>mk</italic> secreted from non-epithelial sources and 2) that <italic>mk</italic> from stump tissues is capable of signaling to the wound epidermis and likely vice versa. These additional data can be found in Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does ablation of macrophages by chlodronate liposomes also inhibit midkine expression similarly to skin flap suture?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question to explore. In response, we attempted a small pilot experiment in a collaborative effort with Dr. Nicholas Leigh, a postdoctoral fellow in the Whited lab. The original dosage in Godwin et al., 2013, used 12.5 mg/kg and we therefore bracketed this using 2x, 1x, 0.5x mg/kg. Each condition had three animals (1 control, 2 experimental). Unfortunately, in our hands, treatment with clodronate caused severe edema at all three doses which we presumed was due to cytotoxicity associated with the clodronate and/or opportunistic infections in both the regenerating and intact hindlimbs of depleted animals. As a result, many animals had to be euthanized. These cytotoxic effects precluded the interpretation of the results on <italic>mk</italic> expression (data not shown) and the optimization of this method extends beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, we do agree this is a possibility and have added this as a future direction in the Discussion (paragraph seven).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do midkine-disrupted animals form a proper wound epidermis without a basement membrane or is it similar to the full skin flap suture? Deposition of collagens along the wound epidermis was also observed after macrophage depletion (Godwin et al., 2013) and this could link midkine and regeneration phenotype observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Picro-mallory staining of the wound epidermis/AEC in both iMDK- and <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants indicates a lack of a basement membrane similar to a normal wound epidermis (Figure 4D’ and G’, absence of blue collagen staining at the basal surface of the wound epidermis). On the other hand, picro-mallory staining of the full skin flap sutured limbs shows a clear blue collagen thick basement membrane and dermal layer (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B’). Therefore, <italic>mk</italic>-disrupted animals appear to form a proper wound epidermis with regards to this aspect. Furthermore, the basement membrane and blue collagen thick dermal layer could be seen re-forming at the amputation plane in iMDK-treated limbs much later at 40 dpa (now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1), providing further evidence for its absence during earlier stages when AEC development normally occurs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>– In order to substantiate that the phenotypes observed following chemical and genetic mk perturbation are due to the specific loss of mk -particularly given the discrepancies of phenotypes observed between mk-/- and iMDK-, a rescue experiment (eg overexpression of mk through electroporation in KO -expected to rescue- or iMDK-treated animals -expected not to rescue if the treatment is sustained-) should be conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree that this is an important point to address given the difference in phenotypes between iMDK treatment and <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants. As such, we performed a rescue experiment in which we overexpressed <italic>mk</italic> in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants beginning at 3 dpa (the time point when <italic>mk</italic> exhibits strong induction). Overexpression of <italic>mk</italic>, but not tdTomato (as a control), in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants was sufficient to rescue the associated phenotypes including delayed regeneration, defective AEC development (thin wound epidermis and higher cell death), as well as high monocyte density associated with persistent inflammation. We believe that these additional data (which can be found in Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3) provide strong evidence that <italic>mk</italic> indeed regulates both AEC development and the resolution of inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To discard non-specific effects of CRIPR targeting, data from animals generated with a second gRNA (targeting a different site) should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>While targeting <italic>mk</italic> with a second gRNA against a different site would provide additional evidence to reinforce our conclusions, we believe that the correlation of phenotypes between two independent loss-of-function methods (chemical and genetic) in our study provides sufficient evidence for our claims. Additionally, our <italic>mk</italic> rescue experiment in the mutant further supports our conclusions that the phenotypes we observed were indeed due to <italic>mk</italic> deficiency and not off-target effects of CRISPR. Together, we believe these data are sufficient to support our conclusions that <italic>mk</italic> is a regulator of AEC development and inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors show that iMDK treatment does not affect innervation, but does mk expression itself depend on innervation? This should be address by presenting mk analysis in denervated vs innervated limb blastemas.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. We have taken advantage of a previous published microarray dataset in both innervated and denervated regenerating axolotl limbs to answer this question. The data from this study determined that <italic>mk</italic> was up-regulated at a similar fold change in both innervated and denervated limbs indicating its upregulation is independent of innervation. We have now included this commentary in the Results (paragraph three in subsection “Mk loss-of-function leads to impaired AEC development and persistent inflammation”) along with referencing the appropriate study (Monaghan et al., 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors focus on the role of MK during the expansion of the wound epidermis into the AEC, however they do not touch on the possible roles of MK itself in the blastema (notably, prrx1<sup>+</sup> cells display substantial MK expression, and loss of MK leads to increased inflammation in the entire regenerate, which could significantly impact blastema cell behaviour). This should be discussed and supported by data whenever possible. For example, EdU and TUNEL data should be shown for blastema progenitors, not just for the wound epidermis, as mk is also expressed in blastemal prrx1<sup>+</sup> connective tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and have conducted additional analyses on blastemal cell death and proliferation in iMDK-treated and <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> regenerating limbs. While we did observe decreased proliferation and persistently higher levels of cell death in blastemal cells of iMDK-treated limbs, we did not observe differences in blastemal cell proliferation or death in <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants. These experimental data are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Together, these data suggest that <italic>mk</italic> is not required for blastemal cell proliferation or cell survival. Alternatively, the discrepancies in the phenotypes could be attributed to off target effects of the inhibitor, which we state and elaborate on in the Discussion (paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Furthermore, they fail to explore a possible dynamic interaction between the wound epidermis and blastema cells through MK: this is evident on Figure 8, where MK receptors sdc-1 and ptprz are expressed at different times in either the wep and/or blastema cells. At 7dpa, it seems that ptprz is expressed in blastema cells exclusively (also, sdc-1 is expressed in blastema cells at 14dpa but not at 7dpa) and could represent an example of paracrine interaction where MK secreted by the wound epidermis affects blastema cells. Unfortunately, these issues are neither explored nor discussed, but are important in order to understand MK function.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the initial <italic>ptprz</italic> in situ at 7 dpa was misleading. The strong blue signal shown in the stump tissues was non-specific background staining from the fibrin clot at the amputation plane. We have included new in situs at 7 dpa for <italic>ptprz</italic> that more clearly demonstrate low expression of <italic>ptprz</italic> (dark blue puncta) throughout the wound epidermis with minimal background staining in the clot (Figure 8C). This was also validated by single cell RNA-seq expression data from Leigh et al., 2018 (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). That said, we thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and agree that a more extensive analysis and discussion of the potential signaling mechanisms of <italic>mk</italic> was needed to put the findings in this study into a broader regenerative context.</p><p>We have now included a more comprehensive analysis of the expression of midkine receptors in our dataset as well as publicly available single cell data (Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1). We find overlapping and non-overlapping expression patterns for <italic>mk</italic> receptors and <italic>mk</italic>, indicating <italic>mk</italic> is capable of both autocrine and paracrine signaling. Furthermore, we find the expression of multiple <italic>mk</italic> receptors in the wound epidermis, indicating <italic>mk</italic> likely directly binds to and regulates wound epidermis/AEC development. However, by mining the higher resolution single cell data, we were surprised to find that <italic>mk</italic> receptors were largely detected at low levels or not detected at all in myeloid cell populations, with the exception of integrin β 1. These data bring forth the possibilities that <italic>mk</italic> may: 1) directly regulate myeloid cell populations through the low expression of these or as of yet unidentified receptors, 2) indirectly regulate inflammation via signaling through other tissues, or 3) modulate inflammation through both. Given the <italic>mk</italic> receptor expression data, we speculate in the Discussion that <italic>mk</italic> is likely regulating the resolution of inflammation through both mechanisms and elaborate on how our functional and transcriptional data suggest that the wound epidermis may be an example of one tissue that may indirectly mediate resolution of inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In this connection, it would be helpful to add additional timepoints between 1 and 3 dpa in Figure 2 in order to define whether mk expression comes first in the wound epidermis, in connective tissue cells, or in both at the same time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more in-depth analysis of the onset of <italic>mk</italic> expression in regenerating tissues would provide important clues as to the dynamics of <italic>mk</italic> signaling. In response, we have now included an additional timepoint, 56 hours post-amputation (hpa), and high magnification images of <italic>mk</italic> expression in both the wound epidermis and stump tissues at 24, 56, and 72 hpa demonstrating that <italic>mk</italic> is first expressed in cells within regenerating stump tissues prior to the wound epidermis (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). These data therefore suggest that <italic>mk</italic> expression in the wound epidermis may first be induced through paracrine signaling from <italic>mk</italic> and/or other extracellular molecules in regenerating stump tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The main results are that inhibition of midkine results in a loss of regeneration due to a loss of maintenance of proliferation. However in the CRISPR knockout the blastema still forms, it is smaller. Another possibility that is not considered is that cell division still proceeds but is slower. If the CRISPR regeneration are examined after much longer time periods does it complete regeneration?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and now include data indicating that the <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants do not exhibit defects in blastemal cell proliferation, indicating <italic>mk</italic> is likely not required for blastemal cell division. The <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants do regenerate anatomically normal limbs, although delayed and we have now included time-lapse imaging in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to demonstrate the delay in mutants compared to wildtype and <italic>mk</italic>-rescued animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In situ hybridization and immune identifies midkine to be expressed in blastema cells, which are also prxx positive, the interpretation is that 60% of the midkine positive cells are &quot;connective tissue blastema cells&quot;. The authors need to look at other markers of cell types that contribute to the blastema like dermal fibroblasts (vimentin), satellite cells(Pax7). Figure 1A shows midkine expression in uninjured cells, what cells are these, maybe satellite cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue and have conducted a more detailed double in situ hybridization analysis to identify the cell types that express <italic>mk</italic> during homeostasis and regeneration. The analysis shows that the majority of <italic>mk</italic>-expressing cells are <italic>pax7<sup>+</sup></italic> satellite cells and <italic>pecam<sup>+</sup></italic> endothelial cells, in addition to <italic>prrx1<sup>+</sup></italic> connective tissue cells, in both intact and regenerating tissues. We quantified the breakdown of cell types expressing <italic>mk</italic> in regenerating stump tissues and included representative images of <italic>mk</italic> double in situs in both intact and regenerating tissues (3, 7, and 24 dpa). In intact tissues, connective tissue cells, satellite cells, and endothelial cells comprised approximately 43.8%, 44.9% and 7.7% of <italic>mk</italic>-expressing cells in stump tissues, respectively. During regeneration, the majority of <italic>mk</italic>-expressing cells were connective tissue cells (~53-54%) and satellite cells (~36-37%) at 3 and 7 dpa. A smaller percentage (~4-5%) of <italic>mk</italic>-expressing cells were endothelial cells at both time points. These data are now included in the study and can be found in Figure 2H-I and in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7H claims that overexpression of midkine results in increased proliferation of wound epidermis cells, however in the figure it is clear that the Edu positive cells are in the blastema not the wound epidermis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this was unclear in the figure. The EdU+ cells are indeed in the wound epidermis as outlined in the dotted yellow lines in each panel of Figure 7I. At 8 dpa, a blastema has not formed in both tdT- and <italic>mk</italic>-overexpressing limbs (this time point is pre-blastema formation). Furthermore, additional quantification of EdU+ cells in the regenerating stump tissues revealed a significant decrease, not increase in proliferation of blastemal cells at 8 and 16 dpa. The additional data quantifying proliferation in blastemal cells is shown in Figure 7J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In what cells is midkine overexpressed? What percentage of the cells in the blastema is it overexpressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Overexpression of constructs via electroporation in axolotl limbs predominantly results in expression in stump tissues, as the electroporation into the epithelial tissues is difficult and occurs at exceedingly low efficiencies. The most obvious expression can be seen in myofibers, however other cell types can also uptake constructs through electroporation (Fei et al., 2016). We have included representative images of tdTomato staining in both our <italic>mk</italic> overexpression experiment during regeneration and our newly added <italic>mk</italic> rescue experiment in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3, respectively. In both experiments, quantification showed that up to 20% of cells constitutively expressed tdTomato or <italic>mk</italic>. We also show equivalent efficiencies by both cell quantification and mean fluorescence intensity across control and experimental conditions as supportive control data to discount the possibility that the phenotypic effects were due to varying electroporation efficiencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can overexpression of midkine rescue the CRISPR knockout phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point and have now included data indicating that overexpression of <italic>mk</italic> beginning at 3 dpa in our <italic>mk</italic><sup>null</sup> mutants is sufficient to rescue the delayed regeneration, AEC developmental defects (thin wound epidermis and higher cell death), as well as higher monocyte density.

Does the overexpression of midkine then have an effect on the number of monocytes present or only on cell proliferation? The Discussion should be modified to reflect more the data present in the paper and then put in the broader context of regeneration</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional evidence is needed to support these claims. As such, we now include data showing that overexpression of <italic>mk</italic> during regeneration leads to consistently higher monocyte density compared to control limbs, indicative of chronic inflammation (Figure 7K-M). Together with the loss-of-function data, these data show that mk levels need to be tightly maintained to proper modulate the resolution of inflammation. We also present additional data showing that <italic>mk</italic> overexpression leads to decreased blastemal cell proliferation despite seeing the opposite effects in the wound epidermis (Figure 7J). We have expanded the Discussion section to incorporate all of these data into the broader context of the roles of <italic>mk</italic> in regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There is data from the zebrafish field on the role of midkine in retina regeneration this should be referred to in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention and have now included the relevant references in the Discussion (paragraph six) (Gramage et al., 2015, Nagashima et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In general the N for a lot of experiments is very low, in some animal experiments the N=4, which means the data are not statistically relevant.
