How this transition is operated in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we report that MEK1 and the Nanog-related transcription factor Ventx2 coordinate this transition. MEK1 was required to make <italic>Xenopus</italic> pluripotent cells competent to respond to all cell fate inducers tested. Importantly, MEK1 activity was necessary to clear the pluripotency protein Ventx2 at the onset of gastrulation. Thus, concomitant MEK1 and Ventx2 knockdown restored the competence of embryonic cells to differentiate. Strikingly, MEK1 appeared to control the asymmetric inheritance of Ventx2 protein following cell division. Consistently, when Ventx2 lacked a functional PEST-destruction motif, it was stabilized, displayed symmetric distribution during cell division and could efficiently maintain pluripotency gene expression over time. We suggest that asymmetric clearance of pluripotency regulators may represent an important mechanism to ensure the progressive assembly of primitive embryonic tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21526.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21526.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>xenopus</kwd><kwd>MEK1</kwd><kwd>asymmetric division</kwd><kwd>Ventx</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEQ20141231765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodjabachian</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20141201815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodjabachian</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012-108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodjabachian</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Degradation and asymmetric inheritance during cell division of a core pluripotency regulator contributes to lineage commitment in the early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How embryonic pluripotent cells can maintain an uncommitted state as well as an unrestricted potential for multi-lineage commitment is a key and unresolved question in developmental and stem cell biology. Therefore, studying in vivo the links between factors that oppositely regulate pluripotency should help to better understand the transitory nature of this state during embryogenesis and its resumption in several human diseases. In mammals, epiblast cells of the developing blastula embryo appear to transit through a series of pluripotent states until gastrulation, which signs the global extinction of pluripotency and the rise of cell competence to somatically commit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>). In amphibians, cells of the blastula animal hemisphere are somatically pluripotent, and their broad potential is globally lost at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Snape et al., 1987</xref>). Studies in vivo have been useful to characterize the core regulatory network of pluripotency, and to reveal its degree of conservation and plasticity during vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morrison and Brickman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boroviak et al., 2015</xref>). In vertebrates, the pluripotency regulatory network is centered on the Pou-V class of transcription factors (also referred as Oct4). Pou-V members <italic>Pou5f3</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> share functional homology in regulating the uncommitted state of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Livigni et al., 2013</xref>) and in reprogramming somatic cells to induced-Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tapia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). Nanog has been discovered as a key component of pluripotency networks in both mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and pre-implantation epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, phylogenetic, biochemical and functional analyses suggest that the role of Nanog in pluripotency is not conserved in all vertebrates, as the <italic>Nanog</italic> gene is absent in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scerbo et al., 2014</xref>) and teleostean <italic>Nanog</italic> does not support pluripotency during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scerbo et al., 2014</xref>). Recent analyses on <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish embryos suggest that Ventx transcription factors, belonging to the same NK family as Nanog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scerbo et al., 2014</xref>), act as guardians of pluripotency during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Ventx factors integrate the pluripotency network by coordinating and maintaining the activity of Pou-V factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2004</xref>), and by regulating cell response to TGF-β/Smad pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu and Kirschner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2004</xref>). However, how the pluripotency network evolves to authorize the expression of lineage-specific genes in lower vertebrates is poorly understood. Pluripotency is maintained by a complex gene regulatory network associated with a specific epigenetic state both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>). Several studies revealed the importance of transcriptional and epigenetic silencing of pluripotency-related genes during the process of cell commitment, which ultimately allows the transcriptional activation of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>). Based on in vitro studies, the regulation of pluripotency factor stability and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spelat et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic and membrane-bound determinants during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Habib et al., 2013</xref>), are also expected to significantly contribute to pluripotency destabilization. However, whether such mechanisms are important during vertebrate embryogenesis remains to be addressed. Studies in mammalian embryos have suggested that MEK1 (<italic>Map2k1</italic>), an upstream component of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, could represent an intrinsic determinant of the ephemeral and transitory nature of the pluripotency state in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boroviak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>). Further support to this idea comes from the reported stabilization in a pluripotent state of mammalian ESCs in vitro by media that include inhibitors of MEK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hackett and Surani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>). MEK1 activity can negatively regulate both the expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boroviak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boroviak and Nichols, 2014</xref>) and the stability in vitro of Nanog and Pou5f1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spelat et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo also represents an attractive model to address how MEK1 controls pluripotency exit in vivo, as the importance of the MAPK pathway for the competence of embryonic cells to differentiate has long been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaBonne et al., 1995</xref>). Activation of the MAPK ERK1, resulting from phosphorylation by MEK1, is known to occur at early blastula stages, primarily in the pluripotent cells of the animal and marginal zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curran and Grainger, 2000</xref>). Multiple studies revealed that FGF-mediated ERK1 activation is necessary for the competence of animal blastula cells to respond to mesoderm and neural inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornell and Kimelman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaune et al., 2005</xref>). However, the existence of a direct link between the MAPK pathway and pluripotency during <italic>Xenopus</italic> development has never been tested. In this study, we reveal that MEK1 is required for embryonic cell competence to respond to differentiation cues, acting against the expression, distribution and stability of the pluripotency regulator Ventx2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MEK1 is required for cell competence to differentiate</title><p>To examine the role of MEK1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, we depleted it through injection of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs). We designed two independent MOs, in the 5'UTR (Mk-MO), and at the ATG (Mk-MO ATG), which both inhibited MEK1 translation and antagonized development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1A</xref>). As Mk-MO proved more efficient, we used it for most experiments in this study, unless stated otherwise. Mk-MO did not up-regulate <italic>p53</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1B</xref>), unlike the non-specific response triggered by some MOs in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robu et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, a wild-type form of MEK1 from hamster efficiently rescued mesoderm and neural specification, as well as early morphogenesis, in Mk morphant embryos, indicating that MEK1 knockdown was specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–1C and D</xref>). We found that MEK1 activity was required for the expression of multiple neural and non-neural ectoderm, as well as mesoderm markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–2A and B</xref>). In contrast, MEK1 activity was found to be dispensable for the expression of endoderm markers and of immediate-early targets of the BMP and Nodal pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–2C and D</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of the epidermal markers <italic>dlx3</italic>, <italic>gata2</italic> and <italic>xk81a1</italic> was reduced in MEK1 morphants, despite the maintained expression of the epidermal inducer <italic>bmp4</italic>. These results suggested that MEK1 was broadly required for multi-lineage commitment of pluripotent cells of the animal hemisphere. To further test this possibility, we examined the differentiation potential of embryonic cells depleted of MEK1 in response to exogenous inducers. Consistent with our hypothesis, recombinant BMP4, NODAL, and NOGGIN proteins induced efficient expression of epidermal, mesodermal and neural markers, respectively, in wild-type but not in MEK1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Likewise, BMP signaling inhibition, obtained by injection of dominant-negative Smad5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchal et al., 2009</xref>), caused neural induction in wild-type embryos, but not in Mk-MO ATG morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2–1</xref>). To directly assess the importance of MEK1 in the competence of pluripotent cells to respond to inducers, we exposed explanted animal ectoderm to the soluble factors described above. Whereas multiple epidermal, neural, mesodermal and endodermal markers were induced by BMP4, NOGGIN, low and high doses of NODAL, respectively, these responses were all abolished in the presence of Mk-MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The impaired ability of MEK1-deficient cells to engage into differentiation could be linked to mis-regulation of pluripotency genes. RT-qPCR analysis on early gastrula embryos revealed that the expression of <italic>pou5f3.1</italic> (<italic>oct91</italic>), <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> (<italic>oct25</italic>), <italic>ventx1</italic> and <italic>ventx2</italic> was significantly up-regulated in MEK1-depleted embryos, whereas no detectable effect was measured on <italic>sox3</italic> and <italic>cdh1</italic> (E-cadherin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>ventx2</italic> and <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> are initially expressed throughout the pluripotent animal hemisphere and are restricted to non-neural ectoderm and floor plate at late gastrulation, respectively, reflecting the progressive engagement of embryonic cells into differentiation. In contrast, these two genes remained ubiquitously expressed in MEK1 morphants at late gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Likewise, targeted injection of Mk-MO in dorsal or ventral ectoderm confirmed that <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> and <italic>ventx2</italic> expression failed to be silenced, even when morphogenesis was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2–2A</xref>). Strikingly, the maintenance of <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> expression in MEK1 morphants was still visible at mid-neurula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2–2B</xref>). Furthermore, gene expression analysis of MEK1-depleted animal ectoderm explants at the end of gastrulation revealed a significantly higher expression of <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> and <italic>ventx2</italic> with a concomitant reduction of the lineage-restricted markers <italic>xk81a1</italic>, <italic>itln1</italic> and <italic>α-tub</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2–2C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that embryonic cells need MEK1 activity to exit pluripotency and engage into lineage-specific programs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21526.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MEK1 depletion impairs embryonic development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mk-MO and Mk-MO ATG were designed to target MEK1 translation.

Western blot analysis of embryos injected with RNA encoding Myc-tagged Ventx2 confirmed the reported degradation after the onset of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, in MEK1 morphants, Ventx2-Myc remained detectable up until mid-gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we analyzed Ventx2-Myc distribution on sectioned blastula and gastrula embryos by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. We found that MEK1 knockdown dramatically increased the number of Ventx2-Myc positive cells at both stages, when compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Careful inspection of blastula cells dividing along the animal-vegetal (apical-basal) axis of the tissue revealed that Ventx2-Myc was asymmetrically distributed in daughter cells in control but not in MEK1 morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In addition, a significant fraction of MEK1-depleted cells displayed Ventx2-Myc signal in the membrane cortex at both stages analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). At blastula stage, Ventx2-Myc membrane association was polarized with respect to the plane of the tissue, with a clear basal enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). No attempt was made at characterizing further the cortical localization of Ventx2. Altogether, our data reveal that MEK1 is required for Ventx2 asymmetric distribution during blastula cell division, and participates in developmentally regulated clearance of this protein in pluripotent embryonic cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21526.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MEK1 is required for Ventx2 clearance and asymmetric distribution during cell division.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Four-cell embryos were injected in each cell with 50 pg GFP-CAAX, 50 pg Ventx2-Myc, 50 pg 2SAVentx2-Myc RNAs, and 25 ng Mk-MO, as indicated.

To further evaluate this possibility, we injected a mutant form of Ventx2 lacking the functional PEST destruction motif. This stable form of Ventx2 was obtained through the substitution of two key serine residues (140 and 144) with alanine (2SAVentx2-Myc) and was demonstrated to be more efficient than the native form of Ventx2 in counteracting mesendoderm induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu and Kirschner, 2002</xref>). As predicted, 2SAVentx2-Myc was detectable in the nuclei of control cells, similar to Ventx2-Myc in MEK1 morphant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, no marked asymmetric distribution of 2SAVentx2-Myc in daughter nuclei of dividing blastula cells was observed, suggesting that phosphorylation of the PEST motif is necessary to control Ventx2 asymmetric distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Similarly to Ventx2-Myc in MEK-1 deficient cells, 2SAVentx2-Myc was detectable in the cortex of injected cells, particularly at gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we combined anti-Myc and γ-tubulin staining to mark the centrosomes, so as to be able to distinguish mitotic phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Ventx2-Myc localized into the nuclei of blastula cells in prophase and MEK1 depletion did not affect this localization. Similarly, 2SAVentx2-Myc co-localized with chromosomes during prophase. Ventx2 is a phosphomitotic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stukenberg et al., 1997</xref>), and it has been proposed that phosphorylation is required for disengagement of transcription factors from chromosomes in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stukenberg et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, Ventx2-Myc was no longer associated with metaphasic chromosomes but rather with mitotic spindles. Interestingly, this change in distribution of Ventx2-Myc was independent from MEK1 activity or from the PEST destruction motif. Upon engagement into cytokinesis, the asymmetry of Ventx2-Myc in daughter nuclei became apparent. Quantification of signals intensity revealed that in control condition, one daughter nucleus contained on average 6.454 fold more Ventx2-Myc than the other daughter nucleus (s.e.m. ±0.5479), whereas this difference was significantly dampened in MEK1-deficient cells (mean ratios = 1.092; s.e.m. ±0.0447) and in 2SAVentx2-Myc injected cells (mean ratios = 1.910; s.e.m. ±0.1319)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the stabilization of exogenous Ventx2 through either MEK1 depletion or PEST motif mutation led to its symmetric distribution upon cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ventx2 inhibition by MEK1 is required for embryonic cell commitment</title><p>Our data indicate that Ventx2 expression, distribution and stability depend on MEK1 activity in vivo, raising the possibility of a causal relationship between the refractory behaviour of MEK1-depleted cells to differentiation and the activity of Ventx2.

This result suggests that 2SAVentx2-Myc has become resistant to degradation induced by MEK1 and can efficiently maintain pluripotency and antagonize commitment in the presence of active MEK1. To test the functional importance of the antagonism between MEK1 and Ventx2 in the transition from pluripotent to committed states, we combined Mk-MO with Ventx2 MO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>).

Specifically, MEK1 activity counteracts Ventx2 activity, both at transcriptional and post-translational levels, which ensures the transition from refractory to responsive states of embryonic cells. In pluripotent blastula cells, MEK1 is necessary for asymmetric distribution of Ventx2 during cell division, generating Ventx2 positive and negative daughter nuclei. By promoting early heterogeneous distribution together with developmentally regulated nuclear clearance of Ventx2, we propose that MEK1 is a fundamental cue for pluripotency state extinction in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first reported regulatory mechanism that correlates the asymmetric distribution and stability of a transcription factor with cell pluripotency in vertebrate embryos. Although we used exogenous Ventx2 tagged proteins to reveal this mechanism, the rescue of cell differentiation in double MEK1/Ventx2 morphants suggests that endogenous Ventx2 is under the same control. Our data are consistent with a recent finding, whereby the Wnt/β-catenin pathway orients asymmetric cell division of mESCs and generates unequal distribution of pluripotency factors, which impacts on cell potency in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Habib et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How does MEK1 regulate Ventx2 asymmetry and stability in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic cells? Ventx2 phosphorylation in the PEST motif was shown to be required for ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu and Kirschner, 2002</xref>). Thus, our observation that mutation of the Ventx2 PEST motif prevents unequal distribution in daughter nuclei suggests that the asymmetric distribution of Ventx2 during mitosis and proteasome activity may be related. In the simplest scenario, MEK1 may act directly or through MAPK to phosphorylate the Ventx2 PEST motif and promote Ventx2 proteolysis. Supporting this hypothesis, the MAPK ERK1 is a known regulator of pluripotency factor stability in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spelat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), and MAPK is predicted to phosphorylate one of the key serine residues in the Ventx2 PEST domain. We note, however, that MEK1 depletion caused stronger responses than 2SAVentx2 injection, suggesting that MEK1 regulates pluripotency through additional residues in Ventx2 and/or through additional effectors. Interestingly, the BMP signal mediator Smad1 was also found to be asymmetrically distributed during somatic cell division, when marked for degradation by MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>). There, phosphorylation by MAPK triggers a subsequent phosphorylation event by GSK3, followed by polyubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation of activated Smad1, leading to BMP signal termination. In contrast, we did not find evidence of GSK3 involvement in the repression of pluripotency genes and in Ventx2 degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu and Kirschner, 2002</xref>). Thus, MEK1 may trigger important proteolytic events in early embryos, independently of GSK3. Although it is tempting to think that MEK1 activity itself may be polarized during division of pluripotent embryonic cells, evidence for such mechanism is lacking in the literature. Alternatively, it is possible that MEK1 controls downstream regulators endowed with asymmetric distribution or activity. For instance, ERK1 was shown to antagonize the polarized PAR-1 kinase during asymmetric cell divisions of the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spilker et al., 2009</xref>). Also related to this idea, asymmetric proteasome segregation was shown to control polarized degradation of the phosphorylated transcription factor T-bet during T lymphocyte division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, it remains possible that MEK1 activity would be antagonized by one or several phosphatases that would protect Ventx2 from degradation, and would somehow contribute to its unequal inheritance in daughter nuclei. Such a balance between the PAR-1 kinase and PP2A phosphatase was shown to control the state of PAR-3 phosphorylation and thus the polarity of dividing embryonic neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krahn et al., 2009</xref>). Future work should address the precise mechanism of action of MEK1 upon Ventx2 during division of <italic>Xenopus</italic> pluripotent cells, a question of high relevance to stem cell biology.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we observed that MEK1 depletion caused Ventx2 asymmetric localization in the basal membrane cortex of blastula cells. This localization was not apparent in control cells, suggesting that it does not simply reflect the over-abundance of Ventx2 protein due to synthetic RNA injection. Rather, this suggests that MEK1 actively prevents membrane association of Ventx2. As stabilized 2SAVentx2 also localized at membranes, this territory may represent a storage compartment for Ventx2 protein. Thus, it will be important to evaluate whether the endogenous Ventx2 protein also displays this unexpected localization in normal or MEK1 morphant embryos. The asymmetric localization of Ventx2 at the basal membrane cortex of MEK1 depleted cells suggests possible links between MEK1 and polarity effectors such as PAR-1 and aPKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ossipova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalmers et al., 2003</xref>). In relevance to our observations, it was reported that Pou5f1 and Pou5f3 proteins localize at the cell membrane both in mESCs and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal pole cells, where they form a complex with E-cadherin and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Livigni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faunes et al., 2013</xref>). Since Ventx2 can physically interact with Pou5f3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2004</xref>), we speculate that MEK1 may be required to destabilize the interaction between Ventx2 and Pou5f3, not only in the nucleus but also at the membrane, further enhancing the competence of embryonic cells to exit pluripotency.</p><p>Ventx2 is a <italic>bona fide</italic> marker of pluripotency during <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>), and the above data indicate that its activity must be inhibited for cells to engage into differentiation pathways. However, the link between <italic>Ventx</italic> genes and pluripotency in other vertebrates, particularly in mammals, has not been actively studied. This may reflect the absence of Ventx orthologs in the rodent genus, although a unique <italic>VENTX</italic> gene is present in human (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggest that a <italic>Ventx</italic> gene appeared at the base of gnathostome evolution, and its prototypical genomic locus has not changed for 450 My (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">3</xref>). Human <italic>VENTX</italic> is the ortholog of <italic>Xenopus</italic>, birds, sauropside and coelacanth <italic>Ventx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">4</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study reported a 6-fold up-regulation of <italic>VENTX</italic> (higher than <italic>NANOG</italic>, <italic>PRDM14</italic>, <italic>POU5F1</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic>) in naive hESCs compared to conventional hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, naive hESCs were obtained in the presence of inhibitors of five kinases, including MEK1, suggesting that repression of VENTX by MEK1 may be conserved in human pluripotent cells. Beyond such circumstantial evidence, the next question is whether VENTX is an important regulator of pluripotency in human, as it is in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Initial support for this idea comes from the identification of VENTX in an unbiased functional screen as a positive regulator of <italic>Pou5f1</italic> expression in hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chia et al., 2010</xref>). Together with the results reported here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scerbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>), such evidence certainly grants more detailed analysis regarding the role of VENTX in the human pluripotency network. As VENTX is absent in rodents, we propose that <italic>Xenopus</italic> represents an appropriate and powerful model to undertake comparative approaches with human and shed light on the control mechanisms of pluripotency in vivo and at single cell level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Xenopus</italic> general procedures and micro-injections</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos were obtained from lab-bred adults (Nasco) by in vitro fertilization, de-jellied, injected and cultured in modified Barth’s solution (MBS) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchal et al., 2009</xref>).

The authors show that MEK knockdown results in a failure of mesoderm and ectoderm development, based on marker gene analysis. The authors further provide evidence that MEK acts by negatively regulating the mRNA levels and protein stability of Ventx2. They report that Ventx2 protein localizes to centrosomes during mitosis and is asymmetrically distribute to one daughter cell.

The main weakness is with the conclusion that MEK inhibition and Ventx2 maintain pluripotency in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, which is not very well supported. Although previous reports suggest that Ventx2 might promote pluripotency, this data is not very robust and is built largely on the fact that Ventx2 can repress differentiation based on a limited marker analysis. Many studies over the past 20 years have shown that MEK and Ventx are involved in mesoderm and neuro-ectoderm development (e.g. PMIDs: 7789277, 7541116, 17525737). In the case of MEK this was attributed to the inducing role of FGF, which has not been ruled out here. Given these previous studies the authors need more rigorous, genome wide analysis, showing that what they are observing is not just the known role of MEK and Ventx in specific lineages. A good test of their hypothesis would be to deplete MEK from animal caps and/or embryos and look at ability of BMP, Activin or Wnt to induce any lineages (including endoderm) by RNA-seq or microarray. Then use a more comprehensive markers analysis (in situ or RT-PCR of a broader panel) to test whether combined MEK and Ventx2 depletion restored all the lineages. Without a genome wide analysis, or some functional assay, showing that the cells cannot differentiate into any lineages it is impossible to conclude that the pluripotency to commitment transition is really involved.</p><p>In addition it has already been shown that Ventx2 degradation is promoted GSK3 phosphorylation (PMID:12408807). Since GSK3 has a preference for residues that are primed by MAPK phosphorylation the observation that MEK is required for Ventx2 phosphorylation and degradation is not surprising. In fact the authors should check whether the MEK regulated activity they observe is GSK3-dependent. It is known that Smad1 is phosphorylated by MEK and GSK3, and recruited to the centrosome where it is asymmetrically localized and degraded (PMID:18045539), similar to what is observed here.</p><p>Given the known role of MEK (and GSK-3) as well as <italic>Nanog</italic> in mammalian pluripotency, the model that the authors propose is very attractive. If they could provide more rigorous data to support their claim then this would be an important advance.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Lineage commitment of embryonic cells involves MEK1-dependent clearance of pluripotency regulator Ventx2&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, while animal caps have allowed to reveal the inductive capacities of many signalling pathways and transcription factors, they do not accurately reflect in vivo developmental potential (e.g. PMID: 15590738). In particular, injury due to dissection is known to cause ERK phosphorylation, which could complicate our interpretations. Inconsistencies have also been reported in multiple occasions when comparing mouse ES cells to mouse pre-implantation embryos. Thus, we designed our assays to study fate commitment of pluripotent cells in vivo, which allowed us to draw clear conclusions. 1) MEK1 knockdown prevents natural embryonic inductions, and causes the maintenance of high levels of pluripotency genes Ventx2 and Pou5f3.2. The comparison of small Mk-MO injected clones to wild-type surrounding cells in embryos that underwent normal morphogenesis addresses one of the concerns of our reviewer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also would like to stress that pluripotency gene up-regulation upon MEK1 knockdown in animal caps was reported by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). 2) In intact embryos, MEK1-deficient animal cells do not respond to exogenous inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but differentiation is restored when Ventx2 is concomitantly knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C-E</xref>). At best, we can anticipate the same information to be collected from in vitro animal cap assays. 3) Using intact embryos, we were able to analyse sub-cellular Ventx2 protein distribution in animal cells that maintained a natural tissue polarity, which is known to be lost in animal caps.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>This work explores the role of MEK and the transcription factor Ventx2 (similar to mammalian Nanog) in regulating the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment in Xenopus.

Ventx2 matches this condition, based on several independent reports, and is used by <italic>Xenopus</italic> experts as a marker of the pluripotent cell state (e.g. PMID: 24210613; 25931449). An unbiased screen identified Ventx as a positive regulator of pluripotency in human ESCs (PMID: 20953172). In zebrafish, a Ventx ortholog known as Vox can reprogram embryonic endodermal cells to a pluripotent state (PMID: 23364327). Thus, the link between Ventx genes and pluripotency is based on robust data in multiple models. Likewise, MEK1 is a known inhibitor of pluripotency in ES cells and our data further support this idea. Finally, Oct4 genes are widely accepted as universal markers of pluripotency in vertebrates and we report here that <italic>Xenopus</italic> Pou5f3.2 (one of several Oct4 orthologs) is repressed by MEK1 through Ventx2.</p><p><italic>Many studies over the past 20 years have shown that MEK and Ventx are involved in mesoderm and neuro-ectoderm development (e.g. PMIDs: 7789277, 7541116, 17525737).

What we instead suggest is that when a pluripotent cell is presented with FGF or other RTK ligands, it is able to exit pluripotency and commit to various lineages, depending on the cues it is exposed to. Thus, induction depends on pluripotency exit and these two features are difficult to uncouple. Our work represents a substantial progress in showing that MEK1 knockdown causes the maintenance of two core pluripotency regulators, Ventx2 and <italic>Pou5f3.2</italic>, one of which represents a functional block to differentiation.</p><p><italic>Given these previous studies the authors need more rigorous, genome wide analysis, showing that what they are observing is not just the known role of MEK and Ventx in specific lineages. A good test of their hypothesis would be to deplete MEK from animal caps and/or embryos and look at ability of BMP, Activin or Wnt to induce any lineages (including endoderm) by RNA-seq or microarray. Then use a more comprehensive markers analysis (in situ or RT-PCR of a broader panel) to test whether combined MEK and Ventx2 depletion restored all the lineages. Without a genome wide analysis, or some functional assay, showing that the cells cannot differentiate into any lineages it is impossible to conclude that the pluripotency to commitment transition is really involved.</italic></p><p>Our reviewer suggests to use genome-wide analysis to evaluate lineage induction in MEK1 and MEK1/Ventx2 morphant situations. We feel that this is overshooting. We used few but extremely well characterized early lineage markers to reveal that MEK1 morphant cells become incompetent to respond to inducers of epidermal, neural, mesodermal and endodermal lineages, and regain this capacity when Ventx2 is also inhibited. What matters here is the competence or incompetence of embryonic cells to respond to inducers. This conclusion will be unchanged if genome-wide analysis is applied. What may be revealed by genome-wide analysis is the identity of putative additional pluripotency regulators; however, this is beyond the scope of our study, which focuses on the specific relationship between MEK1 and Ventx2.</p><p><italic>In addition it has already been shown that Ventx2 degradation is promoted GSK3 phosphorylation (PMID:12408807). Since GSK3 has a preference for residues that are primed by MAPK phosphorylation the observation that MEK is required for Ventx2 phosphorylation and degradation is not surprising. In fact the authors should check whether the MEK regulated activity they observe is GSK3-dependent. It is known that Smad1 is phosphorylated by MEK and GSK3, and recruited to the centrosome where it is asymmetrically localized and degraded (PMID:18045539), similar to what is observed here.</italic></p><p>The study that reported Ventx2 (also called Xom) degradation in gastrula embryos actually indicated that GSK3 activity is <italic>not</italic> required for degradation (PMID: 12408807 p561). Thus, the degradation mechanism induced by ERK/GSK3 sequential phosphorylation does not apply to Ventx2.</p><p><italic>Given the known role of MEK (and GSK-3) as well as Nanog in mammalian pluripotency, the model that the authors propose is very attractive. If they could provide more rigorous data to support their claim then this would be an important advance.</italic></p><p>We thank our reviewer for his/her appreciation of our proposed model. We feel, however, that our data are rigorous, notwithstanding the lack of genome-wide analysis.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. I would like to stress that eLife does not normally allow for multiple rounds of review so it is essential that you complete these relatively minor but important revisions or the paper will not be considered further. However, we will understand if you would prefer to withdraw the paper in the event you are not prepared to perform this essential additional work.</italic></p><p><italic>1) RNA encoding the wild type form of MEK1 rescues the MEK1 morpholino phenotype. Seems like a straightforward and necessary experiment that would justify generating the construct.</italic></p><p>To address this request, we injected synthetic mRNA encoding a wild-type version of hamster MEK1 ORF into Mk morphant embryos. There was no overlap between Mk-MO and hamster MEK1 mRNA. To further avoid in vitro non-specific interaction between these two molecules, they were injected separately. Wildtype MEK1 could largely restore gastrulation, as well as axial mesoderm and neurectoderm specification. These results now replace those initially obtained with a constitutively active version of MEK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), and the main text has been modified accordingly (subsection “MEK1 is required for cell competence to differentiate”).</p><p><italic>2) Since it could be done with simple qRT-PCR, it seems important to know whether the Ventx2 morpholino influences the expression of any of the other Ventx genes?</italic></p><p>We have performed this analysis, and present the corresponding results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>. By RT-qPCR, we observed that <italic>ventx1</italic> and <italic>ventx3</italic>, as well as <italic>pou5f3.1</italic> and <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> expression is lower in Ventx2 morphant embryos at gastrula stage, compared to uninjected control embryos. Conversely, the pro-differentiation marker <italic>gsc</italic>, which is a known negative target of Ventx2 (Sander V et al., 2007; Trindade M et al., 1999), was up-regulated. The same conclusion was obtained through whole-mount in situ hybridization of <italic>ventx1</italic> and <italic>gsc</italic>. We conclude that Ventx2 knockdown leads to a global decrease of Ventx gene expression, and probably activity. This new information is now mentioned in the main text (subsection “Ventx2 inhibition by MEK1 is required for embryonic cell commitment”).</p><p><italic>3) Rather than argue the point, the authors should repeat the study on GSK3-MEK interaction as previously suggested (&quot;In fact the authors should check whether the MEK regulated activity they observe is GSK3-dependent.&quot;), as it would both solidify previous conclusions and help define the mechanism reported here.</italic></p><p>To address whether GSK3 is involved in the MEK1-dependent phenomenon that we have uncovered, we used a dominant-negative version of GSK3, which has been very well characterized in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. The rationale is that if GSK3 and MEK1 collaborate to control pluripotency in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, dnGSK3 should cause similar effects as Mk-MO. First, we verified in a classical assay that dn-GSK3 RNA injection could efficiently induce secondary body axis formation. As expected, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that dn-GSK3 strongly up-regulated the expression of the organizer genes siamois and <italic>gsc</italic> at the early gastrula stage. In contrast, dnGSK3 significantly down-regulated the expression of all <italic>ventx</italic> and <italic>pou5f3</italic> genes in the same embryos. Whole-mount in situ hybridization confirmed that <italic>ventx2</italic> and <italic>pou5f3.2</italic> were down-regulated, whereas <italic>gsc</italic> was up-regulated in embryos injected with dn-GSK3. Thus, MEK1 and GSK3 knockdown had opposite effects on the level of expression of pluripotency regulators. Finally, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that dn-GSK3 did not induce Ventx2-Myc protein stabilization, unlike Mk-MO. This observation is consistent with the data of Zhu et al., (2002), which indicated that GSK3 was not required for Ventx2 proteolysis. Furthermore, Ventx proteins were not recovered in genome-wide GSK3-dependent proteomes (see GSK3 PROTEOME TABLE1 and TABLE2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hhmi.ucla.edu/derobertis/">http://www.hhmi.ucla.edu/derobertis/</ext-link>; or Acebron S et al., 2014 NCBI GEO accession numbers GSE50629 and GSE50248). We conclude that GSK3 is likely not involved in the transition from pluripotency to commitment of embryonic cells, which primarily involves MEK1-dependent destabilization of the pluripotency regulatory network. These results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> and mentioned in the Discussion section of the main text (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) As previously suggested, please test the hypothesis by depleting MEK from animal caps and/or embryos and look at ability of BMP, Activin or Wnt to induce any lineages), would address my concerns about whole embryos versus animal caps. In this case, qRT-PCR of a few diagnostic markers (rather than RNA SEQ or microarray analyses) should be sufficient.</italic></p><p>As requested, we tested whether animal caps responded to inducers of differentiation in absence of MEK1 activity. We used BMP4, NOGGIN, a low dose of NODAL, and a high dose of NODAL recombinant proteins to induce epidermal, neural, mesodermal and endodermal fates, respectively. We did not use Wnt, as it is known to be a rather poor germ-layer inducer in animal caps. Similar to our initial observations in whole embryos, none of the inducers tested could activate differentiation markers in Mk morphant animal caps, as revealed by RT-qPCR analysis. This analysis confirmed our initial conclusion that MEK1 activity is required for embryonic cell competence to respond to inducers of differentiation. These new results have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and are described in the main text (subsection “MEK1 is required for cell competence to differentiate”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
