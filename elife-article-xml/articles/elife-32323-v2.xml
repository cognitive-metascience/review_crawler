ammonium-limited chemostats. We found repeated selection for non-synonymous variation in the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional activator, GAT1, which functions with the repressor, DAL80 in an incoherent type-1 feedforward loop (I1-FFL) to control expression of the high affinity ammonium transporter gene, MEP2. Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 reduce its binding to the GATAA consensus sequence. However, we show experimentally, and using mathematical modeling, that decreases in GAT1 binding result in increased expression of MEP2 as a consequence of properties of I1-FFLs. Our results show that I1-FFLs, one of the most commonly occurring network motifs in transcriptional networks, can facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression through modulation of transcription factor binding affinities. Our findings highlight the importance of gene regulatory architectures in the evolution of gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1244219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gresham</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM107466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gresham</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The architecture of a gene regulatory network determines the effect of evolutionary changes in transcription factor binding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression evolution is a pervasive source of phenotypic diversity between and within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacob and Monod, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nocedal and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Genetic variation causing evolutionary changes in gene expression impacts either the regulatory elements of a gene (<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory) or the factors that control its expression (<italic>trans</italic>-regulatory). The relative importance of these two classes of variation across evolutionary timescales is the source of long-standing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wittkopp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoekstra and Coyne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</xref>). A variety of approaches have been developed for identifying the genetic basis of intraspecific gene expression variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>) and defining the landscape of mutational changes that affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). Comparative genomics using extant organisms is typically used for inferring the evolutionary processes and outcomes that underlie the evolution of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittkopp, 2010</xref>). However, these approaches face the challenge of distinguishing neutral from adaptive variation and cannot provide insights into the dynamics of gene expression evolution in evolving populations.</p><p>The regulation of gene expression typically comprises multiple regulatory factors with both activating and repressive functions that coordinately control the dynamics and output of gene transcription. Regulatory networks controlling gene expression are composed of network motifs, recurrently occurring patterns of interaction between regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon, 2007</xref>). Studies of global regulatory networks in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) identified three component feed-forward loops (FFL) as one of the most commonly occurring network motifs. A FFL comprises a transcription factor that regulates a second transcription factor. Both transcription factors bind the regulatory region of a third target gene and jointly control its expression. As transcription factors can be either activators or repressors, there are eight possible configurations of three component FFLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>). Of these variants, incoherent type-1 feed-forward loops (I1-FFL) are one of the most common, occurring hundreds of times in bacteria and yeast gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milo et al., 2002</xref>). These network motifs are termed âincoherentâ as the upstream regulator directly activates the target gene and indirectly represses it by activating a repressor of the target gene. I1-FFL function to speed the response time of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>) and for particular parameter values, detect relative changes in input signals rather than absolute levels of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goentoro et al., 2009</xref>). 1I-FFLs are found throughout gene regulatory networks in multiple organisms. Although the dynamic properties and behavior of the I1-FFL have been extensively studied, the significance of this network in evolution is not well understood. In particular, how I1-FFLs constrain or facilitate evolutionary pathways remains unknown.</p><p>Long-term experimental evolution (LTEE) provides a means of studying evolutionary dynamics, processes and outcomes. Performing replicated LTEE in controlled conditions and assessing the fitness and phenotypes of evolved lineages and populations enables tests of the role of gene expression evolution in response to selection and the extent to which selection results in recurrent outcomes. LTEE in microorganisms provides evidence for the role of adaptive changes in gene expression in response to selection as parallel changes in gene expression have been observed in replicated populations of both <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferea et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>). However, proving that changes in gene expression are adaptive and identifying the underlying molecular bases of gene expression changes acquired during experimental evolution remains challenging.</p><p>Quantitative DNA sequencing enables the comprehensive identification of genomic variants, their frequencies and dynamics during adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wenger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). In LTEE performed in conditions of constant nutrient-limitation using chemostats, increased expression of nutrient transporter genes is a primary mode of adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gresham and Hong, 2015</xref>). Copy number variants (CNVs), comprising gene amplifications that result in increased expression of transporter genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>), are a recurrent class of adaptive alleles in chemostat LTEE. However, adaptive mutations in trans factors, such as transcription factors (TFs) are also frequently identified in LTEEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). These variant alleles are primarily missense, frame-shift or nonsense mutations that are likely to confer strong effects on gene expression in evolved lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll, 2008</xref>). However, how protein coding changes in transcriptional regulators identified during LTEE alter gene expression and how these changes in expression confer increased fitness remains unknown.</p><p>The regulation of nitrogen utilization in budding yeast represents one of the best understood gene regulatory networks in any system. Control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) transcription is achieved by four transcription factors, that bind to the same GATAA consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magasanik and Kaiser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofman-Bang, 1999</xref>). Two factors â GLN3 and GAT1 â have activating activity and two factors â DAL80 and GZF3 â have repressive activity. GLN3 is constitutively expressed and regulated post-translationally by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation that prevents its entry into the nucleus. In conditions in which TORC1 activity is low, dephosphorylation of GLN3 enables it to enter the nucleus where it activates expression of GAT1, DAL80 and GZF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The promoters of GAT1, DAL80 and GZF3 contain GATAA binding sites and thus they coordinately regulate expression of their targets and themselves. The NCR regulatory components comprise four interconnected I1-FFLs comprising either of the activators, GLN3 and GAT1, and either of the repressors DAL80 or GZF3, that function to regulate the expression dynamics and output ofÂ ~41 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Godard et al., 2007</xref>) that encode products required for assimilating diverse nitrogen sources. NCR is an ideal system for studying the evolution of gene expression owing to the well-characterized properties of its four regulators and the small number of well-defined direct targets.</p><p>Here, we used LTEE in ammonium-limited chemostats to investigate the functional basis of adaptive increases in gene expression. Leveraging our understanding of selection in chemostats primarily operating on nutrient transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gresham and Hong, 2015</xref>) and the detailed understanding of nitrogen-regulated gene expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magasanik and Kaiser, 2002</xref>) we studied how adaptive variation in the trans regulatory factor, GAT1, mediates its effects on fitness by altering gene expression. We find that the beneficial effects of recurrently selected missense mutations in GAT1 are a result of its effect on increasing expression of the high affinity ammonium transporter gene, <italic>MEP2</italic>. Surprisingly, we find that these effects are the result of decreased affinity for the GAT1 consensus binding site that differentially impact binding at the promoters of the repressor <italic>DAL80</italic> and their common transcriptional target, <italic>MEP2</italic>. Using functional assays and mathematical modeling we find that adaptive evolution acts to increase the transcriptional output from the I1-FFL comprising GAT1, DAL80 and MEP2 by decreasing transcription factor affinities. Thus, in addition to their important dynamic behavior, I1-FFL possess properties that may be exploited by evolution to tune their output thereby increasing organismal fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>De novo missense mutations in <italic>GAT1</italic> are positively selected in ammonium-limited chemostats</title><p>Previously, we identified repeated selection of independent missense mutations in theÂ DNA binding domainÂ of GAT1Â within a single LTEE population maintained in ammonium-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). In this study, we aimed to determine whether adaptive mutations in <italic>GAT1</italic> result in alteration of its regulatory activities and, if so, how these changes impact fitness.

The frequency of the MEP2 amplification was defined as the proportion of clones bearing more than 2 copies of MEP2 among 96 randomly selected clones.

Consistent with this claim, complete loss of GAT1 results in decreased MEP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and is deleterious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Decreased TF affinities can result in increased expression from an I1-FFL</title><p>Using functional assays, we found that the impact of GAT1 variants on promoter binding affinities differs between the <italic>DAL80</italic> and <italic>MEP2</italic> promoters. As DAL80 is a negative regulator of <italic>MEP2</italic>, a quantitative decrease in DAL80 expression is expected to result in increased expression from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter. However, GAT1 variants also reduce affinity for the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter sequence potentially decreasing its direct activation. Thus, while the overall topology of the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 I1-FFL is maintained in evolved lineages, the increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression, and likely other targets with strong promoters (including <italic>GAT1</italic> itself), must be mediated by maintenance of direct binding at the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter and an indirect effect through reduced activation of the repressor, <italic>DAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Using a mathematical model of I1-FFLs we confirmed that a net increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression results when decreased activation at the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter is the only functional effect of <italic>GAT1</italic> variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). However, using this model we also find that a GAT1 variant that results in a decrease in direct activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter will result in increased expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> when activation of the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter is also decreased. IncreasedÂ <italic>MEP2</italic> expression, despite decreased activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter, is enhanced by a greater relative decrease in <italic>DAL80</italic> activation. Thus, our model of a I1-FFL is consistent with the finding that decreased binding affinity of GAT1, leading to decreased activation of both the <italic>DAL80</italic> and <italic>MEP2</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) can simultaneously result in decreased expression of the repressor, <italic>DAL80</italic> and increased expression of the targetÂ gene, <italic>MEP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Here, we have shown that decreasing the binding affinity of GAT1 for its target sequence increases expression output from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter as well as other GAT1 targets with strong promoters. We attribute the increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression to decreased affinity of GAT1 for its consensus sequence, which reduces transcriptional output from the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter, a comparatively weak promoter. A reduction in the effective concentration of the repressor results in increased transcriptional output from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter. Surprisingly, we also observe reduced affinity of GAT1 variants for the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter, which one would expect might reduce its transcriptional output. However, as illustrated by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), a proportionally greater decrease in <italic>DAL80</italic> expression can outweigh the effect of reduced activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter. GAT1 is auto-regulatory and we observe that GAT1 variants also result in increased <italic>GAT1</italic> expression, which further increases expression output from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, quantitatively different effects of transcription factor variants on promoters of differing strengths, in the context of gene regulatory architectures, can lead to counterintuitive impacts on gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The long-term fate of <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations in evolving populations</title><p>In our repeated LTEE we detected multiple <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations during the firstÂ ~100 generations of selection in ammonium limitation. The preponderance of these mutations within and between populations suggests that remodeling the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 I1-FFL is a frequently occurring repeatable mode of adaptive evolution during the earliest stages of adaptive evolution in ammonium-limited environments. However, adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> alleles likely do not represent a fitness optimum in the ammonium-limited environment as, in contrast to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>), we found that ultimately these alleles were outcompeted by lineages containing <italic>MEP2</italic> amplifications. <italic>MEP2</italic> amplifications have the same functional effect as adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations: they increase expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> enabling improved ammonium transport capabilities. However, the increased expression of other high affinity transporters in <italic>GAT1</italic> lineages that are unable to transport ammonium may confer a fitness cost that is not associated with <italic>MEP2</italic> amplification alleles. It should be noted that our method for detecting MEP2 amplifications has limited detection power until CNVs rise to high frequencies in the population. Thus, it is likely that <italic>MEP2</italic> amplification alleles co-exist with adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations during the early phases of evolution but are undetectable using our sampling and assay scheme.</p><p>Our results provide insight into NCR regulation and suggest additional levels of regulatory complexity. First, it is notable that we do not detect <italic>DAL80</italic> loss of function alleles in our LTEE. Given the current model of NCR regulation, loss of the repressor DAL80 would be expected to result in increased expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> and other NCR regulated genes resulting in increased fitness. Similarly, we do not see selection for variation in the other NCR repressor, <italic>GZF3</italic>. Finally, <italic>GLN3</italic>, the upstream activator of NCR genes, which is itself not a target of NCR regulation does not appear to harbor any adaptive variation. Combining LTEE with targeted studies of functional and fitness effects of regulatory components of NCR may provide further insights into how these four GATA factors coordinately regulate the NCR regulon.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Parallels with oncogenic transcription factors mutations in human tumors</title><p>Experimental evolution in eukaryotic microbes has many parallels with the molecular processes, and evolutionary dynamics, underlying tumorigenesis.

As with adaptive evolution, missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of these transcription factors result in altered binding affinities at the promoters of target genes resulting in aberrant transcriptional activation in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filippova et al., 2002</xref>).

Our study highlights the importance of network motifs and incorporation of biophysical parameters in gene regulatory models in order to predict their functional output in the context of evolution. As I1-FFL are one of the most frequent motifs in transcriptional networks they may serve a general evolutionary role as facilitators of transcriptional tuning through modulation of transcriptional factor binding affinities. Further work is required to determine whether the properties of I1-FFL afford this motif unique evolutionary potential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The ancestral strain used for all LTEE is a prototrophic haploid derivative (FY4; MATa) of the S288c reference strain. To isolate individual <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations, we crossed each evolved lineage to an isogenic haploid strain of the opposite mating type (FY5; MATÎ±) and, following sporulation, recovered meiotic products bearing different combinations of derived adaptive alleles. To genotype individual segregants, we used allele-specific PCR for which two allele specific forward primers and one common reverse primer were prepared. We also knocked out the entire <italic>GAT1</italic> locus by replacing it with nourseothricin resistance (NatR) marker using a standard high efficiency transformation protocol. We engineered GFP fused promoter constructs for four GAT1 targets (<italic>GAP1</italic>, <italic>MEP2</italic>, <italic>DAL80</italic> and <italic>GZF3</italic>) and integrated them at the <italic>HO</italic> locus using homology based transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For each construct, we fused GFP with 1 kb of sequence 5â and 1 kb of sequence 3â of the open reading frame (ORF) for each target gene, which encompasses regulatory elements including promoter and UTRs. We attempted to construct a GFP-based transcriptional reporter using the <italic>GAT1</italic> promoter but found that including as much as 2 kb of sequence 5â to the <italic>GAT1</italic> ORF failed to activate GFP expression in either ancestral or adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> backgrounds (data not shown).

The average sequence read coverage was around 50x, resulting in a detection limit for SNPs around 10% (i.e. we required that each variant was present in at least five reads). We identified CNVs by normalizing read depth at each nucleotide position to the median read depth of the entire genome by processing BAM files using samtools and R. We identified CNVs that include <italic>MEP2</italic> in all three populations at 250 generations using read depth analysis. At each time point during the LTEE, we estimated the allele frequency of CNVs in the population by randomly selecting 96 clones and conducting qPCR to measure the copy number of <italic>MEP2</italic> for all clones. We found that most clones possess one or two copies of <italic>MEP2</italic> but some possesses up to eight or nine copies (data not shown).

Amplicon libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq in a 2 Ã 250 bp mode such that the two paired reads overlapped and each insert was sequenced twice. Only overlapping regions were used for allele frequency estimation and thereby we were able to dramatically reduce the false positive SNP call rate.

For population-level fitness assay, we established cultures containing the ancestral mCitirine-labeled strain (DGY500) alongside chemostats vessels in which LTEE were performed and let them reach the steady state conditions at the same dilution rate. We then mixed a sample from the LTEE with the fluorescence labeled ancestor strain in ratio of 1:9. To determine population fitness, each competing culture was sampled at multiple (5 -10) time points over a total period of less than 20 generations. At least 10,000 cells were assayed using an Accuri flow cytometer to determine the relative abundance of each genotype, and relative fitness determined using linear regression of the natural logarithm of the ratio of the two genotypes against the number of elapsed generations. We tested the fitness of three evolved mutants, three segregants from backcrossing experiments that contained only <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations and one engineered <italic>GAT1</italic> KO strain in four different nitrogen-limited chemostat conditions â using either ammonium, glutamine, proline or urea â and in YPD rich medium using batch culturing and serial dilution.

(D)Â Quantification of transcription factors binding affinity. Parameters estimated from fitting a Michaelis-Menten function to EMSA data. Fr_max is the maximal of bound over total DNA. K_x is the concentration of protein required for half-maximal binding. Non-significant parameter values are in grey italics. (E)Â Strains used in this study.

E-scores for the top 8-mer bound by the protein on each microarray were calculated. A PWM was generated for each protein variant based on an alignment of the top ten 8-mers. (B)Â GAT1 protein fragment sequences used in PBM and EMSA assays. The DNA binding domain is in blue. Flanking sequences included in the expressed protein fragment are in green. (C)Â Oligonucleotides used to generate duplex DNA for EMSAs. Bold and underlined sequences are GATA sequences bound by GAT1. The minimum match score was set as 0.8 using âmatchPWM()â function in âBiostringsâ library in R. Negative motifs differ from target motifs only at the underline GATA by replacement with random sequence.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application"

They find that cells increase expression of MEP2, the ammonium permease either by increasing the gene copy number (reported before) or through mutations in the MEP2 transcription factor GAT1. Surprisingly, these mutations reduce the binding of Gat1 to the MEP2 promoter, but still increase the expression of MEP2 by decreasing the expression of its repressor DAL80. This is indeed an interesting and surprising discovery that shows how the connectivity of molecular circuits could impact on their ability to evolve.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Report expression and fitness for all lineages, as suggested by reviewer #3.</p><p>2) Change the model to include auto-regulation of GAT1, as requested below.</p><p>3) Discuss the ability to distinguish the contribution of DAL80 vs. GAT1 to the increased MEP2 expression.</p><p>4) Discuss the generality of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Gresham and colleagues examine the molecular basis of adaptive evolution in an experimental evolution setting. They evolve asexual yeast strains in nitrogen-limited conditions and use whole-genome population sequencing to identify the molecular changes associated with fitness gains. The major target of selection in this context is the expression level of MEP2, coding for an ammonium permease. One of the most advantageous changes at this locus is increase in copy number, which was dissected in previous papers. Other changes that occur are non-synonymous changes in GAT1, a transcription factor positively regulating MEP2. Surprisingly, through functional analyses, the authors show that these amino acid changes reduce the binding of Gat1 to the MEP2 promoter. The decreased binging affinity would contribute to increase the expression of MEP2 by decreasing the expression of DAL80, a repressor of MEP2.</p><p>This paper appears to be an important contribution because the evolution of gene expression is generally reduced to a very low level of complexity (including in my own work) by characterizing changes as being in cis or trans and as positive or negative. However, transcriptional networks are very complex and network motifs can produce expression levels and patterns that are not necessarily changing in a simple way, at least not in a way that would be expected based for instance on simple changes in TF affinities. The findings presented here are a good example of this and also illustrate the need to consider molecular changes in the context of molecular networks in order to be able to map fitness changes to phenotypes and genotypes. The experiments are well done, the paper is well written and clearly of interest to a large community.</p><p>My major comments would be regarding the interpretation of the data:</p><p>- It would be useful to eliminate effects that could come from outside the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 motif and that could explain why MEP2 expression goes up when Gat1 affinity decreases. The gene expression data produced could be used for this purpose, for instance by showing that other potential MEP2 regulators are not affected in the Gat1 mutant backgrounds.</p><p>- Third paragraph of Discussion. It would be useful to have a stronger conclusion as to how the increased expression of MEP2 is achieved. The dynamic model constructed maybe useful in terms of supporting one mechanism or the other, for instance self-regulation of Gat1 versus weaker effect of GAT1 mutations on DAL80 than on MEP2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper Hong and colleagues attempt to understand the functional significance of specific adaptive mutations that evolve in yeast under N<sub>2</sub> limited chemostat growth. They find that a large number of early adaptive mutations â although not clear what proportion â are missense mutations in one particular TF (GAT1) that acts on multiple genes but in particular is a positive regulator of the N<sub>2</sub> transporter. These mutations eventually get outcompeted by the expansion of the transporter itself (MEP2) but the early adaptation is (apparently) dominated by the GAT1 missense mutations.</p><p>Long story short their argument is that most of the GAT1 are loss (reduction) of function in terms of the binding affinity to the GAT1 binding site but because the downstream targets are regulated through an incoherent FF loop this reduction of binding leads to an <italic>increase</italic> in expression of MEP2 because the GAT1 mutations decrease the expression of the repressor of MEP2, the TF called DAL80.</p><p>I was very much prepared to like the paper but was left underwhelmed. The evidence that their model is correct in broad strokes is quite convincing. But they do not seem to be able to link the TF binding to fitness despite having a large number of mutants and do not in any way describe the difference between the two GAT1 mutants they study in great detail. One leads to a much stronger reduction of binding â what does that imply for function?</p><p>I am also unclear about the overall message. What do they mean by claiming that the incoherent FFL enhances the ability of yeast to adapt? Is it that in this context loss of function mutants in terms of binding that are more common can generate a gain of function phenotype in terms of expression of the key gene? Is this particular to this structure? What about the other properties of this structure â like the ability to generate a pulse of expression? I was left without a clear sense of how generalizable the findings are and what they mean broadly. Without this sense of general importance it is hard for me to see why this paper out to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> rather than in a more particular molecular biology journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study shows that evolution in ammonium-limited chemostats repeatedly selects for modulation of the DNA binding affinity of GAT1, one of the transcription factors controlling nitrogen catabolite repression. Due to it being a part of an incoherent type-1 feedforward loop, this alteration in binding affinity results in an increased expression of MEP2, a high-affinity ammonium transporter. This increase ultimately results in an improved fitness in ammonium-limited conditions. As such, network motifs like feedforward loops might facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression.</p><p>This is an elegant study highlighting the importance of network motifs, such as feedforward loops, a nuance often overlooked up until now in the interpretation of experimental evolution data. One of the major strengths of this study is the reproducibility of the experimental evolution, exemplifying that this mechanism of adaptive gene expression tuning might be more general than previously thought. Granted the authors take some of the below-mentioned comments and concerns into account, this study will certainly improve our understanding of the dynamics of evolution.</p><p>â¢ Something that is not really explored in this study, is the influence of GAT1 mutations on its own expression. The data suggest that its expression is also increased (even more than MEP2). This fact is never mentioned in the interpretation of the data, but it might be very important. It is also not included in the mathematical model, which seems a bit simple. As previously said, the expression of GAT1 also depends on the level of GAT1 itself and even on the expression of DAL80. On the other hand, DAL80 supposedly also influences its own expression, and this is also not included in the model. These are very important parts of the feedforward loop, so in my opinion a better model could be made, more resembling the real structure of a feedforward loop. These facts should also be incorporated in the interpretations and discussions.</p><p>â¢ The authors suggest several times that the mutation of the DNA-binding domain of GAT1 is a quick way to increase the expression of MEP2 during evolution, before the expression can be increased even more by duplicating MEP2. However, MEP2 expression is never measured in lineages with MEP2 CNVs. As such, the proposed progression of MEP2 expression during evolution is never really shown. As this is one of the main underlying assumptions (increased MEP2 expression equals increased fitness, and CNV has the highest expression), this is a crucial experiment to do. Measure expression and fitness for all lineages, including those with CNVs. Then, correlate this expression with fitness.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32323.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Report expression and fitness for all lineages, as suggested by reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified fitness and expression of lineages containing MEP2 amplification alleles.

The other direct activator of <italic>MEP2</italic> is GLN3 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). We find that GLN3 expression is not significantly altered in strains containing GAT1 variants (Supplementary file 1B). This is consistent with the fact that the GLN3 promoter does not contain the GATAA binding sites and thus is not regulated by GAT1 or the repressing GATA factors, DAL80 and GZF3. This suggests that the increased expression is not attributable to changes in the activity of GLN3. In addition, our results indicate that GZF3 is not altered in expression making it unlikely that it contributes to changes in MEP2 expression. We have added this point in the main manuscript as follows:</p><p>âBy contrast, the expression of <italic>GLN3</italic> and <italic>GZF3</italic> is unchanged in the presence of <italic>GAT1</italic> variants (Supplementary file 1B) suggesting that the altered expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> and <italic>DAL80</italic> is attributable to changes in GAT1 binding affinity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Third paragraph of Discussion.

We revisited our data and made some interesting observations. First, we find that the residue mutated in the <italic>GAT1-1</italic> (W321L) allele is only hit once in our repeated evolution experiments whereas the residue mutated in the <italic>GAT1-3</italic> (R345G) allele is the most frequently mutated site (Figure 1E). In addition, <italic>GAT1-1</italic> shows significantly lower fitness compared to <italic>GAT1-3</italic> (R345G) (Figure 2B). Given these results, we suggest that selected GAT1 variants differ in their fitness effects, such that strongly reduced TF binding results in lower fitness increase than does a more moderate reduction in TF binding. We have added this point in the Results section as follows:</p><p>âInterestingly, <italic>GAT1-1</italic> (W321L) shows a much stronger reduction in DNA binding affinity compared to <italic>GAT1-3</italic> (R345G) for both tested promoter sequences (Figure 4B and 4C). [â¦] These observations suggest that intermediate reductions in GAT1 binding affinity may be more beneficial than strongly reduced binding. Consistent with this claim, complete loss of GAT1 results in decreased MEP2 expression (Figure 3B) and is deleterious (Figure 2B).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also unclear about the overall message.

To study and interpret gene expression evolution, it is essential to consider the properties of the gene regulatory networks as the net effect of altered transcription factor affinities can be unintuitive. We now emphasize point this in the Abstract:</p><p>âOur results show that I1-FFLs, one of the most commonly occurring network motifs in transcriptional networks, can facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression through modulation of transcription factor binding affinities. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for gene regulatory architectures to understand gene expression evolution.â</p><p>And reiterate this point in the Discussion:</p><p>âThus, quantitatively different effects of transcription factor variants on promoters of differing strengths, in the context of gene regulatory architectures, can lead to counterintuitive impacts on gene expression.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] Granted the authors take some of the below-mentioned comments and concerns into account, this study will certainly improve our understanding of the dynamics of evolution.</p><p>â¢ Something that is not really explored in this study, is the influence of GAT1 mutations on its own expression.

We explored using a more complicated model including GAT1 autoregulation and DAL80 self-inhibition. However, the model quickly becomes unwieldy because there are too many unknown parameters. Although the model we present is simple, our goal in constructing it was to test whether our experimental observation that decreased affinity for both MEP2 and DAL80 promoters is consistent with increased expression output of MEP2 as this seemed entirely counterintuitive. As we report, the model is consistent with our findings. We did not measure affinity of GAT1 variants for its own promoter, but as the reviewer points out our gene expression data indicate that GAT1 expression is increased. Therefore, we tested the effect of increased GAT1 expression on MEP2 expression output across the entire parameter space studied in Figure 4F. We find that increased GAT1 expression results in a linear increase in MEP2 expression. We have included this result in a new supplementary figure, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</p><p>âFigure 4âfigure supplement 2.Increasing GAT1 expression results in increased MEP2 expression.
