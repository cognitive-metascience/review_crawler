Here we reveal a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We show that folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is promoted by ubiquitination of a specific lysine, retaining it in the ER while avoiding degradation. Subsequent ER exit requires removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19. This ubiquitination-deubiquitination is conceptually reminiscent of the glucosylation-deglucosylation occurring in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. To avoid infinite futile cycles, folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and ER export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are, with time, polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation. This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins as CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor 2, two poor folders involved in severe human diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19083.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19083.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19083.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins carry out almost every process that happens inside a cell. Like all machines, their ability to work properly depends on their three-dimensional shape and structure. To make proteins, building blocks called amino acids are first assembled into a string that, like wool in a sweater, needs to be knitted into the final three-dimensional structure. How proteins reach their 3D structure is called “folding”, and when protein folding fails, or is not so efficient, it can cause very severe diseases.</p><p>Protein folding is not as nicely progressive as knitting a sweater: it is more like putting all the wool into a big messy blob that then suddenly turns into a protein with the right three-dimensional structure. Cells have machinery that can detect messy-looking molecules and destroy them. Therefore, new proteins need to be hidden from this machinery until they have finished folding.</p><p>A human protein called LRP6 is found on the surface of cells and it plays an important role in allowing cells to communicate with each other. Like many other proteins, LRP6 is produced inside the cell in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum and is then exported to the cell surface. In 2008, a team of researchers found that LRP6 is modified in a particular way known as S-palmitoylation before it leaves the endoplasmic reticulum. This suggested that there is a system that helps this protein to fold correctly.</p><p>Here Perrody, Abrami et al. – including some of the researchers from the previous work – used biochemical techniques to investigate how LRP6 folds. The experiments show that another type of protein modification that involves attaching a molecule called ubiquitin to LRP6 promotes this protein’s folding. Once the protein is folded, the ubiquitin is removed from LRP6 by an enzyme called USP19. Further experiments show that this system also helps to ensure that two other important proteins fold correctly.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work are to identify the other molecules involved in this protein folding system. A future challenge is to find out how this system protects new proteins from being degraded while they are still folding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19083.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19083.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transmembrane</kwd><kwd>folding</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>340260 PalmERa</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Goot</surname><given-names>F Gisou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Goot</surname><given-names>F Gisou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Goot</surname><given-names>F Gisou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel folding machinery assists transmembrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While protein folding may be extremely efficient, the presence of multiple domains, in soluble or membrane proteins, greatly reduces the efficacy of the overall process. Thus, a set of enzymes and chaperones assist folding and ensure that a sufficient number of active molecules reach their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellgaard et al., 2016</xref>). Even with help, folding may remain inefficient and thereby sensitive to errors or mutations, leading to disease. An illustrative example of folding inefficiency, and the consequences thereof, is the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Riordan, 2008</xref>). It has been estimated that less than 25% of newly synthesized CFTR molecules actually reach the plasma membrane. When the number of functional CFTR channels is further reduced, patients suffer from Cystic Fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Riordan, 2008</xref>). This is the case for mutations that affect the kinetics or thermodynamics of CFTR folding in the ER, such as the most frequent CF mutation ΔF508, and which are recognized by ER quality control systems and targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Riordan, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Inefficiency in folding is a fairly common characteristic of transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deuquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guerriero and Brodsky, 2012</xref>). Most transmembrane proteins, which jointly compose 30% of the human proteome, are synthesized by ER-bound ribosomes and co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellgaard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu and Ng, 2015</xref>). Subsequent folding must proceed in three topological environments: the ER lumen, the membrane and the cytosol. In each of these environments, the protein may benefit from the help of chaperones and folding enzymes. On the luminal side, these are fairly well characterized and include HSP40, HSP70 and HSP90 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>), the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>) and protein disulfide isomerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodsky and Skach, 2011</xref>). Less is known about the assisted folding in the ER membrane and on the cytosolic side. If folding or assembly in any of these environments fails, the protein is recognized by quality control machineries and targeted to the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lemus and Goder, 2014</xref>). ERAD involves polyubiquitination of the cytosolic domains of transmembrane protein, extraction from the ER membrane and degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lemus and Goder, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we have studied the biogenesis of Low-density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 6 (LRP6), a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which has been associated with many human pathologies including cancer, osteoporosis and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joiner et al., 2013</xref>), but also involved in the formation of gap junctions in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>). LRP6 is a type I membrane protein composed of a large extracellular domain containing multiple ß-propeller and EGF-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). Proper folding of the ß-propeller domains depends of the dedicated LRP6 chaperone Mesd (mesoderm development) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsieh et al., 2003</xref>) and possibly other chaperones such as calnexin. We have previously shown that exit of LRP6 from the ER also requires a cytoplasmic post-translational modification, namely S-palmitoylation, on two cysteine residues in close proximity to the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>). LRP6 acylation influences the conformation of this domain, possibly by alleviating the hydrophobic mismatch between the thickness of the membrane and the length of the hydrophobic stretch composing the transmembrane domain. Mutation of the palmitoylation sites leads to retention of LRP6 in the ER and ubiquitination on Lys-1403 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>) indicative of its recognition by a quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feldman and van der Goot, 2009</xref>). Once properly folded, LRP6 exits the ER, it transits through the Golgi, as indicated by the acquisition of Endoglycosidase H insensitive complex sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>), before reaching the plasma membrane where its signal role takes place.</p><p>Here we have further investigated LRP6 biogenesis in the ER. We show that newly synthesized wild type LRP6 also undergoes ubiquitination, on the same site (Lys-1403), and that this post-translational modification promotes its folding. For ER exit to occur, ubiquitination must however be subsequently removed. This is mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP19, one of the isoforms of which is tail-anchored to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wing, 2016</xref>). It is thought to play an essential role in skeletal muscle atrophy through unclear mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wing, 2016</xref>). At the more mechanistic level, USP19 has been shown to control the stability of several cytoplasmic proteins such as the inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mei et al., 2011</xref>), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altun et al., 2012</xref>) and the initiator of autophagy Beclin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, USP19 is a target gene of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and was found to rescue CFTR ΔF508 from ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>). More recently it was found that USP19 is a key player in a novel misfolded-protein associated secretion MAPS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). We show that USP19 controls the cellular levels of LRP6. In the absence of USP19, LRP6 is efficiently targeted to ERAD. Upon USP19 overexpression, ER exit of LRP6 is greatly enhanced.</p><p>This work reveals the existence of a novel assisted-folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER and depends on site-specific cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination. Upon ubiquitination on Lys-1403, LRP6 presumably interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>). If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ERAD. The here identified ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins such as CFTR or the anthrax toxin receptor 2 (also know as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2), loss of function of which leads to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deuquet et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Massive degradation of newly synthesized LRP6 in the ER</title><p>We analyzed LRP6 stability by performing a cycloheximide chase, which consists in following total protein expression levels by western blot analysis of extracts from Pigmented epithelial (RPE1) cells submitted for various times to a protein synthesis block.

The long apparent half-lives estimated both by long metabolic labeling and cycloheximide chase suggest that mature LRP6 has a half-life that exceeds 20 hr. The rapid decay times observed for short metabolic pulses on the other hand indicate that close to 80% of newly synthesized LRP6 molecules are degraded in our cells within the first 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and thus do not contribute to the population of active Wnt signaling co-receptors.</p><p>Cellular degradation of membrane proteins can occur by two main pathways: ERAD, where proteolysis is mediated by the proteasome, or the lysosomal pathway, which is responsible for degradation of most membrane proteins but is also the endpoint of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). To determine the relative contribution of these pathways to the degradation of LRP6, we repeated the 20 min metabolic pulse-chase experiments while either inhibiting the proteasome with MG132 or preventing lysosomal degradation by inhibiting the vacuolar ATPase with Bafilomycin A. MG132 protected LRP6 from degradation early after synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), consistent with degradation of a subpopulation of LRP6 molecules by ERAD during biogenesis. Bafilomycin A protected LRP6 at later times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), consistent with transport of a portion of newly synthesized LRP6 molecules to the plasma membrane and their subsequent endocytosis and targeting to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). That LRP6 undergoes degradation by two distinct pathways is further support by the observation that palmitoylation deficient LRP6, in which the two cysteines are mutated to serines (LRP6<sup>CC–SS</sup>), and which does not exit the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>), is partially rescued by MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) but is insensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes such as Bafilomycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) or leupeptin (supplementary information in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>]).

The process is however not all-or-none, <italic>i.e.</italic> even in the absence of Lys-1403 and/or palmitoylation, a small population of molecules folds properly and exits the ER. Pulse-chase experiments with long <sup>35</sup>S pulses indeed reveal biphasic decay curves for all mutants studied, and show the existence, irrespective of the mutations, of a minor population of extremely long-lived molecules, which presumably reside at the plasma membrane. Importantly these constitute the steady state population that is revealed by western blotting. Western blot analysis of LRP6 mutants may therefore be misleading as to the importance of specific residues for biogenesis and membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Working hypothesis</title><p>The above findings, combined with our previous observation that LRP6<sup>CC–SS</sup>undergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403 and fails to exit the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>), led us to propose the following working hypothesis: following synthesis and insertion into the ER membrane, LRP6 first undergoes ubiquitination, probably of a specific type, on Lys-1403, allowing it to interact with an ER or cytosolic ubiquitin-binding protein. This interaction provides LRP6 with time to fold –and as such this ubiquitin-binding protein would act as a chaperone– protecting it from ERAD targeting. Lys-1403 is then deubiquitinated. At this stage, LRP6 can either (1) undergo palmitoylation of its two juxtamembranous cysteine residues, followed by ER exit, (2) be re-ubiquitinated on Lys-1403, or (3) be polyubiquitinated on one of the other 16 cytoplasmic lysine residues and sent to ERAD. Option 1, re-ubiquitination on Lys-1403, allows LRP6 to undergo a second cycle of interaction with its ubiquitin-binding chaperone, further promoting folding. Palmitoylation, which favors ER exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>), could prevent LRP6 from Lys-1403 ubiquitination, possibly through a conformational change of steric hindrance given the juxtamembrane localization of both modifications.</p><p>A major prediction of this model is the existence of an ER localized deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme that can remove ubiquitin specifically from Lys-1403.

Because LRP6 folding takes place in the ER, we searched for ER-associated DUBs and to the best of our knowledge, only USP19 has an ER localized isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clague et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wing, 2016</xref>).

While ubiquitination of LRP6 is undetectable under control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>), silencing of <italic>usp19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) revealed a clear LRP6 ubiquitination signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), often, but not always, appearing as a well identifiable band and a smear.

More specifically we show that following synthesis, LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on Lys-1403, most likely of a specific form. In conceptual analogy to the binding of newly synthesized mono-glucosylated proteins to calnexin in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamriben et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesize that Lys-1403-ubiquitin can interact with a putative ER-ubiquitin binding protein that would also act as a chaperone. Upon release from this putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone, LRP6 is deubiquitinated by USP19. Following USP19 deubiquitination, LRP6 can, if properly folded, exit the ER, an events possibly promoted by palmitoylation of cysteines in the vicinity of Lys-1403 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrami et al., 2008b</xref>). Or, LRP6 can undergo a new cycle of Lys-1403-specific ubiquitination and chaperone binding. Upon prolonged presence in the ER, LRP6 undergoes polyubiquitination on other cytosolic lysines, leading to ERAD targeting. In the ER, LRP6 can thus undergo two types of ubiquitination events, which operate with different kinetics: (1) specific ubiquitination on Lys-1403 which promotes folding, (2) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines which promotes ERAD. These two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen, which also occur with different kinetics. De-glucosidation promotes folding of glycosylated protein, but if folding is too lengthy or fails, de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD.</p><p>While the here described ubiquitin-dependent folding system was identified for LRP6, it likely also operates on other membrane proteins. We indeed found that <italic>usp19</italic> silencing also led to a pronounced decrease in the levels of CMG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), defective folding of which lead to Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome (OMIM #228600) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deuquet et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2011</xref>). Silencing of <italic>usp19</italic> however did not affect the levels of the CMG2-related protein TEM8 (Tumor endothelial marker 8), nor those of the Transferrin and the EGF receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). USP19 was reported to rescue the CFTR Δ508 mutant, which is an ERAD substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hassink et al., 2009</xref>). USP19 however also controls proteostasis of wild type CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Future studies are required to establish the generality of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system, determine whether it has a built-in quality control, and identify the missing components such as the folding-promoting ubiquitin ligase, the putative ubiquitin-binding chaperone and the degradation-targeting ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). All these enzymes could be exploited to control Wnt signaling in the context of disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Hela and RPE1 cells were used in this study.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There is a clear consensus between the reviewers that this paper is interesting and describes a significant new form of quality control of membrane protein synthesis and maturation. The data, which are high quality and largely well interpreted, are used to propose a model in which LRP6 is unstable in the ER and degraded by ERAD. Newly synthesized LRP6 is stabilized by ubiquitination of K1403, allowing folding and palmitoylation. Subsequent removal of ubiquitin is necessary for forward trafficking to the Golgi apparatus. Despite the general positivity among reviewers, there are some issues that need to be resolved before it can be accepted.</p><p>1) The trafficking route of LRP6 needs further clarification. Given the recently defined misfolded protein-associated secretion pathway termed MAPS from the Ye lab (Lee et al., 2016) that utilizes USP19, does LRP6 trafficking to the cell surface travel through the MAPS pathway that bypasses the Golgi or the traditional secretory pathway?</p><p>2) In a related issue, the experiments that show different kinetics of the effects of MG132 and bafilomycin imply that there are two distinct degradation mechanisms. These could be further clarified by examining the endo-H sensitive/resistant LRP fractions that are subject to MG132 or bafilomycin-sensitive degradation. Investigating the glycosylation in this way should also address the above question of whether LRP6 is trafficked conventionally through the Golgi.</p><p>3) Late in the paper it is suggested that USP19 might also be the unidentified chaperone that binds to K1403 ubiquitinated LRP6. This is a major mechanistic issue and should be explored a little further. The consequences on Wnt signaling of overexpression of a catalytically dead form of USP19 would be a simple experiment that might separate these functions, allowing the possibility of this dual function to be addressed.</p><p>4) There is a significant lack of clarity in the dynamic aspect of the model that needs to be better explained. K1403 ubiquitination is both a stabilizing process for the newly synthesized LRP6 – allowing a chaperone to bind and support folding. But loss of USP19, predicted to increase time or level of Ub binding to K1403, leads to destabilization of LRP6. This appears to contradict the idea that ubiquitination is stabilizing. The resolution of this paradox is probably the timing of two events: first stabilization by ubiquitin addition, then ubiquitin removal for ER exit – but this is not well described, nor is there much data to support it strongly. Do they think that the palmitoylation, which is discussed but not well integrated into the model, is a secondary stabilizing factor that prevents destabilization of mature LRP6 after the ubiquitin is removed?

Thus LRP6 follows the traditional secretory route rather than the MAPS pathway.</p><p><italic>2) In a related issue, the experiments that show different kinetics of the effects of MG132 and bafilomycin imply that there are two distinct degradation mechanisms. These could be further clarified by examining the endo-H sensitive/resistant LRP fractions that are subject to MG132 or bafilomycin-sensitive degradation. Investigating the glycosylation in this way should also address the above question of whether LRP6 is trafficked conventionally through the Golgi.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows that WT LRP6 degradation is sensitive to both MG132 and Bafilomycin. We now additionally show (new panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) that degradation of palmitoylation-deficient LRP6, which does not exit the ER (Abrami 2008), is sensitive only to MG132, not to Bafilomycin. Thus degradation by the Bafilomycin sensitivity pathway requires ER exit. Together these experiments (described in subsection “Massive degradation of newly synthesized LRP6 in the ER”, last paragraph) show that WT LRP6 undergoes degradation via two distinct pathways, ERAD in the ER and, following ER exit, degradation mediated by lysosomes.</p><p><italic>3) Late in the paper it is suggested that USP19 might also be the unidentified chaperone that binds to K1403 ubiquitinated LRP6. This is a major mechanistic issue and should be explored a little further. The consequences on Wnt signaling of overexpression of a catalytically dead form of USP19 would be a simple experiment that might separate these functions, allowing the possibility of this dual function to be addressed.</italic> </p><p>We now mention (subsection “USP19 promotes LRP6 biogenesis and controls Wnt signaling”, second paragraph) that USP19 is very <italic>unlikely</italic> to be both the DUB and the ubiquitin-binding chaperone. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> that over- expression of catalytically inactive USP19 has no protective role towards degradation. Our initial interpretation was limited to the conclusion that the catalytic activity is required for LRP6 rescue, but the complete lack of effect also rules out that USP19 acts as the chaperone since otherwise a partial rescue would have been observed.</p><p><italic>4) There is a significant lack of clarity in the dynamic aspect of the model that needs to be better explained. K1403 ubiquitination is both a stabilizing process for the newly synthesized LRP6 – allowing a chaperone to bind and support folding. But loss of USP19, predicted to increase time or level of Ub binding to K1403, leads to destabilization of LRP6. This appears to contradict the idea that ubiquitination is stabilizing. The resolution of this paradox is probably the timing of two events: first stabilization by ubiquitin addition, then ubiquitin removal for ER exit – but this is not well described, nor is there much data to support it strongly. Do they think that the palmitoylation, which is discussed but not well integrated into the model, is a secondary stabilizing factor that prevents destabilization of mature LRP6 after the ubiquitin is removed? And is there anything to be said about the relationship between K1403 ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination that promotes ERAD? Please clarify the model generally.</italic> </p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Concluding remarks”, we have now clarified that LRP6 can undergo two types of ubiquitination events in the ER and that these events operate with different kinetics: 1) specific ubiquitination on K1403, which promotes folding, 2) the slower polyubiquitination on other lysines, which promotes ERAD. The latter does not have time to take place if the protein folds and exits the ER.</p><p>We also mention that, given the proximity of the palmitoylation sites to Lys1403, palmitoylation might prevent re-ubiquitination on Lys-1403, thus preventing re- entry into the cycles of ubiquitination-deubiquitination.</p><p>Finally, we mention that the two types of ubiquitination events are reminiscent of de-glucosidation and de-mannosidation of glycoproteins in the ER lumen, which also occur with different kinetics. De-glucosidation promotes folding but if this is too lengthy de-mannosidation takes place and targets the protein to ERAD.</p><p><italic>5) Finally, the cell surface expression of LRP6 is measured using a biotinylation assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> upon USP19 overexpression. This experiment is missing controls such as LRP6 levels in WCL and a loading control. It would also be of interest to see how overexpressing the USP19 catalytic mutant would affect cell surface expression of LRP6.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. We have now removed this figure, which indeed lacked the appropriate controls. Almost all experiments in the paper were performed by metabolic pulse-chase because, as we mentioned already in the original text, western blot analysis of the steady state population does not allow the analysis of the effect of USP19 by protein overexpression, due to the very high stability of a subpopulation of LRP6, WT and mutants, that end up constituting the steady state population monitored by western blot.</p><p>Consistent with this, as we should have realized, surface biotinylation, which is revealed by western blotting, with the requested controls, does not, and cannot, reveal differences of surface LRP6 upon overexpression. Thus, while the Wnt signaling assay, which is more quantitative, indicates that cells overexpressing LRP6, Mesd and USP19 undergo higher Wnt signaling than cells overexpressing only LRP6 and Mesd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (in cells that have endogenous levels of the 3 proteins), this cannot be seen by surface biotinylation. We are happy to add these experiences to the manuscript if requested, however we feel that it might render things unnecessarily confusing for readers.</p><p>Instead we have added surface biotinylation to accompany <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, which also illustrates that Wnt signaling is strongly dependent on the USP19 levels, however using USP19 silencing instead of overexpression. As shown in various figures of the paper, the effect of USP19 silencing or knock out on LRP6 levels can readily be observed by western blotting. Consistently surface LRP6, monitored by surface biotinylation, decreases upon USP19 silencing. We show gradual decrease of LRP6 at the cells surface after 1, 2 and 3 days of siRNA. At day 3 of siRNA, LRP6 levels are undetectable at the surface but also very low in the total cell extract. Therefore, quantification of surface LRP6 was performed at day 2 of siRNA, when total LRP6 levels are still detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
