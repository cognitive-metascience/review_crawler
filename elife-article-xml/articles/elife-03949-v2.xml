However, the past decade revealed the existence of multiple intracellular gradients in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and their significance in providing positional information within the cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiekebusch and Thanbichler, 2014</xref>). Although these protein gradients are now emerging as significant general motifs to spatially organize cells, little is known about how protein patterns are established by local unmixing, and maintained on a molecular level. What are the ultimate cues and mechanisms to localize gradient forming proteins? Are protein gradients modulated by boundary conditions of the cell and how are downstream proteins directed by the positional information of protein gradients?</p><p>Cellular reconstitution methods enable us to study biological processes under defined conditions, and have significantly contributed to our understanding of molecular interactions and kinetics of proteins in simplified environments. To systematically investigate the mutual dependence between biochemical networks and three-dimensional cellular organization several techniques to confine proteins in micro compartments have recently been devised. One approach to achieve three-dimensional confinement of proteins and cytoplasmic extracts is by their encapsulation in water-oil droplets or vesicles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinot et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazel et al., 2013</xref>) These systems add tremendously to our understanding of how a constrained reaction space, and varying surface-to-volume ratios affect (bio) chemical reactions. Applying subtle mechanical forces to these systems, they may be also deformed into non-spherical shapes. However, if more complex geometries need to be realized, or if the compartments need to be mechanically stabilized, biochemical systems may also be reconstituted on and in spatially tailored microfabricated environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laan et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, combinations of two- and three-dimensionally engineered substrates with lipid membranes have been applied to study the role of simple membrane geometries on membrane interacting protein networks in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schweizer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</xref>). However, although such in vitro experiments are now being successfully applied to identify the minimal components and interactions of protein networks, we are still far from understanding the mutual interdependence of protein functionalities and physical parameters in generating nonhomogeneous protein distributions for providing positional information within the cellular compartment. Therefore, further development of bottom-up approaches are required to tackle the minimal requirements for nonhomogeneous protein localization. Studying gradient formation in a simplified and controlled environment, detached from the complexity of living cells, should shed light on the role of individual biochemical and physical parameters for regulated protein localization in space and time.</p><p>Among the most fundamental and significant gradients in cells are those that set the spatial cues for cytokinesis. In many bacteria, and also in eukaryotes that undergo symmetric division, protein gradients with the lowest concentration in the middle of the cell and the highest concentration at the cell poles have been identified. These gradients target the division site through polar inhibition of the division machinery assembly. For instance, in fission yeast, a Pom1 gradient regulates the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Celton-Morizur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Padte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Berthelot-Grosjean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in many bacteria, the assembly of the conserved ring-forming cell division protein FtsZ is inhibited at the cell poles by protein gradients of FtsZ inhibitors. In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, a gradient of the cytokinesis inhibiting protein MipZ is established, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2006</xref>) whereas in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, an inhibitory complex of MinC and MinD is attached to the cell poles by MinJ and DivIVA. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edwards and Errington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bramkamp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patrick and Kearns, 2008</xref>) Comparably, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> employs the membrane-targeted MinC/MinD complex to inhibit FtsZ assembly at the cell poles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>) Interestingly however, MinC and MinD in <italic>E.coli</italic> do not form a static gradient, but the Min protein patterns oscillate from pole to pole. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raskin and de Boer, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raskin and de Boer, 1999a</xref>) These dynamic oscillations require ATP as an energy source for the ATPase MinD and MinE, which accelerates hydrolysis of ATP by MinD. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Boer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2001</xref>) On time-average, the oscillations result in an effective concentration gradient of the MinC/MinD complex.</p><p>While MinD and MinE have been identified as a minimal set of proteins that is able to self-organize into dynamic pattern on flat supported membranes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loose et al., 2008</xref>) the minimal requirements for gradient formation, and the mechanisms of forwarding positional information to downstream processes are still controversial and only begun to be elucidated. Labeling MinE and co-reconstituting MinE with MinD in cell-shaped compartments, we demonstrated that pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min system can be reconstituted in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</xref>). However, time-averaged Min protein gradients in vitro have not been reported to date and thus, direct evidence for the establishment of steady protein gradients by self-organizing oscillations of MinD and MinE without additional proteins is still missing.</p><p>Moreover, it is still ambiguous how cell geometry affects gradient formation. On the one hand, live cell experiments with cell shape mutants, as well as in vitro reconstitutions, have shown that compartment geometry affects pattern formation of the Min proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corbin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raskin and de Boer, 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, protein gradients should be robust against morphological changes during cell development and growth. Living bacteria typically double their length during one live cycle and gradually constrict during cell division. Thus, they undergo significant changes in cell geometry, which should not disturb the establishment and functional role of Min protein gradients. Whether cell shape affects pattern formation only if the geometry of a cell is artificially perturbed, or whether a cell might use its own geometry as a readout and control parameter to shape protein gradients, still has to be determined. Thus, the identification of principal cues for gradient establishment, and their modification by spatial parameters, such as the three-dimensional geometry of a cell, remains an outstanding challenge.</p><p>In this study, we were able to establish, from a system of soluble and initially well-mixed proteins, an effective steady protein concentration gradient, potent of targeting the assembly of cell division proteins to the middle of artificial membrane-clad compartments. In particular, FtsZ, which marks the cell division site and represents the cytoskeletal backbone for the divisome machinery in many bacteria, can be targeted to the middle of a cell-like compartment by a gradient of Min proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that orientation and partitioning of Min protein gradients is controlled by compartment geometry. Notably, our synthetic system opens a new way to study complex organization principles in a simplified environment and provides novel insights into the basic biophysical and biochemical requirements for gradient formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of protein gradients in cell-shaped compartments</title><p>To determine the minimal requirements for gradient formation, we investigated the spatially self-organizing Min system as a prototype for gradient formation in a synthetic environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Supported lipid membranes, which adapt to the topography of the underlying PDMS support, were produced using a vesicle fusion technique. Then proteins, ATP and/or GTP (depending on experiment) of defined concentration were added to a buffer volume of 200 µl on top of the supported lipid membranes.

However, both the compartments and the spatial scales of the protein waves are about ten times bigger as compared to living cells. Why the Min patterns in vivo are about ten times larger than in vitro is quantitatively not fully understood. Different protein ratios, ionic strength of the buffer and membrane composition have been shown to affect the spatial scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strahl and Hamoen, 2010</xref>) and molecular crowding in a living cell could influence Min protein patterns. An advantage of the larger spatial scales in vitro is the possibility to study with much greater detail how the concentration profiles of MinD and MinE, which result in the formation of MinD gradients, are modulated during an oscillation period. Following the MinD and MinE concentration profiles along the compartment length over time, we found that the dynamic profiles are characterized by the following succession of events: First, attachment and increase in concentration of MinD at one site of the compartment, then delayed attachment of MinE to MinD and increase in MinE intensity at the trail of MinD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although the size of bacterial cells and photo bleaching is limiting for characterizing the Min profiles in vivo in such detail as it is possible in vitro, the intensity peak of MinE at the trail of the Min pattern was also observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and is generally referred to as ‘MinE ring’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raskin and de Boer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2001</xref>) After formation of the MinE peak MinD/E were disassembled from the membrane at the trail of the MinD zone, which was accompanied by assembly of a new MinD/E zone at the other pole of the compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This disassembly of Min protein patterns at the trailing zone during each oscillation is comparable to the disassembly at the trailing edge of travelling Min patterns on flat membranes. The main difference of Min proteins profiles on flat membranes and in microcompartments is that the concentration profiles on flat membranes only change their localization while traveling across the membrane. In contrast, during oscillations in compartments new membrane attached Min protein patterns need to be repeatedly established and disassembled every half oscillation period, which results in a remarkable remodelling of the concentration profiles during the oscillation cycle and an asymmetry in their rise and decay phases at the poles.</p><p>To determine the mean spatial distribution of MinD, we averaged the fluorescence signal of MinD within the cell-shaped compartments over time using confocal time-lapse movies. Remarkably, MinD formed indeed a clear nonhomogeneous concentration profile, with the lowest concentration in the middle of the compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that using the Min system, the establishment of an effective protein gradient indeed requires only a lipid membrane, an appropriate reaction space, and two proteins that self-organize under the consumption of energy, in the form of ATP.</p><p>While the requirements for Min gradient formation are now understood to a point, at which these gradients can be reconstituted in vitro, less is known about the importance of the structural properties of the gradient forming proteins. Although MinD has been shown to interact with membranes in vitro and MinE interacts with MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2002</xref>), MinE also harbours a short membrane targeting sequence at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in the membrane targeting domain of MinE result in defects in cell division and in distinct phenotypes, such as filamentous cells or a minicelling phenotype, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2011</xref>). However how the membrane targeting of MinE contributes to a normally functioning Min system is not fully understood. To gain a deeper insight in how the membrane targeting sequence of MinE contributes to gradient formation of the Min system we purified and labelled a MinE mutant without its membrane targeting sequence (MinE without amino acids three to eight, herein referred to as MinE(Δ3–8)) and reconstituted it with MinD in microcompartments. Interestingly, MinE(Δ3–8) resulted in a severe phenotype in the bottom-up system. The Min system was still able to self-organize into dynamic pattern, but instead of a stable pole-to-pole oscillation, the Min system formed dynamic patches with irregular shape and without a constant axis of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, although MinE(Δ3–8) still counteracted MinD, no stable MinD gradients were generated. Depending on the degree of affecting the membrane targeting sequence of MinE, the effective generation of a gradient and its localization along the long axis of the cell might therefore be altered to different degrees, which might account for the distinct phenotypes in vivo, such as filamentous cells or mini cells.</p><p>While the structural properties and the diffusion-reaction driven self-organization of MinD and MinE determine the non-equilibrium distribution of the Min system, a third protein, MinC, is proposed to be the actual mediator to forward positional information of the Min gradient to downstream targets. In particular, MinC is proposed to inhibit FtsZ–the cytoskeletal framework of divisome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>). To investigate the spatial distribution of eGFP-MinC in our minimal system, we co-reconstituted MinD and MinE oscillations with MinC in micro compartments. We found that eGFP-MinC oscillated from pole-to-pole by coupling to MinD/E patterns, which strongly resembles the dynamics of MinC in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on time-lapse movies, we then analyzed the time-averaged distribution of eGFP-MinC and found the concentration profile of MinC also exhibit a pronounced minimum in the middle of the compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This experiment revealed that the effective non-equilibrium distribution of the complete Min system, with the highest concentration of MinC at the cell poles, is fully recapitulated,in our simple cell-free setting.</p><p>Note that the <italic>E. coli</italic> lipid extract for generating membranes in these experiments is a mixture of mainly three different lipids, (phosphatidylethanolamine [PE, neutral], phosphatidylglycerol [PG, negatively charged] and cardiolipin [CA, negatively charged]) and that the membranes have a net negative charge. Recently it has been shown that a minimal lipid bilayer for pattern Min formation on flat supports only requires two different lipids. Moreover, cardiolipin, which has previously been proposed as a structural polar cue, which might help in triggering the pole to-pole oscillations of Min proteins, was not required for Min pattern formation on planar supports. Instead, the negative charge has been suggested to play a primary role in formation of surface waves on planar membranes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>) To address whether membrane charge and not the chemical membrane composition is also sufficient for gradient forming pole-to-pole oscillations, we established the minimal membrane composition for Min protein oscillations in our synthetic system. First, we confirmed the aforementioned results that membrane charge is a strong determinant for Min pattern formation on flat supported membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). Then we reconstituted the Min proteins in compartments with two different minimal membrane mixtures: First, with 70% neutrally charged DOPC and 30% negatively charged cardiolipin, and then with 70% DOPC and 30% negatively charged PG. In both cases, the proteins retained their ability of pattern formation and pole-to-pole oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Min gradients can be established without any structural cues in the membrane. In contrast, simple physical parameters, such as electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the proteins, are strong determinants for gradient formation. For high amounts of negatively charged lipids, the length scales of the protein patterns decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vecchiarelli et al., 2014</xref>]). Thus, the spatial scales of the Min proteins on highly negatively charged membranes would be too small to form stable pole-to-pole oscillations in compartments, which were engineered for protein length scales on <italic>E.coli</italic> membranes. The implication that Min protein oscillations are perturbed if the membrane charge increases is in agreement with live cell studies of GFP-MinD in PE-lacking <italic>E.coli</italic> cells, which demonstrate that Min protein pattern are affected if the membrane charge is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mileykovskaya et al., 2003</xref>) and provides further evidence that a balanced ratio of charged and non-charged lipids is of critical importance for the live cycle of <italic>E.coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Localization of downstream targets by reconstituted protein gradients</title><p>Intracellular protein gradients play a pivotal role in cellular organization through providing positional information for downstream proteins. However, although protein gradients are now emerging as general motives to organize cells, tools to study gradient-mediated organization of three-dimensional space are limited. To directly investigate whether the established Min gradient indeed provides an efficient cue to position downstream targets, we attempted the assembly and positioning of FtsZ to the middle of a synthetic compartment in a co-reconstitution assay. To keep the system as minimal as possible, we avoided the native membrane adaptors of FtsZ, FtsA and ZipA, and used a FtsZ hybrid protein, fused to YFP and a membrane targeting sequence (FtsZ-mts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al., 2014</xref>). In spite of this simplification, we found that highly FtsZ-mts enriched regions were clearly visible in the center of the compartments, while FtsZ-mts localization was strongly reduced at the polar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

MinC has a C-terminal and an N-terminal domain, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordell et al., 2001</xref>) which are both involved in FtsZ inhibition. The C-terminal domain of MinC is responsible for binding to MinD and dimerization of MinC. Furthermore, it binds to the conserved C-terminus of FtsZ and was suggested to compete with FtsA and ZipA to inhibit FtsZ ring formation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</xref>). Note, that FtsZ-mts comprises amino acids 1–366 of <italic>E. coli</italic> FtsZ, but instead of the C-terminally conserved tail, it comprises YFP and a membrane targeting sequence. The proposed interference of the C-terminal domain with FtsZ is therefore not involved in the system described above, which suggest that the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal domain is not required in a minimal system to inhibit FtsZ at compartment poles. In the context of a living cell, the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal domain of MinC might provide an additional mechanism for disrupting FtsZ, rendering the Min system more robust.</p><p>The N-terminal domain of MinC inhibits FtsZ polymerization by binding to an alpha-helix of FtsZ at the interface of FtsZ subunits in a filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2010</xref>). Since the FtsZ-binding region for the C-terminal domain of MinC is not present in FtsZ-mts, the major inhibitory activity contributing to FtsZ-inhibition in our synthetic system should originate from the N-terminal domain of MinC. To test this hypothesis, we used a MinC mutant (MinC-G10D) with lower inhibitory activity of its N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>). The MinC-G10D mutant has reduced ability to inhibit FtsZ in vivo and in vitro, but interacts with MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1999</xref>). We first characterized MinC-G10D by co-reconstituting it at different concentrations with FtsZ-mts, MinD and fluorescently labeled MinE on flat supported membranes. Consistent with the behavior of wild type MinC, we found that the self-organizing Min protein patterns were unperturbed at low concentrations of MinC-G10D, and that the Min patterns were weakened by high concentrations of MinC-G10D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The weakening of Min patterns for high concentrations of MinC is likely due to an overlap of the binding sites for MinC and MinE on MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), which might result in a competition of MinC with MinE for binding sites on MinD at large MinC concentrations. The weakening of Min Protein patterns therefore suggests that MinC-G10D binds to MinD. However, in contrast to MinC the MinC-G10D mutant was inefficient in depolymerizing FtsZ-mts on flat membranes, as well as at the poles, when co-reconstituted in microcompartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations confirm that the inhibitory activity in the synthetic system originates from the N-terminal domain of MinC and that the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal domain is sufficient to inhibit FtsZ-polymerization at compartment poles in the context of a minimal system.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03949.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MinC-G10D does not inhibit polymerization of FtsZ-mts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) FtsZ-mts (blue), MinD, MinE (5% labeled with Atto655: red) were reconstituted with the MinC-G10D mutant.

We therefore hypothesized that stable pole-to-pole oscillations should be found in microstructures of different length, where the range should vary at least by a factor of two, if this length-dependent robustness is intrinsic to the Min system.

Then, we compared Min oscillations in micro compartments with different aspect ratios up to 5.5, which were acquired at the same time on the same chip. Imaging multiple compartments on the same chip allowed us to analyse Min oscillations in about 200 compartments under the same experimental conditions at the same time. We found that the oscillation period between aspect ratios of 1.5 and 5.5 increased from 79 s to about 165 s. For higher aspect ratios we only observed higher oscillation modes. For very low aspect ratios of 1.2 the mean value for the oscillation period was slightly higher than for 1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Note that in very small cells a stochastic switching of Min protein pattern between the poles have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer-Friedrich et al., 2010</xref>) and that a longer oscillation period for very small compartments might represent a transition from normal pole-to-pole oscillation to different dynamics in very small compartments.</p><p>To address how downstream processes of the Min gradient are affected by the length dependent oscillation modes in compartments of different length, we investigated FtsZ-mts localization in these compartments.

Theoretical modeling suggested that this change in geometry might account for an equal partitioning of Min proteins to both daughter cells. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Ventura and Sourjik, 2011</xref>) In other words, septum constriction is hypothesized to provide a geometrical cue to switch from the pole-to-pole oscillations of Min proteins to a symmetric double oscillation, which enables the daughter cells to trap equal amounts of Min proteins. In live cells it is challenging to directly observe the partitioning of proteins, because the constricting septum of <italic>E. coli</italic> becomes smaller than the optical resolution limit during the proposed process. At the same time, the Min protein system is a highly dynamic system, rendering time-lapse imaging with current superresolution techniques difficult. To experimentally test the proposed partitioning of Min proteins during septum constriction, compartments that mimicked morphologically different stages of bacterial cell division were designed. Using cell-shaped compartments with a systematically varying width of the artificial septum, we analyzed whether different patterns occurred in more ‘constricted’ compartments, as compared to ‘non-constricted’ compartments.</p><p>We found that double oscillations occurred indeed in compartments with a small neck in the middle of the compartment. As a negative control, normal pole-to-pole oscillations were sustained in compartments with the same length, but constant cell width. Finally, geometries mimicking the full septum closure, that is, separation in two cells, induced independent pole-to-pole oscillations in each ‘daughter’ compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2 fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). This finding presents the first direct experimental evidence that equal Min protein distribution during cell division is a result of geometrical cues.

We demonstrated that a switch from asymmetric pole-to-pole oscillations to symmetric double oscillations occurred at a certain cell length. However, in longer compartments, double oscillations occurred already in unconstricted cells und thus, a constriction in the middle of the cell had no additional effect on pattern formation. In very short cells, on the other hand, a constriction in the middle of the compartment resulted in a new length axis of the two compartments perpendicular to the length axis of the unconstricted ‘mother’ compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, a re-orientation of the pattern occurred during constriction, from oscillations along the long axis in the unconstricted compartment, to perpendicular new length axes. These findings demonstrate that an optimal range of cell length exists were Min gradients represent an efficient cue for septum formation. In addition, the Min partitioning to both daughter cells can be controlled by changing the local compartment width during septum closure in the middle of the cell.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated that coordinated spatial control by intracellular protein gradients can be reconstituted in cell-free systems, and that these gradients are modulated by geometric parameters. The reconstitution of self-organizing protein systems in membrane clad soft-polymer compartments represents a simple approach to study membrane interacting proteins in a defined sample volume and geometry. Applying this system, we particularly tackled three major questions. First, what are the minimal requirements for protein gradient formation? Second, can the organized localization to predefined sites be achieved by reading out the positional information of a minimal protein gradient system? And finally, what are the geometric boundary conditions to generate and modulate protein gradients?</p><p>To address the minimal requirements for gradient formation, we considered the Min protein system as a prototype for a gradient forming system and accomplished the reconstitution of a time-averaged nonhomogeneous concentration profile with the lowest concentration in the middle of the compartment. We demonstrated that the minimal requirements for Min gradient formation comprised only a negatively charged membrane, a cell-shaped compartment, ATP as an energy source, and the two antagonistic proteins MinD and MinE.</p><p>To investigate whether the reconstituted gradient provides an efficient cue to organize cellular space by positioning down-stream targets, we co-reconstituted the MinD/E system with the cell division protein FtsZ-mts and the FtsZ inhibitor MinC. This cell-free bottom-up system recapitulated remarkably cell-like properties, such as coordinated spatial coordinated localization of FtsZ-mts to the middle of a cell-like compartment. Interestingly, although it is proposed that MinC has two inhibitory domains which act on FtsZ–FtsZ interactions and on the ternary system FtsZ-FtsA/ZipA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen and Lutkenhaus, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2010</xref>), our data suggest that MinC can already inhibit FtsZ-localization at compartment poles by only disrupting FtsZ–FtsZ interactions. While we do not exclude that the interaction of MinC with the conserved C-terminal domain, which interacts with FtsA and ZipA, is a parallel mechanism to inhibit FtsZ polymerization at cell poles and possibly make FtsZ structures more sensitive to the action of the Min system, our results show that the minimal biochemical requirements to displace FtsZ from compartment poles by the Min system do not involve the disruption of FtsZ-membrane binding sites.</p><p>Moreover, we demonstrated that very long compartments harbored a MinC protein concentration profile with multiple minima. While a normal growing wild type cells typically comprises a Min concentration gradient with only one minimum for division protein assembly, multiple minima resulting in more than one sides for cell division, are potentially advantageous in filamentous cells. If transient unfavorable environmental conditions inhibit cell division but not cell elongation, divisions at multiple sides could ensure the re-establishment of a normal cell length when conditions, which support division, reoccur.</p><p>To systematically address how compartment geometry modulates Min protein gradients, we reconstituted Min protein patterns in compartments with systematically varying shape. Varying the length of the compartments, we found that robust pole-to-pole oscillations occur in compartments, even if the length of these compartments was varied by a factor of 2.3. In a live cell, this robustness of the Min oscillations with respect to cell length should be highly significant, because the length of living cells is not constant over time, and during the life cycle of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the cell doubles in length. The observation that the Min protein patterns in vitro deviate from a stable axis in very short compartments, and that higher order oscillations systematically occur the longer the compartment is, confirm that the MinD/E patterns in synthetic compartments are strikingly similar to the Min pattern of round, wild type and filamentous cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corbin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shih et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raskin and de Boer, 1999b</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, when we increased the width of the compartments, the Min proteins oscillated along the short axis of the compartment. The cause of oscillations switching along the length axis to oscillations along the short axis is not known. However, the width at which this switching occurs might be correlated with the wavelength of the Min protein patterns and therefore related to the mechanism for determining the wavelength of the Min system. It is also unknown whether a similar gradient along the short axis of the cell is used in living cells, and which factors might contribute on the bacterial scale to regulate gradients along the short axis.</p><p>However, note that FtsZ involving cell-division in certain bacteria, such as <italic>Laxus oneistus</italic>, occurs along the long axis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leisch et al., 2012</xref>) Although the spatial cues to determine the position of their division plane are unknown, it is intriguing to speculate that gradients along the short axis might also provide an effective cue to spatially organize space along the short axis Thus, protein gradients might also orient the cell division plane in cells which divide along the length axis of the cell.</p><p>In line with our in vitro results, Min oscillations along the short axis of a bacterial cell might be accomplished by an increased width as compared to an <italic>E.coli</italic> cell, or by smaller scales of Min protein patterns through modified reaction and/or diffusion rates of the proteins. However, also other systems which generate gradients along the length axis of a bacterial cell, such as activity gradients of phosphorylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), might provide mechanisms to generate gradients along the short axis.</p><p>In addition to varying the overall width of a compartment, we mimicked septum closure in the middle of the compartments and thereby simulated morphologically different stages of bacterial cell division. While it has been controversial how the pool of Min proteins is distributed to the two daughter cells after cell division, we provide experimental evidence for the theoretical model that Min protein partitioning is a result of geometric variation during septum constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Ventura and Sourjik, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we reconstituted a cell-free bottom-up system which recapitulates cell-like properties, such as coordinated spatial control for division site placement by intracellular protein gradients. In particular, our results unravel the minimal requirements for localization of the cell division protein FtsZ. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the interplay of geometrical cell boundaries and self-organizing Min proteins determine the orientation of Min gradients, the number of potential FtsZ assembly sites, as well as Min protein partitioning during cell division. Thus, our synthetic system opens a way to study complex organization principles in a simplified environment, and provides novel insights into the basic biophysical and biochemical requirements for gradient formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>PDMS micro-compartments</title><p>Using photolithographic techniques, resist micro-patterns were produced on Si wafers mainly as described in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zieske and Schwille, 2013</xref>). Photoresist patterns (ma-P 1275, micro resist technology GmbH, Germany) of about 10 µm height on top of Si wafers (Si-Mat, Kaufering, Germany) were produced by photolithography. The chrome mask was purchased from Compugraphics Jena GmbH. To better mimic the curvature of the cellular membrane, we left a small gap between photoresist and mask during exposure of the mask to UV light, resulting in more tilted walls as compared to the contact mode. For reconstitution of Min protein oscillations along the length axis of a compartment, the mask patterns had a width of 10 µm. The Si wafers were coated with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to prevent sticking of PDMS to the wafer. PDMS (Sylgard184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was mixed at a ratio (monomer to cross-linker) of 10:1 and degased under vacuum. The PDMS mixture was then poured on top of the wafer. Standard glass coverslides where then manually pressed into the liquid PDMS on top of the wafer, leaving a PDMS layer of about 30 µm between the wafer and the glass coverslide. After curing the PDMS at 80°C overnight, the bulk PDMS layer was peeled off.

Purified MinE(Δ3–8) was labeled with Alexa647 maleimide (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufactures manual.</p><p>The sample buffer in all experiments contained 25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 5–15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> if only the MinD and MinE were reconstituted, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> if FtsZ-mts was reconstituted) When Min proteins where included in the experiments, the buffer was supplemented with 2.5 mM ATP. When FtsZ-mts was used 3 mM GTP was added to the buffer. Protein concentrations used in this study were as follows. MinC or eGFP-MinC: 0.05 µM, MinE: 1 µM, MinD: 1 µM (depending on the experiment MinD was supplemented with 10% eGFP-MinD), FtsZ-mts: 1 µM. When MinE was imaged 10% of MinE were substituted with the labeled version of MinE.</p><p>Note that these concentrations refer to the average concentrations in the sample buffer before the buffer volume was reduced below the upper level of the micro compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Microscopy: Image acquisition was performed on a ZEISS (Jena, Germany) LSM780 confocal laser scanning microscope (inverted microscope) equipped with a ZEISS Plan-APO 25×/NA 0.8 objective and ZeissC-Apochromat 40×/1.20 objective.</p><p>For acquiring images of Min pattern and FtsZ bundles the focal plane was typically adjusted to the bottom of the compartments (if not stated otherwise). Note that the bottom area of the microstructures is smaller than the top area. Therefore the sizes of structures on the pictures might appear smaller than indicated in the text (text always refers to upper rim of microstructures).</p><p>The relative intensity profiles along the length axis of compartments can be more accurately determined if the focus plane is in the middle of the compartment, because at this plane the relative intensity profiles at different time steps are less prone to errors due to slight focal shift. Thus, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> were extracted from time-lapse images with the focal plane in the middle of the compartments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Michaela Schaper for help with cloning, Senthil Arumugam for discussions and providing FtsZ-mts and Martin Loose for comments on previous versions of the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see the referees have raised a number of points, a large number of which pertain to providing more details of experimental details and to some additional controls. However, one major concern that we would like you to further address is the role of MinC in FtsZ ring positioning in your studies. For example, is it possible to assemble more focused rings if full length MinC were used? The experiments should also be performed with the MinC-G10D mutant to correlate the results of the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. We would like you to consider and respond to the other comments made by the referees, if possible with experiments or with explanations to rebut the points raised. With the appropriate changes, your work will make a very important contribution to the fields of bacterial cell biology and cytokinesis in general.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The authors take a bottom up approach to reconstitute the oscillatory motion of the MinCDE system. They also present evidence demonstrating the sufficiency of the system in positioning FtsZ in the medial region within cylindrical compartments. They also show that while the Min gradient is independent of the chemical nature of the lipid bilayer, geometric cues play a rather critical role in its patterning. The work is major achievement in reconstituting minimal systems. This also provides major insights into determinants of spatial organization in biological systems.</p><p>MinDE oscillations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. While it’s clear that MinD and MinE are sufficient to set the oscillations and achieve the maximum concentration of MinD at poles, additional negative controls will add to the experiment.</p><p>1) Additional controls like any other membrane bound protein OR a MinD mutant defective in MinE binding will be a good addition.</p><p>2) Since oscillations are set by MinD's ATP hydrolysis, a non-hydrolysable ATP analog addition will also serve as a good control.</p><p>3) To test the importance MinE's membrane association, the authors could use a MinE deleted of its MTS.</p><p>It's shown that cardiolipin is not necessary and negative charge is sufficient to set MinDE oscillations. However, how important is negative charge in MinD patterning is not addressed.</p><p>The authors could try different lipid ratios to test if MinDE location and oscillations are affected.</p><p>The authors show that the MinCDE proteins are sufficient for positioning FtsZ to the medial region and excluding it from the pole ends. Again a few additional experiments to test the importance of MinE's membrane association &amp; interaction with MinD in regulating FtsZ positioning could be added.</p><p>1) They could use a MinE MTS deletion and MinD interaction mutants.</p><p>2) It would also be interesting to see the effect of at least 2 mutations affecting membrane binding that Lutkenhaus lab had identified (Cell, Volume 146, Issue 3, 5 August 2011, Pages 396-407) in MinE on the oscillations and FtsZ positioning.</p><p>3) Although it shown that cardiolipin is not necessary for the oscillations, it is possible that cardiolipin has direct effects on FtsZ filaments. It may therefore play a role in FtsZ ring organization and positioning. To test if cardiolipin plays a role in medial localization of FtsZ, one could test FtsZ position in the presence of other lipids as done in earlier experiments.</p><p>Does the period of pole-to-pole oscillation change with increasing lengths? This is not indicated in the paper.</p><p>An interesting experiment that the authors do is to mimic the septating cell and find double oscillations similar to the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. An extreme extension of the same could be to mimic an ftsZ84ts strain after shift up shift down, where multiple septa are formed. Would oscillations happen between each constricting septa.</p><p>In the discussion, the authors speculate that gradients across the short axis might determine the division axis in a bacterium like Laxus oneistus. This is a very interesting idea given the presence of Min system in this bacterium. However, the authors should a statement speculating what factors could lead to gradients in short axis even in widths as small as 0.5 um as against the large widths (&gt;10um) in the experiments performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>The fascinating oscillation of MinD/E in <italic>E. coli</italic> was discovered 15 years ago and has been of major interest to experimentalists, physicists and mathematicians ever since. In 2008 the Schwille lab reported a major advance by reconstituting the MinD/E system on planar lipid bilayers, where the two proteins interacted to generate moving waves. Their proposed reaction-diffusion model has provided insight into the mechanism, and they have explored the system in several subsequent papers. In 2013 Zieske and Schwille described creation of cylindrical PDMS chambers coated with lipid, in which the also reconstituted the MinD/E. Here the waves mimicked the oscillations obtained in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>The present paper used this PDMS chamber reconstitution in a much more thorough exploration. They determined that the charge of the lipid is the most important parameter, and they explored the co-localization of MinD and MinE (the previous study labeled and imaged only MinE). Most important they added FtsZ to the system, and showed that the oscillating Min compressed its localization to the middle of the chamber, similar to the mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is an important advance, which I think merits publication. I do have a couple of general issues that I think need to be addressed. Also, I found the paper to be lacking a surprising number of essential experimental details, which marred the presentation and made understanding difficult. In addition to the specific issues I raise, the authors should make a much stronger effort for a complete and polished presentation.</p><p>1) One general issue is that the chambers seem to operate with the same aspect ratio as they do in <italic>E. coli,</italic> yet they are on a ten times larger scale. I think this begs some detailed comparison with the system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, especially in terms of speed of movement of the waves, and oscillation period. The graphs in 1s1e, showing co-localization of MinD and E, are potentially interesting. Can these be compared with <italic>E. coli</italic>? Can it be related to the localization on planar lipid bilayers?</p><p>2) Another issue is the limited restriction of FtsZ in the present system. In <italic>E. coli</italic> the Min system seems to limit FtsZ to a single sharp Z ring localized precisely in the mid cell. In the present system it is a fuzzy patch 5+ µm wide. Is this because of the 10X larger scale? This deficiency of the present system at least needs to be noted.</p><p>3) A final general concern is that the previous Arum gam study concluded that curvatures ∼1 µm diameter caused optimal perpendicular alignment of pfs, while the alignment was lost for diameters ∼3-5 µm. Yet in the 10 µm chambers here they appear nicely aligned. Also, from the Schweizer study one can conclude that the direction of oscillation was established by width and length of flat lipid patches, so the curvature of the present chambers is probably not playing a role in the present oscillations. These two points should be addressed briefly.</p><p>Technical and editorial concerns:</p><p>4) I was confused about the construction of the chambers. From the EM they appear to be hemi cylinders, although the circular profile of the cylinder might not be exact. My confusion is what goes on top? Is there a cover slip? In this case the profile is a half circle with a flat top. The Methods have a somewhat obscure statement “the cured bulk PDMS was carefully peeled off and then the glass cover slide with an about 30 μm high microstructured PDMS layer were peeled off with the help of a razor blade.” (The two peeled are confusing.) That sounds like the PDMS is separated, but I would imagine it has to be sealed again with a cover slip. Is the cover slip separately coated with lipid? And then finally sealed? In the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the statement means nothing to me: “The buffer was not yet reduced to a level below the upper level of the chip. Therefore membrane and FtsZ-mts network are still intact on the upper level of the chip.” The Zieske ref provides a clue. It suggests that the PDMS chambers are simply open on top, no cover slip. A liquid-air interface. This needs more detailed description, including when and how the liquid was lowered (this for each figure). If the setup is like Zieske, I think a diagram like that 1b should be added, and perhaps also a cross section of the chamber (indicating its hemicircular shape, if that is reasonably established.</p><p>It is stated that a 25X/0.8 lens was used for some images – this would be suitable for the air-water interface. A 40X/1.20 objective was used for some images. This would be water immersion, very different from the liquid air interface. These experimental details should be given for each image.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> there are various constrictions in the center of the trough. We need some indication of the shape of the constriction relative to the hemi-cylinder and presumably flat surface of the liquid-air interface on top. Can any estimate be given for the diameter at the constriction?</p><p>“phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CA), which have a net negative charge.” I think only the last two are negatively charged.</p><p>6) I found an apparent contradiction in the sizes and scale bars. The width of the compartments is claimed in Results to be ∼10 µm. From the scale bars in Figure s1 I'd make them to be 2 or 5 µM (1a and 1b). Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and d</xref> I'd make them 2 and 5 µm. In <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">movie 1</xref> the scale bar says 50 pixels. This needs to be given in microns, and made to agree with all the above. All of these problems may be related to the confusion about the chamber shape, see above, and the level of focus. This needs to be clarified and stated for all cases.</p><p>7) More details are needed for how the time-averaged fluorescence intensity is calculated, or more specifically the value for a given time. One possibility would be to take a single image focused on the middle of the compartment (but see my questions above about the shape of the compartment - would that be the top surface at the air water interface, or lower?). Alternatively one would do a Z stack and determine the total concentration at each point on the long axis, and somehow average over the hemi-circle.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, what Min is labeled? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> what Min is labeled? I suppose an intelligent reader can deduce that FtsZ is blue, but this should be taken care of by the authors. Is the FtsZ-mts the same or similar to the construct of Osawa and Erickson? If so a reference is needed.

One describes the oscillation of MinD and MinE in a cylindrical compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zieske &amp; Schwille, 2013</xref>). Another is a paper that shows that FtsZ filaments are dynamically positioned on a flat surface where Min proteins are at a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arumugam et al, 2014</xref>). In this follow up paper the authors exploit the system developed in the 2013 paper to show that the Min proteins can position FtsZ within micro compartments that have the shape of a cell. This positioning of FtsZ in these micro compartments is another step in the bottom up approach to reconstitute bacterial cell division. It is a nice demonstration although it is predictable based upon there prior two publications.

For example, is it possible to assemble more focused rings if full length MinC were used? The experiments should also be performed with the MinC-G10D mutant to correlate the results of the in vitro experiments with in vivo experiments.

Since the microcompartments were adjusted to the spatial scales of Min pattern on <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes, no stable oscillations would be formed in the compartments. We now discussed this point and the importance of the right amount of negative charge in the main text. “For high amounts of negatively charged lipids, the length scales of the protein patterns decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> and (Vecchiarelli AG, <italic>et al.</italic> Mol Microbiol. 93, 453-63 (2014)).

They determined that the charge of the lipid is the most important parameter, and they explored the co-localization of MinD and MinE (the previous study labeled and imaged only MinE). Most important they added FtsZ to the system, and showed that the oscillating Min compressed its localization to the middle of the chamber, similar to the mechanism in vivo. This is an important advance, which I think merits publication. I do have a couple of general issues that I think need to be addressed. Also, I found the paper to be lacking a surprising number of essential experimental details, which marred the presentation and made understanding difficult. In addition to the specific issues I raise, the authors should make a much stronger effort for a complete and polished presentation</italic>.</p><p>The revised manuscript now contains more experimental details, a new figure that depicts the process of sample preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) and images to give more insight into the geometry of the micro compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>1) One general issue is that the chambers seem to operate with the same aspect ratio as they do in</italic> E. coli<italic>, yet they are on a ten times larger scale.

Can it be related to the localization on planar lipid bilayers?</italic></p><p>We now compared the results with <italic>E. coli</italic>: “Although the size of bacterial cells and photo bleaching is limiting for characterizing the Min profiles <italic>in vivo</italic> in such detail as it is possible <italic>in vitro</italic>, the intensity peak of MinE at the trail of the Min pattern was also observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and is generally referred to as ‘MinE ring’.”</p><p>Part of the dynamics in microcompartments can be related to Min dynamics on planar bilayers: “This disassembly of Min protein patterns at the trailing zone during each oscillation is comparable to the disassembly at the trailing edge of travelling Min patterns on flat membranes. The main difference of Min proteins profiles on flat membranes and in microcompartments is that the concentration profiles on flat membranes only change their localization while traveling across the membrane. In contrast, during oscillations in compartments new membrane attached Min protein patterns need to be repeatedly established and disassembled every half oscillation period, which results in a remarkable remodelling of the concentration profiles during the oscillation cycle and an asymmetry in their rise and decay phases at the poles.”</p><p><italic>2) Another issue is the limited restriction of FtsZ in the present system. In</italic> E. coli <italic>the Min system seems to limit FtsZ to a single sharp Z ring localized precisely in the mid cell. In the present system it is a fuzzy patch 5+ µm wide. Is this because of the 10X larger scale? This deficiency of the present system at least needs to be noted</italic>.</p><p>We added the following paragraph: “In contrast to the living cell, the FtsZ-mts distribution in the middle of synthetic compartments appears to be rather broad. The major reason for the wide FtsZ-mts distribution is most likely the ten times larger Min protein pattern <italic>in vitro,</italic> as compared to living cells. The wide MinC minimum allows multiple FtsZ-mts bundles to localize in a wide region in the middle of the compartment.”</p><p><italic>3) A final general concern is that the previous Arum gam study concluded that curvatures ∼1 µm diameter caused optimal perpendicular alignment of pfs, while the alignment was lost for diameters ∼3-5 µm. Yet in the 10 µm chambers here they appear nicely aligned. Also, from the Schweizer study one can conclude that the direction of oscillation was established by width and length of flat lipid patches, so the curvature of the present chambers is probably not playing a role in the present oscillations. These two points should be addressed briefly</italic>.</p><p>For the Min protein oscillations, the curvature indeed does not play a role. However, note that the geometrical requirements for aligning oscillating Min patterns in compartments and travelling Min pattern on flat membranes are different. The previous Schweizer et al. study did not demonstrate oscillating Min pattern, but investigated the alignment of traveling Min waves instead. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> oscillatory Min patterns are not aligned in compartments with a width of about 40 μm while traveling waves are still aligned at a membrane widths as big as 100 μm.</p><p>We are sorry for the previously insufficient description of the chambers. We now included profiles of the chambers, which show that the chambers are 10 μm on the top and are tapered towards the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>). We now also demonstrate that FtsZ-mts is aligned in tapered compartments as compared to compartments with a flat bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>Technical and editorial concerns</italic>:</p><p><italic>4) I was confused about the construction of the chambers. From the EM they appear to be hemi cylinders, although the circular profile of the cylinder might not be exact. My confusion is what goes on top? Is there a cover slip? In this case the profile is a half circle with a flat top</italic>.</p><p>We now revised the presentation of the construction of the chambers and added much more information. To better describe the profile of the chambers we now supplemented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> with a profile image of the chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>). To provide a more detailed description of the construction of the chambers, the fabrication process is now depicted in a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) and explained in the corresponding figure caption and in the Materials and methods section. We now also point out that the microstructured PDMS compartments are open on the top and clad with membrane at the bottom and the sides. “The top of the chambers was open with a buffer/air interface.”</p><p><italic>The Methods have a somewhat obscure statement “the cured bulk PDMS was carefully peeled off and then the glass cover slide with an about 30 μm high microstructured PDMS layer were peeled off with the help of a razor blade.” (The two peeled are confusing.) That sounds like the PDMS is separated, but I would imagine it has to be sealed again with a cover slip. Is the cover slip separately coated with lipid? And then finally sealed</italic>?</p><p>There are indeed two layers of PDMS involved in the fabrication process (a thick bulk PDMS layer and a thin PDMS layer harboring the microstructures), but we see that the description might have been confusing.</p><p>To clarify the fabrication process of the PDMS microstructures, we now included a photograph and a schematic image of the Wafer/PDMS/glass cover slip/PDMS sandwich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In the Methods section, we changed the description and included a reference that points to the figure describing the fabrication process in more detail. “After curing the PDMS at 80°C overnight, the bulk PDMS layer was peeled off.

A liquid-air interface. This needs more detailed description, including when and how the liquid was lowered (this for each figure). If the setup is like Zieske, I think a diagram like that 1b should be added, and perhaps also a cross section of the chamber (indicating its hemicircular shape, if that is reasonably established</italic>.</p><p>The reduction of the buffer to enclose proteins in compartments is now described in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2D</xref>.
