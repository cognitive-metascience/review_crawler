What is the nature and role of activity across the two hemispheres? We recorded muscles and neurons bilaterally while monkeys cycled with each arm. Most neurons were active during movement of either arm. Responses were strongly arm-dependent, raising two possibilities. First, population-level signals might differ depending on the arm used. Second, the same population-level signals might be present, but distributed differently across neurons. The data supported this second hypothesis. Muscle activity was accurately predicted by activity in either the ipsilateral or contralateral hemisphere. More generally, we failed to find signals unique to the contralateral hemisphere. Yet if signals are shared across hemispheres, how do they avoid impacting the wrong arm? We found that activity related to each arm occupies a distinct subspace, enabling muscle-activity decoders to naturally ignore signals related to the other arm.</p></abstract><kwd-group

motor cortex (M1) are lateralized: most spinal projections influence the contralateral musculature. M1 lesions thus produce contralateral motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Rouiller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Passingham et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vilensky and Gilman, 2002</xref>). Similarly, electrical microstimulation activates contralateral musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kwan et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sessle and Wiesendanger, 1982</xref>). The degree to which computations within M1 are lateralized remains less clear. The corpus callosum connects M1 across hemispheres, yielding the potential for extensive cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gould et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenny, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Wise, 1977</xref>). Callosally mediated interactions are readily revealed by paired-pulse TMS protocols and can involve net facilitation or suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferbert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanajima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>). An obvious role for inter-hemispheric communication is coordination of bimanual movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donchin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haken et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kelso, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kermadi et al., 1998</xref>). Yet, there is evidence that unimanual movements also involve sharing information across hemispheres.</p><p>Most physiological studies of unimanual movements have focused on activity contralateral to the moving limb, on the grounds that contralateral activity is most functionally relevant and likely to be most prevalent. Yet, ipsilateral activity can be robust. During finger movements, ipsilateral single-neuron activity is modest but present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsunami and Hamada, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanji et al., 1988</xref>) and behavior can be decoded from BOLD activation within ipsilateral motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berlot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref>). Considerable ipsilateral activity has been reported during movements involving the upper arm, such as reaching to remove food from a drawer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kermadi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kazennikov et al., 1999</xref>), or performing center-out reaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donchin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinberg et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>While the presence of ipsilateral activity is established, the nature of that activity is less clear. Few studies have directly compared neural response patterns when the same movement is performed by one arm versus the other. In premotor areas, delay-period responses can encode information about an upcoming reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>) or grasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michaels and Scherberger, 2018</xref>) independently of which arm would subsequently move, suggesting that preparatory activity is largely limb-independent. However, activity during movement was more limb-dependent, for both premotor cortex and M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinberg et al. (2002)</xref> reported similar single-neuron directional tuning in M1 regardless of which arm was moving, yet also found evidence for limb-dependent population-level encoding of direction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donchin et al. (1998)</xref> found that activity during bimanual movements differed from that during unimanual movements, but did not analyze whether response tuning varied between contralateral and ipsilateral movements. Thus, it remains unclear to what degree the pattern of M1 responses – at either the single-neuron or population levels – depends on the limb being used.</p><p>If responses are limb-independent then the relationship between hemispheres is necessarily simple: both contain the same information, encoded in the same manner. In contrast, strongly limb-dependent responses would raise additional questions. Are ‘lower-level’ signals (e.g. those describing muscle activity) more prevalent in the contralateral hemisphere? More generally, which signals are shared across hemispheres? How is activity structured such that only one arm moves when both hemispheres are active?</p><p>We investigated these questions using a novel ‘cycling’ task, performed with either the left or right arm. We recorded neural activity from both hemispheres simultaneously. In separate sessions, we recorded muscle activity bilaterally. Individual neurons responded robustly regardless of which arm performed the task. Yet, responses were strongly limb-dependent: for a given neuron, response patterns pertaining to the two arms were essentially unrelated. Nevertheless, we found no clear evidence that the two hemispheres contained different types of information. For example, muscle activity could be decoded equally well from contralateral or ipsilateral neural activity. More broadly, any signal that was strongly present in one hemisphere was present (and similarly strong) in the other. Thus, activity in a given hemisphere contains similar information during movement of one arm versus the other, but that information is distributed very differently across individual neurons. This might appear to yield a paradox: how can M1 be robustly active without driving the contralateral arm? A solution emerged when we examined population activity: arm-specific signals were partitioned into orthogonal dimensions, allowing a simple decoder to naturally separate signals related to the two arms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Terminology</title><p>We adopt the following terminology. For neurons in a given hemisphere, we refer to the contralateral arm as the ‘driven arm’ (reflecting the strong connections to the contralateral spinal cord). We refer to the ipsilateral arm as the ‘non-driven arm.’ Thus, for a neuron recorded from the right hemisphere, the left arm is the driven arm and the right arm is the non-driven arm. For the muscles, the driven arm is simply the arm upon which the muscle acts. We use the term ‘driving cortex’ to refer to the hemisphere contralateral to the performing arm. We use the term ‘non-driving cortex’ to refer to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the performing arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Behavior</title><p>Two monkeys (E and F) were trained on a cycling task that could be performed with either arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Left and right hands each grasped a pedal. Monkeys performed blocks of left-hand and right-hand trials. Cycling the correct pedal produced motion through the virtual environment. Success required that the non-performing arm be kept still. On each trial, monkeys cycled from one target to another, located seven cycles away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Targets were positioned so that cycling started and ended either at the top of the cycle (‘top start’) or at the bottom of the cycle (‘bottom start’).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Task schematic.

Most recordings were from M1 proper, and a few were from the adjacent caudal region of PMd. Trial-averaged firing rates were computed by filtering single-trial spike-trains to produce a continuous rate, and then adjusting the time-base to temporally align behavior across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Neural responses were typically rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>), and could be nearly sinusoidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or could contain additional higher frequency structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). For comparison, we recorded the activity of the major muscles in both arms (48 total recordings). The temporal features of individual-muscle responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>) in many ways resembled those of individual-neuron responses. However, muscles and neurons were quite different in the degree to which responses were restricted to movements of a single arm.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Two-step trial alignment procedure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vertical hand position on all trials (within one session) for an example condition.

For example the left anterior deltoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was active when the left arm performed the task (<italic>blue</italic>) but not when the right arm performed the task (<italic>red</italic>). While expected, this direct confirmation is important because of the possibility that muscles might have been active in ways that did not move the pedal (e.g. co-contraction). Such activity could potentially have been substantial, which would have complicated the interpretation of neural activity. A few muscles exhibited weak activity when the task was performed by their non-driven arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). However, this typically occurred only at the end of movement, consistent with tensing to aid stability when stopping.</p><p>In contrast to the muscles, neurons were typically active throughout the movement, regardless of whether the task was performed with their driven (contralateral) or non-driven (ipsilateral) arm. A few neurons were active only when cycling with the driven arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and on rare occasions a neuron was active only when cycling with the non-driven arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, most neurons were active in both situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Neural responses could be quite different when cycling with the driven versus non-driven arm. Neural response patterns could change in both phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) depending on which arm performed the task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neurons are active during movements of either arm</title><p>To quantify the arm preference of individual units, we compared firing-rate modulation when the task was performed with the driven versus non-driven arm. Modulation was assessed as the standard deviation of the firing rate across times and conditions. Average modulation was computed once across all conditions where the driven arm performed the task, and again across all conditions where the non-driven arm performed the task. We analyzed only the middle cycles of movement (excluding the first cycle and the last two cycles). Focusing on this ‘steady state’ neural response aids interpretation because non-performing-arm muscles had minimal steady-state modulation. We computed an ‘arm preference index’: the difference in modulation for the driven versus non-driven arm, divided by the sum. This index ranges from −1 to 1, with the extremes indicating complete preference for the non-driven and driven arms respectively. An arm preference index of zero indicates that a neuron was equally responsive regardless of the arm used.</p><p>To establish a baseline for comparison, we computed the arm preference index for each muscle. Arm preference indices were typically high for the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) confirming that muscles were active primarily when the task was performed with their driven arm. A few muscles showed weak activation regardless of the arm being used, resulting in lower indices. However, most muscles had robust responses during cycling, and were much more active when the task was performed with the driven arm.

Instead, the distribution was centered only slightly above zero (median = 0.07 and 0.31 for Monkey E/F). Thus, neural responses were much more likely than muscle responses to be similar in magnitude regardless of the arm used. Furthermore, many neurons had arm preference indices &lt; 0, indicating stronger modulation when the non-driven arm performed the task (Monkey E: 201/533 neurons; Monkey F: 107/617 neurons). Results were virtually identical (median arm-preference indices of 0.06 and 0.31) if analysis was restricted to more posterior recordings (excluding the influence of any neurons recorded from PMd or from the border region between M1 and PMd).</p><p>Thus, neurons can be quite active even when the task is performed with their non-driven arm. Might such responses be related to small movements of the driven arm? This explanation is unlikely a priori. As described above, movements of the non-performing arm were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) and corresponding muscle activity was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In principle, neural responses related to weak muscle activity might be magnified via normalization or some other non-linearity. However, such magnification would need to be very strong. To match the median neural arm preference indices, muscle activity in the non-performing arm would need to be magnified by a factor of 12 (monkey E) and 52 (monkey F). Furthermore, magnification cannot account for the finding that neurons commonly had negative arm preference indices, while muscles rarely (monkey E) or never (monkey F) did.</p><p>We performed an additional control to ask whether the responses of neurons, when their non-driven arm performed the task, were in fact reflecting small movements of their driven arm. Such movements varied across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), allowing us to divide trials into those with movements larger than the median (very modest movement, <italic>red</italic>) versus lower than the median (nearly stationary, <italic>black</italic>). Average firing rates were very similar in these two cases, as illustrated for one example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Applying this same analysis to the (weak) muscle activity in the non-performing arm revealed significant differences at double the chance rate (10% of data-points) overall, and peaking at four times the chance rate near the end of the movement when muscle activity became more prominent (21% of data-points).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.006</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Small movements of the non-performing arm cannot explain modulation of neural activity within the non-driving cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis employed the distribution (across trials) of the mean angular speed of the non-performing arm.

That weak muscle activity was statistically coupled to small movements of the driven (non-performing) arm. In contrast, most neurons exhibited robust responses when the task was performed with their non-driven arm. Those responses were not statistically linked to small movements of their driven (non-performing) arm. Prior studies have found that neurons can be active when a task is performed with their non-driven arm, although to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donchin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kermadi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanji et al., 1988</xref>). The present findings replicate the finding of weakly lateralized responses in motor cortex, and largely rule out potential explanations based on small residual movements of the driven arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Neural response patterns are limb-dependent</title><p>One plausible explanation for weakly lateralized responses is that neural activity encodes higher-level, limb-independent features of movement. For example, activity might encode hand velocity, movement goal, or some other quantity, regardless of which limb is moving. Preparatory activity in the more anterior rostral premotor cortex can exhibit largely limb-independent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>). Might this also be true in motor cortex during movement? The two arms performed very similar movements in our task. Thus, limb-independence should be reflected by similar neural responses regardless of the performing arm. Instead, neural responses were strongly limb-dependent. Responses often differed in phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and/or structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) depending on which arm performed the task.</p><p>To provide quantification, for each neuron we computed the correlation between the firing rate patterns when the driven versus non-driven arm performed the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysis considered only the middle cycles (2-5). This ensured that high correlations indicate similar response patterns, not simply firing rates that rise non-specifically during movement. On average the correlation was near zero (median correlation: 0.16 and 0.08 for Monkey E and F). Strongly correlated responses were the minority: only 18/533 (E) and 9/617 (F) neurons had correlations &gt;= 0.75. Thus, for a given neuron, there was remarkably little relationship between responses when the task was performed with the driven versus non-driven arm.</p><p>For comparison, we computed the distribution of response correlations between random pairs of neurons. This yields a distribution of correlations expected by chance if responses are related only in the sense that they come from the same overall set of responses. The empirical distributions (<italic>black</italic>) were shifted significantly rightwards relative to these ‘shuffled’ (<italic>green</italic>) distributions (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for both monkeys, bootstrap, Materials and methods). Yet while significant, this shift was very modest: the empirical distributions were centered much closer to zero than to unity. Thus, the correlation between responses for the two arms, for a given neuron, was only slightly greater that the correlation between two arbitrarily chosen neurons.</p><p>Might correlations appear artificially low if responses are weak or noisy? While sampling error will inevitably reduce correlations, this is unlikely to be the source of the low correlations we observed. Cycling evoked particularly strong neural responses with correspondingly small standard errors of the mean firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>, envelopes show SEM). We further addressed this concern by computing, for each neuron, the correlation between the firing rate for top-start versus bottom-start conditions. Behavior was very similar for these two conditions during the middle cycles (after aligning phase), and correlations should thus be high. This was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>orange</italic>, medians of 0.72 and 0.77), confirming that sampling error did not impede the ability to measure high correlations.</p><p>These results rule out the hypothesis of predominantly limb-independent responses. Individual-neurons showed very different responses depending on which arm performed the task.

What occurs when the task is performed with the non-driven arm? From the analysis above, we know that the response pattern of each neuron is likely to change. Does this occur in a coordinated fashion, such that the two neurons remain correlated with one another? This would be consistent with the idea that neurons with related responses ‘encode’ related features, and continue to do so in new contexts. In fact, this property was rarely observed. We did occasionally observe neurons that were strongly correlated when the driven arm performed the task, and remained strongly correlated when the non-driven arm performed the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Yet, it was also common for correlations to invert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), for strong correlations to disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), or for neurons to undergo very different changes in response magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.007</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Correlations between neurons depend on which arm is used.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average firing rates of two neurons (green and orange traces) during one condition, performed with the driven arm (top pair of traces) and non-driven arm (bottom pair of traces).

To aid visualization, we ordered neurons to group responses that were similar when the task was performed with the driven arm, resulting in a block structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). We asked whether this correlation structure remained similar when the task was performed with the non-driven arm. Note that it is possible for the correlation matrix to remain identical, even if every neuron changes its response, so long as correlated neurons remain correlated. Instead, the correlation structure was dramatically altered. As a result, the original ordering no longer groups neurons with similar response properties (<italic>right column</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>).</p><p>This change in correlation structure was not due to correlations being largely spurious, as could occur if estimated firing rates were noisy.

The correlation structure was very similar in these two cases (compare <italic>middle</italic> and <italic>left columns</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). This finding also demonstrates that not every change in the task results in a change in the correlation structure; changing the starting position had relatively little impact, while changing the performing arm had a dramatic impact.</p><p>Each matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref> corresponds to a given condition (a starting position and cycling direction). We wished to summarize, across all such conditions, the degree to which correlations are or aren’t preserved when the task is performed with one arm versus the other. To do so, for each condition and each pair of neurons we plotted their firing-rate correlation when the non-driven arm performed the task versus their correlation when the driven arm performed the task (to aid visualization, the scatterplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> show a random 1% of data-points; density plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> encompass all data-points). Preserved correlations would yield diagonal structure. In fact, there was little tendency for correlated neurons to remain correlated, or for anti-correlated neurons to remain anti-correlated. The ‘meta-correlation’ was 0.1 and 0.05 (monkey E and F).

Rather than attempting to infer specific candidate signals, we developed a method to address this question generically. We assessed how well driving cortex activity could be predicted by the dominant signals from the non-driving cortex. To do so, we projected non-driving cortex activity onto its top principal components, and then regressed driving cortex activity against these projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). For comparison, we computed how well driving cortex activity could predict itself, by regressing the activity of each driving-cortex unit against principal component projections derived from all other driving-cortex units, in a leave-one-out fashion.</p><p>Generalization performance depended on the number of principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>) and was higher for more components (indicating that overfitting was not a large concern). The key question is whether, for a given number of components, it matters whether driving-cortex activity is explained by driving-cortex projections versus non-driving-cortex projections. This was indeed the case, but it was a very modest effect. For example, when using 10 principal components, generalization <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> was 82% and 85% (monkey E and F) when regressing against driving-cortex projections, versus 81% and 81% when regressing against non-driving-cortex projections.

A caveat is that smaller signals could be quite different, which would be difficult to discern given our relatively simple task. Activity spans a modest number of dimensions when cycling at steady-state (five principal components account for ~80% of the variance). It is quite possible that differences in smaller signals, carried by other dimensions, could be uncovered with added task complexity (e.g. cycling at different speeds or under different loads).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Neural trajectory tangling is low for both hemispheres</title><p>We recently described a major difference between M1 population activity and downstream muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). Neural population activity, but not muscle population activity, avoids ‘trajectory tangling.’ Trajectory tangling is defined as the occurrence of similar population states with very different derivatives. Trajectory tangling becomes high if the population trajectory crosses itself, or if the trajectory for one condition traverses near that for another condition while traveling in a different direction. Pattern-generating recurrent networks are noise-robust only if trajectory tangling is low, suggesting an explanation for why low trajectory tangling was observed in M1. It is unknown whether the non-driving cortex participates (via callosal connections) in pattern generation. Notably, it is possible for a cortical area to be active during cycling yet have high trajectory tangling; this was true of proprioceptive primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We computed the tangling index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2018</xref>) for every timepoint during the middle cycles, across all conditions. The muscles often showed high trajectory tangling, revealed by a long right tail in the cumulative distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <italic>black lines</italic>). The driving cortex displayed consistently low trajectory tangling: cumulative distributions (<italic>blue</italic>) plateaued early. This replicates prior results: trajectory tangling is much lower for the driving cortex than for the downstream muscle population. Notably, this is true even though individual-neuron and individual-muscle responses are superficially similar.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Trajectory tangling is similar for the driving and non-driving cortices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative distribution of trajectory tangling for the driving cortex (blue), non-driving cortex (red), and muscle activity (black).

For monkey E, tangling was slightly higher in the non-driving versus driving cortex (468 ± 201 versus 420 ± 153; mean ±S.D.) while the opposite was true for monkey F (374 ± 105 versus 430 ± 146). Thus, trajectory tangling is similarly low for both cortices, with only small and inconsistent differences. Critically, for both the driving and non-driving cortex, neural trajectory tangling was much lower than muscle trajectory tangling. The latter averaged 2296 ± 1766 for Monkey E and 4392 ± 2950 for Monkey F.</p><p>The presence of similarly low tangling in the driving versus non-driving cortex agrees with the finding above that the major signals are similar. Thus, there is little hemispheric difference regarding either the major signals or the organization of population trajectories. Notably, such similarity is not inevitable when comparing population responses; muscle trajectories had a different, and much more tangled, organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Neural activity occupies different dimensions for movements of different arms</title><p>The above results document that during movement of a given arm, neurons in both hemispheres are active and carry similar signals. Indeed, one would rarely be able to tell, from the response of a given neuron, the hemisphere in which that neuron resides. On the one hand, this broad sharing of information makes sense given the heavily interconnected nature of the two hemispheres. On the other hand, the descending control provided by each hemisphere must still be able to separate signals related to the relevant arm, and avoid contamination from signals related to the other arm. Is the population response structured to facilitate that separation? Can separation be achieved based solely on the properties of the responses themselves, without knowing the hemispheric identity of each neuron?</p><p>In confronting these questions, we took inspiration from recent work suggesting that some neural dimensions in motor cortex are ‘muscle potent’ – activity in those dimensions produces output that will influence the muscles – while other dimensions are ‘muscle null’ – activity in those dimensions has no direct outgoing impact on muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Druckmann and Chklovskii, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of output-null dimensions is natural (and typically inevitable) in pattern-generating recurrent networks. We wondered whether this principle might apply to the present case. We considered all recorded neurons, across both hemispheres, as a unified population. We asked whether signals related to the movement of each arm are partitioned in a manner that could allow signals related to one arm to naturally avoid impacting the other arm.</p><p>We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the population response (the trial-averaged firing rate of every unit) during the middle cycles of each behavioral condition. PCA was applied separately for conditions where the task was performed with the left versus right arm. For example for forward cycling starting at the top, PCA was applied once when cycling with the left arm (yielding a ‘left-arm’ subspace) and again when cycling with the right arm (yielding a ‘right-arm’ subspace). Importantly, in both cases, PCA considered the responses of the same unified population of neurons (all recorded neurons across both hemispheres). The key question was to what degree the left-arm subspace, constructed without any reference to activity when the task was performed with the right arm, did or did not capture such activity (and vice versa for the right-arm subspace).</p><p>Activity from a held-out condition was used to test how well left- and right-arm subspaces captured responses when each arm performed the task. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> employs a left-arm subspace, based upon responses when the left arm performed a particular condition (forward cycling, starting at the top). This same space captured a robust response when the left arm performed the held-out condition (<italic>blue</italic> trajectory; forward cycling, starting at the bottom) but not when the right arm performed that same held-out condition (<italic>red</italic> trajectory). We quantified this effect by computing the cumulative variance explained by the left-arm space, as a function of the number of principal components used. Cumulative variance explained rose rapidly (as expected) when considering held-out conditions performed by the left arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, <italic>blue</italic> traces), but not when considering held-out conditions performed by the right arm (<italic>red</italic> traces).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.011</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Left-arm and right-arm related activity lie in orthogonal subspaces.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projection of population activity onto the first two dimensions of the left-arm subspace.

This effect actually aids the (presumed) goal of ignoring ‘wrong-arm’ related activity. The neural population being analyzed is recorded from the right hemisphere (and thus drives the left arm). Ignoring wrong-arm activity thus requires that there be little occupation of the left-arm space when the right arm performs the task. This is indeed the scenario in which there is the largest difference in occupancy between the two arms (the effect is larger in panels A and E versus C and G).

It was always the case that relatively little variance was captured when activity for right-performing conditions was projected onto the left-arm space, and vice versa. Averaged across all such conditions, the top five principal components explained only 7 ± 1% (monkey E) and 2 ± 0.5% (monkey F) of the response variance (mean ±std. computed across eight conditions). This was in contrast to the considerable variance captured for held-out conditions performed by the same arm on which the space was trained: 65 ± 3% (monkey E) and 69 ± 2% (monkey F).</p><p>Thus, neural responses related to the two arms occupy nearly orthogonal subspaces. Dimensions that robustly capture activity when one arm performs the task do not continue to do so when the other arm performs the task. This was true both when analyzing a unified population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and when analyzing each hemisphere independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1,2</xref>).</p><p>Orthogonal subspaces could occur trivially if neurons fall into two groups: neurons that respond only when the right arm performs the task, and neurons that respond only when the left arm performs the task. However, as documented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) most neurons responded when the task was performed with either the left or right arm, with only a modest tendency for responses to be stronger when using the contralateral arm. Consistent with this, both subspaces involved contributions from neurons in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,I,F,L</xref>) with a modestly larger contribution from the driving cortex (e.g. the right hemisphere for the left-arm subspace) as expected given the modestly larger individual-neuron responses in the driving cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Neural trajectories on single trials</title><p>Is it also true that single-trial activity avoids the subspace associated with the non-performing arm? Presumably that subspace must be occupied at least weakly on single trials; the non-performing arm does occasionally move (if only very slightly). The key question is whether the occupation is more than modest, which is possible if trial-averaged data are unrepresentative of what occurs on single trials. To ask whether trial-averaged firing rates are representative, we first considered across-trial variability at the individual-neuron level. Studies have typically found that the Fano factor (the ratio of spike-count variance to spike-count mean) in cortex is approximately unity when an animal is fully engaged in a task and performing consistently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Churchland et al., 2010b</xref>). The presence of additional trial-to-trial ‘network level’ variability inflates the Fano factor above unity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland and Abbott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</xref>). During cycling, the Fano factor was less than or equal to one (0.99 and 0.69 for Monkey E and F, averaged across conditions), arguing against considerable network-level variability.</p><p>We next examined single-trial variability at the population level. We used a recently developed method: Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandarinath et al., 2018</xref>) LFADS employs latent non-linear dynamics to produce single-trial firing rates that explain the observed spiking. LFADs is not guaranteed to identify all forms of trial-to-trial variability but has been demonstrated to successfully infer meaningful variations in single-trial activity under a variety of circumstances. We used LFADS to infer single-trial firing rates, employing sessions where a reasonable number of neurons were recorded simultaneously (20-41). Estimated single-trial firing rates were then projected into the left-arm and right-arm subspaces (computed from trial-averaged rates). Single-trial trajectories had modest variability, but it was nevertheless the case that the left-arm space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B,E,F</xref>) captured considerable variance for left-arm performing conditions (<italic>blue</italic>) but not right-arm performing conditions (<italic>red</italic>). Analogous results were found for the right-arm subspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D,G,H</xref>). Thus, separation of left-arm and right-arm-related signals into different subspaces was present at the single-trial level. Separation was perhaps slightly weaker (e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, the blue trace has non-negligible variance) than when analyzing trial-averaged rates, but this is expected when analyzing fewer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.014</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Left-arm and right-arm related activity on single trials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Similar analysis to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, but projecting single-trial firing rates inferred using LFADS.

Thus, the structure of population activity ensures that a decoder, trained to extract activity related to one arm, will naturally tend to ignore activity related to the other arm.</p><p>Yet while decoders tended to naturally ignore activity related to the ‘wrong’ arm, this feature was imperfect: small amounts of residual modulation were still present <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,G</xref> <italic>bottom subpanel</italic>). Overall, predicted EMG modulation in the non-performing arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,I</xref>, <italic>orange</italic> distribution in bottom subpanel) was significantly higher than the true EMG modulation (Monkey E:<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>0.0013</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>; Monkey F: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test across 96 muscles and conditions). This led to arm-preference indices, for the decoder, that were smaller than those of the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D,J</xref>, <italic>orange</italic> distributions lie to the left of <italic>black</italic> distributions). Is this a fundamental limitation of a linear decoder or does it simply reflect the challenge of generalizing to a very different situation?</p><p>To address the second possibility, we trained decoders using both left-arm-performing and right-arm-performing conditions (with generalization tested using left-out conditions of each type). This train-both strategy led to further improvement in the ability to ignore neural activity related to the ‘wrong’ arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <italic>green traces and distributions</italic>). For example, the green distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C,I</xref> are shifted leftward of the orange distributions. (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>0.0013</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for the two monkeys, Wilcoxon signed-rank test across 96 muscles and conditions). Yet, decoded muscle activity was still modulated slightly more than observed empirically (Monkey E: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, Monkey F: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). As a result, train-both decoders predicted muscle activity with arm-preference indices much higher than that of the neural activity, but not quite as high as those of the muscles themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D,J</xref>). This remaining modulation of the decode likely reflects the use of a linear approximation to the non-linear function relating neural and muscle activity, and/or the incomplete sampling of the neural population.</p><p>The above results demonstrate that even simple linear decoders can largely ignore activity related to the wrong arm. This ability can be improved by directly training decoders to do so. Yet, even without such training, decoders successfully generalize and predict little muscle activity when the relevant arm is not performing the task. There is thus no paradox in the presence of robust neural activity across both hemispheres, despite the absence of muscle activity in the non-performing arm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neural signals related to movements of the right and left arms were mixed across hemispheres; when one arm moved, neurons in both hemispheres were modulated. Signals were also mixed across neurons; most neurons responded when both their driven and non-driven arm performed the task. Individual neurons responded very differently depending on which arm was moving. Yet at the level of the population, both hemispheres contained similar information. Surprisingly, we did not find signals that were strongly present in the driving cortex but absent in the non-driving cortex. This was true even for muscle-like signals, which could be decoded similarly well from either hemisphere.</p><p>Despite this intermixing, signals corresponding to the two arms were naturally separable at the level of the neural population. Activity related to the two arms occupied nearly orthogonal subspaces. As a result, even simple linear decoders could read out commands for one arm while ignoring commands for the other arm. Indeed, decoders naturally ignored activity related to the ‘wrong’ arm, even without being trained to do so.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Separation of information across dimensions is a common feature of cortical activity</title><p>Our results contribute to an increasingly broad set of studies reporting that neural activity related to different computations or task parameters is often separated across neural dimensions, instead of at the level of brain areas or individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Druckmann and Chklovskii, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raposo et al., 2014</xref>). For example, during reaching, dimensions carrying preparatory activity are orthogonal to dimensions carrying movement-related activity generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>) and muscle-related signals specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). Preparatory dimensions are thus proposed to be ‘muscle null’ – with no net drive to downstream muscles. Muscle-null dimensions are also expected during movement; they are essential in network-style models of reach generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sussillo et al., 2015</xref>) and to the hypothesis that population activity is structured to avoid trajectory tangling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that right-arm-related neural activity falls in dimensions that are muscle-null with respect to the left arm, and vice versa. This hypothesis makes a prediction that could be tested with simultaneous EMG and large-scale neural recordings: small contractions within the non-performing arm should be correlated with small excursions into the corresponding subspace.</p><p>Although we do not yet know the mechanisms by which the orthogonality of different signals is established, it is noteworthy that two randomly oriented dimensions are essentially guaranteed to be nearly orthogonal in a high-dimensional space. Thus, if a learning mechanism ensures that neurons have random preferences for the two arms (randomly ‘mixed’ selectivity) orthogonality could be achieved without being explicitly enforced.</p><p>Given that subspace-based separation of signals appears to be a common neural strategy, it is worth stressing two points regarding interpretation. First, the weights defining each subspace should not be thought of as mapping directly onto anatomy. For example, a neuron may carry muscle-like signals, and thus contribute to a ‘muscle-potent’ subspace, even if it is not an output neuron. Such a neuron may drive output neurons, may convey muscle-related signals to areas other than the spinal cord, or may simply be participating in the computations that generate muscle-related signals. In the present study, a neuron can contribute to the ‘right-arm’ subspace regardless of which hemisphere it resides in. Conversely, an output neuron may contain contributions from both muscle-potent and muscle-null dimensions. This naturally occurs in network models, and is possible so long as non-muscle-like signals average out across output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaufman et al., 2014</xref>). For example, some corticospinal neurons have been shown to have ‘mirror’ responses to observed actions, despite a lack of corresponding muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraskov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Second, orthogonality of subspaces does not imply that the relevant signals do not interact – indeed it is typically proposed that they do. Preparatory activity is proposed to seed movement-related dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Churchland et al., 2010a</xref>), and movement-period dynamics are proposed to span muscle-null and muscle-potent dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland and Shenoy, 2007</xref>). Mixing of signals within a given neuron allows opportunities for such interactions. In the case of the two arms, the opportunity for interaction may be relevant to bimanual coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison with prior studies of lateralization in M1</title><p>Our finding that individual neurons often respond during movements of either arm is in broad agreement with prior primate recording studies. A majority of these studies describe intermixing of right- and left-arm responses in the activity of individual M1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donchin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donchin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kermadi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steinberg et al., 2002</xref>). However, some studies employing small finger movements report a much smaller percentage of ipsilateral neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanji et al., 1988</xref>), suggesting greater lateralization for hand-related versus arm-related computations. Consistent with that interpretation, the hand area of M1 has fewer callosal connections and fewer ipsilateral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenny, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Wise, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rouiller et al., 1994</xref>). Yet that interpretation should be considered tentative; fMRI studies find considerable bilateral tuning in M1 during movement of the digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berlot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verstynen et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Individual-neuron responses are strongly limb-dependent</title><p>Two prior studies explicitly compared neural response properties during unimanual movements of each arm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al.

At the same time, Steinberg et al. found that left-arm and right-arm reach directions could be independently decoded by separate pools of neurons, suggesting some degree of limb-dependence. The present findings indicate that neural responses are strongly limb-dependent.</p><p>Unlike prior studies, our comparisons of response properties concerned their temporal structure, rather than a preferred direction per se, and employ a very different task.

Furthermore, although unimanual comparisons were not a central topic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donchin et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donchin et al. (1998)</xref>, example units shown in that study do not support the hypothesis of a preferred direction that is consistent across limbs. It thus appears that M1 responses are strongly limb-dependent across a variety of contexts.</p><p>Assessed via fMRI, individual voxels within motor cortex have preserved ‘finger preference’ (pinky, middle or thumb) across limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref>). This might appear in conflict with the present results, where responses were not preserved. A likely resolution is that nearby neurons have responses related to a similar set of joints for both arms, but without preservation of tuning for movement features. For example, a neuron might respond during flexion of the right pinky and extension of the left pinky.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible reasons for ipsilateral motor cortical activity</title><p>There exist multiple reasons why motor cortex might be active when the non-driving arm performs the task. A straightforward possibility is that motor cortex employs an abstract limb-independent representation of movement. However, this hypothesis is unlikely given the strongly limb-dependent nature of responses. Alternatively, the two cortices may process different but complementary information. This hypothesis is also unlikely; we found no large signals that were present in the driving cortex but absent in the non-driving cortex.</p><p>It is also possible that activity ipsilateral to the moving arm may relate to uncrossed descending connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuypers, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenzweig et al., 2009</xref>). For example, activity in the right motor cortex could exist to drive, via uncrossed connections, muscle activity in the right arm when that arm performs the task. However, prior studies have found little evidence for a robust relationship between M1 and ipsilateral muscle activation. Intracortical microstimulation readily produces contralateral muscle responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kwan et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sessle and Wiesendanger, 1982</xref>), yet very rarely generates ipsilateral muscle responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aizawa et al., 1990</xref>). Intracellular recordings of motoneurons reveal no monosynaptic evoked potentials from ipsilateral corticospinal tract stimulation and spike-triggered EMG effects are present only for contralateral muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soteropoulos et al., 2011</xref>). For these reasons, we suspect that uncrossed projections are unlikely to be the primary reason that the non-driving motor cortex is active.</p><p>A further possibility is that activity in the non-driving cortex results from an efference copy of signals generated and employed by the driving cortex. An efference copy could aid coordination between limbs. While this was not necessary in the present task (one hand simply remained still), it may be that efference copy signals are conveyed by default and ignored if they are not needed. Our results are consistent with this possibility, and argue that if it is correct, the efference copy must be quite complete. That is, the driving cortex must convey the majority of the signals it generates, rather than (for example) just the output signals.</p><p>Independent of a role in online coordination, an efference copy might allow the non-driving cortex to ‘observe’ computations in the driving cortex, aiding inter-manual transfer of skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiestler et al., 2014</xref>). If so, responses in the non-driving cortex might be thought of in much the same way as mirror responses. Mirror neurons have been observed in multiple motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogassi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rizzolatti et al., 1996</xref>), including primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dushanova and Donoghue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vigneswaran et al., 2013</xref>). Even identified pyramidal tract neurons can exhibit mirror properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kraskov et al., 2014</xref>). These results argue that a common property of neurons in motor areas is a response during movements in which they do not directly participate, possibly for the purposes of learning.</p><p>A final possibility is that motor cortical computations are distributed across both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In the extreme, neurons in the non-driving cortex might simply be viewed the way we view most neurons in the driving cortex; they can contribute to the computation even though they are one or more synapses from the cortico-spinal neurons that will convey the output. This hypothesis is appealing because it could explain the finding that all large signals are shared between hemispheres. More generally, if a randomly chosen neuron from the non-driving cortex has responses that are nearly indistinguishable from a neuron chosen from the driving cortex, perhaps our default assumption should be that they are participating in the same computation. It remains unclear if this hypothesis can be reconciled with the finding that motor cortex inactivation principally affects the contralateral limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glees and Cole, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu and Rouiller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Passingham et al., 1983</xref>). If both hemispheres participate in controlling both arms, one would expect a more bilateral deficit. A possible resolution is that the network is sufficiently robust that it can still function when many neurons are inactivated, so long as the output neurons can still convey the necessary commands.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Ipsilateral arm signals in other brain regions</title><p>Cortical areas, subcortical areas, and the spinal cord all contribute to the control of dexterous movements. Indeed, other studies comparing contralateral and ipsilateral movements have found that not only M1, but also the dorsal premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kermadi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanji et al., 1988</xref>), ventral premotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michaels and Scherberger, 2018</xref>), Supplementary Motor Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donchin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gribova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kazennikov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kermadi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kermadi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanji et al., 1988</xref>), Cingulate Motor Area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kermadi et al., 2000</xref>), and the Posterior Parietal Cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kermadi et al., 2000</xref>) contain neurons which respond to movements of the ipsilateral arm. Furthermore, there are circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord which specifically support the generation of coordinated, rhythmic movements like locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duysens and Van de Crommert, 1998</xref>). Other brain regions, such as the Anterior Intraparietal Area, encode movement parameters in a largely limb-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michaels and Scherberger, 2018</xref>), suggesting that the relationship of motor and visuo-motor areas to ipsilateral movements may vary depending on their role in motor computation. In general, movement is generated by a broad, interconnected network of brain and spinal regions. We focused on M1 because it is the cortical region that, based on anatomy and microstimulation results, seemed most likely to have a lateralized representation of movement. Yet, even in M1 we failed to find evidence of strongly lateralized activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Data were collected from two male monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) while they performed a cycling task for juice reward. Experiments were controlled and data collected under computer control (Real-time Target Machine: Speedgoat, Liebfeld, Switzerland). While performing the task, each monkey sat in a custom primate chair with the head restrained via surgical implant. A video monitor displayed a virtual environment through which the monkey moved. The monkey grasped a custom pedal with each hand. Hands were lightly restrained with fabric tape to keep them in a consistent position on the pedals. The pedal itself was also designed to encourage a consistent hand position, and included a handle and a brace that reduced wrist motion. Pedals turned a crankshaft attached to a motor (Applied Motion Products, Watsonville, CA). A rotary encoder within the motor reported position with 1/8000 cycle precision. Information regarding angular position and its derivatives was used by the real-time system to deliver force commands that produced virtual mass and viscosity. This endowed the pedal with a natural feel, and provided sufficient resistance to ensure robust and repeatable patterns of muscle activity.</p><p>Monkeys cycled the pedal to control their position in the virtual environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The angular position of the pedal was mapped directly to linear position in the virtual world. The task involved stopping on targets (stationary white squares on the ground) to receive juice reward. On each trial, the monkey progressed from an initial target to a final target. The relationship between world position and pedal position was set such that targets were spaced exactly seven cycles apart. Monkeys performed blocks of twenty consecutive trials. For a given block, one arm was the ‘performing arm,’ and the other was the ‘non-performing arm.’ World position was determined by the pedal manipulated by the performing arm. The other pedal was required to remain within a tight position window at the bottom of the cycle (see below). Following completion of a block, the next block was signaled by 5 s of gentle ‘buzzing’ delivered to one pedal (via the motor) indicating the new performing arm. Blocks were presented in randomized order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Monkeys also executed blocks where both arms cycled together (bimanual task variant), which are not analyzed in this study.</p><p>At the start of each trial, the initial target appeared one to two cycles in front of the monkey. The monkey cycled to and ‘acquired’ this target by stopping on it. The acceptance window was ± 0.15 cycles for Monkey E and ± 0.01 cycles for Monkey F. Holding the target also required remaining below a stringent speed threshold: 0.01 cycles/s for Monkey E and 0.0125 cycles/s for Monkey F. After holding the target for 1000-2000 ms (monkey E) or 600-1000 ms (monkey F) the initial target disappeared and the final target appeared seven cycles ahead of the current position. The monkey then cycled to this final target. To encourage cycling at a swift and consistent rate, we enforced a minimum speed threshold and maximum cycling duration. Once the final target was acquired, the monkey remained still within the target, for 1000-1600 ms, to receive a juice reward. The speed threshold was the same for the initial and final targets. For Monkey F, when the pedal was stopped within the target, the motor provided small stabilizing forces, minimizing the muscle activation needed to hold the pedal stationary.</p><p>As a trial was performed, the pedal associated with the non-performing arm had to remain within a window (±0.05 and ±0.07 cycles for monkey E and F) centered at the bottom of the cycle. Movement outside that window caused trial failure followed by a short time-out. Monkeys adopted a stereotyped position within the enforced window and moved little from that position. For the non-performing arm, the position range explored within a trial averaged 0.006 cycles (monkey E) and 0.029 cycles (monkey F).</p><p>Within each 20-trial block there were four behavioral conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Each condition employed one of two starting pedal positions (top-start and bottom-start), and one of two cycling directions (forward and backward). On top-start conditions, the initial target was located such that the pedal position necessary to acquire that target was at the very top of the cycle. On bottom-start conditions, the necessary pedal position was at the very bottom. In both cases, the final target was exactly seven cycles away, and was thus acquired with the same pedal position. During forward cycling conditions, forward progress in the virtual environment was produced by cycling ‘forward’, with the arm moving away from the body at the top of the cycle (a motion similar to that of the foot when pedaling a bicycle). During backward cycling conditions, the mapping was reversed. Cycling direction was cued by the color of the landscape in the virtual environment: green for forward, orange for backward. Each of the four combinations of starting position and cycling direction was performed in a sub-block of five trials. Sub-block order was identical for each block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Monkeys were highly trained on this task before experiments began, and performance was thus consistent across days.

A 19 mm diameter cylinder (Crist Instruments) was placed above the primary motor cortex of each hemisphere, guided by structural MRI performed prior to surgery. The skull remained intact under the cylinder, covered with a thin layer of dental acrylic. Prior to recording, monkeys were anesthetized and a 3.5 mm diameter burr hole was drilled by hand through the dental acrylic and skull, leaving dura intact. Over the course of the experiment, burr holes were opened at different locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Recordings were made from a variety of depths. Notably, penetrations that entered in anterior M1/posterior PMd could yield recordings in sulcal M1. Following recording, burr holes were closed with dental acrylic, allowing the skull to heal.

During this surgery, we confirmed that the burr hole locations lined up with the expected sulcal landmarks.</p><p>After opening each burr hole, we first recorded neural activity using conventional single electrodes (Frederick Haer Company).

However, a minority of recordings were almost certainly made from premotor cortex. Thus, for both monkeys, key analyses were repeated using data only from the posterior burr-holes. Results were virtually identical, confirming that that properties we report are intrinsic to primary motor cortex, rather than arising from contamination by recordings from premotor cortex.</p><p>We recorded neural activity with 24-channel V-Probes (Monkey E), or 32-channel S-Probes (Monkey F) (Plexon Inc, Dallas, TX). We lowered one probe into each hemisphere each day, removing the probe at the end of that session. Probes were moved to different locations within each burr hole on each recording day. Neural signals were processed and recorded using a Digital Hub and 128-channel Neural Signal Processor (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT). Threshold crossings from each channel were recorded and spike-sorted offline (Plexon Offline Sorter). Unit isolation was assessed based on separation of waveforms in PCA-space, inter-spike interval histograms, and waveform stability over the course of the session. Analyses consider stable, well-isolated single and multi-unit isolations. Multi-unit isolations consisted of identifiable spikes (i.e., not merely threshold crossings) from two (or occasionally more) neurons that could not be distinguished from one another with confidence. All example firing rates shown in figures are from single units. We recorded 263 units in the left hemisphere and 270 units in the right hemisphere for monkey E (8–47 per day), and 338 units in the left hemisphere and 279 units in the right hemisphere for monkey F (12–64 per day).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EMG recordings</title><p>On separate days, interspersed with the neural recordings, we recorded intramuscular EMG signals. We recorded from biceps brachii (long and short head), triceps brachii (medial, long, and lateral heads), deltoid (anterior, lateral, and posterior head), latissimus dorsi, pectoralis, trapezius, and brachioradialis. Pairs of hook-wire electrodes were inserted ~1 cm into the belly of the muscle at the beginning of each session and removed at the end. On each session, 1–3 EMG recordings were made per arm. Electrode voltages were amplified, bandpass filtered (10–500 Hz) and digitized at 1000 Hz (Monkey E) or 30,000 Hz (Monkey F). Recordings were not considered further if they contained significant movement artifact or weak signals. Offline, EMG records were high-pass filtered at 40 Hz, rectified, and smoothed with a 25 ms Gaussian. This produced a measure of intensity versus time, which was then averaged across trials. Trial-averaging of EMG employed the same alignment procedure used when computing trial-averaged firing rates (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Trial-averaged firing rates</title><p>The spike times of each neuron on each trial were converted to a firing-rate by convolving spikes with a 25 ms Gaussian. To produce trial-averaged firing rates, we first aligned all trials on a common time: the moment when the first half-cycle was completed. This nicely aligned behavior across trials during the beginning of each trial. However, because trials lasted multiple seconds, small differences in cycling speed could accumulate and cause considerable misalignment of behavior across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting misalignment of single-trial firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) would yield an unrepresentative average firing rate (the same problem would impact averages of muscle activity and kinematic variables). Thus, temporal alignment was applied to the middle six cycles, from a half cycle after movement began (i.e. for top-start trials, at the moment when the pedal reached the bottom) until a half-cycle before movement ended.</p><p>Alignment was achieved via two steps. First, we temporarily converted firing rates to a position-base rather than a time-base. For example, consider <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, the firing rate of a neuron as a function of time. We constructed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>'</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the angular position of the pedal (from 0 to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, as there are six middle cycles). Because all trials now share the same domain, they can be averaged to produce <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:msup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. We then converted back to the temporal domain to yield <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Although there was slight variability across trials and conditions, monkeys cycled very close to 2 Hz. We thus employed the approximation that each cycle lasted 500 ms, and linearly mapped positions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>12</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to times 0-3000 ms (6 cycles with 500 ms per cycle). This mapping ensures that a given time always corresponds to the same position, aiding comparisons across conditions and the pooling of neurons across sessions into a single population. A drawback of this simple mapping is that behavior becomes idealized; that is vertical hand position becomes a perfect sinusoid after alignment. In practice, this drawback was tolerable; vertical hand position was already close to a perfect sinusoid during the middle cycles.</p><p>This procedure altered the time-base of individual trials very modestly, yet maintained appropriate alignment across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and produced trial-averaged estimates of the firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) that are representative of what occurred on single trials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> plots spike times to illustrate the utility of alignment. However, we stress that temporal alignment was performed after converting spikes to single-trial firing rates via convolution with a Gaussian. Thus, alignment never altered the firing rates themselves, merely the times when those rates were achieved. Alignment was applied only when computing trial-averages, and not in the case of single-trial analyses.</p><p>Note that it is not possible to align based on the time-course of hand position unless position is changing. While we could have estimated the very first moment the pedal began to move, and the last moment it was in motion, it was more robust and convenient to simply begin and end at the first and last half-cycles. (Because the first and last half cycles only lasted a few hundred milliseconds, trials remained in reasonable alignment across those times).</p><p>Most analyses of firing rates employed the middle four cycles (2-5), excluding the first cycle and the last two cycles. This focused analysis on the steady-state response, rather than on responses associated with starting, stopping, or holding. This aided interpretation in two ways. First, muscle activity in the non-performing arm was particularly weak during middle cycles (in contrast, modest activity was occasionally observed when stopping). Focusing on middle cycles thus largely sidesteps concerns that activity ipsilateral to the performing arm is related to muscle activity in the non-performing arm. Second, we wished to focus key analyses on the rhythmic pattern of firing rate modulation, rather than on overall changes in net firing rate when moving versus not moving. As one example, when predicting muscle activity from neural activity, it is relatively ‘easy’ to capture the generally elevated activity level during movement, resulting in high <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values even if predictions fail to capture cycle-by-cycle activity patterns. We wished to avoid this, and to consider predictions successful only if they accounted for rhythmic response aspects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Individual-neuron analyses</title><p>Analyses were performed based on trial-averaged firing rates, computed as described above, and consider the middle four cycles (cycles 2-5) of the time-varying response.

For example, principal component analysis (PCA) seeks to capture maximum variance, and a neuron with a firing rate modulation of 100 spikes/s would contribute 25 times as much variance as a neuron with a modulation of 20 spikes/s.

For each trial, we computed the mean (absolute) speed of the non-performing arm. For each condition, we divided trials into those with speeds greater versus less than the median. We did not apply this analysis if there were fewer than eight trials for that condition for that neuron (as sometimes occurred if a neuron was well-isolated for only part of a recording session).</p><p>After dividing, we recomputed the mean firing rate for each of the two pools of trials, yielding one firing rate when the non-performing arm moved modestly, and another when it was virtually stationary. For each timepoint, we asked whether these two firing rates were more different than expected given sampling error. This was accomplished via a randomization test in which trials were divided into two groups randomly, rather than based on speed. We performed 1000 such random divisions. Differences were considered significant if they were larger than for 95% of the random divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Comparison of muscle-activity predictions between hemispheres</title><p>To predict muscle activity from neural activity, we used Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression (plsregress in MATLAB).

We then asked how much variance is explained by those dimensions when the task is performed using the other arm (e.g. the right arm). These analyses employed trial-averaged firing rates (as described in this section), and were repeated using estimates of single-trial firing rates (see section describing LFADS below).</p><p>Analysis considered triplets of conditions: a training condition, a ‘same-arm’ test condition and an ‘opposite-arm’ test condition. The training condition and the same-arm test condition shared the same arm and cycling direction but had different starting positions. The training condition and the opposite-arm test condition were identical but used different arms. Analysis was run eight times per monkey, with every condition serving as a training condition exactly once. Example projections are shown for pairs of test conditions. Quantitative summaries (e.g. variance explained) average across the eight relevant test conditions.</p><p>For a given training condition, we applied PCA to the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf142"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> matrix of firing rates, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf143"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of timepoints during the middle four cycles of movement and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf144"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of neurons.

These results confirmed that our high neuron-counts (&gt;200 per hemisphere) were important for accurately assessing subspace overlap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fano factor</title><p>We employed the Fano factor as a rough measure of whether trial-averaged firing rates are representative of individual-trial responses. The Fano factor is defined as the ratio of the spike-count variance (across trials) to the spike-count mean, with counts made in a temporal window of fixed duration. We computed the Factor for all single-unit isolations with at least ten trials per condition. To compute spike counts, we aligned all trials for a particular condition to the very middle cycle (the time at which the hand position crossed 3.5 cycles, halfway between the beginning and end of the trial). On each trial, spikes were counted in two 250 ms windows: one preceding and one following the alignment time. For each window (treated separately) we computed the mean and variance of the spike counts. We did not modify the time-basis of individual trials. A modified time-base complicates interpretation of spiking variability, and was unnecessary given the relatively short time-spans considered here (behavior drifted little over ± 250 ms). To compute a single Fano factor per dataset, we considered both windows and all neurons and conditions, and used regression to estimate the relationship between spike-count variance and mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Churchland et al., 2010a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>LFADS</title><p>To visualize single-trial neural trajectories, we leveraged a recently-developed machine learning technique: Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pandarinath et al., 2018</xref>). LFADS trains a variational auto-encoder to generate single-trial neural firing rates via dynamics instantiated by a recurrent neural network. This approach leverages simultaneous neural recordings to infer latent dynamics that generate neural activity, and leverages those dynamics to generate denoised estimates of single-trial firing rates for each neuron. This allowed us to repeat analyses regarding left-arm and right-arm subspaces (described above for trial-averaged responses) on single-trial firing-rate estimates. We used the LFADS Run Manager (written by Daniel J. O’Shea: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lfads.github.io/lfads-run-manager/">https://lfads.github.io/lfads-run-manager/</ext-link>).</p><p>An advantage of LFADS is that it can leverage data recorded across sessions. Single-trial latent trajectories are constrained by both the spikes on that trial, and by dynamics inferred across trials and sessions. In the present study, all analyses of single-trial trajectories are performed within a single session, but the inclusion of multiple sessions helps denoise trajectories by better constraining the dynamical model. Sessions were chosen according to two criteria. First, the session had to include a minimum of twenty units (across both hemispheres), all of which remained isolated across the full session (in contrast to trial-averaged data, where we could exclude trials if isolation became poor). Second, we analyzed only sessions where the sampling of response properties was not overly ‘lopsided’, with one or more conditions having few responsive neurons. This is very unlikely in large datasets, but can occur on single sessions and complicates comparisons of variance captured for different conditions. We therefore required that the neural population variance in the highest-variance behavioral condition not be more than three times the neural population variance in the lowest-variance condition:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf147"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the variance of neuron <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf148"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> on the condition with the maximum summed variance and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the variance of neuron <italic>n</italic> on the condition with the minimum summed variance.

The input is a three-dimensional tensor of size times by neurons by trials. On each trial LFADS infers an initial state and a latent trajectory that evolves according to the learned dynamics. To avoid complexity in the LFADS model, we did not allow it to also infer time-varying inputs. This constrained the model to capture all trial-to-trial differences using different initial states. For this reason, it is important that trials not be overly long. For long trials, trial-to-trial variations that occur late would tend not to be captured unless they can be accounted for via differences in initial state. We specifically wished to capture as much trial-to-trial variability as possible. To allow LFADS the best opportunity to do so, we defined an LFADS ‘trial’ to be a single cycle of behavior. Thus, each behavioral trial was split into four LFADS trials (one for each cycle from 2 to 5). Each of these spanned a 500 ms window, centered at the time when the hand reached the top pedal location (note that, on different trials, the pedal might travel slightly more or less than one cycle during this window). We trained a stitched multi-day LFADS autoencoder with the following parameters. Bin size: 5 ms; batch size: 32; factor dimensions: 16; generator dimensions: 64; encoder dimensions: 64; learning rate stop: 0.001. Other parameters were left at the default values provided by the LFADS Run Manager.</p><p>Analysis of left-arm and right-arm subspaces on single trials paralleled the original analysis based on trial-averages. Single-trial LFADS-inferred firing rates were projected onto left-arm and right-arm subspaces. As in the original analysis, subspaces were found based on a training condition, and the projected data were from two test conditions (same arm but different starting position, or the corresponding condition for the other arm). We computed the variance captured, in each subspace, for each test condition. Although LFADS leveraged data across sessions, the above-analysis steps were performed independently for each session. Subspaces were found based on within-session trial-averages to address the key question of whether subspaces inferred from trial-averages segregate single-trial responses in the same way that they do trial-averaged responses. Similar results were obtained if subspaces were found based on single trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Trajectory tangling</title><p>We assessed trajectory tangling as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Russo et al.

As in our previous EMG prediction analysis, we used PLS regression (described above) and focused on the middle four cycles. For this analysis, we predicted EMG activity using all neurons, regardless of hemisphere.</p><p>We first assessed generalization performance using a ‘train-moving’ decoder, which was trained using only conditions where the relevant arm performed the task, and was then asked to generalize to conditions where the other arm performed the task. This is a potentially challenging form of generalization, as the decoder must predict EMG activity in a situation (arm not moving) very different from the situation in which it was trained (arm moving). We also computed generalization performance of a ‘train-both’ decoder, trained using a set of conditions that included the relevant arm performing and not performing the task. Generalization was to left-out conditions of each type.</p><p>For the train-moving decoder, we used the following division of training, validation, and testing, conditions: <italic>Training</italic>: Direction 1, Start Position 1, Arm moving. <italic>Validation</italic>: Direction 1, Start Position 2, Arm moving (one cycle). <italic>Testing</italic>: Direction 1, Start Position 2, Other arm moving.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jörn Diedrichsen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christian K Machens (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Ames and Churchland provides an important and fresh look into the characteristics of neural activity in motor cortex during ipsilateral arm movements. In many ways the results confirm the study of Donchin et al., 1998, from 20 years ago, showing a high prevalence of ipsilaterally tuned activity and the lack of a tight relation between tuning for contralateral and ipsilateral movement directions. The new analyses, however, reveals the orthogonality of the population activity for contra- and ipsilateral arm, providing important constraints in understanding the function of the widespread ipsilateral activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers discussed the points raised in the individual reviews extensively, and agreed on the following major points that should be addressed in the revision.</p><p>1) While these findings are quite convincing, the explanation why this bilateral representation is needed (efference copy to support motor planning?) is less clear. For example, finger movements often require an increased coordination effort between both hands, e.g., for bimanual hand actions. This seems at odds with the authors' point that distal (finger) movements are less represented bilaterally than proximal (reach) movements. An additional hypothesis that maybe should be considered in the Discussion is that the non-driving cortex simply &quot;observes&quot; the activity of the driving hemisphere, but does not causally contribute to the driving arm movement. Like in action observation, the neural activity would occur in a muscle null-space (Kraskov et al., 2014). A possible function of such activity (if there is any) may that it helps lay establish networks in the ipsilateral hemisphere, which then underlie the inter-manual transfer of motor skill (Wiestler et al., 2014).</p><p>2) How could you confirm that recordings were actually from M1 and not, e.g., from PMd? Did you look for low ICMS thresholds? This is important since bilateral representations in PMd could be quite different from M1.</p><p>3) All analyses seem to have been done on trial-averaged data. We think that it is crucial that the authors show whether the orthogonal subspaces still robustly separate the population activity on single trials. It is necessary that single-trial activity also falls into the Null-space for the contralateral hand, such that it can avoid generating contralateral activity. While your analysis shows that on average the activity falls into the null-space, we believe it would be informative to see the spread of the projection. This could be done by projecting single trials onto the orthogonal subspaces, and showing that the information is there, or by applying single-trial dimensionality reduction techniques.</p><p>(In this context, it would be interesting to know if single-trial muscle activity in the non-driven arm can be predicted by deviations from the orthogonal subspaces. As far as I understood the limitations of the data, that will not be testable in the current data-set, as muscle activity and brain activity were recorded separately. I don’t ask the authors to do this, but would just like to point out that it could strengthen the authors' hypothesis considerably.)</p><p>4) As noted in the Discussion, activity in one M1 hemisphere has little effect on muscle activity in the non-driven arm. Yet, the dimensionality reduction and prediction analyses in Figures 9 and 10 consider the full cross-hemisphere population. To answer the question of why population activity in one hemisphere does not activate the non-driven arm, the dimensionality reduction and prediction analyses should ideally be done on a single hemisphere. The effect may be weaker (because of less data), but it should still be there. Alternatively, the authors could demonstrate that the decoding weights (or weights characterizing the subspaces) properly separate information between the two hemispheres.</p><p>5) Even within a hemisphere, an additional concern is that there might be a mix of cell types, with some responsible for direct motor control (e.g., the small proportion of cells with a preference index close to 1), and some responsible for the general computation, say. Previous work in mouse ALM has shown that such a separation can exist, with associated anatomical differences in left/right preference (Li et al., 2015, Nature 519 51-56). I would like the authors (at a minimum) to display some information about the weights of the decoders or subspaces (see also point 2).</p><p>6) The authors use PLS to find a low-dimensional linear mapping between population activity X and population activity Y, and evaluated it in generalization setting how well can predict new data. The main results are that muscle activity can be nearly equally well predicted from contra and ipsilateral M1, and that there are hardly any differences in predicting left M1 from left M1 as from right M1. The main limitation of this analysis is that it can show that the two population codes occupy a common linear subspace, but it does not show that the two population codes are structurally the same (or have the same representational geometry – Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017). For example, consider the two population depicted in Image 1. Both have a neural dimension that codes for the vertical position of the hand and a neural dimension that codes for the horizontal position of the hand (of course neural dimensions do not cleanly represent specific physical variables, but that's not the point here). This means that you could find a two-dimensional mapping that would predict the population activity in of region A from region B, likely nearly as good as you could predict region A from region A. Furthermore, a specific muscle activity that is a linear combination of position could be read out of the population activity equally well (or bad). However, this obscures the fact that region A overemphasizes the vertical dimension of the movement, whereas region B emphasizes coding for the horizontal dimension.</p><fig id="desfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.021</object-id><label>Decision letter image 1.</label><caption><title>Two different neural population codes that occupy the same functional subspace, but that have a different representational geometries.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46159-des-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This problem is especially prevalent as the underlying behavior is relatively simple.

For example, finger movements often require an increased coordination effort between both hands, e.g., for bimanual hand actions. This seems at odds with the authors' point that distal (finger) movements are less represented bilaterally than proximal (reach) movements. An additional hypothesis that maybe should be considered in the Discussion is that the non-driving cortex simply &quot;observes&quot; the activity of the driving hemisphere, but does not causally contribute to the driving arm movement. Like in action observation, the neural activity would occur in a muscle null-space (Kraskov et al., 2014). A possible function of such activity (if there is any) may that it helps lay establish networks in the ipsilateral hemisphere, which then underlie the inter-manual transfer of motor skill (Wiestler et al., 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with all the above points. First, it is indeed unclear why a bilateral representation is needed, and there remain multiple reasonable possibilities. Second, we agree that there is no clear reason why finger/hand-related responses should be more lateralized (one might expect just the opposite, as the reviewers note).</p><p>Further to this point, it is unclear whether finger/hand-related responses are in fact more lateralized. fMRI results reveal bilateral digit-related responses. Finally, we agree that a possible purpose of activity in the non-driving cortex is ‘observation’ of driving-cortex activity for the purpose of inter-manual transfer of skill. We have made the following changes to the manuscript.</p><p>1) We have revised the relevant section of the Discussion (Possible reasons for ipsilateral motor cortical activity) to respect the above points. In particular, we now raise the possibility of observation for inter-manual transfer of skill:</p><p>“Independent of a role in online coordination, an efference copy might allow the non-driving cortex to ‘observe’ computations in the driving cortex, aiding inter-manual transfer of skills (Wiestler et al., 2014). […] These results argue that a common property of neurons in motor areas is a response during movements in which they do not directly participate, possibly for the purposes of learning.”</p><p>2) We have revised the paragraph in the Discussion where we discuss the degree of lateralization found in different studies. We now highlight the lack of clarity regarding whether digit responses are more lateralized.</p><p>“Assessed via fMRI, individual voxels within motor cortex have preserved ‘finger preference’ (pinky, middle or thumb) across limbs (Diedrichsen et al., 2013). […] E.g., a neuron might respond during flexion of the right pinky and extension of the left pinky.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How could you confirm that recordings were actually from M1 and not, e.g., from PMd? Did you look for low ICMS thresholds? This is important since bilateral representations in PMd could be quite different from M1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question – especially because in one monkey (E) some recordings were almost certainly from caudal PMd (adjacent to M1). Even in monkey F, a few recordings were near the ‘border zone’ (there is of course no clear border). Importantly, we found the same properties regardless of recording location. This is now explicitly stated in the manuscript.</p><p>“Results were virtually identical (median arm-preference indices of 0.06 and 0.31) if analysis was restricted to more posterior recordings (excluding the influence of any neurons recorded from PMd or from the border region between M1 and PMd).” [For reference, indices were 0.07 and 0.31 when analyzing all recordings.]</p><p>We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> the relevant figure (Figure 4) replicated with this restricted analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> we show the key analysis (orthogonality of subspaces) after restricting to posterior burr-holes. Results are unchanged. These could be added as supplementary figures if desired.</p><p>We have also added to the manuscript details regarding the localization of recordings. This includes new subpanels in Figure 1 showing the location of the burr-holes (keeping in mind that many penetrations traveled well below the illustrated surface features and into the sulcus). We also report ICMS thresholds, which were typically low (10-40 ua, consistent with proximal-arm M1) with the exception of one anterior burr-hole in Monkey E (75 ua, consistent with PMd as noted above). The added text is in the subsection “Surgical Procedures and neural recording”.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46159.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Figure 4 variant: Neural responses are not strongly lateralized (restricted to neurons from posterior burr holes).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histograms of arm preference index for all recorded neurons from posterior burr holes.

We think that it is crucial that the authors show whether the orthogonal subspaces still robustly separate the population activity on single trials. It is necessary that single-trial activity also falls into the Null-space for the contralateral hand, such that it can avoid generating contralateral activity. While your analysis shows that on average the activity falls into the null-space, we believe it would be informative to see the spread of the projection. This could be done by projecting single trials onto the orthogonal subspaces, and showing that the information is there, or by applying single-trial dimensionality reduction techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. It is slightly challenging to analyze single trials because we recorded only modest numbers of neurons simultaneously: 8-47 (Monkey E) and 12-64 (Monkey F). This is a consequence of wishing to use v-probes (rather than Utah arrays) to access the central sulcus and to allow flexible recording from a range of sites (yielding higher total neuron-counts that could be achieved with Utah arrays).</p><p>Still, on the best days, the number of recorded neurons approached the number of good isolations on a Utah array, making it possible to perform single-trial analyses. We now include single-trial analyses (employing LFADS) to ask whether trial-averages are truly representative. We also address this question by using the Fano Factor to ask whether there is evidence of ‘extra’ variability beyond that expected from roughly Poisson spiking statistics. These analyses are described in a new section (Neural trajectories on single trials) and a new figure (Figure 10). The results demonstrate that single trials behave similarly to trial averages; activity related to the two arms is largely separated into different subspaces. Consistent with this, the Fano Factor is below unity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(In this context, it would be interesting to know if single-trial muscle activity in the non-driven arm can be predicted by deviations from the orthogonal subspaces. As far as I understood the limitations of the data, that will not be testable in the current data-set, as muscle activity and brain activity were recorded separately. I don’t ask the authors to do this, but would just like to point out that it could strengthen the authors' hypothesis considerably.)</p></disp-quote><p>This would indeed be good to know. We presume that the reviewer is correct, and that small single-trial activations of the muscles in the non-performing arm are associated with small excursions into the ‘wrong’ arm’s subspace. Detecting this would of course require simultaneous muscle and neural recordings (which we did not make) and probably also much higher-neuron-count recordings (given that the relevant deviations are likely to be small). Still, this is a clear prediction that may become testable in the future and we agree it should thus be stated. We now do so:</p><p>“Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that right-arm-related neural activity falls in dimensions that are muscle-null with respect to the left arm, and vice versa. This hypothesis makes a prediction that could be tested with simultaneous EMG and large-scale neural recordings: small contractions within the non-performing arm should be correlated with small excursions into the corresponding subspace.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As noted in the Discussion, activity in one M1 hemisphere has little effect on muscle activity in the non-driven arm. Yet, the dimensionality reduction and prediction analyses in Figures 9 and 10 consider the full cross-hemisphere population. To answer the question of why population activity in one hemisphere does not activate the non-driven arm, the dimensionality reduction and prediction analyses should ideally be done on a single hemisphere. The effect may be weaker (because of less data), but it should still be there. Alternatively, the authors could demonstrate that the decoding weights (or weights characterizing the subspaces) properly separate information between the two hemispheres.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to show that what holds for the full population also holds for each hemisphere. This is indeed the case, and is now demonstrated in four added supplementary figures. We added two supplementary figures which reproduce the analysis in Figure 9 for each hemisphere individually (Figure 9—figure supplements 1, 2). We also added two supplementary figures reproducing the results shown in Figure 11 (previously Figure 10) for each hemisphere individually (Figure 11—figure supplements 1, 2). Effects are still very robust. These supplementary figures also allow one to appreciate an additional point: the ability to ignore ‘wrong-arm’ related activity is aided by the fact that not only are subspaces orthogonal, but activity is modestly stronger for the ‘correct’ arm. Thus, the segregation by subspace is particularly clean for the most relevant subspace (e.g., the left-arm subspace for the right cortex, as shown in the top row of Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We like these added analyses, but have kept the analysis in the main figures focused on the full population for both practical and conceptual reasons. Practically, it allows for fewer subpanels (e.g., Figure 9 can have 12 subpanels, rather than 24). Conceptually, at this point we want to shift the conversation towards thinking about motor cortex as a full population. The results in the earlier figures establish that both sides respond during movement of both arms, and contain similar signals. Anatomically, the two sides are heavily interconnected. It thus becomes reasonable to ask, ‘if all the relevant signals are shared across a large bi-lateral population, how can arm-specific signals become separated.’ Indeed, it is a particularly stringent and interesting test to ask whether the signals related to the two arms can be separated <italic>without</italic> needing to know which side each neuron was recorded from. We have modified the beginning of the relevant section to reflect this motivation.</p><p>We also agree that it is worth adding the subspace / decoding weights to the relevant figures (now 9 and 11). This has been done. As expected, both hemispheres contribute to both spaces/decode (with the expected small driving-cortex bias).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Even within a hemisphere, an additional concern is that there might be a mix of cell types, with some responsible for direct motor control (e.g., the small proportion of cells with a preference index close to 1), and some responsible for the general computation, say. Previous work in mouse ALM has shown that such a separation can exist, with associated anatomical differences in left/right preference (Li et al., 2015, Nature 519 51-56). I would like the authors (at a minimum) to display some information about the weights of the decoders or subspaces (see also point 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is interesting to consider whether there might be sub-populations which correspond more tightly to particular parameters of the computation. We now show distributions of projection weights for PCA in Figure 9, and EMG decoding weights in Figure 11. These distributions don’t support the hypothesis of a distinct subpopulation with large weights for a given space (e.g., a subpopulation of ‘pure left-arm’ neurons). There is a somewhat continuous distribution. Still, we would not want to entirely rule out that hypothesis. For example, it seems plausible that cortico-motoneurons could be more ‘pure’, and would thus occupy the tail of the distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors use PLS to find a low-dimensional linear mapping between population activity X and population activity Y, and evaluated it in generalization setting how well can predict new data. The main results are that muscle activity can be nearly equally well predicted from contra and ipsilateral M1, and that there are hardly any differences in predicting left M1 from left M1 as from right M1. The main limitation of this analysis is that it can show that the two population codes occupy a common linear subspace, but it does not show that the two population codes are structurally the same (or have the same representational geometry – Diedrichsen and Kriegeskorte, 2017).</p><p>For example, consider the two population depicted in Image 1. Both have a neural dimension that codes for the vertical position of the hand and a neural dimension that codes for the horizontal position of the hand (of course neural dimensions do not cleanly represent specific physical variables, but that's not the point here). This means that you could find a two-dimensional mapping that would predict the population activity in of region A from region B, likely nearly as good as you could predict region A from region A. Furthermore, a specific muscle activity that is a linear combination of position could be read out of the population activity equally well (or bad). However, this obscures the fact that region A overemphasizes the vertical dimension of the movement, whereas region B emphasizes coding for the horizontal dimension.</p><p>This problem is especially prevalent as the underlying behavior is relatively simple. While the cycling direction dissociates position, velocity, and muscle activity, the two starting points probably do very little to add new dimensions that the functional subspace that the brain needs to encode. Thus, as long as both hemispheres occupy this relative restricted subspace of neural activity, prediction performance of the PLS model will be quite good. That is, two very different population codes can look very much the same if the experiment does not dissociate the critical dimensions.</p><p>We believe that the authors should at least acknowledge these two limitation of their regression approach.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent points. We agree that the PLS approach has two notable limitations. The first is that PLS would not distinguish between two population responses that are ‘stretched’ relative to one another (i.e., share the same signals but to quite different degrees). The second is that a simple task might provide limited ability to ‘see’ dimensions that are different. For example, a more complex task might evoke a 50-dimensional response, with the first ten dimensions shared between the driving and non-driving hemispheres, and rest being completely different. Thus, we need to be careful to stress that our conclusion is simply that the signals carried by the dominant dimensions are very similar. We have made the following revisions:</p><p>1) We have altered our analysis to address the first limitation. We now employ PCA-regression rather than PLS regression. To appreciate why PCA-regression addresses this limitation, consider a scenario of the type described by the reviewers: signals X1 and Χ2 are present in both hemispheres, but X1 is emphasized in the driving cortex and Χ2 is emphasized in the non-driving cortex. If we apply PCA to the driving cortex population, and project onto the first PC, we will recover X1. When we regress driving-cortex activity against X1, it will capture considerable variance (say 60%). If we apply PCA to the non-driving cortex population, and project onto the first PC, we will recover Χ2. When we regress the driving-cortex population against Χ2, it will capture rather less variance (say 30%). Thus, PCA regression, unlike PLS regression, will reveal a mismatch in signal sizes. We therefore now employ PCA regression for this analysis (other analyses still use PLS regression). We also confirm (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) that this analysis would indeed reveal differences if they were there. The relevant figure panels (Figure 7E-G) have been updated, as has the relevant text. (We also continue to note, for completeness, that PLS regression yielded similar results.)</p><p>2) We have added the following text to explicitly acknowledge the second limitation:</p><p>“Thus, the dominant signals – those present in the top handful of principal components – are nearly identical between the driving and non-driving cortices. A caveat is that smaller signals could be quite different, which would be difficult to discern given our relatively simple task. Activity spans a modest number of dimensions when cycling at steady-state (5 principal components account for ~80% of the variance). It is quite possible that differences in smaller signals, carried by other dimensions, could be uncovered with added task complexity (e.g., cycling at different speeds or under different loads).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
