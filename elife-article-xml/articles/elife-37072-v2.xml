Whether it is rainforest soil or human skin, each environment hosts a unique community of microbes, referred to as its microbiome. There can be upwards of hundreds of species in a single microbiome, and these species can interact in a variety of ways; some cooperate, others compete, and some can kill other species. Deciphering the nature of these interactions is crucial to knowing how microbiomes work, and how they might be manipulated, for example, to improve human health. Yet studies into these interactions have proven difficult, not least because most of the species involved are difficult to grow in controlled experiments.</p><p>One environment that is home to a rich community of microbes is the outer surface of cheese, known as the cheese rind. The cheese rind microbiome is a useful system for laboratory experiments, because it is relatively easy to replicate and its microbes can be grown on their own or in combinations with others.</p><p>To explore the nature of interactions in microbiomes, Morin et al. have now grown a large collection of <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants as members of simplified microbiomes based on the cheese rind. The mutant bacteria were grown on cheese either alone, paired with one other species, or alongside a community of three species. The aim was to see which mutants grew poorly when other species were present, thus allowing Morin et al. to identify specific genes that are important for interactions within the experimental microbiomes.</p><p>Even in these simplified microbiomes, the microbes interacted in a variety of ways. Some microbes competed with <italic>E. coli</italic> for elements like iron and nitrogen; others cooperated by sharing the building blocks needed to make larger molecules. Many of the interactions that happened when <italic>E. coli</italic> was paired with one species were not seen when more species were added to the community. Similarly, some interactions were only seen when <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown alongside a community of microbes, and not when it was paired with any of the three species on their own.</p><p>These findings show that complex interactions are present even in a simplified microbiome. This experimental approach can now be applied to other microbiomes that can be grown in the laboratory to examine whether the patterns of interactions seen are generalizable or specific to the cheese rind system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cheese</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>transposon sequencing</kwd><kwd>species interactions</kwd><kwd>cross-feeding</kwd><kwd>higher-order interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CJS INRA/INRIA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morin</surname><given-names>Manon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 T32 GM 7240-40</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pierce</surname><given-names>Emily C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#2016-65131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutton</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutton</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM068763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutton</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of the global genetic requirements and gene expression changes in E. coli in the presence of a simple microbiome revealed pairwise and higher-order interactions, and underlying molecular mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microorganisms rarely grow as single isolated species but rather as part of diverse microbial communities. In these communities, bacteria, archaea, protists, viruses and fungi can coexist and perform complex functions impacting biogeochemical cycles and human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falkowski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flint et al., 2012</xref>). Deciphering microbial growth principles within a community is challenging due to the intricate interactions between microorganisms, and between microorganisms and their environment. While interest in microbial communities has dramatically increased, our understanding of microbial interactions within communities is lagging significantly behind our ability to describe the composition of a given community.</p><p>Approaches relying on 16S rDNA sequencing analyses of microbial communities can be used to reconstruct ecosystem networks and detect patterns of co-occurrence to infer general interactions such as competition, mutualism and commensalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain largely uncharacterized. Further, the way in which these interactions are organized within a community, such as whether they consist of predominantly pairwise or higher-order interactions, is even less clear. A more precise understanding of microbial interactions, their underlying mechanisms, and how these interactions are structured within a community, are all necessary to elucidate the principles by which a community is shaped. In this study, we combine genome-scale genetic and transcriptomic approaches within an experimentally tractable model microbial community to begin to address these questions.</p><p>Genome-scale approaches, such as transposon mutagenesis coupled to next-generation sequencing (TnSeq approaches) have been successfully used to quantify the contribution and thus the importance of individual genes to a given phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013</xref>). These techniques use a pooled library of transposon insertion mutants whose frequency is measured to identify genes important for growth in a given condition. Recently, the generation and introduction of unique random barcodes into transposon mutant libraries made this approach more high-throughput, enabling screens of important genes across hundreds of conditions and for numerous genetically tractable microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the genetic basis of microbial interactions, we have adapted this approach to identify and compare genetic requirements in single-species (non-interactive) and multi-species (interactive) conditions. We used a large and diverse transposon library previously generated in the genetically-tractable model bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>) to characterize the genetic requirements of interactions within a model community based on the rind of cheese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome has undergone extensive characterization can help more effectively interpret the genetic requirements introduced by growth within communities. Although <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 is not a typical endogenous species of this particular microbiome, non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains can be found in raw milk and raw-milk cheese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trmčić et al., 2016</xref>). Shiga-toxin-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 and non-0157 pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> species are common invaders of the cheese environment and can survive during cheese making causing mild to life-threatening symptoms after ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>Using the <italic>E. coli</italic> transposon library, we (i) identified the set of genes important for growth alone in the cheese environment, (ii) identified the set of genes important for growth in pairwise conditions with each individual community member and (iii) identified the set of genes important for growth in the presence of the complete community. Characterization of the functions or pathways associated with growth in interactive versus non-interactive conditions were then used to infer the biological processes involved in interactions within the model microbiome. Additionally, we compared the set of genes important for growth in pairwise conditions with the ones important for growth in a community to investigate how microbial interactions change depending on the complexity of the interactive context. We also performed a similar RB-TnSeq analysis during non-interactive and interactive conditions using a transposon library we generated in the cheese-endogenous species <italic>Pseudomonas psychrophila</italic> JB418. Finally, we measured changes in the transcriptional profile of <italic>E. coli</italic> during growth alone, growth in pairwise conditions, and within the community using RNAseq as a complementary approach to RB-TnSeq in defining microbial interactions. This analysis revealed a deep reorganization of gene expression whenever <italic>E. coli</italic> is in the presence of other species.</p><p>This work revealed numerous interactions between species, such as metabolic competition for iron and nitrogen, as well as cross-feeding from fungal partners for certain amino acids. Our analysis showed that most of the metabolic interactions (competition and cross-feeding) observed in pairwise conditions are maintained and amplified by the addition of all partners in the community context. However, around half of the genetic requirements observed in pairwise conditions were no longer apparent in the community, suggesting that higher-order interactions emerge in a community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in isolation</title><p>We used the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio_ML9 RB-TnSeq library from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>, containing a pool of 152,018 different insertion mutants (with a median of 16 insertion mutants per gene; covering 3728 of 4146 protein-coding genes), each associated with a unique 20 nucleotide barcode. This library was originally generated in and maintained on lysogeny broth medium (LB) and was used previously to identify genes required for growth across a variety of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Price et al., 2018</xref>). To determine genes important for growth on our cheese-based medium, we grew the pooled library by itself on sterile cheese curd agar plates (CCA: 10% freeze-dried fresh cheese, 3% NaCl, 0.5% xanthan gum, 1.7% agar), the same medium used in all further experiments and used previously to demonstrate that cheese communities could be successfully reconstructed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>). As the library is composed of multiple insertion mutants for a gene, we expect the individual insertion mutants to be evenly distributed in the experimental environment, minimizing the effect on any individual insertion mutant due to stochastic processes such as genetic drift or localized effects related to spatial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallatschek et al., 2007</xref>). During growth, we expect the library to modify the environment by taking up nutrients and excreting molecules (waste products, enzymes, etc). Consequently, we expect that some genetic requirements will change during growth. Thus, to provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic requirements for growth, we grew the pooled library on CCA and collected samples after 1, 2 and 3 days. For each time point, we harvested the library from the surface of the cheese plate, extracted genomic DNA, used PCR to amplify the barcoded regions of the transposons, and then sequenced these products to measure the abundance (<italic>i.e.</italic> the number of sequencing reads associated with each barcode) of each transposon mutant over time (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>The fitness of each insertion mutant was calculated as the log<sub>2</sub> of the ratio of its abundance at a given timepoint compared to its abundance at T0 (the inoculum). We calculated the raw fitness of a gene as the weighted average of the fitness of all insertion mutants of that gene. Gene fitness values were then normalized. First, fitness values are corrected to account for changes in copy number along the chromosome as insertions near the replication fork are expected to have higher copies in dividing cells. Then, fitness values were normalized based on the assumption that disruption of most of the genes leads to little or no fitness effect (see Materials and Methods and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>) for details). Consequently, most of the fitness values are expected to be close to 0, indicating that disruption of these genes leads to no particular growth modification compared to the rest of the library. Negative gene fitness values, however, identify mutants that are growing slower than the rest of the library and therefore, genes that are of particular importance for growth in the studied condition. A t-score, calculated as a moderated t-statistic, is determined for each gene fitness value to assess if the fitness value is reliably different from 0 (see Materials and Methods and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>) for details). The RB-TnSeq pipeline from experimental set-up to gene fitness calculation is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>At each timepoint, we were able to calculate the fitness and a corresponding t-score for 3298 protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Because we were interested in genes with a strong fitness defect (significant negative fitness values), we first removed genes with an absolute t-score &lt;= 3. This t-score threshold was set to identify strong negative fitness values while minimizing potential false positives (false discovery rate of 0.2%). The t-score assesses how reliably a fitness value is different from 0. In each condition, most genes have no detectable fitness effect, and thus have a fitness value close to 0. Thus, in our dataset, most of the genes below this t-score also have a fitness value close to 0. On average, 97% of the fitness values were associated with a t-score that falls below our threshold. Within the fitness values that pass the t-score threshold, we then removed genes associated with positive fitness values. Thus, we only retained the genes whose deletion leads to a consistent growth defect for <italic>E. coli</italic> on CCA compared to the rest of the library.

Within these metabolic genes, we found 28 genes associated with amino acid metabolism, specifically the biosynthesis of all amino acids except for proline, lysine and histidine. Quantification of free amino acids in our medium highlighted very low concentrations of all amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggesting that a limited supply of free amino acids leads to a genetic requirement for amino acid biosynthesis. This is supported by the observation that both <italic>spoT</italic> and <italic>relA</italic>, regulators of the stringent response which can be triggered by amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cashel et al., 1996</xref>), are also associated with a negative fitness value. Additionally, we observed the importance of the regulator <italic>gcvR</italic>, that inhibits catabolism of glycine into C1 metabolism. In fact, GcvR inhibits the glycine cleavage complex, a multienzyme complex that oxidizes glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghrist and Stauffer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghrist et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, mutants of the glycine cleavage complex displayed a significant positive fitness, suggesting that absence of glycine utilization through C1 metabolism is beneficial in our amino acid-deficient environment. Altogether, this observation also underlines that amino acids are limiting in the environment and that their biosynthesis and utilization control is important for growth. 19 of the 160 genes were associated with energy metabolism and, more specifically, with sulfur assimilation (n = 7 genes) and respiration (n = 8 genes). Here, we deduce that importance of sulfur assimilation is directly caused by the lack of the amino acids cysteine and methionine, which are the major pools of sulfur-containing compounds in the cell. As a non-endogenous species, <italic>E. coli</italic> might not possess the adequate peptidases or proteases to degrade and use the highly available protein casein. Identification of two of the three genes of the Leloir pathway (<italic>galE</italic> and <italic>galT</italic>), involved in the uptake and conversion of galactose into glucose, suggests that galactose might be a crucial nutrient for <italic>E. coli</italic> growth on CCA.</p><p>Eight genes mapped to membrane transport and were associated with two specific pathways: ferric-enterobactin transport and glycine-betaine transport. Ferric-enterobactin transport allows the cells to scavenge iron in a low-iron environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raymond et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hider and Kong, 2010</xref>). Iron is an essential micronutrient and cheese is known to be iron-limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albar et al., 2014</xref>). Glycine betaine is used by cells as an osmoprotectant in high osmolarity environments. During cheese curd processing, high concentrations of NaCl are added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guinee, 2004</xref>), and our CCA medium contains 3% NaCl to mimic these conditions. The importance for <italic>E. coli</italic> to maintain its cell osmolarity is also suggested by the requirement of genes responsible for the transport of the ions sodium, potassium and zinc.</p><p>In our experiment, the fact that all of the mutants are pooled together limits our ability to identify genes whose phenotypes can be complemented by common goods (molecules released in the environment) produced by neighboring cells. For example, given that iron is limiting in cheese, we expect that enterobactin biosynthesis is an important pathway for growth in this environment. However, no genes from the enterobactin biosynthesis pathway (<italic>entCEBAH</italic>, <italic>entD</italic> and <italic>entF</italic>) had a significant negative fitness value (average fitness of the enterobactin biosynthesis pathway: 0.1), while individual growth of these enterobactin biosynthesis mutants from the KEIO collection was limited on CCA compared to a rich, non-iron-limited medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, functions of major importance for <italic>E. coli</italic> to grow alone in our experimental environment involved (i) response to low iron availability, (ii) response to osmotic stress and (iii) response to limited available nutrients (specifically free amino acids). These required functions are consistent with recently published results on the requirements of the mammary pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (MPEC) during growth in milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olson et al., 2018</xref>) except for resistance to osmotic stress which does not occur in milk. We also generated an RB-TnSeq library in the bloomy rind cheese endogenous species <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> JB418 and found comparable requirements for growth alone on cheese (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To validate the results obtained with the RB-TnSeq library, we measured the fitness of individual knockout mutants from the <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 2006</xref>). We tested 25 knockout mutants corresponding to genes with a strong growth defect observed after one day of growth. We carried out competitive assays between each knockout mutant and the wild-type strain on CCA. We calculated each knockout mutant fitness as the log2 of the fold change of its abundance after one day of growth. A z-score was also calculated to assess the confidence of that fitness. 21 of 25 knockout mutants displayed a fitness value lower than 0 with at least 95% confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The remaining four mutant strains (<italic>brnQ</italic>, <italic>cysK</italic>, <italic>serA</italic> and <italic>trxA</italic>) were associated with high fitness value variability across replicate experiments and had a lower z-score.

As performed above, barcode frequencies were compared between T0 and after growth with each partner (at days 1, 2 and 3). As our goal is to compare genetic requirements for growth in interactive and non-interactive conditions rather than to examine changes in requirements over time, we grouped genes with a significant negative fitness for at least one timepoint as a single set of genes for each pairwise condition. We identified 145 genes with negative fitness values in <italic>E. coli</italic> for growth with <italic>H. alvei</italic>, 142 genes for growth with <italic>G. candidum</italic> and 131 genes for growth with <italic>P. camemberti</italic>.

Consistent presence of multiple genes of the same pathway within only one of these sets of genes associated with negative fitness is likely to point out a pathway specifically important in one condition. Thus, we can infer possible interactions based on the different relevant pathways between interactive and non-interactive growth conditions. Altogether, the 153 genes with a negative fitness in pairwise conditions and the 160 genes for <italic>E. coli</italic> growth alone represent 235 unique genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These can be divided into three groups of genes: (i) conserved negative fitness: genes with negative fitness in both growth alone and in all pairwise conditions (n = 78), (ii) pairwise-alleviated negative fitness: any gene found to have a negative fitness during <italic>E. coli</italic> growth alone that was not associated with a negative fitness in at least one of the three pairwise cultures (n = 82), and (iii) pairwise-induced negative fitness: any gene with negative fitness in the presence of at least one of the partners but not associated with a negative fitness during growth alone (n = 75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We further focused on the pairwise-alleviated and pairwise-induced negative fitness as these groups contain genes potentially related to interactions.</p><p>Genes whose negative fitness is alleviated by pairwise growth can highlight processes that are of importance for growth alone but no longer important because of the presence of a partner, thus suggesting interactions between <italic>E. coli</italic> and the partner. Just over half of the genes with negative fitness alone appeared to be relieved by the presence of a partner (n = 82 genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting major modifications of growth conditions following the introduction of a partner. We mapped these 82 alleviated genes to the KEGG BRITE database to identify functions and pathways that are no longer critical in the presence of a partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). 16 genes were associated with unknown or predicted proteins and did not map to any field of the database. Of the remaining genes, 45 mapped to modules of the KEGG orthology hierarchy.</p><p>Most of the genes with alleviated negative fitness were associated with the KEGG metabolism module and are thus part of metabolic pathways. It is especially evident that pairwise growth leads to major changes in the need for amino acid biosynthesis. For example, 6 out of the 8 genes of valine and isoleucine biosynthetic pathways are no longer associated with a negative fitness during pairwise growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, 2 genes of arginine biosynthesis, 2 genes of methionine biosynthesis as well as final steps of homoserine, aspartate and glutamate biosynthesis are no longer required. Moreover, <italic>ilvY</italic>, the transcriptional activator of valine and isoleucine biosynthesis was also among the genes no longer required for pairwise growth. Here, the dominant presence of amino acid biosynthesis genes in the alleviated functions suggests cross-feeding of the pathway end-products or intermediates which are either provided directly by the partner species or made more available in the environment as a consequence of the partner’s metabolic activity. Thus, our data suggest that pairwise growth may allow cross-feeding of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, arginine, methionine, homoserine, aspartate and glutamate. Isoleucine and methionine are also intermediates of cofactor biosynthesis, and genes associated with their biosynthesis were also mapped to metabolism of cofactors and vitamins.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37072.017</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of <italic>E. coli</italic> genes with negative fitness within the community and in pairwise conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Using the <italic>E. coli</italic> RB-TnSeq library, we identified genes required to grow with the community (<italic>H. alvei</italic> + G. candidum + <italic>P. camemberti</italic>).

However, cross-feeding by fungal partners was not as striking as for <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of <italic>E. coli</italic> genetic requirements for growth within the community and comparison to pairwise conditions</title><p>We next aimed to investigate the differences between genes with a negative fitness during growth in a community (complex interactive condition) and genes with a negative fitness during growth in associated pairwise conditions (simple interactive conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We grew the <italic>E. coli</italic> library with the complete community composed of <italic>H. alvei</italic>, <italic>G. candidum</italic> and <italic>P. camemberti</italic> and we identified 126 genes with a reliable negative fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). <italic>E. coli’s</italic> final biomass was more reduced by the presence of the community than by a single partner. However, the growth of each community member remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We first identified community-induced and community-alleviated genes by comparing the genes with a negative fitness in the community with the genes with a negative fitness during growth alone. We identified 89 genes that had negative fitness for both community and alone (conserved negative fitness), 37 genes with negative fitness only with the community (community-induced negative fitness) and 71 genes with negative fitness only for growth alone (community-alleviated negative fitness). As with a single partner, the presence of a complex community potentially relieves some fitness effects while introducing new ones.</p><p>Comparing community-induced and pairwise-induced genes can reveal if and how community complexity modifies the genes that are important in different interactive contexts compared to growth alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> – Interaction-induced negative fitness). We identified 29 genes with a negative fitness in both pairwise and community growth compared to growth alone (conserved interaction-induced negative fitness). These include genes associated with oxidative stress and biofilm formation. These genes are likely to be associated with pairwise interactions which are maintained in a community context.</p><p>Meanwhile, eight genes appeared to be specifically associated with negative fitness in the presence of the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, community-specific induced genes), highlighting higher-order interactions that emerge from a higher level of complexity in the community composition. Interestingly, these genes represent only a small fraction (22%) of the community-induced requirements, suggesting that most of the negative fitness effects observed in the community are derived from pairwise interactions.</p><p>Finally, we identified 46 genes that have a negative fitness in pairwise conditions, but not during growth alone or within the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, pairwise-specific induced genes). These genes could be related to interactions that are either alleviated or counteracted in a community, either by the presence of a specific species or by the community as a whole. For example, some of the identified genes were associated with antimicrobial resistance, and, in a diverse community, other species could degrade the putative antimicrobial molecules or prevent the producing species from secreting it. Consequently, <italic>E. coli</italic> would be exposed to a lower level of antimicrobials, suppressing the necessity of a resistance gene. Thus, the complex pattern of requirements for these genes may reflect higher-order interactions.</p><p>We next investigated if the interactions related to pairwise-alleviated negative fitness and community-alleviated negative fitness were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> – Interaction-alleviated negative fitness). 68 genes were no longer associated with a negative fitness in both pairwise conditions and with the community compared to growth alone (conserved interaction-alleviated negative fitness). These genes may represent pairwise interactions maintained in the community context. Amino acid biosynthesis was highly represented within these genes and more specifically biosynthesis of valine, isoleucine, methionine, homoserine, aspartate and glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that, despite the presence of more species, these amino acids are still cross-fed.</p><p>We also identified 14 genes that no longer had a negative fitness in pairwise conditions compared to growth alone yet remained with a negative fitness in growth with the community (pairwise-specific alleviated negative fitness). These 14 genes represent a small fraction of the pairwise-alleviated, thus suggesting that most of interactions related to pairwise-alleviation are maintained in the community. Finally, only three genes were specifically alleviated in the community (community-specific alleviated fitness). This points out that presence of the full community does not lead to emergence of specific alleviation of fitness effects but that most of the fitness effect alleviations observed in the community are conserved from pairwise interactions. In both cases, these 14 pairwise-specific and three community-specific alleviated genes could highlight existence of more higher-order interactions. However, too few genes are involved to determine the exact nature of these interactions.</p><p>Finally, we identified 75 genes with negative fitness in all conditions (core negative fitness). These genes encompass functions including iron uptake and response to high osmolarity. Overall, they are associated with response to environmental parameters that other species do not alleviate.</p><p>To summarize, the community-induced genes were mostly maintained from pairwise-induced genes. Similarly, the genes that were community-alleviated were highly similar to the pairwise-alleviated genes. However, we also observed emergence of higher-order interactions in the community condition as numerous interactions observed in pairwise conditions (n = 46 + 14) were not conserved in the community condition and specific interactions (n = 8 + 3) were observed in the community condition. Altogether, 58% of the interactions observed in the community were from pairwise interactions while 42% emerged from higher community complexity.</p><p>Again, we carried out similar experiments and analysis using the <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> JB418 RB-TnSeq library generated in our laboratory. The results were highly similar to the ones observed with <italic>E. coli</italic> in terms of number of genetic requirements alleviated in the presence of the community compared to growth alone as well as the number genes specifically important to grow with the community compared to growth alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, we consistently observed importance of higher-order interactions, 61% of the observed interactions in the community were conserved from pairwise interactions and 39% were higher-order interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential expression analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> in interactive conditions versus growth alone</title><p>So far, we used a genome-scale genetic approach to investigate potential microbial interactions.

We calculated the fold change of gene expression between pairwise growth and growth alone and identified differentially expressed genes by screening for adjusted p-values lower than 1% (Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing) and an absolute log2 of fold change (logFC) greater than 1. To remain consistent with the analysis performed for the genetic requirements, we pooled the data of all timepoints after identifying the upregulated or downregulated genes for each timepoint. We found a total of 966 upregulated and 977 downregulated genes across all partners (482 upregulated genes and 478 downregulated genes in presence of <italic>H. alvei</italic>, 633 upregulated genes and 719 downregulated genes in presence of <italic>G. candidum</italic>, 626 upregulated genes and 694 downregulated genes in presence of <italic>P. camemberti</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Almost half of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s genome is subjected to expression modification, suggesting a global response to the presence of a partner. We further investigated if differential expression in pairwise conditions is partner-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Around half of <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression regulation in the presence of a partner appears to be independent of which partner is present. Also, a number of genes were differentially expressed depending on the partner: 66 genes were specifically upregulated and 60 genes downregulated with <italic>H. alvei</italic>, 213 upregulated and 182 downregulated with <italic>G. candidum</italic>, and 183 upregulated and 161 downregulated with <italic>P. camemberti</italic>.</p><p>Due to the larger gene set compared to RB-TnSeq, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on the differentially expressed genes in pairwise conditions to determine upregulated functions and pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). First, almost all of the aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases and functions associated with energy production were upregulated. Interestingly upregulation of energy production through aerobic respiration and the TCA cycle happened after 3 days of growth. Oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunsalus, 1992</xref>) and growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wackwitz et al., 1999</xref>) are the two known regulators of aerobic respiration. At day 3, <italic>E. coli</italic> was observed to be in log phase when alone, whereas in the presence of a partner, and especially with <italic>P. camemberti</italic>, <italic>E.coli</italic> was observed to enter the stationary phase between day 2 and day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> – figure supplement 1). Therefore, upregulation of aerobic respiration is most likely associated with the growth stage difference between <italic>E. coli</italic> alone and with a partner. While these functions were upregulated regardless of the partner, more genes were upregulated in the presence of <italic>G. candidum</italic> than the other partners and thus, several pathways associated with nucleotide biosynthesis (C1-pool by folate, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism) were specifically upregulated with this partner. This suggests that either <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>G. candidum</italic> compete for nucleotide compounds from the environment or that presence of <italic>G. candidum</italic> leads to an increased demand of nucleotide compounds for <italic>E. coli’s</italic> metabolism and growth.</p><p>We performed a similar KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the downregulated genes in pairwise conditions. Pathways involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, specifically tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, lysine, arginine, homoserine, leucine, glutamate, threonine and glycine, appeared to be the principal downregulated functions in the presence of a partner and more particularly with a fungal partner. Interestingly, some amino acid biosynthetic pathways were upregulated later in the growth but not significantly enriched in the enrichment analysis (phenylalanine, tyrosine and leucine). Downregulation of amino acid biosynthesis suggests that the partner species generates amino acids available for cross-feeding. The observation of this interaction in the transcriptome data is consistent with our interpretation of RB-TnSeq results and reinforces the likelihood of such an interaction. However, late upregulation of some amino acid biosynthesis suggests that as the partner grows along with <italic>E. coli</italic> they eventually end up competing for amino acids, leading to biosynthesis upregulation. This late competition was unlikely to be detected by RB-TnSeq using our current analysis.</p><p>To summarize, presence of a partner triggers a significant and dynamic reorganization of <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression. Most of these modifications restructure <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolic activity: mostly in response to modification of growth phase, but also in response to nutrient availability changes and for example to benefit from cross-feeding and common goods.</p><p>Next, we aimed to determine whether <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression reorganization significantly changes when grown with the full community as compared to growth in pairwise conditions. To do so, we first calculated <italic>E. coli</italic> gene logFC at each timepoint between growth with the community and growth alone. We further analyzed genes with adjusted p-values lower than 1% (Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing) and absolute logFC greater than 1. After pooling across timepoints, we identified 465 upregulated and 476 downregulated genes in the presence of the community versus growth alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then compared these genes to the 966 upregulated genes and 977 downregulated genes in pairwise conditions versus growth alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>First, 416 genes were found to be upregulated in both pairwise and community growth versus growth alone (conserved upregulated genes). Enrichment analysis highlighted functions that were previously described as upregulated in most of the pairwise conditions: aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that certain interactions that <italic>E. coli</italic> experienced in pairwise conditions are conserved in the community context. To investigate if the addition of similar interactions from different partners leads to an amplified response, we explored if the magnitude of expression changes in these pathways is higher in the community. We performed differential expression analysis on the genes comparably regulated in pairwise conditions and with the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). 50 of the 416 conserved upregulated genes were significantly more upregulated in community growth compared to pairwise growth. Among them, sulfate assimilation genes were overrepresented. This suggests that similar pairwise interactions may be additive in the community, leading to a stronger transcriptional response.</p><p>Next, we identified 549 genes that were specifically upregulated in pairwise conditions versus growth alone and not upregulated in community versus growth alone (pairwise-specific upregulated genes). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted that these genes were mostly associated with quorum sensing, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This observation suggests that the presence of additional species in the community counteracts or prevents certain pairwise interactions. It supports the presence of higher-order interactions as highlighted with the RB-TnSeq experiments. Indeed, more than half of the upregulated genes observed in pairwise conditions are not conserved with the community.</p><p>Finally, 49 genes were specifically upregulated during community growth versus growth alone (community-specific upregulated genes). Emergence of specific expression patterns with the community also suggests the existence of higher-order interactions. However, these community-specific upregulated genes represent only a small fraction (10%) of upregulated genes within the community. Thus, most expression upregulation observed with the community is conserved from expression upregulation observed in pairwise conditions. Genes specifically upregulated with the community were associated with the biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, pyrimidine metabolism as well as arginine and proline metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Upregulation of certain amino acid biosynthesis pathways suggests that despite potential cross-feeding from individual partners, addition of many partners eventually leads to competition. Upregulation of pyrimidine, arginine and proline metabolism however is part of a larger response; the response to nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This response facilitates cell survival under nitrogen-limited conditions. Specifically, upregulated genes included all the genes involved in the regulatory loop of the transcriptional regulator NtrC (<italic>glnL</italic>) and nitrogen utilization as well as NtrC transcriptional targets: the transcriptional regulator Nac (<italic>nac</italic>), the operon <italic>rutABCDEFG</italic> involved in ammonium production by uracil catabolism, the <italic>astABCDE</italic> operon constituting the arginine degradation pathway (AST pathway) and the two regulators of the stringent response, <italic>relA</italic> and <italic>spoT</italic>. Thus, the presence of additional species in the community specifically triggers the activation of the response to nitrogen starvation, which suggests a potential higher competition for nitrogen in the community context.</p><p>We performed a similar analysis on downregulated genes in pairwise conditions and with the community versus growth alone to investigate if transcriptional downregulation in pairwise and community conditions are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We identified 448 genes that were downregulated during both pairwise and community growth conditions versus growth alone (conserved downregulated genes). Enrichment analysis pointed to the downregulation of amino acid biosynthesis as well as cysteine and methionine metabolism. Therefore, consistent with our RB-TnSeq data, this suggests that cross-feeding from a single partner is maintained in a more complex context. 527 genes were specifically downregulated in pairwise conditions and not with the community (pairwise-specific downregulated genes). Despite the large number of genes, no specific functions were enriched. However, the <italic>rutABCDEFG</italic> and <italic>astABCDE</italic> operons associated with the response to nitrogen starvation were downregulated in each pairwise condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Altogether, pairwise-specific downregulated genes represent 54% of the genes downregulated in pairwise conditions, thus strongly suggesting higher-order interactions. Here, the presence of the community may trigger a highly specific response that would otherwise be downregulated in the presence of only one species. Finally, also highlighting potential higher-order interactions, 28 genes were specifically downregulated when <italic>E. coli</italic> is grown with the community (community-specific downregulated genes). However, this represents only 6% of the observed downregulated genes in the community, highlighting again that most of the gene expression regulations in the presence of the community are conserved from gene expression regulations pairwise interactions.</p><p>To conclude, most of the changes in <italic>E. coli</italic> gene expression during growth with the community were similar to a subset of expression changes observed in pairwise conditions. Moreover, some of these changes were amplified in the community compared to pairwise. This suggests that while a large part of transcriptional regulation in the community results from pairwise interactions, similar interactions from different partners may be additive in the community and exert a stronger impact on transcription. Also, the observed changes in nitrogen availability-related transcription suggest that community growth may induce new metabolic limitations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used the model organism <italic>E. coli</italic> as a readout for microbial interactions in a model cheese rind microbiome. We used genome-scale approaches to determine the changes in <italic>E. coli’s</italic> genetic requirements and gene expression profiles in conditions with increasing levels of community complexity. Our analysis highlighted both important changes in <italic>E. coli’s</italic> genetic requirements between interactive and non-interactive conditions as well as deep reorganization of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s gene expression patterns. We identified a variety of interactive mechanisms in the different interactive contexts. Our data revealed that interactions within the community include both competitive and beneficial interactions. By reconstructing a community from the bottom up, we were able to investigate how interactions in a community change as a consequence of being in a more complex, albeit still simple, community. RNASeq and RB-TnSeq consistently showed that around half of the interactions in a community can be attributed to pairwise interactions and the other half can be attributed to higher-order interactions. Although community structure is argued to be predictable from pairwise interactions in specific cases, higher-order interactions are believed to be responsible for the general lack of predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billick and Case, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Momeni et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, such higher-order interactions have been shown to be responsible for the unpredictability of community function from individual species traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanchez-Gorostiaga et al., 2018</xref>). Our work demonstrates the existence and prevalence of these higher-order interactions even within a simple community.</p><p>Together, RB-TnSeq and RNASeq provided insight into mechanisms of mutualism between microbial species in this model system. One major interaction mechanism appears to be cross-feeding of amino acids from fungal partners. Although amino acid biosynthesis pathways were strongly required when <italic>E. coli</italic> grew alone, the presence of fungal species, but not bacterial species, led to fitness effect alleviation and downregulation of amino acid biosynthesis. This suggests that fungi increase the availability of free amino acids in the environment. Cheese-associated fungal species are known to secrete proteases that can degrade casein, the major protein found in cheese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kastman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutrou et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutrou et al., 2006a</xref>), and therefore may increase the availability of an otherwise limiting resource. Although our model system is based on cheese, interactions based on cross-feeding are widely observed in other environments, such as soil, the ocean or the human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freilich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pacheco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in the gut microbiome, Bifidobacteria can ferment starch and fructooligosaccharides and produce fermentation products including organic acids such as acetate which can in turn be consumed by butyrate-producing bacteria like <italic>Eubacterium hallii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belenguer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Vuyst and Leroy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flint et al., 2012</xref>). Cross-feeding of other nutrients in the gut has also been uncovered using a related approach (INSeq) which found that vitamin B12 from Firmicutes or Actinobacteria was important for the establishment of <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our results also revealed mechanisms of competition within the community. RNASeq highlighted that both siderophore production and uptake are upregulated in interactive conditions, suggesting that there is competition for iron between species. Competition for iron is frequently observed across many environments, including cheese, as iron is an essential micronutrient for microbial growth and often a limited resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monnet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stubbendieck and Straight, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Traxler et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, although we were able to detect fitness defects for siderophore uptake using RB-TnSeq, we did not see fitness defects for siderophore biosynthesis mutants. Because RB-TnSeq relies on a pooled library of mutants, one of the limitations to this approach is that it is difficult to detect fitness effects for genes associated with the production of common goods. For example, in the pooled library, most cells have wild-type siderophore biosynthesis genes, and thus produce and secrete siderophores into the environment under iron limitation. A consequence of this is that any cell that has lost the ability to produce siderophores can readily access the siderophores produced by neighboring cells. In contrast, the genes for uptake of common goods should remain crucial, and accordingly, we do observe fitness defects in the siderophore uptake genes. For this reason, using RNASeq can help overcome some of the limitations, such as pooling effects, associated with RB-TnSeq.</p><p>Interactions between species also appeared to lead to stressful growth conditions, as RB-TnSeq showed the need for genes to deal with growth in the presence of toxic compounds. <italic>G. candidum</italic> is known to produce and excrete D-3-phenyllactic acid and D-3-indollactic acid, which inhibit the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in the cheese environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutrou and Guéguen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dieuleveux et al., 1998</xref>). Also, strains of <italic>H. alvei</italic> isolated from meat have been shown to produce compounds inhibiting biofilm formation in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Enteritidis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chorianopoulos et al., 2010</xref>). To begin to understand the extent to which the interactions we detected with <italic>E. coli</italic> were specific to this species, or more general, we performed similar RB-TnSeq experiments with the cheese isolate <italic>Pseudomonas psychrophila.</italic> This comparative approach showed that some responses to growth with other species are conserved, such as those needed to survive stress conditions, while others differ between the two species such as amino acid cross-feeding. This further highlights the ability to detect the dynamic nature of interactions, which not only change with community complexity, but also with the composition of the community.</p><p>While our analysis highlighted global changes occurring as a consequence of interactions, and some of the key underlying interaction mechanisms, many more aspects of the biology occurring within communities are likely to be uncovered even within this simple model system. For example, much of our current analysis is limited to well-characterized pathways with strong negative fitness effects, yet many uncharacterized genes were also identified as potentially involved in interactions. Further investigation of these genes could uncover novel interaction pathways. Additionally, analysis of the exact ways in which community members modify the growth environment, such as through the production of extracellular metabolites, will be important to fully understand the molecular mechanisms of interactions.</p><p>Altogether, this study revealed the intricacy, redundancy and specificity of the many interactions governing a simple microbial community. The ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> to act as a probe for molecular interactions, the robustness of RB-TnSeq, and its complementarity with RNASeq open new paths for investigating molecular interactions in more complex communities, independently of the genetic tractability of their members, and can contribute to a better understanding of the complexity and diversity of interactions within microbiomes. Finally, our work provides a starting point for better understanding the exact nature of higher-order interactions, and how they impact microbial communities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Library, strain background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12)</td><td>Keio collection</td><td>PMID: 16738554</td><td>CGSC, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002303">SCR_002303</ext-link></td><td>Collection of 3,818 <break/><italic>E. coli</italic> knockout strains</td></tr><tr><td>Library, strain background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12)</td><td>Keio_ML9</td><td>PMID: 25968644</td><td>RB-TnSeq library of <italic>E. coli</italic> <break/>K12 BW25113 (152,018 <break/>pooled insertion mutants)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Library, strain background <break/>(<italic>Pseudomonas psychrophila</italic>)</td><td>JB418_ECP1</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td>RB-TnSeq library generated in the <break/><italic>P. psychrophila</italic> JB418 strain <break/>isolated from cheese (272,329 <break/>pooled insertion mutants)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12)</td><td>Keio ME9062</td><td>PMID: 16738554</td><td>CGSC#: 7636</td><td>Parent strain of the Keio <break/>collection mutants.

The sequencing depth for each condition varied between 1.5 and 7.5 million reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Data processing and fitness analysis</title><p>BarSeq data processing and gene fitness calculation were performed separately for the <italic>E. coli</italic> and the <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> JB418 experiments. For each library, BarSeq reads were processed using the Perl script BarSeqTest.pl from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>). This script combines two Perl scripts essential for the BarSeq data processing. After the raw reads have been de-multiplexed, the computational pipeline: (i) identifies individual barcodes and the associated number of reads, (ii) calculates the strain fitness for each insertion mutant and (iii) calculates the normalized fitness value for each gene along with a t-statistic value (t-score). The following parameters were applied during the fitness calculations: (i) only insertion mutants located within the central region of genes (10%–90%) were considered, (ii) barcodes with less than three reads in the T0 were ignored and (iii) genes with less than 30 counts across all barcodes in T0 were ignored. For each library, the pipeline uses a table where each barcode is mapped to a location in the genome. The Arkin lab (Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA) kindly provided the TnSeq table for the <italic>E. coli</italic> library and we generated a TnSeq table for <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> strain JB418. The different scripts used for this analysis originate from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>) and are publicly available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/feba.">https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/feba.</ext-link></p><p>We calculated <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> JB418 genes fitnesses at T = 24 hr (Day1), 48 hr (Day2) and 72 hr (Day3) in the following conditions: growth alone, growth with <italic>H. alvei</italic>, growth with <italic>G. candidum</italic>, growth with <italic>P. camemberti</italic> and growth with the community.</p><p>First, strain fitness for each insertion mutant that met the criteria described above is calculated as the log2 of the ratio of the insertion mutant’s abundance at the time of the harvest (number of reads of the associated barcode) and its abundance in the T0 sample. Un-normalized gene fitness is then calculated as the weighted average of strain fitness of all the insertion mutants of a gene. Un-normalized fitness values are then normalized, first by subtracting the smoothed median of the un-normalized fitness values. This is performed to account for changes in gene copy number along the chromosome as genes close to the replication fork might have multiple copies in diving cells. Then, the final normalization step relies on the assumption that disruption of most of the genes leads to little to no fitness effect. This normalization is performed by subtracting the mode of the gene fitness. Thus, most of the genes are expected to have a fitness of 0. Genes whose disruption is deleterious will have a negative fitness and genes whose disruption is beneficial a positive fitness. A t-score is calculated along with each gene fitness to evaluate how reliably different from zero the gene fitness is. The t-score is a moderated t-statistic calculated as the ratio of the gene fitness and its standard deviation.

The number of the mutant cells and the WT cells were calculated at T0 and day one after harvesting and homogenizing the cheese plug, plating serial dilutions and counting CFUs. Experimental fitness of each mutant was calculated as the log2 of the ratio of the mutant abundance (mutant CFUs divided by total CFUs (WT +mutant)) after 24 hr and its abundance at T0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNASeq and differential expression analysis</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>RNASeq library preparation</title><p>Libraries were prepared in duplicate for the following conditions: <italic>E. coli</italic> growth alone, with <italic>H. alvei</italic>, with <italic>G. candidum</italic>, with <italic>P. camemberti</italic> and with the community for T = 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr. RNA samples from the <italic>E. coli</italic> BarSeq experiment were used to produce the RNASeq library.</p><p>Each library was prepared as follows. First, RNA samples were treated with DNAse using the ‘Rigorous DNAse treatment’ for the Turbo DNA-free kit (AMBION, Life Technologies, Waltham, MA) and RNA concentration was measured by nucleic acid quantification in Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Then, transfer RNAs and 5S RNA were removed using the MEGAclear Kit Purification for Large Scale Transcription Reactions (AMBION, Life Technologies) following manufacturer instructions. Absence of tRNA and 5S RNA was verified by running 100 ng of RNA on a 1.5% agarose gel and RNA concentration was quantified by nucleic acid quantification in Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer. Also, presence of trace amounts of genomic DNA was assessed by PCR using universal bacterial 16S PCR primers (Forward primer: AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG, Reverse Primer: GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT). The PCR was performed in a final volume of 20 µL: 10 µL of Q5 polymerase master mix (New England Biolabs), 0.5 µL of forward primer 10 uM, 0.5 µL of reverse primer 10 uM and 5 µL of non-diluted RNA. PCR products were run on a 1.7% agarose gel and if genomic DNA was amplified, another DNAse treatment was performed as well as a new verification of absence of genomic DNA. Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit by Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA). According to manufacturer instructions; we used 1 µL of RiboGuard RNAse Inhibitor in each sample as suggested and followed instructions for 1–2.5 ug of RNA input and we used a 2:1 mix of bacterial Ribo-Zero Removal solution and yeast Ribo-Zero Removal solution. rRNA depleted samples were recovered in 10 µL after ethanol precipitation. Concentrations after ribodepletion were measured using Qubit RNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen). The RNASeq library was produced using the NEBNextUltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina for purified mRNA or ribosome depleted RNA. We prepared a library with fragments size of 300 nucleotides and used the 10 uM NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Set 1, NEB #E7335) lot 0091412 and the NEBNext multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Set 2, NEB #E7500) lot 0071412. We performed PCR product purification with 0.8X Agencourt AMPure XP Beads instead of 0.9X. Library samples were quantified with Qubit DNA HS Assay Kits before the quality and fragment size were validated by TapeStation (HiSensD1000 ScreenTape). Library samples were pooled at a concentration of 15 nM each and were sequenced on HiSeq4000 (50 bp, single-end).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>RNASeq reads were mapped to the concatenated genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 BW25113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grenier et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>H. alvei</italic> using Geneious version R9 9.1.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>]).

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Changes in the genetic requirements for microbial interactions with increasing community complexity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Alvaro Sanchez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In &quot;Changes in the genetic requirements for microbial interaction with increasing community complexity&quot; the authors show that bacteria require a different set of genes to grow alone, in pairwise competition, or in communities. Moreover, they also show that the gene expression profile in the bacteria changes upon the bacterial interaction partner. The addressed question and the conclusion that genetic requirements of bacteria are interaction dependent are very, very interesting.</p><p>Please note we are aware of the messaging exchange that clarified a key methodological concern of the reviewers and enabled this request for resubmission. Please make sure that the clarification of these concerns is clearly addressed in the revised submission.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The mutant library consists of 150,000+ strains. Were all of these strains grown as 150,000 separate colonies on the CCA agar plates? Or were they a complex mixture? If they were grown as a mixture, then different mutants can interact within the mix (e.g. cross-feeding) obscuring the findings of genes relevant for growth on CCA medium. Please clarify the growth conditions and discuss the limitations of the chosen condition.</p><p>Spatial aspects:</p><p>The experiments were done in a spatial setting, by plating the bacteria on agar. However, this will lead to strong spatial heterogeneity, with areas where only specific mutants grow, whereas interaction may happen only at the borders of those patches. This may obscure a lot of interaction. Moreover, the population expands in a spatial environment, which is known to cause genetic drift that can obscure the fitness outcomes of those bacteria.</p><p>Single species cultures were done on 100mm (?) petri dishes but pairwise and community experiments were done in 96-well plates and thus different spatial settings. Why was the experimental design changed between the different experiments? Moreover the number of bacteria per area was much higher in the petri dishes than in the 96-well plates. Since the size of the inoculum will change the spatial organization (fewer cells lead to bigger, homogeneous patches) and the interaction depends on the spatial organization, the change of experimental design from one experiment to the other may alter the outcome and makes me wonder how comparable the experiments are.</p><p>Terminology:</p><p>All reviewers had trouble with the terminology: &quot;essential&quot; vs. &quot;important&quot; genes. An &quot;essential gene&quot; is one essential for growth. That is not the usage by the authors. Instead, here, &quot;essential genes&quot; are just genes with reliably negative fitness effects upon knock-out. However, this may be true for many (likely even the majority of) genes?</p><p>The authors state that the fitness was calculated for 3289 genes. 40 were removed by showing positive fitness effects upon knock out, but in the end only 160 genes were identified as having negative fitness effects. Does it mean that the majority of genes (around 3000) were excluded because they showed non-reliable data (small t-score)? Are the obtained 160 genes not so much 'essential genes' but simply genes that lead to reproducible data? In other words, the majority of gene-knockout could lead to decreased fitness but just some show reliable results and those are called 'essential genes'. How strong is variation for different insertion localizations within the same gene? How sensitively are fitness measures depending on the parameters chosen for the pipeline? How strong is variation between triplicates? Does this explain the many unreliable fitness values?</p><p>Timing:</p><p>This issue is related to the library pool method that the authors use to determine fitness. Is it that they are pooling together the entire transposon deletion library, throwing it together into their CCA medium, and measuring the fitness at three different time points? What they are putting together is already a community of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains which, collectively, strongly modify their environment as they grow. Thus, this <italic>E. coli</italic> community already contains multiple interactions among mutant strains, which are probably less strong early on during the growth period (say at day 1) when the environmental effects of the community's growth (i.e. through the collective depletion and secretion of resources) would be expected to still be weak-ish. However, on days 2, 3 there should be significant environmental construction by the community, and indeed this is apparent, not only by the fact that the population is not growing anymore after ~40hr (Figure 1A), but by the fact that the genes that show a negative fitness effect on days 2-3 are not the same as those that have an effect on day 1 (Figure 1B).</p><p>The authors do have a control for this, by looking at individual mutants that had been scored as having a negative effect within the community and directly competing them against the wild-type after one day of co-culture. In most cases this works well (See Figure 1—figure supplement 5), but they did not do the same for days 2-3, when interactions among deletion mutants that are pooled together may be stronger. A different but related complication to interpret deleterious mutations during days 2-3 (when the multi-strain population is not growing anymore) is the possibility of cell death. The authors measure population size by CFUs, and the population size does barely change after 40hrs. While the obvious explanation is that cells are just not dividing anymore but is it possible that some cell death is occurring but it is balanced by cell divisions? A breakdown of which genes are deleterious on days 1, 2, 3 in each of the conditions (monoculture, pairwise, community) would be helpful to disentangle which genes are deleterious in the unperturbed CCD environment that the authors provide (and whose composition is well understood) versus in the environment constructed by the <italic>E. coli</italic> community, which is much less well understood in this case. This is important in order to adequately rationalize and interpret interactions with other species either in pairwise or multi-species communities; The data presented in Figure 2-3 is also, evidently, pooling together genes that are deleterious in days 1, 2, 3.</p><p>An analysis where the genes found to be essential on days 1, 2, 3 are separated (which to some extent they do in Figure 1B, but then they do not incorporate into their analysis any further, as far as I could see) would be worthwhile, and a discussion of the limitations of the method particularly in the context of environmental/niche construction would significantly strengthen the paper.</p><p>Discussion points:</p><p>Either in the Introduction, or in the Discussion sections, the authors should relate their findings of suggested mechanisms for interactions in communities to related findings from other microbial communities, beyond cheese. In addition, <italic>E. coli</italic> (which the work mainly focuses on, i.e. Figures1-5) does not normally live on cheese rinds and is therefore not a natural interaction partner for the other species. The authors address this issue in the Introduction only very briefly, by pointing out that their transposon screen allows them to identify the genetic requirements for <italic>E. coli</italic> interacting with the other species. This is correct of course, but identifying the relevant interactions for <italic>E. coli</italic> to live with species it never encounters in the real world may be irrelevant. The authors can use the same data and analysis to identify how the 3 cheese-native species interact with other species using <italic>E. coli</italic> as a readout. This kind of analysis is already present in the results description, but a clearer distinction between which side of the interaction is being investigated throughout the manuscript would conceptually strengthen the manuscript. In addition, a clearer and longer description (beyond technological justification) in the Introduction for why using <italic>E. coli</italic> is relevant is needed.</p><p>higher-order interactions, subsection “Identification of <italic>E. coli</italic> genes essential for growth within the community and comparison with genes essential for growth in pairwise conditions”, last paragraph: The authors mention that their findings from the TnSeq screen &quot;underline the presence of higher-order interactions&quot;. An explanatory paragraph on the relevant genes is necessary. There is currently only one paragraph (see seventh paragraph of the aforementioned subsection), which does not describe anything about these genes except that there are 14+3 relevant genes. Also: this small number of relevant genes seems to be at odds with the rather broad statement of the relevance of higher-order interactions given at the end of the Introduction.</p><p>The function of every gene doesn't need to be discussed in the main text (e.g. subsection “Identification of genes essential for <italic>E. coli</italic> growth in pairwise conditions”, fifth paragraph). The <italic>P. psychrophila</italic> story might just be put to the supplement, since it does not really add new things. Either in the Introduction, or in the Discussion sections, the authors should relate their findings of suggested mechanisms for interactions in communities to related findings from other microbial communities, beyond cheese.</p><p>Many of the figures show number of genes that are essential for this or that condition. These numbers are hard to interpret. They are not really put into context (e.g. what does the 26 in Figure 2B top really convey? How would it change the overall message if this number were 10 or 50?). In most cases they confuse more than they transport real information. More of a summary of the meaning of the numbers would perhaps be helpful.</p><p>Specific questions:</p><p>Subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of the <italic>E. coli</italic> sensor species in isolation”, first paragraph: This equation for the fitness cannot be correct, as it will always be positive. Or should the normalization be included in the fitness equation? But which strain has no growth rate defect on CCA medium? The WT? Please clarify and reword. It seems like some mutants had a growth-increase on CCA medium (but were excluded from the analysis).</p><p>Subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of the <italic>E. coli</italic> sensor species in isolation”, second paragraph: Why is the number of genes for which the fitness was calculated smaller than the number of genes covered in the transposon library?</p><p>Subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of the <italic>E. coli</italic> sensor species in isolation”, last paragraph: Why were only 25 defined mutants tested and not all (since the Keio collection is comprehensive)? How were these 25 mutants chosen?</p><p>How many genes did the authors remove based on the criteria of T0? Was there any bias in the genes you removed?</p><p>How was fitness value estimated and t-score? assume it is described in Wetmore at al., 2015, but it would be helpful to shortly explain here as well.</p><p>How was number of generations measured in Figure 1A? Could the authors show the fitness 'raw data' of the pairwise and community conditions like they showed them for <italic>E. coli</italic> alone in Figure 1B?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37072.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The mutant library consists of 150,000+ strains.

Please clarify the growth conditions and discuss the limitations of the chosen condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The library is composed of 152018 insertions mutants pooled together. We apologize for any confusion, and have clarified that the library is a mix of mutants growing together in the text (Results – subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in isolation”). As a mixture, the mutants have the potential to interact with each other, such as through cross-feeding. We agree that this is an important limitation of using a pooled library, and in the original manuscript, we briefly discussed this possibility. We have now added a more detailed discussion of the concerns associated with “pooling” effects.</p><p>In the Results: “In our experiment, the fact that all of the mutants are pooled together limits our ability to identify genes whose phenotypes can be complemented by common goods (molecules released in the environment) produced by neighboring cells. […] However, no genes from the enterobactin biosynthesis pathway (<italic>entCEBAH, entD</italic> and <italic>entF</italic>) had a significant negative fitness value (average fitness of the enterobactin biosynthesis pathway: 0.1), while individual growth of these enterobactin biosynthesis mutants from the KEIO collection grew poorly on CCA compared to a rich, non-iron-limited medium (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>In the Discussion: “Because RB-TnSeq relies on a pooled library of mutants, one of the limitations to this approach is that it is difficult to detect fitness effects for genes associated with the production of common goods. […] For this reason, using RNASeq can help overcome some of the limitations, such as pooling effects, associated with RB-TnSeq.”</p><p>Because we have a very clear instance of how a pooled library will miss genes whose products can be complemented by the products of neighboring cells (common goods), we decided to use this as an example to illustrate this limitation. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we show that mutants in the enterobactin siderophore production pathway, when grown individually, fail to grow on the iron-limited cheese curd agar (CCA). However, in our RB-TNseq analysis, these mutants do not show a growth defect as a result of the pooling of mutants in the library. In contrast, our RNAseq analysis shows that these genes are upregulated on CCA, suggesting that siderophore production is important for growth on CCA, consistent with the grow defects we observe of mutants grown individually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Spatial aspects:</p><p>The experiments were done in a spatial setting, by plating the bacteria on agar. However, this will lead to strong spatial heterogeneity, with areas where only specific mutants grow, whereas interaction may happen only at the borders of those patches. This may obscure a lot of interaction. Moreover, the population expands in a spatial environment, which is known to cause genetic drift that can obscure the fitness outcomes of those bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that spatial structure can, and certainly does, impact interactions in an environment that is not well-mixed. However, in our experiment, there are many insertion mutants representing each gene (median of 16 insertion mutants/gene), and we expect these mutants to be randomly distributed on the plate. As a result, all of the mutants of a gene won’t be clustered together in a specific area of the agar plate. Thus we expect that stochastic events (such as potential genetic drift) may randomly affect individual insertion mutants, but are very unlikely to affect all the insertion mutants of a gene. We have addressed that concern in the manuscript.</p><p>“As the library is composed of multiple insertion mutants for a gene, we expect the individual insertion mutants to be evenly distributed in the experimental environment, minimizing the effect on any individual insertion mutant due to stochastic processes such as genetic drift or localized effects related to spatial structure <underline>(Hallatschek et al., 2007)</underline>.”</p><p>Further, in the RNASeq analysis, the effects of spatial structure should be averaged across all cells. Therefore, in the event that we miss potential interactions with the RB-TnSeq due to spatial structure, we should be able to identify these in RNAseq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Single species cultures were done on 100mm (?) petri dishes but pairwise and community experiments were done in 96-well plates and thus different spatial settings. Why was the experimental design changed between the different experiments? Moreover the number of bacteria per area was much higher in the petri dishes than in the 96-well plates. Since the size of the inoculum will change the spatial organization (fewer cells lead to bigger, homogeneous patches) and the interaction depends on the spatial organization, the change of experimental design from one experiment to the other may alter the outcome and makes me wonder how comparable the experiments are.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments performed in 96 well plates containing cheese curd agar (Figure 2A) included an <italic>E. coli</italic> “alone” condition, in addition to the pairwise and community conditions.

An &quot;essential gene&quot; is one essential for growth. That is not the usage by the authors. Instead, here, &quot;essential genes&quot; are just genes with reliably negative fitness effects upon knock-out. However, this may be true for many (likely even the majority of) genes?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion due to use of the word “essential”.

Does it mean that the majority of genes (around 3000) were excluded because they showed non-reliable data (small t-score)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers concerns here are mostly due to a confusing explanation of the t-score and an inappropriate use of the word “unreliable”. We hope the following explanation and figures will eliminate this confusion. Similar explanations have also been added in the new manuscript in the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><p>Along with the normalized gene fitness, a t-score is calculated as a moderated t-statistic (see specific details on how the t-score is estimated below). By definition, the t-score values are conceptually similar to a z-score and ideally follow a normal distribution. The t-score is meant to indicate how reliably a gene fitness value is different from 0. In our data analysis, we set-up a t-score threshold of absolute(t-score)&gt;=3, to identify genes with fitness values confidently different from 0 with a false discovery rate of 0.2%. Thus, we aim to identify genes associated with strong fitness defects and filter out genes with subtle to no fitness effect. Moreover, genes fitness normalization relies on the assumption that disruption of most of the genes should lead to subtle to no fitness modification. Consequently, most genes are expected to not have a strong fitness value and to be filtered out by the t-score.</p><p>As expected, for each analyzed condition, the vast majority of fitness values (on average 97%) did not pass our t-score threshold and were thus not considered strong fitness effects (Figure 1A). While the majority of the rejected fitness values are associated with low to no fitness effect (fitness value close to 0), some of the rejected fitness values (7%) might appear as strong fitness effects but did not meet our confidence threshold. This group of genes may not pass the confidence threshold due to high variability resulting from: (i) noisy data due to low number of reads in the T0 sample, (ii) a low number of insertion mutants for a gene or (iii) variability within the insertion mutant fitness of a gene associated with insertion location.</p><p>Plots presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> compare these parameters for the genes with significant fitness values and genes with high fitness values (fitness values &gt;0.5 and &lt;-0.5) but not passing the t-score threshold at day 3 during growth alone. The number of insertion mutants and number of reads in the T0 samples appeared to be lower for gene fitness values that did not pass the t-score cutoff than for the genes with significant fitness values. However, we did not observe strong differences associated with variation due to insertion location. Thus, low numbers of insertion mutants within a given gene and/or low sequencing coverage in the T0 sample may increase variability and lower confidence in gene fitness calculation. Higher sequencing depth would decrease the variability attributed to low counts in the T0 sample.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37072.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Investigation of parameters potentially influencing variability in gene fitness calculation.</title><p>Here, we compare (i) the number of insertion mutants/gene, (ii) the number of counts/gene in the T0 sample and (iii) the variability associated with insertion location, for genes with fitness values that pass the t-score threshold and genes with strong fitness values (fitness values &gt;0.5 or &lt;-0.5) that don’t pass the t-score threshold.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-37072-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>While variation associated with insertion location did not appear as a general reason for variability, it may it some specific cases be the origin of variation as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>.

In other words, the majority of gene-knockout could lead to decreased fitness but just some show reliable results and those are called 'essential genes'.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the majority of gene-knockouts had a fitness close to 0, meaning their disruption did not lead to statistically significant defect compared to the other mutants in the library. The 160 genes are the genes whose disruption leads to a growth defect compared to the rest of the library in the studied condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How strong is variation for different insertion localizations within the same gene?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in Wetmore et al. 2015, different parameters are calculated in the fitness calculation pipeline which allow assessment of the quality of the experiment (i.e. the quality of the calculated fitness). One of these parameters is mad12, defined as the absolute median of difference between fitness in the first half and fitness in the second half of the gene. Another parameter, cor12, calculates the correlation between the fitness in the first half of the gene and the second half of a gene. To ensure that there is not strong dependency of gene fitness on the insertion location, mad12 has to be lower than 0.5 and cor12&gt;= 0.1. These criteria were met in all our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>) and were added as Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Further, for individual genes, insertions within the first and last 10% of a gene are not included in the analysis to reduce bias due to insertion location. For most of the genes, low variation due to insertion location is expected. However, in some specific cases, variation within the insertion mutant fitness values of a same gene can be observed. As an example of potential variation depending on the insertion location, we present below the insertion mutants’ fitness as a function of the insertion location for a gene with low variation of insertion mutant fitness values (<italic>htrC</italic> – growth alone – day 3) and a gene with variation of insertion mutant fitness values associated with insertion location (<italic>pcnB</italic> – growth alone – day 3). We observe a low variance among the insertion mutant fitness of the gene htrC (upper plot) as fitness values are randomly distributed around 0. On the other hand, <italic>pcnB</italic> (lower plot) has a fitness value not close to 0 but not confidently different from 0 according to our confidence criteria. Variation of insertion mutant fitness values depending on the insertion location in this gene may in this specific example be the reason for a low t-score value.</p><p>The variation based on insertion location is taken into account in the t-score calculation (see below for details on how the t-score is calculated) as the estimated variance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How sensitively are fitness measures depending on the parameters chosen for the pipeline?</p></disp-quote><p>In the pipeline, parameters affecting gene fitness measures include: (i) exclusion of insertion mutants and genes based on the number of reads in the T0 sample and (ii) exclusion of insertion mutants if the insertion is within the first and last 10% of the gene. These parameters help reduce the noise due to low abundance in the inoculated library or to insertion location. For our analysis, we used the default parameters established by Wetmore et al. as lowering them would increase the noise and variability of data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How strong is variation between triplicates? Does this explain the many unreliable fitness values?</p></disp-quote><p>In our experimental setup, the replicates were pooled for sequencing. qPCR analysis of pairwise and community conditions highlighted that <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA concentration in the DNA extractions was low, presumably due to the presence of DNA from the other species. This would result in only 2ng of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA instead of the 50ng input recommend for the PCR. Consequently, barcodes with low representation in the library because of strong fitness defects may be missed by the PCR. We decided to pool PCR products of replicates of a condition to increase our chances of detecting barcodes associated with low abundance. Thus we only have one fitness value per condition and cannot assess the variation between replicates within these data. A previous RB-TnSeq analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> growth alone on CCA in similar inoculation conditions were performed in 4 replicates in the lab and highlighted high correlation between replicates (Pearson coefficient of 0.8). Also, Wetmore et al., 2015 highlighted a correlation between 2 biological replicates ranging from 0.79 to 0.97. Thus, this highlights low variability and high reproducibility of RB-TnSeq data.</p><p>As described previously, most of the gene fitness values were not unreliable but close to 0.</p><p>Edits have been made in the revised manuscript to remove the confusion about unreliable fitness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Timing:</p><p>This issue is related to the library pool method that the authors use to determine fitness. Is it that they are pooling together the entire transposon deletion library, throwing it together into their CCA medium, and measuring the fitness at three different time points? What they are putting together is already a community of E. coli strains which, collectively, strongly modify their environment as they grow. Thus, this E. coli community already contains multiple interactions among mutant strains, which are probably less strong early on during the growth period (say at day 1) when the environmental effects of the community's growth (i.e. through the collective depletion and secretion of resources) would be expected to still be weak-ish. However, on days 2, 3 there should be significant environmental construction by the community, and indeed this is apparent, not only by the fact that the population is not growing anymore after ~40hr (Figure 1A), but by the fact that the genes that show a negative fitness effect on days 2-3 are not the same as those that have an effect on day 1 (Figure 1B).</p><p>The authors do have a control for this, by looking at individual mutants that had been scored as having a negative effect within the community and directly competing them against the wild-type after one day of co-culture. In most cases this works well (See Figure 1—figure supplement 5), but they did not do the same for days 2-3, when interactions among deletion mutants that are pooled together may be stronger. A different but related complication to interpret deleterious mutations during days 2-3 (when the multi-strain population is not growing anymore) is the possibility of cell death. The authors measure population size by CFUs, and the population size does barely change after 40hrs. While the obvious explanation is that cells are just not dividing anymore but is it possible that some cell death is occurring but it is balanced by cell divisions? A breakdown of which genes are deleterious on days 1, 2, 3 in each of the conditions (monoculture, pairwise, community) would be helpful to disentangle which genes are deleterious in the unperturbed CCD environment that the authors provide (and whose composition is well understood) versus in the environment constructed by the E. coli community, which is much less well understood in this case. This is important in order to adequately rationalize and interpret interactions with other species either in pairwise or multi-species communities; The data presented in Figure 2-3 is also, evidently, pooling together genes that are deleterious in days 1, 2, 3.</p><p>An analysis where the genes found to be essential on days 1, 2, 3 are separated (which to some extent they do in Figure 1B, but then they do not incorporate into their analysis any further, as far as I could see) would be worthwhile, and a discussion of the limitations of the method particularly in the context of environmental/niche construction would significantly strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed the transposon library is a pool of 152,018 insertion mutants. Over time, we expect the environment to change in response to the library growth as cells will utilize available nutrients and release molecules, thereby modifying the environment. These abiotic modifications are expected to lead to different genetic requirements at different stages of the growth. For this reason, we decided to calculate gene fitness at multiple timepoints, to encompass as many of the genetic requirements that could be important for any moment of the growth as possible. As the library is pooled and we expect all the insertion mutants (on average 16 per gene) to be evenly distributed on the plate, we expect that the whole library is likely to modify the environment as a wild-type culture would, and thus interactions among insertion mutants won’t lead to specific modifications of the environment. Moreover, the reviewers assume strong interactions between mutants and significant pooling effect within the library. The fact that most of the genes have a fitness value close to 0 suggests that this is not the case.</p><p>Although we agree completely that the dynamics of gene fitness requirements over time would be a very interesting future direction, our primary goal in this work was to identify the genes that are important for growth in non-interactive (alone) and interactive conditions (pairwise and community),. As described above, our motivation for collecting data at several timepoints, was to maximize our detection of genes that are important for growth, regardless of timepoint or growth stage. Following gene fitness calculations, we group all the genes that are important at each timepoint as a single group of important genes for each condition. To more accurately reflect this approach, in the revised manuscript, the data generated across timepoints are displayed together as a single dataset per condition.</p><p>In order to provide a quantitative description of the differences between timepoints, additional comparative methods are needed. We are currently working on developing these methods, but we believe that this is outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion points:</p><p>Either in the Introduction, or in the Discussion sections, the authors should relate their findings of suggested mechanisms for interactions in communities to related findings from other microbial communities, beyond cheese.</p></disp-quote><p>Such comparisons have been added within the Discussion section in the revised manuscript. We have specifically mentioned examples of cross-feeding in the human gut microbiome.</p><p>“Although our model system is based on cheese, interactions based on cross-feeding are widely observed in other environments, such as soil, the ocean or the human gut (Freilich et al., 2011; Pacheco et al., 2018; Goldford et al., 2017). […] Cross-feeding of other nutrients in the gut has also been uncovered using a related approach (INSeq) which found that vitamin B12 from Firmicutes or Actinobacteria was important for the establishment of <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> in mice <underline>(Goodman et al., 2009)</underline>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, E. coli (which the work mainly focuses on, i.e. Figures1-5) does not normally live on cheese rinds and is therefore not a natural interaction partner for the other species. The authors address this issue in the Introduction only very briefly, by pointing out that their transposon screen allows them to identify the genetic requirements for E. coli interacting with the other species. This is correct of course, but identifying the relevant interactions for E. coli to live with species it never encounters in the real world may be irrelevant. The authors can use the same data and analysis to identify how the 3 cheese-native species interact with other species using E. coli as a readout. This kind of analysis is already present in the results description, but a clearer distinction between which side of the interaction is being investigated throughout the manuscript would conceptually strengthen the manuscript. In addition, a clearer and longer description (beyond technological justification) in the Introduction for why using E. coli is relevant is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary rationale for using <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 in this work was due to it being a well-characterized model organism, which would allow us to more easily interpret the biological processes associated with fitness effects.

Or should the normalization be included in the fitness equation? But which strain has no growth rate defect on CCA medium? The WT? Please clarify and reword. It seems like some mutants had a growth-increase on CCA medium (but were excluded from the analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>The equation described in the former manuscript calculates the un-normalized gene fitness as the weighted average of the strain fitness (i.e. insertion mutant fitness) and is calculated as follows:</p><p>Strainfitness=fs=log2nafter+φ-log2(n0+1φ</p><p>with nafter and n0 the number of reads of the mutant’s barcode (mutants abundance) at the time of the harvest and in the T0 respectively and φa “pseudocount” to avoid noisy data when nafter is very low to null (as done previously in Wetmore et al., 2015). The strain fitness values are negative whenever nafteris lower than n0. Along with the strain fitness, the strain variance is calculated as:</p><p>Strainvariance=Vs=11+nafter+11+n0In(2)2</p><p>Then, the unnormalized gene fitness is calculated as follows:</p><p>Unnormalized gene fitness=fu=∑i(wifsi)∑iwi</p><p>with i representing each insertion mutant of a given gene and wi the weight associated to the strain fitness inversely proportional to its variance.</p><p>Then, gene fitness values are normalized. First, a normalization is performed to account for changes in copy number along chromosome (as gene close to the replication fork are expected to have higher copy in dividing cells). This normalization uses the smoothed median within each scaffold (there is only one scaffold in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic>). Then, gene fitness is also normalized so that the typical gene has a fitness of zero. Here, this normalization step does not rely on the WT but on the assumption that disruption of most of the genes leads to subtle to no effects on fitness. Thus, the normalization is performed by subtracting the mode of the gene fitness values distribution from the gene fitness values. Therefore, negative fitness identifies genes whose disruption leads to a growth defect compared to the overall library population and positive fitness identifies genes whose disruption leads to a better fitness than most of the insertion mutants in the library. These methods are described in detail in Wetmore et al., 2015.</p><p>We added this information in the revised manuscript (Results and Materials and methods) as well as in a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) which represents the pipeline of the RB-TnSeq experiments and analysis.</p><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, even if we identified positive fitness values, we excluded them from our analysis as we only focused on negative fitness values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of the E. coli sensor species in isolation”, second paragraph: Why is the number of genes for which the fitness was calculated smaller than the number of genes covered in the transposon library?</p></disp-quote><p>The number of genes covered in the library indicates how many <italic>E. coli</italic> genes have at least one insertion mutant with an insertion in the central part of the gene (within the central 10% – 90% of the genes).

To be considered, an insertion mutant must have more than 3 reads in the T0 sample., After removing barcodes with fewer than 3 reads, the total number of reads for all barcodes in a gene are summed, and any gene with fewer than 30 total reads is also removed from the analysis.

Was there any bias in the genes you removed?</p></disp-quote><p>The library covers 3728 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes and we calculated the fitness of 3298 genes. Thus, 430 genes were removed from that analysis based on the T0 criteria. We did not observe bias in the genes removed in terms of function, genome location or strand location.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was fitness value estimated and t-score? assume it is described in Wetmore at al., 2015, but it would be helpful to shortly explain here as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the previous question for fitness value calculation. We added this information in the revised manuscript (Results – subsection “Identification of the basic genetic requirements for growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in isolation” and Materials and methods) as well as in supplementary figures (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The t-score is used to estimate the reliability of fitness of a gene and how reliably it is different from 0. It is calculated using a moderated t statistic, and can be described as the gene fitness divided by the maximum of two estimates of the gene fitness standard deviation:</p><p>t=fgσ2+max⁡(Vn,Vo)</p><p>Where fg is the normalized gene fitness, σ a small constant (equal to 0.1) to represent uncertainty in the normalization of small fitness values and V is the maximum of two variances: the naïve variance (V<sub>n</sub>) calculated based on the best-case Poisson-noise and number of reads for the gene, and the estimated variance (V<sub>e</sub>) based on the consistency of fitness for the insertion mutant of that gene and particularly adapted for genes with few insertion mutants as it incorporates data from other genes, too. Such information has been added in the Materials and methods of the revised manuscript and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was number of generations measured in Figure 1A? Could the authors show the fitness 'raw data' of the pairwise and community conditions like they showed them for E. coli alone in Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, the purpose of Figure 1A was to display when sampling was performed for RB-TnSeq experiments. As this information is not essential for the understanding of the experiment, and further because the number of generations was not used in any part of the fitness calculations, this figure has been removed in the revised manuscript to avoid any confusion. Scatter plots showing the fitness values and the t-scores have been added in Figure 2B and Figure 3A for the different pairwise conditions and for the growth community. Also, the raw data have been added in the figures source files.</p></body></sub-article></article>
