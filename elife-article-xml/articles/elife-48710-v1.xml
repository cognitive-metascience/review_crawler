This form of variation may serve as a mechanism for the emergence of new traits in musical systems. In this study, we aim to investigate whether individual differences in the social learning and transmission of music relate to intrinsic neural dynamics of auditory processing systems. We combined auditory and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an interactive laboratory model of cultural transmission, the signaling game, in an experiment with a large cohort of participants (N=51). We found that the degree of interhemispheric rs-FC within fronto-temporal auditory networks predicts—weeks after scanning—learning, transmission, and structural modification of an artificial tone system. Our study introduces neuroimaging in cultural transmission research and points to specific neural auditory processing mechanisms that constrain and drive variation in the cultural transmission and regularization of musical systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cultural transmission</kwd><kwd>signaling games</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>resting-state functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>interhemispheric connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Grundforskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vuust</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Resting-state functional connectivity between core regions of fronto-temporal auditory networks can distinguish music transmitters from innovators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human brain function shows substantial variability across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergfeldt, 2016</xref>). An emerging question in the study of cultural evolution is whether aspects of variability in brain function relate to variation in the acquisition and transmission of symbolic systems observed across individuals in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dediu and Ladd, 2007</xref>). In recent years, it has been argued that symbolic systems, including language and music, evolve while they are being transmitted across individuals and generations, partly adapting to properties of brain systems of learners and users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deacon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christiansen and Chater, 2008</xref>). This view has found support in laboratory experiments on the cultural transmission of language and music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kirby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ravignani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lumaca and Baggio, 2017</xref>). These studies showed that novel and initially unstructured (artificial) signaling systems become gradually more organized during transmission along chains of individuals (‘generations’). Artificial symbolic systems are generally assumed to be relevant to understanding the cultural transmission and evolution of natural symbolic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scott-Phillips and Kirby, 2010</xref>). One major unresolved question is whether variability in brain structure and function can be linked to interindividual differences in learning, retaining, and transmitting symbolic material. To our knowledge, no study has addressed this question using neuroimaging techniques.</p><p>We investigate this issue in the music domain by examining a core functional property of brain systems: resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Rs-FC is a measure of the temporal correlation of spontaneous slow fluctuations (&lt;0.1 Hz) in the BOLD signal between spatially separated brain regions, derived from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biswal, 2012</xref>). This measure is receiving much attention because it captures spontaneous interactions between neuronal populations in functionally associated networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>), and it has been recognized as a promising tool for assessing individual differences in brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubois and Adolphs, 2016</xref>).</p><p>One hypothesis in the field of bio-musicology is that some musical traits and behaviors may be traced back to the local functioning of the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trainor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lumaca et al., 2018b</xref>). With each generational transfer, music material has to pass through an information processing ‘bottleneck’ that constrains music perception and acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Merker et al., 2015</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that this bottleneck can be instantiated in anatomical and functional connectivity patterns of the auditory system and other (e.g. attentional and motor) brain systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zatorre, 2013</xref>). For example, a stronger functional connectivity between left and right auditory cortex, and between auditory cortex and prefrontal areas, as measured during active listening, tends to be associated with facilitation in the encoding and discrimination of melodic material in experimental participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andoh and Zatorre, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andoh and Zatorre, 2013</xref>). When measured at rest, functional connectivity networks may serve as indicators of auditory learning skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ventura-Campos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veroude et al., 2010</xref>) and have been shown to be plastic and music-experience dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fauvel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tanaka and Kirino, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zamorano et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we address the specific question whether spontaneous functional connectivity patterns within portions of the auditory cortex, and between the auditory cortex and other relevant (e.g. prefrontal and parietal) networks, as measured by rs-fMRI, can drive and predict inter-subject variability in three core aspects of cultural transmission: (1) social learning, (2) transmission, and (3) structural modification of an unfamiliar (artificial) tone system. We use the term ‘prediction’ to indicate that a brain measure collected at one point in time in one group may be used to predict a behavioral outcome at a later point in time in the same group, without however implying out-of-sample generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gabrieli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we modeled these three behaviors using a laboratory model of interactive cultural learning and transmission, the signaling game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moreno and Baggio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nowak and Baggio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baggio, 2018</xref>). In signaling games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Skyrms, 2010</xref>), a sender and a receiver exchange signals over subsequent rounds with the aim of developing a ‘common code’: here, a finite set of tone sequences associated with specific semantic or affective states. In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lumaca and Baggio, 2016</xref>), we showed that individual players’ ability to learn and transmit an artificial tone system in signaling games, and the extent to which structural aspects of the codes are reorganized by players, can be predicted based on the latency of a neurophysiological marker of auditory processing in participants: the mismatch negativity (MMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Näätänen et al., 1978</xref>). Complex cultural phenomena, such as the transmission of musical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le Bomin et al., 2016</xref>), may therefore be partly constrained by the functional organization of the auditory cortex in the human brain.</p><p>We assessed this hypothesis by combining resting-state and auditory fMRI and signaling games in two sessions (20 days apart on average). In the first session, each participant was first scanned at rest (rs-fMRI) and then subjected to functional scanning to localize auditory networks using an auditory oddball paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lumaca and Baggio, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The use of a functional localizer independent of the behavioral task has at least one major advantage: it allows us to test specific hypotheses of brain function in a statistically unbiased dataset, increasing the generalizability of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saxe et al., 2006</xref>). In the second session, each participant played two signaling games, the first as receiver (or learner), and the second as sender (transmitter). In Game 1, participants had to learn from a confederate of the experimenters a melodic signaling system of the same kind used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lumaca and Baggio (2016)</xref>. In Game 2, they had to transmit the code they had learned in the previous game to a receiver. We tested the hypothesis that rs-FC between auditory regions identified with a functional localizer task in session one predicts—weeks after scanning—learning, transmission, and structural modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) of the signaling system used in the games of session 2.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48710.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of Bohlen-Pierce (BP) tone sequences used in the functional localizer task (auditory oddball).</title><p>Functional MRI scanning was performed while participants listened to these sequences.

These measures are different indicators of the complexity of a melodic signal. <italic>Asymmetry:</italic> we calculated asymmetry in Game 2 as the difference of the number of code changes introduced by the sender (<bold>S</bold>) and by the receiver (<bold>R</bold>) across all emotions, divided by the total number of code changes ((<bold>S–R</bold>)/(S+R)). This measure reflects the direction of information flow and ranges from −1 (the receiver adapts his mappings to the ones used by the sender) to 1 (viceversa). In Game 1, the sender never changes the signal-to-emotion mappings and asymmetry is −1 by design. <italic>Coordination:</italic> we computed coordination in Game 1 as the mean similarity (1-Hamming distance) between the signal (tone sequence or contour transform) used by the sender for a given emotion and the set of signals mapped by the receiver to the same emotion during the second half of the game (between-player measure). A mean value was computed across all five emotions. It represents the extent to which the sender and receiver shared their mappings at the end of the game and it ranges from 0 (different signaling system) to 1 (shared signaling system). <italic>Transmission:</italic> this measure was computed as the similarity of signals (tone sequences or contour transforms) mapped to the same emotion and used by senders of adjacent games (between-player measure). A mean value was computed across emotions. It ranges from 0 (the sender in game two reproduced a new signaling system) to 1 (the sender in game two faithfully transmitted the signaling system received in game 1). <italic>Innovation:</italic> this measure was calculated as the mean hamming distance (HD) between the signal (tone frequency or contour transform) mapped with the greatest frequency to a given emotion in the second half of Game 1 by the player as receiver and the signal reproduced with major frequency for the same emotion in Game 2 by the same player as sender (within-player measure). A mean value was computed across the five emotions, ranging from 0 to 1. Values close to one indicate that a significant number of changes were introduced in the signaling system by the participant. <italic>Interval compression ratio:</italic> The interval compression ratio (ICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tierney et al., 2011</xref>) was calculated as the ratio between the mean absolute interval size (in macrotones) of a tone sequence randomly scrambled (<italic>N</italic> = 100), divided by the mean absolute interval size of the original sequence. A mean value was computed across the five emotions. Larger values indicate a bias towards smaller (proximal) intervals.

These seeds were used in rs-FC (resting-state functional connectivity) and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses (details below), and to extract task-based activation changes from functional localizer data. To this end, mean percent signal changes were extracted from each ROI and condition (STD, C-deviant, I-deviant) using MarsBaR Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/">http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brett et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Preprocessing and analysis of rs-FC data</title><p>Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) preprocessing and analysis were implemented by using a standard pipeline in the SPM CONN toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>).

The mean time course of all voxels within each seed was used to calculate individual ROI-to-ROI pairwise linear Pearson’s correlations, and the resulting <italic>r</italic> values were normalized to <italic>z</italic> values via Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>-transformation. Pairwise correlations were computed for all ROIs. From each participant we obtained 6 <italic>z</italic> values, each reflecting the degree of connectivity between any pair of ROIs. We computed Pearson’s correlations between Fisher’s <italic>z</italic> values and performance measures in signaling games (see below). Second, using CONN, we performed whole-brain FC analyses separately for each auditory seed. In this analysis, we explored whether the rs-FC between auditory ROIs and other (e.g., parietal and prefrontal) brain areas could predict behavioral performance. Single-subject seed-to-voxel correlation maps were calculated by extracting the residual BOLD time course from each seed, and by computing Pearson’s correlation coefficients between that time course and the time course of all other voxels in the brain. Correlation coefficients were normalized to <italic>z</italic> values via Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>-transformation. At group-level, we implemented a linear regression analysis for each seed, by defining the simple main effect of performance as between-subject contrast. Statistical thresholds were set to p&lt;0.001 (uncorrected) at single voxel level, and the resulting cluster(s) were thresholded to a cluster-mass FWE p&lt;0.05 using non-parametric permutation testing two-tailed (<italic>n</italic> = 1000).</p><p>To examine whether task-dependent functional connectivity was related to signaling game performance, we also conducted a PPI analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friston et al., 1997</xref>). We tested whether oddball-evoked changes in the functional connectivity of the same auditory network could predict behavioral performance and structural modification in signaling games. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were created as 5 mm spheres centered on single-subject global maxima for the contrast of interest (C-deviant &gt;STD: p&lt;0.05 uncorrected; minimum voxel extent 3). This subject-specific global maximum was identified within a sphere of 10 mm radius centered on the peak of the group effect (C-deviant &gt;STD). In participants where no active cluster could be found, the statistical threshold was lowered to p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.5 uncorrected. The BOLD signal was summarized in each participant using the first eigenvariate (principal component) of suprathreshold voxels within the VOIs. The PPI design matrix contained the following three variables: (1) a ‘psychological’ variable that represents the contrast of interest (C-deviant &gt;STD), (2) a ‘physiological’ variable that represents the time-course of the seed region, and (3) an interaction term between the psychological and physiological variables. Individual β images of the interaction term were entered into a whole-brain second-level regression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ofen et al., 2012</xref>) with each behavioral variable as a covariate of interest—that is one behavioral variable at a time. We constrained the whole-brain regression analysis to a ‘target’ region—a spherical binary mask of 5 mm radius centered on the peak of the group effect. In line with previously described resting-state analyses, we performed a regression analysis for each possible seed-to-target combination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Session 2: Signaling games</title><sec id="s2-10-1"><title>Signaling games</title><p>In the version adopted here, signaling games are cooperative games of incomplete information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis, 1969</xref>), where a sender and a receiver exchange signals without a prior agreement on pairings of signals to meanings: players should then agree, over multiple signaling rounds, on a ‘common code’ (i.e. a shared set of signals-meaning mappings). A typical interaction may consist in the sender privately witnessing a state of affairs, which must be communicated to the receiver using a signal. Upon receiving the signal, the receiver must take appropriate action to match the initial state of affairs. Feedback may follow, providing players with information about whether they associated the signal with corresponding states and actions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10-2"><title>Procedure and stimuli</title><p>shows an example of a single signaling round or trial. A facial expression (state) is privately displayed on the screen to the sender, who is in turn instructed to produce a five-tone pattern (signal) matching the observed event. The signal is produced using digits (1-5) of the computer keyboard and is sent to the receiver. The receiver listens to the signal through headphones and is asked to select one of the five facial expressions (i.e., the one he believes the sender has seen) by using the keyboard’s numeric keypad. A feedback (3 s) is then provided to both participants, showing on their screen the state as seen by the sender and the one chosen by the receiver. There was no reward for speed, either in a trial or in the game. Successful coordination was the only reward for participants. In this study, player roles were fixed throughout a game, which consisted of several trials (see below). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moreno and Baggio (2015)</xref> demonstrate that, with fixed roles, it is (mostly) the receiver who modifies her code to adapt to the sender.

Players converged on (i.e. learned or transmitted) a melodic signaling system, that is a set of melodic patterns with mappings to emotions. At the start of Game 1, one of two sets of stimuli (starting material) was delivered by the confederate player. The confederate was instructed to press, on the computer keyboard, a numeric digit showed on the screen (1 to 5). Each key was mapped to one of the five melodic patterns of the seeding material: in Game 1, he played with no sound feedback (volume set at 0), to prevent him from learning the starting material and be biased in Game 2. The confederate was instructed to use consistently that mapping throughout Game 1, regardless of what the participant (receiver) would do. In each set, signals had different melodic contour complexity: two high-entropy (Shannon Entropy, H = 1 bit), two low-entropy (H = 0.81 bits), and a monotone stimulus (control; H = 0 bits) (details below). The participant was instructed to learn the signaling system in Game 1 and to re-transmit it as faithfully as possible to the receiver in Game 2 (see Procedure and stimuli).

Hamming distance is the number of pointwise substitutions (S) necessary to make two strings of equal length (L) identical, and the normalized value [0 to 1] is given by S/L. Values close to one are associated to different strings. The strings compared were pairs of patterns of five tones (tone distance) or of four interval directions (i.e. ups and downs) between adjacent tones (contour distance). Coordination (as a learning index) was measured as tone and contour similarity (i.e. inverse Hamming distance) between the signals used by the confederate (sender) and the signals most frequently paired with corresponding emotions during the second half of Game 1 by the participant (receiver). A value close to one indicates that the melodic material was effectively learned by the participant during Game 1. Transmission was calculated as the similarity between the signals used by senders of adjacent generations (between-player measure). A value close to one indicates an accurate recall of the initial melodic material by the participant during Game 2. Innovation was measured as the distance between signals learned by the participant in one game as receivers and transmitted in the next game as senders (within-player measure). Furthermore, an asymmetry index A=(S-R)/(S+R), measuring the direction of information flow, was computed. In the equation, asymmetry (A) is the difference between the code changes made by the sender (S) and those made by the receiver (R), divided the total number of changes.

The interval compression ratio (ICR) was used here as a measure of melodic proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tierney et al., 2011</xref>), and it is computed as follows: first, all the tones of a sequence are randomly shuffled, and a mean absolute interval is computed for the resulting sequence; this procedure is repeated 100 times; a mean of these averages is computed and is used as the numerator of the ICR equation. The denominator is the mean absolute interval of the original sequence. Large values indicate a bias towards small intervals.

These results connect for the first time individual brain characteristics with basic aspects of cultural transmission behaviors in humans (, p. 239). Interestingly, we found that the structural reorganization of melodic patterns was only predicted by rs-FC between the left and right Heschl’s gyri, and between left Heschl’s gyrus and prefrontal regions, while learning and transmission were only predicted by rs-FC between areas of bilateral planum temporale. This suggests a <italic>functional dissociation</italic> in the bilateral fronto-temporal auditory network for encoding and regularization of musical material. Task-driven activations did not predict behavior in signaling games.</p><p>The bilateral activation in the STG, as evoked by deviant <italic>contour</italic> changes in an oddball functional localizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lumaca and Baggio, 2016</xref>), includes the main cortical generators of the auditory MMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Opitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Opitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wible et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schönwiesner et al., 2007</xref>). The MMN reflects auditory change-detection and can therefore be used to study bottom-up processes of auditory scene analysis (ASA), such as the extraction of regularities from acoustic inputs, and melodic and rhythmic grouping during encoding of melodic Gestalts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bregman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koelsch and Siebel, 2005</xref>). The absence of significant activations for deviant <italic>interval</italic> changes is consistent with previous findings suggesting that automatic detection (smaller and slower MMN) in non-musicians is more difficult for pitch interval changes relative to contour changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schiavetto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trainor et al., 2002</xref>), here further hindered by the use of the unfamiliar Bohlen-Pierce scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leung and Dean, 2018</xref>). Unlike some of the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Molholm et al., 2005</xref>), we did not observe frontal or parietal activity in pitch deviance detection, which are thought to underlie the generation of the P3a evoked potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Soltani and Knight, 2000</xref>). The P3a component typically follows the MMN in time and is related to involuntary attention switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Escera et al., 1998</xref>). Our results support the view that automatic detection of deviant sounds and, more generally, pre-attentive operations of ASA are primarily carried out in early auditory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindler et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The last two decades have seen a surge of interest in the impact of culture on low-level (attention-independent) perceptual processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han and Northoff, 2008</xref>). However, the flip side of that has been largely neglected: namely, whether the functional organization of lower-level sensory systems affects the diversity of cultural traits within (and across) individuals and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sperber and Hirschfeld, 2004</xref>). The ‘neuronal recycling’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dehaene and Cohen, 2007</xref>) is a comprehensive view that may also account for the neural origins of cultural variation. Acquired cultural systems and behaviors are accommodated within pre-existing brain networks, initially evolved for different specific adaptive reasons. Such systems and behaviors may then be shaped by the computational constraints inherent to the host networks. Auditory scene analysis (ASA) emerges early in human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Winkler et al., 2003</xref>), and it is automatic and widely conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fay, 2008</xref>). ASA neural circuitry might therefore be evolutionarily older than human musicality and may provide some of the neuronal substrates for the cultural recycling of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trainor, 2015</xref>). One prediction of the ‘neuronal recycling’ hypothesis in the context of auditory perception is that even small differences between individuals in the prior organization of bottom-up ASA auditory circuits, (1) may emerge rapidly in the course of transmission as variants of musical traits and behaviors, and (2) may be amplified in frequency during cultural transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lumaca et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we support prediction (1) by showing that the inter-hemispheric cortical organization of a temporal auditory network, as revealed by rs-FC, maps onto individual differences in learning and transmission, and in the extent of melodic reorganization in signaling games. A positive correlation was observed between interhemispheric rs-FC in bilateral PT, and the individual accuracy in learning (high coordination, high accuracy) and transmitting (high transmission and low innovation) melodic material in signaling games. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andoh and Zatorre (2013)</xref> showed that an increase of interhemispheric FC in STG, before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is associated with facilitated encoding and discrimination of melodic material in experimental participants. Increased interhemispheric connectivity in bilateral PT is often associated with superior auditory skills, such as the unique ability to perceive and retain the pitch class of any given tone, or absolute pitch (AP). For example, a graph-theoretical analysis of AP functional data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loui et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated an increased interhemispheric task-related FC between bilateral PT compared to matched controls. This finding was replicated on resting-state data. Although AP is often considered a binary trait, it may be expressed along a continuum in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bermudez and Zatorre, 2009</xref>). Also, an increased interhemispheric FC in bilateral PT, accompanied by a greater integrity of transcallosal projections, has been found in musicians compared to nonmusicians and is related to perceptual advantages in language-related skills such as phonetic categorization and speech decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kühnis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elmer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elmer et al., 2017</xref>). These findings support a model of human PT as a computational ‘hub’ for spectro-temporal analysis of complex auditory objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Griffiths and Warren, 2002</xref>). Also, these results favor the view that spontaneous interhemispheric correlation patterns may reflect prior constraints or biases on auditory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two main mechanisms can account for our results. In one model, the coherence of slow spontaneous fluctuations underlying rs-FC may reflect the synaptic efficacy structure of a cortical network, which in turn might modulate the efficiency of information exchange between its functional units during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Varela et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmelech and Malach, 2013</xref>). An alternative, non-exclusive account focuses on the interindividual variability in structural connectivity between bilateral homologous auditory regions, partly mediated by the corpus callosum (CC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Westerhausen et al., 2009</xref>). This structural connectivity is strongly associated with FC in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roland et al., 2017</xref>). More specifically, interhemispheric structural connections between homologous regions are mostly subtended by the same slow spontaneous fluctuations in BOLD signals that characterize rs-FC. Regardless of its origins, it has been shown that coordination among brain regions generally decays with the increase of their Euclidean distance, except for bilateral homologous brain regions, where neuronal synchronization remains strong. Resting-state functional connectivity between homologous areas of the two hemispheres has been proposed as a functional organization principle of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salvador et al., 2005b</xref>). More efficient inter-hemispheric communication between homologous computational units, via either direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>) or indirect structural connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salvador et al., 2005a</xref>), may partly account for the enhanced performance in learning and transmission observed here.</p><p>We did not find evidence for a nexus between behavioral performance and task-related brain activations. Intrinsic connectivity properties of the auditory network, more than the extent or the activation level of its functional units, might drive social learning and structural modification of melodic systems. This view is in line with a previous ERP study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lumaca and Baggio, 2016</xref>): we showed that only MMN <italic>latencies</italic> were predictive of individual learning, transmission, and regularization of musical codes in signaling games, and no significant relations were found between behavior and MMN amplitudes. This result was recently extended to the rhythm domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lumaca et al., 2018a</xref>). One proposal is that ERP latencies reflect axonal myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardenas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haier et al., 2005</xref>) and diffusion properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tuch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Whitford et al., 2011</xref>) of fiber tracts connecting the relevant neural ERP generators, and determining in turn their FC. ERP amplitudes may instead be related to the size and extent of activation of a neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rasser et al., 2011</xref>). This would support the view that spontaneous neuronal synchronization is a more efficient metric of neural information processing than mere task-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of this hypothesis is the possible relation between cultural behaviors and task-evoked FC within the same auditory network described so far. The PPI analysis we performed did not reveal any significant effects. Specifically, oddball-evoked changes in the functional coupling between nodes of the temporal auditory network did not predict individual performance or structural code regularization in signaling games. Up to now, it remains unclear how task and rest FC may relate to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 2014</xref>). One hypothesis is that FC at rest characterizes an ‘intrinsic’ network architecture that, much like structural connectivity, is stable across multiple brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, oddball-evoked FC would reveal only a very specific functional state that was unrelated to the behavioral task in our study. Following this view, general constraints imposed on the relevant functional network architecture would mainly be revealed at rest. Our findings contribute to clarifying the nature of the neural mechanisms constraining or driving the cultural evolution of human symbolic systems.</p><p>During cultural transmission, information is learned and reproduced across individuals and may become increasingly compressible (low-entropic) and structured and easier to learn and reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chater and Vitányi, 2003</xref>). One question now emerging in the music evolution field is whether aspects of compressibility and, in turn, the system-level emergence of musical structure, can be traced back to properties of core auditory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Merker et al., 2015</xref>). Early auditory cortical regions such as HG and PT are critical for encoding and short-term retention of melodic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zatorre et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jäncke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leaver et al., 2009</xref>). However, to our knowledge, so far no attempt has been made to investigate dissociations between encoding and compressibility mechanisms, recruited during learning and regularization of cultural material, respectively.</p><p>In this study, we provide the first evidence in support of this dissociation. We show that the degree of intrinsic FC within a widely distributed auditory network that includes right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in addition to bilateral auditory cortices, is negatively correlated with regularization of melodic material during memory retrieval. Individuals with a stronger negative correlation (antiphase coherence) between DLPFC and auditory cortices introduce smoother forms in the melodic set. This result was not predicted, and the nature of the underlying neuronal processes remains to be described in detail. However, this is consistent with theoretical accounts of symbolic regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kam and Newport, 2009</xref>) and with neuropsychological data (e.g. congenital amusia). One hypothesis relates to the crucial role of dorsolateral prefrontal structures in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rypma and D'Esposito, 1999</xref>). A process-specific model has been proposed in past studies, where DLPFC supports maintenance, monitoring, and manipulation of perceptual representations stored in more posterior sensory regions (see for a support in the auditory domain). A reduced connectivity between DLPFC and sensory regions may affect the quality of mnemonic information available for later retrieval, resulting in a loss of details and on a greater emphasis on global features. The connectivity pattern we observed in ‘innovators’ (i.e. the individuals regularizing the melodic material more), echoes previous findings in amusics. A reduced frontotemporal connectivity was observed in this population, either at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leveque et al., 2016</xref>) or during the active and passive listening of auditory material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albouy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyde et al., 2011</xref>), and is linked to impaired melodic retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albouy et al., 2015</xref>). The auditory cortices were also found to be overconnected compared to control groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leveque et al., 2016</xref>). This converging evidence suggests that an increased projection of acoustic information between bilateral auditory regions, and decreased frontotemporal projection, can reveal poorer auditory processing capabilities in individuals. Functional decoupling between prefrontal structures and sensory regions, and an over coupling of homologue auditory areas, can be thus invoked as one putative mechanism to explain regularization in the acquisition of cultural material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thompson-Schill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kam and Newport, 2009</xref>). We showed that even small differences in the functional architecture at rest of temporo-frontal networks can be manifested in regularization behaviors, already in a single round of learning and transmission. These differences can be amplified by cultural transmission and can produce population-level effects, as shown by computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kirby, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffiths et al., 2008</xref>), behavioral research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lumaca and Baggio, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ravignani et al., 2016</xref>), and population-genetics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dediu and Ladd, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our findings point to degrees of interhemispheric functional connectivity in the relevant sensory networks as a possible neural source of inter-individual variation in three main aspects of human cultural behavior: (i) social learning, (ii) symbolic transmission, and (iii) structural modification of symbolic systems. To our knowledge, this may be the first demonstration of the existence of specific neurophysiological mechanisms underlying perceptuo-cognitive biases or constraints in music evolution. Inter-individual variability in these biases or constraints may give rise to system-level variation in the organization, transmission, and acquisition of human musical systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Martin Dietz for useful comments, Hella Kastbjerg for proofreading the manuscript, and Claudia Iorio, Ulrika Varankaite, Eira Aksnes, and Malou Ryborg for assistance in data acquisition.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lutz Jäncke (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This novel study addresses whether individual approaches to a lab model of cultural learning and transmission were reflected in resting state connectivity, and demonstrates a number of interesting and specific correlations.</p><p>The reviewers enjoyed reading this work and have raised a number of points related to exposition and interpretation that would increase its impact and accessibility. We invite the authors to submit a resubmission that addresses the points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rationale for choosing the studied signaling game as a model of transmission of a musical system should be better explained. It appears overstated that it reflects &quot;learning, transmission, and the structural modification of an artificial musical system&quot; (as stated in the Abstract). More precisely, what does &quot;musical system&quot; mean in the present study design? Participants have to learn (and then transmit) a code linking emotions (on faces) and short melodies (constructed from the Bohlen-Pierce scale). There does not appear to be underlying rules to be learned regarding melody construction or to infer regarding the pairwise associations between emotions and melodies. It therefore appears as mere associative audio-visual learning, with more or less accurate reproduction of the learned melodies depending on the participants.</p><p>2) A concern was possible confounds like general intelligence or g. No participant neuropsychological data are provided and an issue is whether correlations might exist between more general measures of perception and neuropsychological function. We would be interested to hear the author's comments. The authors might also include more behavioural data on musicianship.</p><p>3) The results were quite difficult to follow because the Materials and methods follow. Either put the Materials and methods section first or help the reader along more in Results section.</p><p>4) More detail on methodology for correlation coefficients is requested. It was not very clear from the text exactly which correlations between behavioural measures and functional connectivity measures were tested (how many tests were performed?). One also wonders how much the different behavioural measures correlate between them. Furthermore, there is no report of the non-significant correlations, so overall it is difficult to appreciate the full data pattern. Also, I did not understand why only percent signal changes are analysed from the localizer data, connectivity measures obtained during listening would also be relevant here.</p><p>5) Was any analysis of functional connectivity between the left and right auditory cortex produced by activation carried out? The main interest here is in resting state connectivity likely reflecting structural connections, and the functional localisers use a very different task to the transmission game but functional connectivity between auditory cortex during activation might also be related to game performance.</p><p>6) It was interesting that structural reorganisation of melody was predicted by resting connectivity between right and left HG which might be expected at a higher level in auditory hierarchy.</p><p>7) The negative correlation between regularisation behaviour and auditory and frontal resting connectivity is unlikely to have been predicted and the discussion of this is cagey. Further comments would be welcome.</p><p>8) The relationship between resting state connectivity in right and left PT and learning/transmission made sense in term of literature on involvement of PT in auditory learning which might be discussed. In general, there are several recent and older papers demonstrating that functional and structural connectivity (also in the auditory system) is related to superior cognitive performance (e.g., IQ: Langer et al., 2012), synesthesia (e.g., Jäncke and Langer, 2012) and also to musicianship (e.g., absolute pitch: Jäncke et al., 2012; Loui et al., 2012; Loui et al., 2011; Hamm et al., 2013; but also musicianship in general: Klein et al., 2016, Elmer et al., 2016). Thus the idea that functional connectivity is a marker of superior performance is not entirely new although the authors focus more on a particular musical aspect. In addition, functional and structural connectivity features are often associated with „negative&quot; behavioral aspects (e.g., depression, anxiety, and cardiac problems; there are many papers of this type).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48710.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rationale for choosing the studied signaling game as a model of transmission of a musical system should be better explained.

The signaling games used in our study is a tool to (formally) model and (empirically) investigate three specific aspects of cultural transmission: social learning, transmission, and structural modification of learned codes. Our hypothesis is that there may exist a link between individual differences in these three cultural behaviors and inter-individual neural variability. Second, we did not actually (claim we) use full-fledged realistic musical systems (see below).</p><p>We have scanned the text for any potential ambiguities in this respect, and we have edited all passages that contained correspondingly unclear statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More precisely, what does &quot;musical system&quot; mean in the present study design?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our use of ‘musical systems’ may be incorrect in some parts of the manuscript. This term typically refers to the complex set of rules and forms that define the musical material of a given culture. In order to improve clarity, we have replaced ‘artificial musical systems’ with ‘artificial tone systems’. We define ‘artificial tone systems’ as an organized system of tones that is novel for all participants in the experiments (Loui, 2007).</p><p>The term ‘musical system’ has been maintained in a few places in the manuscript where it is more appropriate (including the title). As artificial languages are generally assumed to be relevant to understand natural languages (Kirby et al., 2008), artificial tone systems can be used to study actual musical systems (Lumaca and Baggio, 2017; Ravignani, Delgado and Kirby, 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Participants have to learn (and then transmit) a code linking emotions (on faces) and short melodies (constructed from the Bohlen-Pierce scale).

Principles of organization (e.g., proximity and continuity) are expected to emerge by a combination of cognitively-driven transmission errors and, partly, by processes of social interaction, such as coordination (game 2). In this respect, signaling games are more complex than a mere associative audio-visual learning task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A concern was possible confounds like general intelligence or g. No participant neuropsychological data are provided and an issue is whether correlations might exist between more general measures of perception and neuropsychological function. We would be interested to hear the author's comments. The authors might also include more behavioural data on musicianship.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a possibility. In our study, we needed a control test for this type of general confound while maintaining the duration of the fMRI experiment at a reasonable length (1.5h including preparation, recording and debriefing). We opted for the Digit Span, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Memory Scales (WMS) that measures attention efficiency and capacity (forward span) and WM (backward span).</p><p>The results of this test are now included in a new table (Table 2). No significant correlations were observed between digit span scores and behavioral scores (for a similar result, see Lumaca and Baggio, 2016). This suggests that individual differences in auditory cortex function, rather than other aspects of neuropsychological function, constrained the learning and transmission of artificial tone systems.</p><p>Regarding experience-related effects on brain connectivity:</p><p>Thank you for reminding us to address this point. We need to mention that more than half of our participants reported 0 years of formal musical training with an instrument (n=32). Inter-individual variability in musical training seems too low to drive the observed inter-individual variability in brain connectivity (see below). We also doubt that few months of musical training may significantly ‘affect’ the functional relationship between auditory cortices. The average number of years of musical training across all participants is 0.6 (STD=0.98; n=51). We have now added these statistics in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We computed the Pearson’s correlation between number of years of musical training and connectivity measures. No correlation survived the Bonferroni correction.</p><p>Though beyond the scope, the point raised by the reviewers is interesting. However, to be properly addressed, it would require a ‘full battery’ of music-psychological tests (e.g., GOLD-MSI). This was not done in the current study, since we tried to maintain the experiment &lt;1.5h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Results were quite difficult to follow because the Materials and methods follow.

In doing so, we have noticed we had missed one significant correlation in the previous manuscript (i.e., between innovation and lHG-lSTG rs-FC). We included this result in the new version.</p><p>By including the digit span test, we have also changed the Bonferroni correction. For each behavioral measurement, we performed 7 independent tests (6 is the number of ROI-to-ROI combinations, plus 1 test with the digit span) (see Table 2).</p><p>We included a supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) showing correlations across all behavioral measures.</p><p>In regard to the comment on functional connectivity analyses, please read below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Was any analysis of functional connectivity between the left and right auditory cortex produced by activation carried out? The main interest here is in resting state connectivity likely reflecting structural connections, and the functional localisers use a very different task to the transmission game but functional connectivity between auditory cortex during activation might also be related to game performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on this point with the reviewers. We had a specific interest in limiting our connectivity analysis to resting state. However, we can use task-based functional connectivity as a control. We have now performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis for each seed ROI in combination with a whole-brain second-level regression analysis, using behavioral measures as covariates of interest. We also implemented a seed-to-ROI approach (the analysis reported in the manuscript). No voxel survived the statistical threshold in either analysis. This suggests that constraints imposed on the auditory functional architecture, possibly operating during learning in signaling games, are primarily revealed at rest. We have added this interpretation in the Discussion.</p><p>Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses are now included in the Materials and methods and Results sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It was interesting that structural reorganisation of melody was predicted by resting connectivity between right and left HG which might be expected at a higher level in auditory hierarchy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers makes an interesting point, yet previous research has shown no evidence for an exclusive link between structural regularization and higher-level auditory systems. Instead, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies show that tonal and melodic processing can occur already in HG (Schindler et al., 2013; Zatorre and Zarate, 2010), and that primary auditory cortex can be involved, together with higher level areas, in complex auditory operations, such as melodic retrieval and manipulation (e.g., Albouy et al., 2017). Also, regularization in this study was not confined to HG, but was linked to the rs-FC of a fronto-temporal network that includes dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (please see our reply to the next comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The negative correlation between regularisation behaviour and auditory and frontal resting connectivity is unlikely to have been predicted and the discussion of this is cagey. Further comments would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ point. The seed-to-voxel analysis was exploratory and, contrary to the ROI-to-ROI analysis, we did not have specific expectations. However, our results seem to support a theoretical account of code regularization (Hudson Kam, Newport, 2009). Also, they are in line with previous neuropsychological data. In our study, regularization was predicted by greater connectivity between auditory cortices (HG) and by diminished connectivity between Heschl’s gyri and prefrontal structures. A similar resting-state connectivity pattern is observed in the amusic brain (Leveque et al., 2016) and may be linked to stronger individual constraints in auditory processing. This would in turn create pressure to regularize the melodic material (Hudson Kam, Newport, 2009). We have now included this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The relationship between resting state connectivity in right and left PT and learning/transmission made sense in term of literature on involvement of PT in auditory learning which might be discussed.

We now succinctly discuss the relationship between interhemispheric connectivity in bilateral PT and auditory processing (see Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
