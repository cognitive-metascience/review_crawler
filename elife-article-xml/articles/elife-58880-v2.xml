To understand how extrinsic cues influence intrinsic temporal programs, we studied <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body progenitors (neuroblasts) that sequentially produce only three neuronal types: γ, then α’β’, followed by αβ. Opposing gradients of two RNA-binding proteins Imp and Syp comprise the intrinsic temporal program. Extrinsic activin signaling regulates the production of α’β’ neurons but whether it affects the intrinsic temporal program was not known. We show that the activin ligand Myoglianin from glia regulates the temporal factor Imp in mushroom body neuroblasts. Neuroblasts missing the activin receptor Baboon have a delayed intrinsic program as Imp is higher than normal during the α’β’ temporal window, causing the loss of α’β’ neurons, a decrease in αβ neurons, and a likely increase in γ neurons, without affecting the overall number of neurons produced. Our results illustrate that an extrinsic cue modifies an intrinsic temporal program to increase neuronal diversity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>temporal patterning</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd><kwd>kenyon cells</kwd><kwd>activin</kwd><kwd>myoglianin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY017916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS095288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HD007520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006732</institution-id><institution>New York University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GSAS MacCracken Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOH01-C32604GG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desplan</surname><given-names>Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The activin ligand myoglianin acts as a temporal extrinsic cue to regulate the intrinsic temporal factor Imp in mushroom body neuroblasts, increasing neuronal diversity by specifying the α’β’ fate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The building of intricate neural networks during development is controlled by highly coordinated patterning programs that regulate the generation of different neuronal types in the correct number, place and time. The sequential production of different neuronal types from individual progenitors, <italic>i.e.</italic> temporal patterning, is a conserved feature of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cepko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lodato and Arlotta, 2015</xref>). For instance, individual radial glia progenitors in the vertebrate cortex sequentially give rise to neurons that occupy the different cortical layers in an inside-out manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Llorca et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, neural progenitors (called neuroblasts) also give rise to different neuronal types sequentially. For example, projection neurons in the antennal lobe are born in a stereotyped temporal order and innervate specific glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jefferis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). In both of these examples, individual progenitors age concomitantly with the developing animal (e.g., from embryonic stages 11–17 in mouse and from the first larval stage (L1) to the end of the final larva stage (L3) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Thus, these progenitors are exposed to changing environments that could alter their neuronal output. Indeed, classic heterochronic transplantation experiments demonstrated that young cortical progenitors placed in an old host environment alter their output to match the host environment and produce upper-layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McConnell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McConnell and Kaznowski, 1991</xref>).</p><p>The adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain is built from ~100 neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Urbach and Technau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2013a</xref>) that divide continuously from L1 to L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Each asymmetric division regenerates the neuroblast and produces an intermediate progenitor called ganglion mother cell (GMC) that divides only once, typically producing two different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, during larval life central brain neuroblasts divide 50–60 times, sequentially producing many different neuronal types. All central brain neuroblasts progress through opposing temporal gradients of two RNA-binding proteins as they age: IGF-II mRNA binding protein (Imp) when they are young and Syncrip (Syp) when they are old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Syed et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syed et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of Imp or Syp in antennal lobe or Type II neuroblasts affects the ratio of young to old neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). Imp and Syp also affect neuroblast lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a single temporal program can affect both the diversity of neuronal types produced and their numbers.</p><p>Since central brain neuroblasts produce different neuronal types through developmental time, roles for extrinsic cues have recently garnered attention. Ecdysone triggers all the major developmental transitions including progression into the different larval stages and entry in pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of central brain neuroblasts are not responsive to ecdysone until mid-larval life when they begin to express the Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syed et al., 2017a</xref>). Expressing a dominant-negative version of EcR (EcR-DN) in Type II neuroblasts delays the Imp to Syp transition that normally occurs ~60 hr after larval hatching (ALH). This leads to many more cells that express the early-born marker gene Repo and fewer cells that express the late-born marker gene Bsh.</p><p>To further understand how extrinsic signals contribute to temporal patterning, we studied <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body neuroblasts because of the deep understanding of their development. The mushroom body is comprised of ~2000 neurons (Kenyon cells) that belong to only three main neuronal types that have unique morphologies and play distinct roles in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). They receive input mainly from ~200 projection neurons that each relays odor information from olfactory receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). Each projection neuron connects to a random subset of Kenyon cells and each Kenyon cell receives input from ~7 different projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Turner et al., 2008</xref>). This connectivity pattern requires a large number of mushroom body neurons (~2,000) to represent complex odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hige, 2018</xref>). To produce this very large number of neurons, mushroom body development is unique in many respects. Mushroom body neurons are born from four identical neuroblasts that divide continuously (unlike any other neuroblast) from the late embryonic stages until the end of pupation (~9 days for ~250 divisions each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraft et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kunz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurusu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sipe and Siegrist, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the two neurons born from each mushroom body GMC are identical. The neuronal simplicity of the adult mushroom body makes it ideal to study how extrinsic cues might affect diversity since the loss of any single neuronal type is obvious given that each is represented hundreds of times.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>α’β’ neurons are not generated from <italic>babo</italic> mutant neuroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of intrinsic temporal patterning mechanism operating during mushroom body development. During early larval stages, mushroom body neuroblasts express high levels of Imp (red) and Chinmo (red) in neurons to specify γ identity for ~85 neuroblast divisions (red-dashed box). From mid-L3 to metamorphosis, when Imp and Syp (cyan) are both at low levels, the same neuroblast divides ~40 times to produce α’β’ neurons (magenta-dashed box). Low Chinmo regulates the expression Mamo, a terminal selector of α’β’ identity. From the beginning of metamorphosis throughout pupal development, high Syp leads to αβ neurons (cyan-dashed outline). (<bold>B</bold>) Known molecular markers can distinguish between the three mushroom body neuronal types in the adult. (<bold>C</bold>) Mushroom body projections originating from neurons born from four neuroblasts (numbered 1 to 4) per hemisphere fasciculate into a single bundle (peduncle) before branching into the five mushroom body lobes. The first-born γ neurons (red) remodel during development to project into a single, medial lobe in the adult. This lobe is the most anterior of the medial lobes. Axons from α’β’ neurons (magenta) bifurcate to project into the vertical and medial α’ and β’ lobes. The β’ lobe is posterior to the γ lobe. The last-born αβ neurons (cyan) also bifurcate their axons into the vertical projecting α lobe and medial projecting β lobe. The α lobe is positioned adjacent and medial to the α’ lobe. The β lobe is the most posterior medial lobe.

The γ temporal window extends from L1 (the first larval stage) until mid-L3 (the final larval stage) when animals attain critical weight and are committed to metamorphosis; the α’β’ window from mid-L3 to the beginning of pupation, and the αβ window from pupation until eclosion (the end of development). Like all other central brain neuroblasts Imp and Syp are expressed by mushroom body neuroblasts, but in much shallower gradients through time, which accounts for their extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Imp and Syp are inherited by newborn neurons where they instruct temporal identity. Imp positively and Syp negatively regulate the translation of <italic>chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis</italic> (<italic>chinmo</italic>), a gene encoding a transcription factor that acts as a temporal morphogen in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). The first-born γ neurons are produced for the first ~85 cell divisions, when Imp levels in neuroblasts, and thus Chinmo in neurons, are high. α’β’ neurons are produced for the next ~40 divisions, when Imp and Syp are at similar low levels that translate into lower Chinmo levels in neurons. Low Chinmo then regulates the expression in neurons of <italic>maternal gene required for meiosis</italic> (<italic>mamo</italic>), which encodes a transcription factor that specifies the α’β’ fate and whose mRNA is stabilized by Syp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). αβ neurons are generated for the final ~125 neuroblast divisions, when Syp levels are high, Imp is absent in neuroblasts, and thus Chinmo and Mamo are no longer expressed in neurons.</p><p>Extrinsic cues are known to have important roles in regulating neuronal differentiation during mushroom body neurogenesis. The ecdysone peak that controls entry into pupation regulates γ neuron axonal remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Ecdysone was also proposed to be required for the final differentiation of α’β’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2017</xref>). EcR expression in γ neurons is timed by activin signaling, a member of the TGFβ family, from local glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>). Activin signaling from glia is also required for the α’β’ fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>): Knocking-down the activin pathway receptor Baboon (Babo) leads to the loss of α’β’ neurons. It was proposed that activin signaling in mushroom body neuroblasts regulates the expression of EcR in prospective α’β’ neurons and that when the activin pathway is inhibited, it leads to the transformation of α’β’ neurons into later-born pioneer-αβ neurons (a subclass of the αβ class) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although there is strong evidence that extrinsic cues have important functions in neuronal patterning in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain, it remains unknown how extrinsic temporal cues interface with the Imp and Syp intrinsic temporal program to regulate neuronal specification. Here we address this question using the developing mushroom bodies. We independently discovered that activin signaling from glia is required for α’β’ specification. However, we show that activin signaling lowers the levels of the intrinsic factor Imp in mushroom body neuroblasts to define the mid-α’β’ temporal identity window. Removing the activin receptor Babo in mutant clones leads to the loss of α’β’ neurons, to fewer last-born αβ neurons, and to the likely generation of additional first-born γ neurons without affecting overall clone size. This appears to be caused by a delayed decrease in Imp levels, although the intrinsic temporal clock still progresses even in the absence of activin signaling. We also demonstrate that ecdysone signaling is not necessary for the specification of α’β’ neurons, although it might still be involved in later α’β’ differentiation. Our results provide a model for how intrinsic and extrinsic temporal programs operate within individual progenitors to regulate neuronal specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>α’β’ neurons are not generated from <italic>babo</italic> mutant neuroblasts</title><p>The production of the three different mushroom body neuronal types occurs within specific developmental stages of larval and pupal development.

We induced mushroom body neuroblast clones at L1 and compared the axonal morphologies of adult neurons born from mutant neuroblasts to neurons born from surrounding wildtype neuroblasts. To identify mushroom body axonal lobes (both mutant and wildtype), we used antibodies to the Rho guanine exchange factor Trio (a weak γ and strong α’β’ cytoplasmic marker) and to the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin II (FasII) (an axonal γ and αβ marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>).

We quantified the number of α’β’ neurons in wildtype and <italic>babo</italic> clones by counting the number of strong Mamo<sup>+</sup> cells within a clone versus the total number of strong Mamo<sup>+</sup> cells outside the clone. In wildtype MARCM clones affecting a single mushroom body neuroblast (n = 7), the percentage of all α’β’ neurons that were present within the clones was 25.5 ± 0.7%, the expected ratio since each mushroom body is built from four identical neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). In comparison, in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones (n = 8) the percentage of α’β’ neurons within clones was 2.2 ± 0.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Interestingly, although there was a decrease in the number of adult α’β’ neurons upon expression of <italic>UAS-babo-RNAi</italic> with <italic>mb-Gal4</italic>, the majority of α’β’ neurons were not lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M–Q</xref>).

This difference with <italic>babo</italic> clones is likely due to the weak expression of <italic>mb-Gal4</italic> in neuroblasts and newborn neurons and suggested to us that activin signaling is necessary for α’β’ specification by acting in neuroblasts (see below).</p><p>We next sought to determine the fate of the missing α’β’ neurons in <italic>babo</italic> clones, particularly since there was no significant difference in average clone sizes between mutant and control clones labeled with <italic>mb-Gal4</italic> (wildtype: clone size = 533.6 ± 33.3, n = 7; <italic>babo</italic>: clone size = 551.3 ± 17.6, n = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H’</xref>), which suggests that there is no defect in neuroblast proliferation, and that α’β’ neurons are not lost by cell death in <italic>babo</italic> clones. However, to directly test whether cell death played a role, we expressed the caspase inhibitor P35 in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, α’β’ neurons were still missing in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that α’β’ neurons are not generated and then die. We thus tested whether the γ or αβ temporal windows were extended in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones. We made MARCM clones in which the γ, α’β’ or αβ neurons were specifically marked with different <italic>Gal4</italic> lines, and then quantified the total number of GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons in wildtype versus <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–M</xref>). Using <italic>R71G10-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Issman-Zecharya and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>) (referred to as <italic>γ-Gal4</italic>), the average number of γ neurons trended higher in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones, although not significantly (wildtype: 154.3 ± 11.4, n = 10; <italic>babo</italic>: 178.4 ± 11.9, n = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>), likely because the number of γ neurons directly depends on the time of clone induction. α’β’ neurons, marked by <italic>R41C07-Gal4</italic> (referred to as <italic>α’β’-Gal4</italic>), were mostly missing in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones compared to wildtype clones (wildtype: 81.5 ± 3.6, n = 4; <italic>babo</italic>: 2.1 ± 0.5, n = 8,) consistent with our previous results when counting strong Mamo<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>babo</italic> clones marked by <italic>mb-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that additional γ neurons are likely produced, and that fewer αβ neurons are generated, in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones. Although this might appear to contradict a recent report that showed that a subclass of αβ neurons (pioneer-αβ) increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>), it is likely that the earliest born pioneer-αβ are increased because of the delayed decrease in the Imp gradient, but that the later-born αβ neurons do not have time to form (see below and Discussion). We note that the total number of neurons labeled by our neuron type specific <italic>Gal4</italic> drivers did not add up to the expected number of ~500 neurons in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones, which is likely explained by the large variability in the number of γ neurons labeled by <italic>γ-Gal4</italic>. Next, we focused on understanding whether and how activin signaling interacts with the intrinsic Imp and Syp temporal program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activin signaling acts in neuroblasts to lower Imp levels and specify α’β’ neurons</title><p>Given that α’β’ neuronal specification is intrinsically controlled by Imp and Syp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), we asked whether activin signaling acts through or in parallel to this intrinsic temporal system, specifically at L3 when α’β’ neurons are being produced. We first asked whether <italic>babo</italic> is expressed at L3 in mushroom body neuroblasts. Based on published transcriptome data collected from mushroom body neuroblasts at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>babo</italic> is expressed evenly through time in mushroom body neuroblasts, unlike the two RNA binding proteins <italic>Imp</italic> and <italic>Syp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The average Imp to Syp ratio was significantly higher in <italic>babo</italic> neuroblasts (ratio: 4.2 ± 0.4; n = 9 from 4 different brains) compared to wildtype neuroblasts (ratio: 2.4 ± 0.2; n = 23 from the same 4 brains as <italic>babo</italic>) at L3, driven by a significantly higher Imp level in mutant neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) while Syp was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B’</xref>). In addition, the α’β’ neuronal marker Mamo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) was lost in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones at L3 while the level of Chinmo was higher in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–C’’’</xref>), consistent with the notion that high Imp levels block α’β’ specification through maintained higher levels of Chinmo that likely lead to the increased production of γ neurons. The significantly higher Imp to Syp ratio in <italic>babo</italic> mutant neuroblasts persisted even ~24 hr After Pupal Formation (APF) (<italic>babo</italic> ratio: 0.58 ± 0.11; n = 7 from 6 different brains; wildtype ratio: 0.27 ±. 02; n = 27 from the same 6 brains as <italic>babo</italic>), once again driven by higher Imp levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–I</xref>).

Given these contradictory results, we compared Mamo and EcR expression at L3. However, Mamo and EcR were mutually exclusive as EcR was not expressed in newborn α’β’ neurons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O’’</xref>), which precludes the possibility that EcR-DN inhibits EcR function in these neurons and might therefore act through off-target inhibition of Mamo. These results confirm the lack of EcR protein in mushroom body neuroblasts and young neurons at wandering L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>), although EcR was clearly expressed in mature (mostly γ) neurons at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–H’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2017</xref>).

In summary, α’β’ neurons were only lost in adult clones when expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> (with <italic>mb-Gal4</italic>) and not in <italic>usp</italic> mutant clones, and α’β’ neurons were still present when expressing <italic>EcR-RNAi</italic> in L3.

We conclude that the loss of α’β’ neurons when expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> is caused by artifactual inhibition of Mamo (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Establishment of mushroom body neuronal identities</title><p>Mushroom body neurogenesis is unique and programmed to generate many copies of a few neuronal types. During the early stages of mushroom body development, high Imp levels in mushroom body neuroblasts are inherited by newborn neurons and translated into high Chinmo levels to specify γ identity. As in other central brain neuroblasts, as development proceeds, inhibitory interactions between Imp and Syp help create a slow decrease of Imp and a corresponding increase of Syp. However, at the end of the γ temporal window (mid-L3), activin signaling from glia acts to rapidly reduce Imp levels in mushroom body neuroblasts without significantly affecting Syp, establishing a period of low Imp (and thus low Chinmo in neurons) and also low Syp. This is required for activating effector genes in prospective α’β’ neurons, including Mamo, whose translation is promoted by Syp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The production of αβ identity begins when Imp is further decreased and Syp levels are high during pupation (modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Low Chinmo in αβ neurons is also partly regulated by ecdysone signaling through the activation of <italic>Let-7-C</italic>, which targets <italic>chinmo</italic> for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kucherenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Based on our model, α’β’ neurons could not be rescued by knocking-down Imp in <italic>babo</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I,N,P</xref>), since low Imp is required for α’β’ specification while the knockdown reduces its level below this requirement. We might expect to rescue α’β’ neurons if Imp levels were specifically reduced to the appropriate levels at L3. However, reducing Imp levels might not be the only function of activin signaling, which may explain why α’β’ neurons are not simply made earlier (e.g., during L1-L2) when Imp is knocked-down.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of how activin signaling defines the α’β’ temporal identity window.</title><p>In wildtype, as development proceeds, mushroom body neuroblasts incorporate an activin signal (Myo) from glia through Babo to lower the level of the intrinsic temporal factor Imp (magenta dashed line). The lower Imp levels inherited by newborn neurons leads to lower Chinmo levels to control the expression of the α’β’ effector Mamo, defining the mid-temporal window (magenta dashed lines). In <italic>babo</italic> mutants, Imp remains higher for longer, leading to the loss of Mamo (and likely many other targets) during mid-late L3 in neurons. In this model, γ neuron numbers increase, α’β’ neurons are lost, and fewer αβ neurons are produced. Nonetheless, the Imp to Syp transition still occurs, allowing for young (γ) and old (αβ) fates to be produced.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58880-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones, we speculate that additional γ neurons are produced at the expense of α’β’ neurons since Imp levels in neuroblasts (as well as Chinmo in neurons) are higher for a longer time during development; There was also a significant decrease in the total number of αβ neurons in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones that contrasts with a recent report by Marchetti and Tavosanis that instead concluded that additional pioneer-αβ neurons are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>). We believe that there is both an increase in the number of γ neurons and of the pioneer-αβ neuron subclass because pioneer-αβ neurons are the first of the αβ class to be specified (when Imp is still present at very low levels) during pupation. We speculate that pioneer-αβ neurons are produced during the extended low Imp window that we detect during pupation in <italic>babo</italic> clones. However, this does not leave the time for the remaining population of αβ neurons to be formed, which explains why their number is reduced.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the three main classes of mushroom body neurons although at least seven subtypes exist: 2 γ, 2 α’β’ and 3 αβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shih et al., 2019</xref>). The subtypes are specified sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting that each of the three broad mushroom body temporal windows can be subdivided further, either by fine-scale reading of the changing Imp and Syp gradients, by additional extrinsic cues, or perhaps by a tTF series as in other neuroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Temporal patterning of <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain neuroblasts</title><p>Postembryonic central brain neuroblasts are long-lived and divide on average ~50 times.

Conceptually, how Imp and Syp gradients translate into different neuronal identities through time has been compared to how morphogen gradients pattern tissues in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). During patterning of the anterior-posterior axis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, the anterior gradient of the Bicoid morphogen and the posterior Nanos gradient are converted into discrete spatial domains that define cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Since gradients contain unlimited information, differences in Imp and Syp levels through time could translate into different neuronal types. Another intriguing possibility is that tTF series could act downstream of Imp and Syp, similarly to how the gap genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo act downstream of the anterior-posterior morphogens. We have shown that another possibility is that temporal extrinsic cues can be incorporated by individual progenitors to increase neuronal diversity. In mushroom body neuroblasts activin signaling acts directly on the intrinsic program, effectively converting two broad temporal windows into three to help define an additional neuronal type. We propose that subdividing the broad Imp and Syp temporal windows by extrinsic cues may be a simple way to increase neuronal diversity in other central brain neuroblasts.</p><p>We have also shown that activin signaling times the Imp to Syp transition for mushroom body neuroblasts, similar to the function of ecdysone for other central brain neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syed et al., 2017a</xref>). In both cases however, the switch still occurs, indicating that a separate independent clock continues to tick. This role for extrinsic cues during <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis is reminiscent of their roles on individual vertebrate progenitors. For example, hindbrain neural stem cells progressively produce motor neurons followed by serotonergic neurons before switching to producing glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chleilat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dias et al., 2014</xref>). The motor neuron to serotonergic neuron switch is fine-tuned by TGFβ signaling. It would be interesting to determine if hindbrain neuronal subtypes are lost in TGFβ mutants, similar to how α’β’ identity is lost in the mushroom bodies in <italic>babo</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ecdysone signaling is not necessary for α’β’ specification</title><p>The specification of α’β’ neurons begins at mid-L3 with the onset of Mamo expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, high levels of EcR are detected in mature mushroom body neurons starting at late L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). At this stage, both γ and α’β’ neurons already exist and new α’β’ neurons are still being generated. Thus, Mamo expression precedes EcR expression. These non-overlapping expression patterns suggest that ecdysone signaling does not regulate Mamo and therefore cannot control the specification of α’β’ neurons. Furthermore, expression of <italic>UAS-EcR-RNAi</italic> or mutants for <italic>usp</italic> do not lead to the loss of α’β’ neurons. We note that our <italic>usp</italic> results contradict the loss of α’β’ neuron reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2017</xref> in <italic>usp</italic> clones. However, we could see α’β’ neurons in these clones based on the morphology of these neurons but the remodeling defect of γ neurons makes α’β’ neurons difficult to identify. Nevertheless, ecdysone might still function later during α’β’ differentiation, particularly during pupation when all mushroom body neurons express EcR.</p><p>We and Marchetti and Tavosanis have both shown that expression of <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> leads to the loss of α’β’ neurons by acting in mushroom body neurons but not in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2017</xref>). However, EcR must be first be expressed in the target cells of interest in order to make any conclusions about ecdysone function using <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic>. Since we cannot detect EcR protein in Mamo<sup>+</sup> cells at L3, but expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> inhibits Mamo in those cells, we conclude that EcR-DN artifactually represses Mamo and leads to the loss of α’β’ neurons. This explains why expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-B1</italic> does not rescue α’β’ neurons in <italic>babo</italic> clones. However, Marchetti and Tavosanis did rescue <italic>babo-RNAi</italic> by expressing EcR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>). This is likely because our experiments were performed using <italic>babo</italic> MARCM clones in which the loss of α’β’ neurons is much more severe than with <italic>babo-</italic>RNAi used in their experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1Q</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>). Indeed, when we attempted to eliminate α’β’ neurons using a validated <italic>UAS-babo-RNAi</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>), γ neurons did not remodel but there was only a minor (but significant) decrease in the number of α’β’ neurons. This indicates that knocking-down <italic>babo</italic> with <italic>mb-Gal4</italic> that is only weakly expressed in neuroblasts and newborn neurons is not strong enough to inhibit α’β’ specification. Thus, we speculate that the LexA line used by Marchetti and Tavosanis (<italic>GMR26E01-LexA</italic>) may not be a reliable reporter for α’β’ neurons upon <italic>babo</italic> knockdown, and that it might be ecdysone sensitive later in α’β’ differentiation. Since EcR expression in all mushroom body neurons at L3 may be dependent on activin signaling directly in neurons, as it is in γ neurons for remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>), expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-B1</italic> together with <italic>UAS-babo-RNAi</italic> using <italic>OK107-Gal4</italic> might both reduce the effectiveness of the RNAi while also allowing for the re-expression of <italic>GMR26E01-LexA</italic>.</p><p>Glia are a source of the activin ligand <italic>myo</italic>, which is temporally expressed in brain glia starting at L3 to initiate the remodeling of mushroom body γ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awasaki et al., 2011</xref>) and α’β’ specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchetti and Tavosanis, 2019</xref>). However, knocking-down Myo from glia is not as severe as removing Babo from mushroom body neuroblasts. This might be due to incomplete knockdown of <italic>myo</italic> or to other sources of Myo, potentially from neurons. For example, in the vertebrate cortex, old neurons signal back to young neurons to control their numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parthasarathy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seuntjens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). It is also possible the Babo is activated by other activin ligands, including Activin and Dawdle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). An intriguing hypothesis is that the temporal expression of <italic>myo</italic> in glia beginning at mid-L3 is induced by the attainment of critical weight and rising ecdysone levels. It would be interesting to determine whether blocking ecdysone signaling in glia leads to the loss of α’β’ specification, similar to how blocking ecdysone reception in astrocytes prevents γ neuron remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hakim et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conserved mechanisms of temporal patterning</title><p>It is well established that extrinsic cues play important roles during vertebrate neurogenesis, either by regulating temporal competence of neural stem cells or by controlling the timing of temporal identity transitions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawaguchi, 2019</xref>).

Using Fiji, each image was cropped to limit the area to a region containing mostly mushroom body cell bodies. In all cases, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were manually counted. To count α’β’ neurons, images were split into their individual channels and the channel containing Mamo staining was automatically binarized to account for weak and strong Mamo expression using either Default or RenyiEntropy thresholding. Binarized images were processed further using the Watershed method to differentiate between contacting cells. The number of particles (<italic>i.e.,</italic> strong Mamo cells) measuring between 50-infinity squared pixels were automatically counted using the Analyze Particles function and a separate channel containing bare outlines of the counts was produced and inverted. This method automatically produced the total number of strong Mamo<sup>+</sup> cells. Individual channels were then remerged. Outlines drawn from the Analyze Particles function that overlapped with GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were defined as α’β’ neurons within a clone. In the eight cases where two mushroom body neuroblasts were labeled in a single hemisphere (wildtype:1; <italic>babo</italic>, <italic>UAS-EcR</italic>: 3; <italic>babo</italic>, <italic>UAS-Syp</italic>: 2), the total number of α’β’ neurons within clones was divided by 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imp and Syp fluorescence quantification</title><p>All brains used for quantifying Imp and Syp fluorescence values in <italic>babo</italic> or <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> mutants were prepared together. Additionally, all images used for quantification were imaged using the same confocal settings for each channel. Fluorescence measurements were made in Fiji. Values for Imp and Syp were measured within the same hand-drawn area encompassing the entire neuroblast from a single z-slice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical tests were performed in Excel or R. The exact tests used are reported in the figure legends. In all cases, whisker plots represent the minimum value (bottom whisker), first quartile (bottom of box to middle line), inclusive median (middle line), third quartile (middle line to top of box) and maximum value (top whisker). The ‘x’ represents the average value. Outliers are 1.5 times the distance from the first and third quartile. Reported are averages ± standard error of mean (SEM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the fly community, the Bloomington and the DGRC stock centers for flies and reagents; Nikos Konstantinides for discussion throughout the project and comments on the manuscript, ﻿and the three reviewers for constructive feedback on our paper; Tzumin Lee for sharing data prior to publication and for discussions; Tzumin Lee, Lynn Riddiford, Oren Schuldine, Cedric Maurange and Michael B O’Connor for fly stocks and antibodies; And all the Desplan lab members for their discussion and comments on the manuscript.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The generation of neuronal diversity often requires progenitors to produce distinct neural subtypes over time. Previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that temporal transcription factors function as a progenitor intrinsic &quot;clock&quot; to sequentially generate different neural subtypes. Here, Rossi and Desplan show there is also a progenitor extrinsic signaling pathway that is also required to generate temporally-distinct neural subtypes. Importantly, they document cross-talk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways required to generate neuronal diversity. This provides a novel paradigm for considering <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian neural cell fate specification.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Extrinsic Activin signaling cooperates with an intrinsic temporal program to increase mushroom body neuronal diversity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Chris Q Doe as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from Rossi and Desplan addresses the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic cues in the specification of temporal identity within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body neuroblast (MBNB) lineages, which sequentially produce four subtypes of neurons: γ, α’/β’, p.α’/β’ and a/b. The mechanisms generating neuronal diversity are important and of general interest; the integration of progenitor intrinsic and extrinsic cues is relatively novel.</p><p>The manuscript builds on closely related work from Marchetti and Tavosanis (2017, 2019). Both labs show that the TGFb signaling pathway is required for α’/β’ adult neuron identity, but via highly divergent mechanisms. Marchetti proposes TGFb drives expression of the steroid hormone receptor EcR which is required for consolidating α’/β’ fate in adult neurons (but not for their specification); when the pathway is compromised, α’/β’ neurons switch to a later-born pioneer.α’/β’ fate. In contrast, Rossi proposes TGFb represses the intrinsic temporal factor Imp in neuroblasts, with low Imp levels specifying α’/β’ identity; when the pathway is compromised, the α’/β’ neurons switch to an earlier-born high Imp γ neuron identity.</p><p>All reviewers felt the current manuscript contained well-designed experiments, convincing figures, and that the logical flow made it easy to follow. All reviewers felt the paper was appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> based on the journal's policy of reviewing papers where an overlapping paper has been recently published with the goals of (a) independently replicating results, or (b) correct previous findings. Nevertheless, all reviewers felt this manuscript failed to resolve conflicts in data and interpretation with prior papers, particularly the role of EcR and the difference between specification and consolidation. Thus, the large majority of comments below ask for additional experiments or text changes to reconcile the two sets of results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The role of EcR signaling. This is central to the Marchetti model, but excluded from the Rossi model. The authors should put more effort into resolving the different conclusions on EcR signaling in specifying α’/β’ neuron identity. Some experiments give similar results (e.g. EcR-DN expression reduces α’/β’ neurons), however, the global interpretation is quite different, which makes the current work more significant. Unfortunately, the differences in interpretation are not explained or discussed, which leave the reader in a perplexed mood, because the main conclusions of the two papers do not seem compatible.</p><p>a) Marchetti et al. show that TGFb signaling induces expression of EcRB1, and that forced expression of EcRB1 can rescue a <italic>babo</italic> mutant phenotype; the α’/β’ neurons are restored. This is strong evidence for the role of EcRB1 in TGFb specification of α’/β’ identity. The Rossi manuscript also shows that the TGFb pathway is required for α’/β’ fate, but independent of EcR. How can these opposing results be reconciled?</p><p>b) The fact that the α'/β' marker Mamo is still expressed when EcR-RNAi is mis-expressed does not necessarily means that ecdysone signaling is not required for α’β’ specification. It is well-documented that EcRDN and EcR-RNAi mis-expression can lead to opposite phenotypes (PMID: 16354717, 25126791, 28394252). Indeed, EcR-DN prevents activation of ecdysone signaling induced by the production of ecdysone, but leaves intact the repressive ability of unbound EcR. In contrast, EcR-RNAi prevents both activation of ecdysone signaling and the repressive role of EcR in absence of ecdysone. One possibility is that Mamo, in the absence of ecdysone is repressed in neurons by unbound EcR, and that ecdysone signaling activates Mamo expression by relieving the EcR-mediated repression. If this is true, one may see precocious expression of Mamo in early L3 upon EcR-RNAi expression (similar to the UAS-babo-Act phenotype). The authors should investigate this to clarify the point.</p><p>c) Major differences are observed in the experiments removing the EcR co-factor Usp. Marchetti, 2017 showed <italic>usp</italic> clones lack α’/β’ neurons; here <italic>usp</italic> clones show normal α’/β’ neurons. Are both labs using the same reagent? Can the authors show that their <italic>usp</italic> mutant clones lack USP protein?</p><p>2) The primary novel conclusion in the present manuscript is that Myo signaling specifies α’/β’ neurons via regulating Imp levels, but the data to support this is rather slim. The only supportive data is the elevated Imp level in <italic>babo</italic> mutant neuroblast.</p><p>a) Importantly, they failed to rescue the α’/β’ neuron identity by forced expression of Imp in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones. How is this consistent with their model?</p><p>b) Furthermore, the authors show that overexpression of EcR-DN leads to suppression of α’/β’ neuron specification (Figure 6E), but in the same figure, they also show that the Imp levels are not changed in the neuroblasts (Figure 6H and J), which suggests that the changing Imp levels in neuroblasts may not be required to change α’/β’ neuron specification.</p><p>c) Also, the authors demonstrate that TGFb signaling intersects with the Imp/Syp temporal patterning system by showing that Imp remains expressed at higher levels in MB NBs that are mutant for babo. The maintenance of higher levels of Imp is supposed to be sufficient to prevent expression of Mamo. Since Chinmo is regulated by the Imp/Syp module and that Mamo is activated by low levels of Chinmo, one should expect high levels of Chinmo to be maintained in late larval neurons produced in the <italic>babo</italic> mutant context. Is this observed? The Marchetti study says that they don't see any obvious changes.</p><p>d) If TGFb signaling is indeed required to terminate the first temporal window and activate the second temporal window then, γ neurons should still be generated in late L3 MB neuroblasts that are mutants for babo. As this is such a critical point in their model, the authors should do a precise time course to determine how long MB neuroblasts continue to generate γ neurons when mutant for <italic>babo</italic> (compared to wt). This should be checked using Abrupt as a marker for γ neurons, which seems to be more specific than Trio.</p><p>e) Related to the previous point: the evidence that TGFb signaling intersects with progression of the Imp/Syncrip temporal patterning system remains thin (slightly higher levels of Imp in late larval and pupal MB neuroblasts that are mutant for babo). Further evidence is needed, to confirm that TGFb signaling is responsible for creating a novel temporal window, as opposed to a role in fate consolidation as proposed by Marchetti.</p><p>f) Finally, they showed that either knockdown or overexpression of Imp using mb-GAL4 leads to loss of Mamo, a marker for α’/β’ neurons. mb-GAL4 is strongly expressed in mushroom body neurons and is weakly expressed in neuroblasts, so the manipulation of Imp level is not only done in neuroblasts but also in neurons, and thus it is possible that the Imp, which appears to also be expressed in post mitotic neurons (Figure S3D), is actually required in already specified α’/β’ neurons to maintain their identity, consistent with the Marchetti model.</p><p>3) Marchetti show that TGFb signaling acts in neuroblasts, but is not required for α’/β’ neuron specification during larval stages, nor for the normal levels of the early temporal factors Chinmo and Abrupt. Rather, TGFb signaling is required to stabilize/consolidate α’/β’ identity in adults. In this work, loss of TGFb signaling increases Imp temporal identity levels, which should alter Chinmo and Abrupt levels. Can you resolve this discrepancy?</p><p>4) The authors state in the text and show in the final model figure that loss of TGFb signaling leads to a loss of mid-born α’/β’ neurons (well supported by multiple experiments) and an expansion of early-born γ neurons, &quot;although not significantly&quot;. Either more n's need to be added to (potentially) reveal significance, or the figure and conclusions need to be toned down. Showing a doubling of γ neurons in the model figure when they are 'not significantly' increased is a stretch.</p><p>5) Marchetti observe EcR-B1 expression in all α’β’ neurons. This manuscript shows EcR-B1 is not expressed in Mamo+ α’/β’ neurons. This is a puzzle that should be resolved. Perhaps by checking that C305-GAL4 and Mamo are expressed in the same set of mushroom body neurons in late L3?</p><p>6) An important point that remains unresolved and that has not been investigated nor discussed is what controls the temporal expression of Myo in glia after critical weight is achieved at mid-larval stage. An attractive hypothesis is that it is induced by the mid-L3 pulses of ecdysone. This can be easily investigated using available Myo-GAL4-driven GFP expression lines and looking at mid 3rd instar. Resolving this point would make the whole study more attractive, and different from the Marchetti one.</p><p>7) Marchetti shows loss of TGFb signaling transforms α’/β’ neurons to later-born pioneer α’/β’ neurons; this work shows that loss of TGFb signaling transforms α’/β’ neurons to earlier-born γ neurons.

We exclude EcR from our model because our data suggest that only EcR-DN, but not EcR knockdown or <italic>usp</italic> mutants, blocks α’β’ specification. EcR-DN blocks α’β’ specification by inhibiting Mamo. Obviously, EcR must be expressed in these cells for EcR-DN to demonstrate function. However, EcR is not expressed in Mamo+ cells that are destined to become α’β’ neurons during L3. In addition, Mamo starts being expressed in presumptive α’β’ neurons from mid-L3 while EcR is only activated later at wandering L3, another point that we highlight in the text. Following this logic, we conclude that EcR-DN must artificially repress Mamo during α’β’ specification. We speculate that Mamo may be regulated by EcR in other contexts and that this regulation is hijacked by expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-DN</italic> with <italic>OK107-Gal4</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Marchetti et al. show that TGFb signaling induces expression of EcRB1, and that forced expression of EcRB1 can rescue a babo mutant phenotype; the α’/β’ neurons are restored.

The most parsimonious explanation is that the differences in the results are a consequence of methods used. First, we failed to rescue <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones while they rescued a <italic>babo-RNAi</italic>. <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones lead to an almost complete loss of α’β’ neurons (while, in their manuscript, expressing <italic>babo-RNAi</italic> using <italic>OK107-Gal4</italic> reduces the number of α’β’ neurons by about 2/3). Second, we quantified the loss of α’β’ neurons in adult clones using two molecular markers (high Mamo and Trio) while they used a LexA driver (<italic>GMR26E01-LexA</italic>). We speculate that this LexA driver is ecdysone sensitive (indirectly). Indeed, all mushroom body neurons express EcR during the pupal stages. If Activin signaling activates EcR expression in all mature mushroom body neurons as it does in γ neurons (independent of its role in mushroom body neuroblasts), then this LexA driver may not be effectively activated late. By expressing <italic>UAS-EcR-B1</italic> and <italic>babo-RNAi</italic> together, they might rescue expression of the LexA driver. In support of this, we now show that by knocking-down <italic>babo</italic> with <italic>OK107-Gal4,</italic> that the majority of α’β’ neurons are present in the adult using Mamo and Trio while g neurons do not remodel in these same brains. Therefore, we speculate that <italic>GMR26E01-LexA</italic> is not a reliable marker for α’β’ neurons in this context.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative images showing the presence of α’β’ neurons based on strong Mamo (gray) and Trio (magenta) expression in adult mushroom body neurons labeled by <italic>mb-Gal4</italic> driving <italic>UAS-CD8::GFP</italic>.</title><p>N-N’’’.

Although the suggestion by the reviewer is logical, the underlying assumption is that EcR is normally expressed in Mamo+ cells. We have shown that this is not the case, as EcR and Mamo do not overlap. If the above model was correct (i.e., unbound EcR inhibits Mamo), then EcR must be expressed in Mamo+ cells, which it is not. Furthermore, this model would require that EcR be expressed before Mamo in mushroom body neurons during development and again, this is not the case since Mamo is expressed in presumptive α’β’ neurons from mid-L3 while EcR can only be detected later at wandering L3. We have added text to our Results and Discussion section highlighting this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Major differences are observed in the experiments removing the EcR co-factor Usp.

We therefore made <italic>usp3</italic> mutant clones, which we now report also contain α’β’ neurons (and unpruned γ neurons) (See Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-C’’’). The difference in interpretation may be due to the fact that in the <italic>usp</italic> clones, γ neurons do not remodel, which can make identifying α’β’ neurons based on morphology alone quite difficult. Nonetheless, from the single image published in Marchetti and Tavosanis’ paper, it is clear that their <italic>usp</italic> mutant clones induced at L1 contain α’β’ neurons marked by GFP+/FasII- are present. The reviewer asked us to show that our <italic>usp</italic> mutant clones lack Usp protein: all of our <italic>usp</italic> neuroblasts clones induced at L1 contain unpruned γ neurons (see Figure 6F, Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-C’’’), demonstrating that <italic>usp</italic> is indeed missing. We have added text to our Discussion describing our interpretation of the Marchetti and Tavosanis results. We have communicated with these authors multiple times to explain our interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The primary novel conclusion in the present manuscript is that Myo signaling specifies α’/β’ neurons via regulating Imp levels, but the data to support this is rather slim. The only supportive data is the elevated Imp level in babo mutant neuroblast.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the conclusion that Activin signaling interacts with the intrinsic Imp and Syp temporal gradients is the most novel concept in our paper. Our work not only confirms that Activin signaling is necessary to specify α’β’ neurons but also shows how two different temporal mechanisms interact to increase neuronal diversity.</p><p>We believe that we provide a very strong proof that Imp levels in mushroom body neuroblasts are regulated by Activin signaling: Imp levels in mutant neuroblast clones are very significantly increased and this was internally controlled with the levels of Imp in neighboring wildtype neuroblasts. Furthermore, this is further supported by the high levels of Chinmo in <italic>babo</italic> clones at the time α’β’ neurons should be produced (see image S3C). We feel that these are more than slim evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Importantly, they failed to rescue the α’/β’ neuron identity by forced expression of Imp in babo mutant clones. How is this consistent with their model?</p></disp-quote><p>We guess the reviewers meant to comment on our rescue of <italic>babo</italic> clones by reducing <italic>Imp</italic> levels, which did not rescue α’β’ specification (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). However, we show (and it is well documented) that <italic>Imp-RNAi</italic> expression leads to the loss of α’β’ neurons and our results are entirely consistent with our proposed model that low imp (but not ‘no Imp’) is required for α’β’ specification. Given our model, we think that reducing the levels of <italic>Imp</italic> specifically at L3 in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones (but still inducing clones at L1) might rescue the loss of α’β’ neurons. This would require us to perform long and technically difficult experiments that were in progress but were interrupted by the lockdown. We now include text in our Discussion addressing this experiment and our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Furthermore, the authors show that overexpression of EcR-DN leads to suppression of α’/β’ neuron specification (Figure 6E), but in the same figure, they also show that the Imp levels are not changed in the neuroblasts (Figure 6H and J), which suggests that the changing Imp levels in neuroblasts may not be required to change α’/β’ neuron specification.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we suggest that EcR-DN blocks α’β’ specification by acting late in postmitotic neurons, not in neuroblasts. We showed that expressing EcR-DN in neuroblasts (with <italic>Insc-Gal4</italic>) does not inhibit α’β’ specification (Figure 6M). Thus, Imp levels in neuroblasts should not be affected by expressing EcR-DN: Imp (and Syp) levels are inherited by neurons at birth, which is where these RNA-binding proteins act to regulate neuronal specification. In addition, EcR is not expressed in mushroom body neuroblasts or newborn postmitotic neurons (Mamo+), explaining why ecdysone signaling can only act in older postmitotic neurons. As explained above, EcR-DN acts by artificially inhibiting Mamo in newborn neurons. We have added text to our Results section highlighting this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Also, the authors demonstrate that TGFb signaling intersects with the Imp/Syp temporal patterning system by showing that Imp remains expressed at higher levels in MB NBs that are mutant for babo.

The Marchetti study says that they don't see any obvious changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our model indicates that Chinmo levels should be higher in <italic>babo</italic> mutant neurons at L3. We had done experiments to test this and were now able to analyze them and they are now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-C’’’. The results indicate that Chinmo levels are indeed higher in mutant neurons while they are low in the adjacent wildtype neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) If TGFb signaling is indeed required to terminate the first temporal window and activate the second temporal window then, γ neurons should still be generated in late L3 MB neuroblasts that are mutants for babo.

We attempted to test whether there was an increase in the number of γ neurons as this is an important component of our model but could only demonstrate a trend upwards in the adult, likely because the timing of clone induction dramatically affects variability of the number of γ neurons, while it does not affect later time windows. Unfortunately, a γ specific marker at L3 does not exist (e.g., Abrupt labels both γ and α’β’ neurons at L3). To attempt to answer whether the γ window is maintained for longer, we now include a figure showing that Chinmo levels are higher in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones compared to surrounding wildtype neurons at wandering L3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-C’’’). These mutant neurons do not express Mamo but wildtype neurons do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Related to the previous point: the evidence that TGFb signaling intersects with progression of the Imp/Syncrip temporal patterning system remains thin (slightly higher levels of Imp in late larval and pupal MB neuroblasts that are mutant for babo).

This clearly demonstrated a ~1.5-fold increase in Imp levels in <italic>babo</italic> mutant neuroblasts, which was quantified in Figure 2D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ). Furthermore, our data agree with Marchetti and Tavosanis who interpret their data, like us, that Babo acts in neuroblasts and not in neurons, although they do not investigate whether Imp and/or Syp levels are altered. They do argue that the α’β’ fate requires EcR signaling in neurons, i.e the two pathways would act in different cell types (neuroblasts versus neurons). Our study provides an answer to this problem as we propose that Activin signaling acts on mushroom body neuroblasts to affect Imp levels, which are inherited by newborn neurons. We have revised our text to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Finally, they showed that either knockdown or overexpression of Imp using mb-GAL4 leads to loss of Mamo, a marker for α’/β’ neurons. mb-GAL4 is strongly expressed in mushroom body neurons and is weakly expressed in neuroblasts, so the manipulation of Imp level is not only done in neuroblasts but also in neurons, and thus it is possible that the Imp, which appears to also be expressed in post mitotic neurons (Figure S3D), is actually required in already specified α’/β’ neurons to maintain their identity, consistent with the Marchetti model.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in that Imp is expressed in neurons. In fact, the original model from Tzumin Lee argues that Imp and Syp are expressed in gradients in neuroblasts but carry out their temporal patterning function in neurons (since they are inherited). These Imp levels in neurons control Chinmo translation and thus other downstream targets. When we express <italic>Imp-RNA</italic> with <italic>OK107-Gal4</italic> (<italic>mb-Gal4</italic>), we are in fact lowering <italic>Imp</italic> in both neuroblasts and neurons. This does not change the conclusion that low Imp levels in neuroblasts, which would normally be inherited from neuroblasts into neurons, are needed for low Chinmo levels and thus for Mamo expression in α’β’ neurons. Our new data show that Chinmo levels are elevated in neurons at L3 in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones, which support our interpretation. Low Imp levels inherited from neuroblasts are what help define α’β’ neurons with everything else occurring downstream of this temporal factor. We have added text to our Discussion that better describes how Imp and Syp levels in neuroblasts are inherited by newborn neurons to control temporal identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Marchetti show that TGFb signaling acts in neuroblasts, but is not required for α’/β’ neuron specification during larval stages, nor for the normal levels of the early temporal factors Chinmo and Abrupt. Rather, TGFb signaling is required to stabilize/consolidate α’/β’ identity in adults. In this work, loss of TGFb signaling increases Imp temporal identity levels, which should alter Chinmo and Abrupt levels. Can you resolve this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>It is our understanding that Marchetti and Tavosanis argue that Activin signaling at L3 leads to the expression of EcR in differentiating (but already specified) α’β’ neurons. They do not provide a model for how Activin signaling in neuroblasts is transmitted to neurons leading to EcR expression but the activation of EcR must occur when ecdysone is present. Although they did stain for Chinmo in <italic>babo</italic> mutant clones at L3, it is unclear from this single image they show whether Chinmo levels are altered. Nonetheless, we did not check Abrupt (for which we do not have a good antibody anyway) since this marker labels both γ and α’β’ neurons at L3. However, we now include data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C’C’’’ that shows higher Chinmo levels and loss of Mamo in <italic>babo</italic> mutant neurons, which is consistent with our model that in the absence of Activin signaling, higher Imp levels (in neuroblasts) at L3 are inherited by neurons and translated into higher Chinmo levels, which leads to the loss of Mamo and of α’β’ specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state in the text and show in the final model figure that loss of TGFb signaling leads to a loss of mid-born α’/β’ neurons (well supported by multiple experiments) and an expansion of early-born γ neurons, &quot;although not significantly&quot;.

We have corrected this in our model figure (Figure 7). We have also added the word, “likely” when we suggest that additional γ neurons are produced in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Marchetti observe EcR-B1 expression in all α’β’ neurons.

It is correct that α’β’ neurons express EcR late, during early pupal stages, but at this point all mushroom body neurons express EcR, the α’β’ window has closed, and αβ neurons are being specified. We also now discuss in the text that as α’β’ neurons mature, they first express Mamo and then later EcR, which is another reason why EcR cannot affect Mamo expression and α’β’ specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) An important point that remains unresolved and that has not been investigated nor discussed is what controls the temporal expression of Myo in glia after critical weight is achieved at mid-larval stage.

We plan on addressing the interaction between extrinsic cues, glia, and neuronal specification in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Marchetti shows loss of TGFb signaling transforms α’/β’ neurons to later-born pioneer α’/β’ neurons; this work shows that loss of TGFb signaling transforms α’/β’ neurons to earlier-born γ neurons.

The two interpretations are not at odds since higher than normal Imp levels during pupation might extend the window for pioneer-αβ neuron specification (since they are the first αβ neuronal type to be specified) while the majority of remaining later-born αβ will not have time to be generated before birth. This would both decrease the overall number of αβ neurons as we suggest but could also lead to an increase in the pioneer-αβ population. We have added text to our Discussion describing these possibilities.</p></body></sub-article></article>
