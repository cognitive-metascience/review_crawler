during reverse transcription (U/A pairs), resulting in pre-integration restriction and post-integration mutagenesis. After entering the nucleus, uracilated viral DNA products are degraded by the uracil base excision repair (UBER) machinery with less than 1% of the uracilated DNA successfully integrating. Although uracilated proviral DNA showed few mutations, the viral genomic RNA was highly mutated, suggesting that errors occur during transcription. Viral DNA isolated from blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages (but not T cells) of drug-suppressed HIV-infected individuals also contained abundant uracils. The presence of viral uracils in short-lived monocytes suggests their recent infection through contact with virus producing cells in a tissue reservoir. These findings reveal new elements of a viral defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18447.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18447.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18447.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects and kills immune cells known as CD4+ T cells, leading to the disease AIDS. Current drug treatments enable HIV-1 infected patients to live relatively long and healthy lives. However, no cure for HIV-1 exists because the virus lives indefinitely in a resting state within the genetic material – or genome – of the infected cell, where it is not susceptible to drug treatments. Most HIV-1 research focuses on T cells, but another type of immune cell – the macrophage – may also harbor resting HIV-1 in its genome.</p><p>Compared to other cells, macrophages are unusual because they produce large amounts of a molecule called deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP). Most cells, including T cells, keep dUTP levels very low because it closely resembles molecules that are used to make DNA and so it can be accidentally incorporated into the cell’s DNA. When this happens, the cell removes the dUTP from the DNA using enzymes in a process called uracil base excision repair (UBER). To hide inside the cell’s genome, HIV-1 needs to produce a DNA copy of its own genome, but it was not known what happens when HIV-1 tries to do this within a macrophage that contains high levels of dUTP and UBER enzymes.</p><p>Here, Hansen et al. reveal that about 90% of macrophages have exceptionally high levels of dUTP and are poorly infected by HIV-1. The high levels of dUTP result in the virus incorporating dUTP into its DNA, which is then attacked and fragmented by UBER enzymes. However, about one in a hundred viral DNA molecules do manage to successfully integrate into the genome of the macrophage. This viral DNA later gives rise to new virus particles through an error-prone process that, by introducing new mutations into the virus genome, may help HIV-1 to evolve and persist.</p><p>Further experiments examined cells that give rise to macrophages from infected patients who had been on anti-HIV drug therapy for several years. Hansen et al. found that there was lots of dUTP in the DNA sequences of HIV-1 viruses found in these “precursor” cells. These precursor cells only live for several days before being eliminated, so the presence of viruses containing dUTP suggests these cells were infected recently. A future challenge will be to identify new anti-HIV drugs that specifically target macrophages and to understand the role of error-prone production of new viral genomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The uracil nucleobase plays a central role in adaptive and innate immunity against HIV-1 when it is found in DNA rather than RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Priet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sire et al., 2008</xref>). The most well-characterized uracil-centric innate immune response involves host cell DNA cytidine deaminase enzymes (APOBECs), which selectively deaminate cytosine residues during (-) strand DNA synthesis thereby rendering the viral genome nonfunctional by hypermutation (C/G to T/A). Work from our lab and others has suggested the presence of another uracil-mediated HIV-1 restriction pathway involving the incorporation of dUTP into viral DNA by reverse transcriptase to produce U/A base pairs ('uracilation') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weil et al., 2013</xref>). The dUTP-dependent pathway is thought to be restricted to non-dividing immune cells such as macrophages, monocytes and resting CD4+ T cells because only non-dividing cells have the requisite low levels of canonical dNTPs and elevated ratios of dUTP/ TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, U/A pairs resulting from dUTP incorporation are 'invisible' to normal DNA sequencing methods and they retain the coding potential of normal T/A base pairs. Despite the similarity of U/A and T/A pairs, the presence of uracil in DNA has the potential to introduce diverse effects on viral infection including transcriptional silencing and engagement of the host uracil base excision repair (UBER) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brégeon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krokan et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2014b</xref>). The presence, persistence, and ultimate fate of U/A pairs in HIV-1 proviral DNA is unexplored and is important for understanding the potential of tissue macrophages to establish and maintain a long-term HIV reservoir.</p><p>A role for dUTP and the UBER enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (hUNG2) in HIV-1 infection have been long debated [see reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weil et al. 2013</xref>) for a succinct review]. A dUTP-mediated host defense pathway was first suggested from inspection of the genomes of β-retroviruses, non-primate lentiviruses, and endogenous retroviruses, which have all captured a host dUTPase gene during viral evolution. Additional support was provided by the observation that dUTPase-deficient mutants of non-primate lentiviruses cannot infect non-dividing cells that contain high-dUTP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lichtenstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turelli et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Threadgill et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steagall et al., 1995</xref>). Intriguingly, HIV-1 does not encode a dUTPase yet can infect human macrophages with a reported dUTP:TTP ratio of 60:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 2011</xref>). There is an equal level of intrigue concerning the role of hUNG2 in HIV infection. A <italic>pro-infective</italic> role for hUNG2 has been suggested by reports that hUNG2 suppresses mutations in the viral genome upon infection of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mansky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Priet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guenzel et al., 2012</xref>), but is completely dispensable for HIV-1 replication of cells with low-dUTP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaiseer and Emerman, 2006</xref>). In contrast, a modest <italic>restrictive</italic> role for hUNG2 has been suggested from the decreased infectivity of HIV virions lacking viral protein R (Vpr). This restriction is attributed to a Vpr-dependent ubiquitin-mediated hUNG2 degradation pathway or through Vpr-induced transcriptional silencing of hUNG2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrofelbauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Langevin et al., 2009</xref>). These intriguing prior observations have motivated our further studies into the role of UBER in HIV infection, which now establish a profoundly restrictive role and unexpected effects on viral mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unique nucleotide metabolism in myeloid cells results in high dUTP/TTP</title><p>We hypothesized that viral uracilation and restriction in resting immune cells would require enzyme activities that support a high dUTP/TTP ratio and uracil base excision.

The scatter plots and histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> show that the copy number for viral <italic>gag</italic> DNA isolated from MDMs at 3 days post-infection was 3.5-fold lower in the Ex-ddPCR experiment, showing that ~70% of <italic>gag</italic> amplicons contained uracil. Importantly, the genomic reference standard RNase P (<italic>RPP30</italic>) contained no measurable uracil, indicating that uracil incorporation is specific to HIV DNA and occurs during reverse transcription. In contrast, the <italic>gag</italic> copy number for viral DNA collected from activated and resting T cells was the same for both the ddPCR and Ex-ddPCR reactions indicating that uracil was absent in viral DNA isolated from infected T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To augment Ex-ddPCR, we also applied the next-generation sequencing technology uracil Ex-Seq to globally map the frequency of U/A pairs across the entire HIV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryan et al., 2014</xref>). Ex-Seq is similar to standard IIlumina sequencing (Seq), except that UNG-mediated uracil excision is used to destroy uracil-containing templates prior to PCR amplification. To specifically enrich HIV-1 sequences, we used 5’-biotin-conjugated DNA probes that tiled both strands of the entire viral genome, yielding a 10<sup>3</sup>-fold increase in HIV-derived fragments. Sequencing of viral DNA isolated from MDMs 7 days after infection with HIV<sup>NL4.3(VSVG)</sup> showed uniform coverage across the genome except for notably increased reads at the 5´ and 3´-LTR regions, which was equally evident for both the Seq and Ex-Seq samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We speculate that the elevated signal in the LTRs arises from non-uniform hybridization of the lock-down probes, which is normalized when converting the reads to Frac U. The ratio of the normalized sequencing reads (Ex-Seq/Seq) thus quantifies the fraction that contained at least one uracil on each strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, about 60% of the 100 bp reads contained uracil, leading us to conclude that uracilation was uniform across the viral genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Integrated proviruses contain abundant uracils</title><p>The above analyses report on both integrated and unintegrated viral DNA. However, the Ex-Seq experiment also provides specific information on the uracilation status of integrated proviruses and their genomic sites of integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Sequence reads from integrated proviruses are unambiguously assigned by the presence of viral LTR and human genomic sequences ('discordant pairs'). Over 4000 discordant pairs were identified per million HIV reads for the Seq sample, which was reduced by about 60% for the Ex-Seq sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This level of uracilation is similar to that of the total HIV DNA and supports our previous finding that uracils can persist in proviruses when nuclear hUNG2 expression is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weil et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Uracils arise from high dUTP/TTP not APOBEC-catalyzed cytosine deamination</title><p>For T cell targets of HIV-1, expression of APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) has been shown to result in cytosine deamination at preferred sequence motifs present in the HIV minus-strand DNA, giving rise to mutagenic uracils (C→T transition mutations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2003b</xref>). We excluded APOBEC-catalyzed cytidine deamination as a major source of viral uracils in infected MDMs using several criteria. First, Ex-Seq data showed that the uracils appeared on <italic>both</italic> strands of the viral cDNA rather than the (-) strand that is exclusively targeted by APOBECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). Second, the mutational spectrum of proviral DNA did not match the signature C/G→T/A hotspots for APOBEC cytosine deamination as determined using the program <italic>Hypermut</italic> 2.0 (see sequencing studies below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rose and Korber, 2000</xref>). Finally, we obtained direct evidence that viral uracils originated from the high dUTP/TTP ratio by increasing the intracellular TTP levels through the addition of 5 mM thymidine to the culture media. Addition of thymidine to the culture medium prior to infection led to a 14-fold decrease in the uracilation level of proviral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and a five-fold increase in proviral copies as compared to no thymidine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The combined results strongly support a mechanism where the viral uracils originate primarily from dUTP incorporation during reverse transcription. Since reverse transcriptase utilizes dUTP with the same efficiency and fidelity as TTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 2011</xref>), the uracils must be in the form of coding U/A base pairs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, we present immunoblots showing that MDMs express very low levels of A3G and A3A, which is consistent with previous reports and the absence of tell-tale marks of enzymatic deamination described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Liddament, 2004</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18447.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Uracils arise from high dUTP/TTP not APOBEC-catalyzed cytosine deamination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Culturing a mixed GFP+/GFP− MDM cell population with media supplemented with 5 mM thymidine resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the fraction of proviral copies that contained uracil.

First, the infected MDMs were sorted into GFP positive and negative populations at 1 day post-infection. The cells were then cultured at days 1, 7, 14, and 30 post-sorting where we measured proviral DNA copy number, the fraction of proviruses containing uracil, and the HIV p24 levels in the culture supernatants for each cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Both MDM populations showed high levels of viral <italic>gag</italic> DNA products at day 1 (red circle and blue square, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The GFP<sup>+</sup> population was characterized by efficient integration and a high proviral DNA copy number that remained stable for 14 days. By day 30, the copy number increased by ~four-fold, which we attribute to secondary infection by released viruses (white bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, the GFP<sup>−</sup> population had a low efficiency of integration exemplified by a 50-fold reduction in copy number between the early <italic>gag</italic> DNA products and proviruses (black bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Unlike the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, the proviral copy number in the GFP<sup>−</sup> population decreased by 20-fold between days 7 and 14 before returning to the day 7 level at 30 days. Once again, we attributed the later increase to secondary infection by released virus particles because it was not observed in single-round infections. We established that HIV<sup>NL4.3(VSVG)</sup>, HIV<sup>SF162(CCR5)</sup>, and HIV<sup>BAL(CCR5)</sup> viral strains and MDMs isolated from different donors behaved similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–E</xref>), and that the results were independent of whether differentiated MDMs were obtained using adherence, M-CSF or GM-CSF protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F–H</xref>).</p><p>The most striking difference between the two MDM populations was that the minor GFP<sup>+</sup> population had no detectable proviral uracils, while ~90% of the proviral copies in the major GFP<sup>−</sup> fraction contained uracil at day one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The fraction of proviral copies that were uracilated (Frac U) decreased from 0.77 to 0.23 between days 7 and 14 before rising to 0.55 at day 30 (presumably due to continuing infection). We explored the mechanistic basis for the differences in viral uracilation between the two MDM populations by measuring the dUTP/TTP ratio in the cell extracts obtained from each. The GFP<sup>+</sup> MDMs had a 20-fold lower dUTP/TTP ratio, which stemmed in part from a five-fold higher TTP concentration compared to the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs. This difference between the GFP+ and negative MDMs confirms the key mechanistic requirement for viral uracilation: a high dUTP/TTP ratio.</p><p>Consistent with their larger proviral copy numbers, the GFP<sup>+</sup> MDMs produced 100 to 1000 times more p24 than the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs and the levels were fairly constant over a 30 day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs showed a 10-fold decrease in p24 levels between day seven and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which coincides with the 20-fold reduction in proviral copy number in the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The expression of detectable levels of p24, but not GFP, in the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs suggests that truncated viral RNAs are being expressed that extend through the p24 coding sequence, but not GFP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CD14/CD16 status of MDMs does not correlate with GFP expression</title><p>We were quite surprised that the uracilation phenotype was restricted solely to MDMs that were incapable of expressing virally encoded GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and were curious whether the minor, but highly infectable GFP<sup>+</sup> MDM population might be derived from CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte precursors. Our reasoning is based on the reports that CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes are enriched in the CCR5 co-receptor and are the preferred target of HIV as compared to the more prevalent CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes which express lower levels of CCR5 and appreciable levels of the active low-molecular-weight forms of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellery et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes typically comprise around 10% of the monocyte pool in uninfected donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellery et al., 2007</xref>), which curiously matches the level of GFP<sup>+</sup> MDMs in our studies. Despite these suggestive relationships, multicolor flow cytometry established that the GFP fluorescence did not track with the CD14<sup>+</sup> or CD16<sup>+</sup> status of the MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Aside from the 20-fold higher dUTP levels in the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs (see above), we have no comprehensive understanding of what additional phenotypic differences exist between the two macrophage populations that result in the combined GFP<sup>−</sup>/uracilation phenotype. It is possible that the dominant GFP<sup>−</sup> phenotype arises from a complex combination of effects related to the metabolic state, or activation state of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Viral uracilation is modulated by hUNG2 activity</title><p>We previously established that hUNG2 activity was the primary determinant of whether uracilated proviral DNA survived or persisted in the HT29 model cell system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weil et al., 2013</xref>). To confirm this result in MDMs, we took advantage of three approaches: (i) knockdown of hUNG2 activity by transfection with a plasmid vector that overexpressed the potent uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (Ugi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 1993</xref>), (ii) overexpression of hUNG2 by transfection with a plasmid expression vector, and (iii) infections with viral constructs where virus protein R (Vpr) was deleted. Viral protein R is known to interact with hUNG2 and induce its degradation through the assembly with the DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase complex and would be expected to recapitulate the phenotype produced by Ugi overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eldin et al., 2014</xref>). We surmised that reduced hUNG2 levels would lead to greater infection efficiency, higher levels of uracil in viral DNA products, and that greater expression of hUNG2 would correlate with increased restriction and reduced uracil content in proviral DNA due to uracil excision by hUNG2. It is important to note that plasmid DNA transfection methodology is essential in these experiments because the introduction of Ugi and hUNG2 through lentiviral packaging and transfection would be compromised by uracilation during reverse transcription.</p><p>Primary macrophages derived from blood monocytes were cultured in the presence of M-CSF for 7 days prior to transfection with the pIRES-Ugi-eGFP and pIRES-hUNG2-eGFP expression plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Because MDMs are exceedingly difficult to transfect, the cells expressing eGFP were sorted by FACS 48 hr post-transfection and the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (indicating successful plasmid transfection; not expression of HIV-encoded GFP) were allowed to adhere for 24 hr and then spin-infected with HIV<sup>SF162(CCR5)</sup> virus.

The lower copies of genomic RNA produced from the uracilated proviruses in GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs is comparable to the reduced proviral copy number in this population. This result indicates that uracilation does not significantly alter the output of viral RNA genomes when normalized for proviral DNA levels.

(2013)</xref>]. Our key finding that MDMs consist of two distinct populations with respect to the uracilation phenotype likely explains why this potent restriction pathway has remained largely elusive.</p><p>The established elements of this pathway are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. Upon entry into the macrophage, reverse transcriptase (RT) encounters a nucleotide pool environment that favors the incorporation of dUTP into HIV DNA products predominantly in the form of U/A base pairs. The high ratio of dUTP/TTP is maintained, at least in part, by the low levels of dUTPase expression combined with the high expression levels of SAMHD1 in macrophages. Uracilation of the viral DNA can proceed to high levels in the cytoplasmic compartment because the UBER machinery is sequestered in the nucleus. However, when the heavily uracilated HIV DNA enters the nucleus it is attacked and fragmented by nuclear UBER enzymes. Fragmentation is initiated by hUNG2 uracil excision, and is likely followed by abasic site excision by human abasic site endonuclease (APE1 or APE2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schrader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stavnezer et al., 2014</xref>). We estimate, based on comparing the measured levels of early and proviral DNA levels in the GFP<sup>−</sup> MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), that ~99% of the viral DNA is destroyed before the integration step and further destruction at the proviral stage is observed over the next 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This pathway differs from original models of APOBEC3G-mediated virus restriction in that uracils are introduced on both DNA strands and they are not inherently mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Priet et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that lethal mutagenesis, functional genome variation, or faithful repair could result from host enzyme processing of uracilated proviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In non-dividing MDMs, we found that uracilated proviruses contained few mutations yet gave rise to mutated viral genomic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although it is tempting to attribute these mutations to RNAP II transcriptional errors as it encounters uracil on the template DNA strand, RNAP II shows high-fidelity incorporation of A opposite to U during in vitro transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Menendez-Arias, 2009</xref>. Moreover, many aspects of the mutation spectrum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> are not reconcilable with RNAP II incorporating incorrect bases opposite a template U (although the frequent A→G transitions may be explained by the potential of U to pair with A or G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuraoka, 2002</xref>). The actual error mechanism is likely to be much more complex given that transcription coupled repair is expected to generate abasic sites, strand breaks, and even gaps when densely spaced uracils are excised. In this regard, RNAP II is known to stall at isolated abasic sites during in vitro transcription and could also misincorporate various ribonucleotides at such sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The observation that proviral DNA is relatively mutation free, while the RNA is not, strongly suggests that repair intermediates generated during transcription by the host UBER pathway are most often repaired to restore the proviral coding sequence. Faithful repair could involve the reincorporation of U opposite to A due to the perturbed nucleotide pools, or the introduction of T. The observation that RNA mutations were increased upon stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine IFNγ, and nearly absent in the presence of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4, indicates that the transcriptional programs induced by these cytokines are highly relevant to the outcome; a further understanding of this complex problem is of considerable interest. Although errors introduced by IFNγ stimulation may frequently lead to non-functional viral genomes, they also allow the viral DNA sequence to evolve rapidly in the absence of reverse transcription. Replication-competent viruses that emerge would then undergo fitness selection in the host. These potential outcomes make UBER a double-edged sword with respect to propagation of viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Uracil as an epigenetic factor in macrophages</title><p>Uracil has never been considered an epigenetic base like 5-substituted cytosines because of its low abundance in genomes and because the detection of U/A base pairs is not possible with standard sequencing methods. Nevertheless, the densely incorporated uracils detected here have the potential to alter DNA structure and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2012</xref>), which could affect site recognition by transcription factors or other DNA binding proteins. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that uracil can exert significant effects on protein binding to DNA. These findings include (i) our previous report that multiple uracils silenced transcription from both HIV-1 LTR and CMV promoters in a cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weil et al., 2013</xref>), (ii) uracils within the origin of replication in HSV-1 perturb the binding of HSV-1 origin binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Focher et al., 1992</xref>), (iii) U/A pairs disrupt AP-1 transcription factor DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogstad et al., 2002</xref>), (iv) singly uracilated DNA disrupts RNase H splicing specificity during reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klarmann, 2003</xref>, (v) U/A pairs perturb maintenance of telomere length in B cells by disruption of sheltrin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vallabhaneni et al., 2015</xref>), and (vi) one or two U/A base pairs within the specific cleavage site of some restriction enzymes prevents DNA strand cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roberts et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, their residence, within tissues that have poor drug penetrance (lung, brain, gut) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cribbs et al., 2015</xref>), has led to an increased interest in their potential role in the establishment and persistence of HIV infection.</p><p>The detection of abundant viral uracils in monocytes isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals who showed full viral suppression from ART, in vivo The fairly short several day half-life of blood monocytes suggests that uracilated viral DNA detected in these cells arose from a recent infection, perhaps by passage of the monocyte through a tissue reservoir containing virus producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Such an infection pathway could involve a canonical CCR5-dependent viral entry mechanism or a recently described pathway involving phagocytosis of infected T cells by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter, 2014</xref>). However, the high efficiency of ART and the low levels of infected T cells using current treatment regimes make the phagocytosis pathway for monocyte infection seem less plausible for our aviremic patient samples. Finally, the requirement for dUTP incorporation during reverse transcription virtually excludes the possibility that the infected monocytes containing uracilated DNA arose from latently infected myeloid stem cells, because monocyte differentiation does not involve reverse transcription and genomic DNA replication does not involve accumulation of detectable uracils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>A further ramification of these data is that some uracilated proviruses may persist for the entire lifetime of a macrophage due to protection within highly compacted chromatin, which is highly resistant to UBER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2012</xref>). Under such circumstances, the potential time scale for uracil persistence could be years based on the findings that replication-competent viruses have been detected in brain microglial cells of patients even after years of viral suppression using ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rappaport and Volsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robillard et al., 2014</xref>).

Total genomic DNA was isolated using a QIamp DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Genomic DNA was first fragmented using the endonuclease BSAJ-1 (1 U) in Cutsmart buffer (NEB) for 1 hr at 60°C. Uracil containing DNA sequences were digested using 50 nM UNG in 1x TMNB+ buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 20 mM NaCl, 11 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.002% Brij-35).

Different primer/probe sets were designed to tile the HIV genome to report on heterogeneity of uracil incorporation. Amplification was performed with the following thermal program: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 44 cycles of: 95°C for 15 s and then 60°C for 1 min, followed by a final step of heating to 95°C for 10 min. The final high-temperature cycle cures the droplets. For each step, the ramp cycle time was decreased to 0.5°C/s. Amplification samples were transferred to a RainDance Sense instrument. Copy numbers of the human RNase P (<italic>RPP30</italic>) gene were measured in the same reaction mixture to determine cell number.

Ex-ddPCR data were analyzed using the RainDrop Analyst software package (RainDance Technologies). Drop-size gating was performed to remove drops of atypical size using a lower and upper size gate boundary for each PMT of 800 and 1150, respectively. Intact drops for each of the three clusters (one negative; quenched drops, and two positive; PMT1+ and PMT2+) were gated independently using the ellipse-gating tool.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Goff, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports a set of observations suggesting that in MDMs, where dNTPs are low and dUTP unusually high, dUs are incorporated in place of dTs, with a variety of effects. There is a major restriction, involving UBER, in levels of proviral DNAs that are formed (only 1% of normal levels get through the restriction); and second, there is a high level of mutation in the resulting RNAs that are formed from the U-containing but not mutated proviruses, for obscure reasons (presumably during forward transcription). This last point is intriguing if mysterious.</p><p>The authors indicate that they have discovered a &quot;new&quot; mechanism, but there is a 25 year old literature describing UBER involvement in this process, due to high concentrations of dUTP in the non-dividing cells and lack of dUTPase to control the dUTP pool levels. The authors cite their own works as defining these parameters and have totally ignored the original publications, primarily demonstrated in animal models including FIV, EIAV, visna and CaEV.</p><p>The authors also indicate that they have identified two separate populations of MDMs in their studies, one permissive and one restricted for HIV infection and that one population Is exclusive in resulting in high level uracilation of viral DNA. As it turns out, these two populations are defined by the artificial expression of GFP, a marker of transfection for the viral genome(s) introduced; i.e., the GFP+ population expressed 7x the level of virus and virus-encoded products relative to the GFP- (essentially low or non-transfected) cell population. The authors never really address the differences in these populations other than obvious susceptibility to transfection,virus expression and relative uracilation. It seems probable that the GFP+ cells were more susceptible to transfection due to higher metabolic rate, most likely due to some stage of activation not extant in the GFP- population. The higher dUTP:dTTP ratio and lower virus integration/production would be consistent with this interpretation. It is unclear the extent to which uracil misincorporation might contribute to this, but seems unlikely to be the primary factor in low virus integration/expression.</p><p>They should also at least speculate on what that artificial i.e., defined by their cloning marker, population of monocytes represents. It must relate to the metabolic state of those cells and/or state of activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We need to have a better review of the history and the literature.</p><p>We need more discussion of the possible explanations for the two populations of expressing and nonexpressing cells – including some potentially trivial ones, as noted by one of the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18447.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We need to have a better review of the history and the literature.</italic> </p><p>In response to a related editorial comment we now clarify our use of the word “new” with respect to this restriction pathway by modifying the final sentence of the abstract to read:</p><p>“These findings reveal new elements of a viral defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection.”</p><p>We included a comprehensive review of the literature in our previous PNAS publication that included references to 20 previous publications in this area (Weil, 2013). Due to space restrictions we elected to refer to our previous review in the Discussion of this manuscript (Second paragraph of Discussion section). However, we are pleased to re-introduce this interesting history in a more condensed form to provide the best context for the current work. We have now added a short section in the introduction, including ten additional references that better review the literature:</p><p>“A role for dUTP and the UBER enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (hUNG2) in HIV-1 infection have been long debated (see reference for a succinct review). […]These intriguing prior observations have motivated our further studies into the role of UBER in HIV infection, which now establish a profoundly restrictive role and unexpected effects on viral mutagenesis.”</p><p> <italic>We need more discussion of the possible explanations for the two populations of expressing and nonexpressing cells – including some potentially trivial ones, as noted by one of the reviewers.</italic></p><p>We are very interested in exploring the nature of these two populations. Thus, prior to the original submission we had performed multicolor flow cytometry experiments to explore whether the uracilation/GFP- phenotype was correlated with the CD14/CD16 activation status of the MDMs. We now include a description of these findings, which establish that the uracilation-status is not correlated with the polarization state of the MDMs (at least with respect to these markers). We are actively pursuing metabolic profiling of these cell types to further elucidate their differences. However, this extensive work is the basis for another independent manuscript.</p><p>We have added the following section”CD14/CD16 status of MDMs does not correlate with GFP expression” describing the data that allows us to eliminate these polarization states as markers for uracilation status. We also comment on the possibility of complex metabolic differences between the expressing and non-expressing cells:</p><p>“CD14/CD16 status of MDMs does not correlate with GFP expression. […] It is possible that the dominant GFP<sup>-</sup> phenotype arises from a complex combination of effects related to the metabolic state or state of activation of these cells.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
