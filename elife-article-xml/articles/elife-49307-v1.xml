organelles essential for cellular signaling and motility. Cilia dysfunctions cause life-threatening ciliopathies, many of which are due to defects in the transition zone (TZ), a complex structure of the ciliary base. Therefore, understanding TZ assembly, which relies on ordered interactions of multiprotein modules, is of critical importance. Here, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dzip1 and Fam92 form a functional module which constrains the conserved core TZ protein, Cep290, to the ciliary base. We identify cell type specific roles of this functional module in two different tissues. While it is required for TZ assembly in all <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated cells, it also regulates basal-body growth and docking to the plasma membrane during spermatogenesis. We therefore demonstrate a novel regulatory role for Dzip1 and Fam92 in mediating membrane/basal-body interactions and show that these interactions exhibit cell type specific functions in basal-body maturation and TZ organization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animal cells have hair-like structures called cilia on their surface, which help them to sense and interact with their surroundings. The cilia are supported by protein filaments and must assemble correctly because faulty cilia can lead to several life-threatening diseases. Problems in an area at the base of the cilia, known as the ‘transition zone’, account for the most severe forms of these diseases in humans.</p><p>The transition zone is responsible for selecting which proteins are allowed in and out of the cilia. The transition zone itself is made up of many proteins that work together to determine the cilia composition. But not all of these proteins are known, and it is unclear how those that are known affect cilia structure.</p><p>One protein found in transition zones of several animals, including fruit flies and mice, is called Cby. Lapart et al. set out to understand which other proteins interact with Cby in fruit flies to better understand what this protein does in the transition zone. A series of experiments showed that Cby interacts with two proteins called Dzip1 and Fam92 to regulate the assembly of transition zones. Together these three proteins constrain a core component of the transition zone, a fourth protein called Cep290, to the base of the cilia.</p><p>Fruit flies only have cilia on cells in their sensory organs and testes and, in both types of tissue, cilia could only form properly when Dzip1 and Fam92 were present. Lapart et al. also showed that, in the fruit fly testes, Dzip1 and Fam92 helped to anchor the newly forming cilia to the cell surface. This anchoring role was particularly important for the fruit flies’ sperm to grow their characteristic whip-like tails, which are a specialized type of cilia that allow sperm cells to move.</p><p>Overall, the findings show how some transition zone proteins work together and that they can have different effects in different tissues. Understanding the mechanisms behind healthy cilia assembly will likely be key to tackling cilia-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>basal body</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DIVERCIL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lapart</surname><given-names>Jean-André</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortier</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Duteyrat</surname><given-names>Jean-Luc</given-names></name><name><surname>Augière</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name><name><surname>Jerber</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Joëlle</given-names></name><name><surname>Durand</surname><given-names>Bénédicte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM DEQ20131029168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lapart</surname><given-names>Jean-André</given-names></name><name><surname>Cortier</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Duteyrat</surname><given-names>Jean-Luc</given-names></name><name><surname>Augière</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name><name><surname>Jerber</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Joëlle</given-names></name><name><surname>Durand</surname><given-names>Bénédicte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006687</institution-id><institution>Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Augière</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analyses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> establish the functional hierarchy of the ciliary transition zone module, Dzip1/Fam92/Cby, and reveal tissue specific variations in basal body anchoring pathways in fly ciliated tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia and flagella are highly conserved organelles present at the surface of eukaryotic cells. They play major physiological roles in animals such as cell or fluid mobility, signaling during development and cellular homeostasis. The importance of cilia and flagella is highlighted by the discovery of human diseases, classified as ciliopathies, that are associated with defects in cilia structure and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Beales, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>). Cilia and flagella are templated from the basal body, derived from the mother centriole, from which the microtubule based axoneme is assembled.</p><p>At the base of the cilium, a specific compartment, the transition zone (TZ) plays a critical role in cilium assembly and function. Many genes responsible for cilia associated diseases such as the Meckel syndrome (MKS), Joubert syndrome or nephronophthisis (NPHP) are caused by defects in proteins of the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Czarnecki and Shah, 2012</xref>). The TZ functions as a ciliary gate by sorting selected components in and out of the cilium, thus controlling the specific composition of the ciliary compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia and Reiter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves and Pelletier, 2017</xref>). TZ assembly starts during the first steps of cilia formation, when the mother centriole associates with cytoplasmic vesicles before docking to the plasma membrane. Assembly of TZ proteins is spatiotemporally controlled and requires, in most organisms, at least three different protein modules namely MKS, NPHP and CEP290. Extensive genetic, biochemical studies and super resolution microscopy analysis helped to establish a hierarchy of these components and a structural view of the TZ architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chih et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia and Reiter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves and Pelletier, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although largely conserved from worms to mammals, all TZ proteins are not conserved in all ciliated species and variations exist between model organisms. For example, the NPHP module, present in mammals, worms and protozoa, is not conserved in flies, whereas CEP290 and several members of the MKS module are conserved in most organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pratt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieillard et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the core TZ components, several others have been identified but their precise relationships with the core known TZ components are not understood. Among these other proteins, Chibby (Cby), a conserved TZ component in vertebrates and flies, is required for cilia function both in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voronina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enjolras et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieillard et al., 2016</xref>). In vertebrates, CBY has been shown to interact with several basal body (BB) associated proteins, such as ODF2 or CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steere et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) and more recently DZIP1L, DZIP1 and FAM92a or b proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breslow et al., 2017</xref>). However, the functional integration of CBY and these interactors in TZ assembly is unclear and some of those, such as Cep164 cannot likely sustain Cby function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as Cep164 does not seem to be expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes (Flybase).</p><p>We show here that the unique <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs Dzip1 (CG13617) and Fam92 (CG6405) of respectively, vertebrate DZIP1 or DZIP1L and FAM92a or b, interact and cooperate with Cby in flies. We demonstrate that all three proteins form a strictly ordered functional module, and cooperate in building the TZ in the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated tissues, with Dzip1 acting upstream of Fam92 and Cby. While our observations establish that Dzip1 and Fam92 localization at the TZ relies on Cep290, they reveal that Dzip1 and Fam92 exert a negative regulatory feedback loop by restraining Cep290 localization to the ciliary base.</p><p>Last, our work reveals remarkable differences in the role of Dzip1 and Fam92 in regulating basal bodies (BB) docking between the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated tissues. Whereas, loss of Dzip1 or Fam92 does not affect basal body docking in sensory cilia, it impairs BB-membrane growth and attachment in spermatocytes. As a consequence, we observed aberrant and premature elongation of the axoneme before completion of meiosis, highlighting a primary role of the BB-membrane associated compartment for regulating axonemal microtubule elongation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes. These aberrant elongations mostly affect the daughter centrioles, revealing functional differences of the mother and daughter centrioles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dzip1/Fam92/Cby form a complex at the ciliary transition zone in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>We initially identified mouse CBY1 interactors by LAP-Tag affinity purification using IMCD3 cells (murine Inner Medullary Collecting Duct cells) stably expressing CBY1 fused to the EGFP-TEV-S peptide tag (see Materials and methods section). This EGFP-TEV-S tag in N-terminus allows to detect the protein in cells and its purification by a two-step affinity procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torres et al., 2009</xref>). Analysis of LAP-CBY1 complex revealed the presence of DZIP1 and FAM92 among 22 identified proteins (see full list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), in agreement with recently published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>DZIP1/1L</italic> and <italic>FAM92a/b</italic> each show a unique ortholog gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>CG13617</italic> and <italic>CG6405</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but are absent, like <italic>CBY1</italic>, from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Hereafter, we name <italic>CG13617</italic> and <italic>CG6405</italic> as <italic>Dzip1</italic> and <italic>Fam92,</italic> respectively. By co-immunoprecipitating Cby-GFP and HA-Dzip1 or HA-Fam92, we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dzip1 and Fam92, each interact with Cby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Dzip1 or Fam92 do not apparently interact with each other in these co-IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, when all three proteins are expressed together, immunoprecipitation of GFP-Dzip1 pulls down both Cby and Fam92, suggesting that all three proteins are present in one complex when co-expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To identify the subcellular localization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dzip1 and Fam92, we generated transgenic flies expressing Dzip1-GFP or Fam92-GFP under the control of their respective promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We determined that both <italic>dzip1</italic> and <italic>fam92</italic> are exclusively expressed in the two kinds of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated cell types, namely type I sensory neurons and male germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Type I sensory neurons comprise chordotonal (Ch) and external sensory (ES) neurons, which harbor motile and immotile cilia respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gogendeau and Basto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jana et al., 2016</xref>).

Dzip1 and Fam92 decorate the base of the cilia at the tip of the sensory dendrites (labeled with 22C10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrows). By performing, super-resolution 3D structured-illumination microscopy (3D-SIM), we confirmed that Dzip1 and Fam92 co-localize with Cby in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating their restricted localization at the ciliary transition zone.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Dzip1 and Fam92 are expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and locate at the ciliary transition zone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the two types of sensory organs (or scolopidia) present in the antennae of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head. Chordotonal scolopidia are proprioceptors present in the second antennal segment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head and respond to sound vibrations and gravity.

During spermatocyte maturation, centrioles convert to BB and dock to the plasma membrane while extending a primary like cilium which is entirely decorated with TZ proteins (green and red). In late spermatocytes, the TZ, also described as the primary like cilium, reaches approximatively 500 nm and protrudes at the cell surface. During meiosis, BB with primary like cilia/TZ are internalized, thus retaining the ciliary membrane (yellow) connected to the plasma membrane, hence creating a membrane cap in spermatids. In round spermatid, BB are apposed to the nuclear membrane and the ciliary cap (yellow) connected to the plasma membrane is extended. The ring centriole (green) marks the base of the ciliary cap which is decorated by TZ proteins. At the onset of axoneme elongation, axonemal microtubule nucleation inside the cap extends the ciliary cap/TZ, and as the axoneme grows (black), the ring centriole is pushed away from the basal body.

Strikingly, it also reveals tissue specific function of these proteins in priming basal body/membrane docking in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes. This reveals intrinsic differences in the mechanisms that link basal body to membranes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated tissues. In mammals, basal body docking requires transition fibers built from the distal appendages on the mother centriole prior to docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, distal appendages have not been observed on centrioles, but structures similar to transition fibers are described at the base of sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Jarman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieillard et al., 2016</xref>), whereas only scarce links could be observed in male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottardo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roque et al., 2018</xref>). These differences could explain why destabilization of the TZ leads to basal body anchoring defects in spermatocytes, but not in sensory neurons. This structural characteristic of the spermatocyte TZ is likely to be related to its specific functional properties. Indeed, whereas the TZ is stably built at the ciliary base in sensory neurons, it shows a dynamic behavior during sperm flagella extension, separating from the basal body and migrating along the growing end of the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basiri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, in spermatocytes, basal bodies have a dynamic behavior, being first docked at the plasma membrane and next internalized during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pasmans and Tates, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabian and Brill, 2012</xref>). This could induce mechanical constraints on basal bodies that would increase their sensitivity to TZ disruption. In agreement with this hypothesis, when TZ maturation was challenged by modulating membrane phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>), BB were released from the plasma membrane during meiosis, but their initial docking was not impaired. However, we observed by EM, that BB fail to initially dock in significant occurrences (8 among 13) in <italic>dzip1<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>fam92<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant spermatocytes, indicating that Dzip1 and Fam92 are at least involved in the initial steps of BB docking. Previous observations of another strong hypomorphic <italic>cep290<sup>mecH</sup></italic> allele showed docked basal bodies in spermatocytes and spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basiri et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>cep290<sup>0153-G4</sup></italic> mutant, we did not quantify the number of docked versus undocked basal bodies in spermatocytes, but we observed up to 76% of aberrant axonemal growth, suggesting that basal body to membrane attachment is compromised in this mutant.</p><p>Differences in the organization of the ciliary base associated with variations in the distribution and function of several centriolar and TZ proteins have been documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jana et al., 2018</xref>). However, none of these identified differences help to explain the behavioral properties of BB docking and TZ dynamics that we have identified in the two ciliated <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. Hence, additional screens for specific factors of basal-body docking or TZ assembly either in sensory neurons or male germ cells need to be designed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mother and daughter centriole asymmetry in ciliogenesis</title><p>In all our observations, there is a striking phenotypic difference between the mother and daughter centrioles in spermatocytes. In all mutants examined (i.e. <italic>dzip1, fam92</italic> and <italic>cby</italic>) we observed a more penetrant defect on the daughter centriole than the mother. Thus, although the 2 centrioles of each pair are able to form cilia, the daughter centriole appears more sensitive to transition zone perturbations. We do not have molecular explanations for these intrinsic differences of mother and daughter centrioles in spermatocytes. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons, centrobin plays a critical role in maintaining the daughter centriole fate, precluding its capacity to build a cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gottardo et al., 2015</xref>). In sperm cells, centrobin is required for the formation of the C tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reina et al., 2018</xref>), which also plays a critical role in TZ assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottardo et al., 2018</xref>). However, in spermatocytes centrobin is equally distributed at the base of both the mother and daughter centrioles and does not show a functional asymmetry. Recently, a transient microtubule based structure that anchors the base of the mother centriole on one of the centriole pair at the onset of meiosis was identified, but its function is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riparbelli et al., 2018</xref>). This structure could stabilize the mother centriole and favor its attachment to the membrane, but the function of this microtubule rootlet in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes needs further investigations. The intrinsic difference of the mother versus daughter centrioles could also be related to the timing of centriole docking during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottardo et al., 2018</xref>), where the mother centriole was shown to dock first. This timing difference would be sufficient to better stabilize the TZ of the mother centriole, and hence explain the phenotypic differences observed in our study. There are other situations in the animal kingdom were both mother and daughter centrioles build a cilium. Among the best studied are the bi-flagellated <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and the peculiar case of multiple ciliated epithelia, where numerous de novo centrioles are assembled just at the onset of ciliogenesis. Interestingly, in mammals, CBY1 was shown to play a critical role in multiple ciliated cells to allow proper docking of the multiple basal bodies to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the increased susceptibility of multiple ciliated cells to CBY1 loss, is related to a particular status of these de novo centrioles, as we observed for daughter centrioles in male germ cells. More work will be needed to understand the molecular determinants of the mother versus daughter centriolar functional asymmetry in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Specific regulatory role of the ciliary cap in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germ cells</title><p>We observed that defects of TZ assembly and/or basal body docking lead to aberrant elongation of axonemal microtubules as revealed by the specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> axonemal marker CG6652-GFP. These abnormal elongation defects appear only in late G2 phase, just at the onset of meiosis, indicating that specific signals, yet to be identified, enable centrioles to start axonemal elongation at the onset of meiosis. The membrane cap restricts this capacity by inhibiting axonemal growth until the round spermatid stage, where a second signal turns on axonemal elongation and TZ migration. Among the candidate proteins recruited by the membrane cap which may coordinate axonemal assembly are microtubule depolymerizing kinesins as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieillard et al., 2016</xref>). This membrane cap could also be involved in stabilizing centriolar capping proteins such as CP110 or CEP97, which in mammals need to be removed from centrioles to allow ciliary assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>).

Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS1X and purification was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nachury, 2008</xref>). Briefly, cells were collected by scraping and resuspended in 11 ml lysis buffer containing HEPES pH7.5 50 mM, EGTA pH8 1 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, KCl 300 mM, Glycerol 10%, NP-40 0.31% and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). CBY1-complexes were purified using GFP-TRAP (Chromotek). S-Tag-CBY1 was cleaved off GFP beads by TEV cleavage and the eluate was further purified on S-protein agarose (Merck) and eluted in 100 μl 2X Laemmli Sample Buffer.</p><p>For protein identiﬁcation, samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie and cut into four slices. Each gel slice was washed, reduced with 10 mM DTT, alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion overnight (Trypsin Protease, MS Grade Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The extracted tryptic peptides were cleaned up using OMIX C18 100 µl pipette tips (Agilent), and lyophilized before being reconstituted for the LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>The peptides were separated using an Eksigent Ultra nano-LC HPLC system coupled with an AB Sciex Triple TOF 5600 mass spectrometer. The LC separations were performed using a Discovery Bio Wide Pore HPLC column (C18, 3 µm, 100 × 5 mm). The mobile phases used were 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient elution steps were performed with a flow rate of 5 µl/min as follows: 0–40% B for 106 min, 40–80% for 5 min, and then 80% B for an additional 5 min. All data were acquired using Analyst software (AB Sciex) in the data dependent mode. Peptide profiling was performed using a mass range of 350–1600 Da, followed by a MS/MS product ion scan from 100 to 1500 Da. For each survey MS1 scan (accumulation time of 250 msec), MS/MS spectra (accumulation time of 75 msec per MS/MS) were obtained for the 30 most abundant precursor ions. The protein identification was performed with the ProteinPilot Software 5.0 (AB Sciex). The MS/MS spectra obtained were searched against the mouse UniProt Proteome database (release 2015_09 with 46470 proteins). The search parameters for tryptic cleavage and accuracy are built-in functions of the software. The other data analysis parameters were as follows: sample type: identification; Cys-alkylation: Iodoacetamide; Digestion: Trypsin; Instrument: TripleTOF 5600; Special factor: gel based ID, and biological modifications; Species: <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>; Search effort: Thorough ID.

Some slides were imaged using an SP5X confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Biosystems) equipped with the Application Suite software (Leica Biosystems). An HCX Plan-Apochromat CS 63 × 1.4 NA objective (Leica Biosystems) was used for all acquisitions.</p><p>All images were processed with ImageJ. Figures were created with Adobe photoshop.

The % of flies that reached each quarter of the tube was counted after 30 s. three different batchs were quantified for each genotype.</p><p>Quantifications of mother versus daughter centrioles were based on the principle that the daughter centriole, being nucleated from the mother centriole, is orthogonally positioned on the lateral wall of the mother centriole. Quantifications of TZ protein intensities was performed using ImageJ and by measuring the sum of pixel intensity in a defined region encompassing the centrioles. Background intensity was measured by measuring the sum of pixel intensity in an area close to and devoid of centrioles and then subtracted to TZ protein intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results of fluorescence intensity quantifications are represented as scatter plots with the mean and SD on all figures.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>I have left the original reviews below. But as you will note, the majority of the comments ask you to please revise the text so that the conclusions more accurately reflect the data and to avoid over-interpretation. Additional comments require re-analysis of the data and presentation of additional images. However, in the post-review discussion, all reviewers concur that as currently presented, there is insufficient experimental proof that Dzip1/Fam92/Cby are in a 'biochemical module', and ask that you perform additional experiments to support this statement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The ciliary transition zone (TZ) is crucial for ciliogenesis, and mutations in genes encoding TZ proteins lead to ciliopathies. Two pairs of recently discovered ciliary TZ proteins in mammalian cells are DZIP1/1L and FAM92A/B, both of which interact with the previously identified TZ protein CBY1. In previous studies, these proteins were shown to have roles in ciliogenesis and hedgehog signaling. However, their specific functions in these processes and their relationship to each other are poorly understood.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors provide the first analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs of these proteins, Dzip1 and Fam92. In both chordotonal (Ch) neurons and developing male germ cells, these proteins are needed to restrict localization of the TZ protein Cep290 to the TZ at the base of the cilium. However, Dzip1 and Fam92 otherwise play distinct roles in the two types of ciliated cells. In Ch neurons, they are needed for normal ciliogenesis, with <italic>dzip1</italic> mutants lacking cilia entirely and fam92 mutants having reduced numbers of cilia. Basal bodies (BB) are still associated with the tips of dendrites in these cells. However, Dzip1 and Fam92 are needed for docking of BB at the plasma membrane in primary spermatocytes. Interestingly, in <italic>dzip1</italic> and <italic>fam92</italic> mutants, docking of daughter centrioles is affected more severely than docking of mother centrioles, and the undocked centrioles form elongated cytoplasmic structures marked by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lebercilin ortholog CG6652. Electron micrographs are consistent with the idea that Dzip1 and Fam92 are needed for formation of a cap that prevents this aberrant elongation. In addition, the authors demonstrate that 1) Cep290 acts upstream to ensure proper localization of Dzip1 and Fam92, 2) Dzip1 itself is needed for robust localization of Cby, Fam92 and the Meckel Syndrome protein Mks1, and 3) Cby and Fam92 are reciprocally required for each other's localization at the TZ.</p><p>Overall, the authors' results nicely lay out the cell type-specific requirements, localization and regulatory interactions of this group of TZ proteins. However, there are several caveats to the authors' claims that will need to be resolved before the manuscript is suitable for publication.</p><p>1) The authors claim &quot;that Dzip1/Fam92/Cby form a biochemical module at the ciliary transition zone&quot;, and that they &quot;all interact to form a biochemical complex&quot;. However, their biochemical data are limited to showing coIPs between Cby and Fam92 or Cby and Dzip1, but not between Fam92 and Dzip1. To support their conclusions, Fam92 and Dzip1 should be tested for their ability to coIP. Even if they do not coIP when co-expressed, they might form a tripartite complex with Cby, an idea that could be tested by co-expressing all three proteins and pulling on them sequentially, using different antibodies, to determine whether they interact indirectly as part of a multiprotein complex containing Cby.</p><p>2) It is unclear why the authors refer to CG6652-GFP as an axonemal marker (subsection “Dzip1 and Fam92 cap the basal body and facilitate its docking to the plasma membrane in spermatocytes”, first paragraph). In wild-type spermatocytes, CG6652-GFP is restricted to the distal tips of the BB, whereas in fam92, <italic>dzip1</italic> and <italic>cep290</italic> mutants, CG6652-GFP localizes to an extended structure that could either be an axoneme or an elongated TZ. I could not find evidence that CG6652-GFP localizes to axonemes in differentiating spermatids, either in the current manuscript or in the authors' previously published paper (Vieillard et al., 2016). A supplementary micrograph illustrating CG6652-GFP localization in whole-mount wild-type testes would be informative in this regard.</p><p>3) Given the authors' observation that BB are defective in docking in 8/13 Dzip1 and Fam92 mutant spermatocytes (subsection “Tissue specific functional properties of the TZ proteins in BB docking”, first paragraph) and their conclusion &quot;that Dzip1 and Fam92 are at least involved in the initial steps of BB docking&quot;, it seems contradictory to claim that Dzip1 and Fam92 are involved in &quot;maintaining basal body/membrane docking in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes&quot;. The latter statement should be reworded to make clear that Dzip1 and Fam92 are needed for docking to initiate/occur (rather than be maintained).</p><p>4) Based on the data provided, it seems unclear whether &quot;Dzip1 and Fam92 form a functional module which caps centrioles&quot; or if their role in this process is indirect. It would be necessary to perform immuno-EM to determine if these proteins are physically associated with the centriolar cap. Alternatively, the authors should soften their conclusion regarding the function of Dzip1 and Fam92 in this process.</p><p>5) Supplementary file 1 and 2 are missing, so it is not possible evaluate the CBY1-associated proteins identified by mass spectrometry (subsection “Dzip1/Fam92/Cby form a complex module at the ciliary transition zone in <italic>Drosophila</italic>”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper that requires some modification to remove several statements that over-interpret the data.</p><p>The authors show by that Cby, Dzip1 and Fam82 co-IP and from this claim the proteins form a biochemical complex. However, there is no evidence presented showing how these proteins might physically interact – if indeed they do physically interact. The authors go on to say that the three proteins perfectly co-localise – referring to Figure 1C. This reader is not able to see this perfect co-localisation. Thus, the conclusion reached at the end of this sections – that &quot;Dzip1, Fam82 and Cby form a biochemical module&quot; has not been demonstrated.</p><p>The difference in the strength of the mutant phenotypes for the <italic>dzip1</italic> and fam82 also seems to make the notion that their gene products form a biochemical entity appear unlikely. The authors report that a hypomorphic allele of <italic>dzip1</italic> has a strong uncoordinated phenotype whereas what appears to be a null allele of <italic>fam92</italic> exhibits a weaker phenotype. It is difficult to relate these phenotypes to any biochemical module. Reflecting the severity of the phenotype, <italic>dzip1</italic> mutants lack neurosensory cilia whereas fam82 flies could have with zero or one cilium in the scolopidia. This is a curious phenotype that perhaps suggests some mother – daughter difference in one of the cell generations leading to the mature scolopidium.</p><p>The authors then present convincing evidence that Dzip1 is needed to recruit both Cby and Fam92… and that Fam82 is required to recruit Cby but not Dzip1. They also see that in the absence of Dzip1, the domain of Cep290 staining is expanded. As this reader understands the text (clarification required), there &quot;a few&quot; (please define) examples of expanded Cep 290. Finally, in a strong Cep290 mutants both Dzip1 and Fam92 are reduced. This is interpreted to mean that Cep290 is required to recruit Dzip1 and Fam92 and these feed back to regulate localisation of Cep290.</p><p>Finally, the authors examine mutant defects in spermatocytes. My reading of this – although the text could be clarified – is that in both <italic>fam92</italic> and <italic>dzip1</italic> mutants, many centriole pairs show axonemal extensions from just one of the two centrioles. This is a particular interesting part of the phenotype that could be further characterised – or at least discussed in relation to the potential mother-daughter differences seen in the sensory cilia.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Lapart et al. identifies Dzip1 and Fam92 as Chibby (Cby) interactors and convincingly show that Dzip1 and Fam92 localize and function at the transition zone and basal body is essential for ciliogenesis. In spermatocytes, authors make the exciting and novel discovery that <italic>fam92</italic> and <italic>dzip1</italic> mutants display an asymmetric phenotypic difference between mother and daughter centriole, with the daughter being more sensitive to TZ perturbation. This manuscript is supported by strong data, high quality imaging, and eloquently writing and will appeal to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic> who are interested in cilia, cell biology, germ cells, and human genetic diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49307.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall, the authors' results nicely lay out the cell type-specific requirements, localization and regulatory interactions of this group of TZ proteins.
