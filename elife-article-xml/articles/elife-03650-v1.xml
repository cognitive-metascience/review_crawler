formation, a prevalent adaptation strategy in response to changing environments. In <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, this process is regulated by the Lap system and the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. High cytoplasmic levels of cyclic-di-GMP activate the transmembrane receptor LapD that in turn recruits the periplasmic protease LapG, preventing it from cleaving a cell surface-bound adhesin, thereby promoting cell adhesion. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis of LapG regulation by LapD and reveal a remarkably sensitive switching mechanism that is controlled by LapD's HAMP domain. LapD appears to act as a coincidence detector, whereby a weak interaction of LapG with LapD transmits a transient outside-in signal that is reinforced only when cyclic-di-GMP levels increase. Given the conservation of key elements of this receptor system in many bacterial species, the results are broadly relevant for cyclic-di-GMP- and HAMP domain-regulated transmembrane signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03650.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03650.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>While bacteria often live as unicellular microorganisms, many bacteria are capable of sticking together on a surface and forming a multicellular structure called a biofilm. Bacterial biofilms occur frequently in nature; for example, on the roots of plants and submerged rocks. While these biofilms are generally innocuous, others pose significant health threats to humans, causing tooth decay, gum disease, and—when they occur on implanted devices such as prosthetic heart valves—potentially serious infections. When in biofilms, many bacteria are tolerant to antibiotics; therefore, working out how to disrupt these films is crucial for developing new treatments.</p><p>The microorganism <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> is an example of a bacterium that can be found living in a complex biofilm. In response to certain environmental cues, free-swimming <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> cells adhere to a surface and produce a slime that encases them in a robust biofilm. The decision to shift between a free-swimming and a biofilm life-style is orchestrated by a signaling molecule found inside the bacteria called cyclic-di-GMP. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic>, the availability of nutrients—in particular, phosphate—controls how much cyclic-di-GMP is produced inside the cell. If not enough phosphate is available, the level of cyclic-di-GMP falls and the biofilm disperses.</p><p>Cyclic-di-GMP affects the stability of the biofilm via a group of proteins called the Lap system. When levels of cyclic-di-GMP are high, cyclic-di-GMP binds to a protein called LapD, which can then in turn bind to an enzyme known as LapG. When bound to LapD, LapG is unable to break apart the molecules that help <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> cells bind to a surface, and so a biofilm can form. If cyclic-di-GMP levels drop, fewer LapD molecules can bind to cyclic-di-GMP. As cyclic-di-GMP-unbound LapD proteins interact poorly with LapG, this leaves some LapG molecules able to destabilize the attachments between the cells and the surface, which disperses the biofilm.</p><p>Here, Chatterjee et al. reveal the molecular mechanism by which LapD and LapG interact in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. When cyclic-di-GMP is bound to LapD, the shape of LapD changes to produce features that fit into the surface of LapG. It is this shape compatibility, more so than an increase in the number or quality of interactions between the chemical groups that make up the proteins, that enables LapD to bind to LapG. Chatterjee et al. also provide evidence that the LapD–LapG interaction can be disrupted, thereby raising the possibility that biofilm formation could be manipulated by targeting this system.</p><p>Given that systems similar to the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> Lap system exist in numerous other bacterial species, including important pathogens, the findings of Chatterjee et al. could assist efforts to develop medicines and products that eradicate bacterial biofilms. LapD also shares many structural elements with a large number of other signaling proteins; therefore, these findings could also improve the understanding of how other cell signaling systems work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03650.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03650.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>biofilm formation</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>c-di-GMP</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>transmembrane protein</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1332208 (CHESS)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-103485 (MacCHESS)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI097307</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Toole</surname><given-names>George A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-GM108440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooley</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM08704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boyd</surname><given-names>Chelsea D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB9984521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Toole</surname><given-names>George A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sondermann</surname><given-names>Holger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure-function analyses reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of inside-out transmembrane signaling that controls periplasmic proteolysis, and thereby biofilm formation, in bacteria and may be relevant in the context of other signaling proteins with similar control elements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biofilms are complex agglomerations of sessile, microbial cells surrounded in a self-secreted extracellular matrix that is composed primarily of exopolysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>). These communities are prevalent in natural as well as industrial and hospital settings and can form on a wide range of biotic and abiotic surfaces. Biofilm-forming pathogenic bacteria have been associated with numerous persistent and nosocomial infections in humans, such as infection of the ear or urinary tract or colonizing the lungs of patients suffering from cystic fibriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsek and Singh, 2003</xref>). Because bacteria in biofilms can withstand antibiotic treatment, many clinically relevant antibiotics are ineffective in the treatment of biofilm-related bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mah and O'Toole, 2001</xref>). Such antibiotic tolerance is a matter of concern especially in the context of the increasing number of multi-drug resistant strains and a rather slow rate of discovery of new antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spellberg et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, it is crucial to understand the molecular basis of biofilm formation, maintenance, and dispersal in order to identify novel targets that could potentially be used for disrupting these bacterial aggregates.</p><p>The decision to transition between a planktonic and a biofilm life-style is orchestrated by the near ubiquitous bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a dinucleotide known to modulate many different aspects of bacterial physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ross et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hengge, 2009</xref>). The dinucleotide is synthesized from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) containing a GGDEF domain, and hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with either an EAL or a HD-GYP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simm et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schirmer and Jenal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krasteva et al., 2012</xref>). Often these juxtaposing domains appear together in the same polypeptide chain, and in a particular subset, as part of enzymatically inactive multi-domain proteins providing them with the ability to sense and respond to changing levels of intracellular c-di-GMP. In <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, biofilm formation is dependent on such a signaling protein, referred to as LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinsa and O'Toole, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newell et al., 2009</xref>). This transmembrane receptor contains a cytoplasmic GGDEF–EAL domain module that lacks enzymatic activity, though the EAL domain has retained its capacity to bind c-di-GMP.</p><p>Cytosolic c-di-GMP levels in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> are regulated in response to nutrient availability, specifically the amount of inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monds et al., 2007</xref>). Limiting phosphate increases the expression of a PDE, which lowers intracellular c-di-GMP levels, ultimately resulting in the dispersion of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> biofilms. Conversely, when environmental phosphate levels are high, multiple DGCs contribute to high intracellular c-di-GMP levels, resulting in stable cell attachment and subsequently biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newell et al., 2011b</xref>). LapD is a c-di-GMP receptor that translates changes in the concentration of this cytosolic second messenger into cell-surface events via an inside-out signaling mechanism that ultimately controls cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newell et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, c-di-GMP-bound LapD engages the periplasmic protease LapG through its Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)-like domain, preventing it from cleaving the cell surface-bound large adhesin LapA, a protein mediating cell adhesion to multiple substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Kirat-Chatel et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, c-di-GMP-unbound LapD adopts an autoinhibited conformation and loses its affinity for LapG. LapG in turn accesses and cleaves LapA's N-terminus, releasing the bulk of the adhesin from the cell surface and destabilizing cell attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyd et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, LapD acts as the central hub in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> that converts environmental cues into the formation of or dispersal from biofilms.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The LapD signaling system and structures of the LapD periplasmic domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of LapD-mediated signaling. The primary structure and domain organization of the LapD receptor is shown (top panel). The cartoon (bottom panel) summarizes the current model of LapD-mediated regulation of biofilm formation in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> by the differential recruitment of the periplasmic protease LapG in response to exogenous inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) availability (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyd and O'Toole, 2012</xref>). Low bioavailability of P<sub>i</sub> induces the expression of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) via the Pho system, which results in low intra-cellular concentrations of c-di-GMP and LapD adopting an autoinhibited state. Auto-inhibited LapD cannot sequester the periplasmic protease LapG, allowing the LapG enzyme to cleave the cell-surface adhesin LapA, releasing it from the cell surface. Conversely, when environmental P<sub>i</sub> is present in sufficient concentration, a subset of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) produce intra-cellular c-di-GMP to levels sufficient for binding to the EAL domain of LapD, thus activating this receptor. Activated LapD binds to and sequesters LapG in the periplasm, which promotes biofilm formation by preventing cleavage of LapA.

Previous work from our groups has begun to establish some of these intrinsic regulatory principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>). The PAS-like periplasmic domain of LapD that engages LapG is flanked by two putative transmembrane helices, the second of which connects to an intracellular, juxatamembrane HAMP domain followed by the aforementioned GGDEF-EAL domain module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). HAMP domains have been extensively studied in several other systems, as this domain is a crucial signal relay module in a large number of diverse proteins, not only in bacteria but also in archaea and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galperin et al., 2001</xref>). These domains are known to be a homodimeric assembly adopting a parallel four-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferris et al., 2011</xref>), although the exact mechanism by which conformational changes are propagated through a signaling protein via HAMP domains remains a topic of great interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swain and Falke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames et al., 2014</xref>). In LapD, the HAMP domain couples to the GGDEF-EAL domain module via a common extension of HAMP domains, the so-called signaling or S helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anantharaman et al., 2006</xref>). Our previous structure-function analyses revealed that the S helix docks onto the lateral surface of the EAL domain and positions the GGDEF domain above the c-di-GMP binding site at the EAL domain, preventing dinucleotide binding, and hence stabilizing the autoinhibited state. Conversely, c-di-GMP binding to the EAL domain is mutually exclusive with this autoinhibited conformation, disrupting inhibitory interactions, leading to an activation of LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>). Through a poorly understood process, these conformational changes in the GGDEF-EAL domain module are sensed by the HAMP domain, which then propagates the signal to the periplasmic domain of LapD, ultimately resulting in a change in affinity for LapG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>The elucidation of a complete functional circuit from nutritional input to the output machinery, and many of the underlying molecular principles, makes the Lap system one of the best-understood c-di-GMP signaling systems to date, and a potent model system to study mechanistic questions. In addition, considering the prevalence of the intracellular HAMP-GGDEF-EAL module (currently 1296 annotated genes in Pfam) and extracellular PAS-like output domain in LapD-like c-di-GMP receptors, as well as in active enzymes for environmental sensing, the mechanism underlying LapD function will be broadly relevant for understanding bacterial transmembrane signaling. Our previous work elucidated the mechanistic underpinnings and regulation of the cytoplasmic portion of LapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we focus on the periplasmic events and how they are coupled to the cytoplasmic control elements in the context of the global, c-di-GMP-dependent switching mechanism of the full-length, transmembrane receptor. In particular, we present an activation model for inside-out signaling via LapD based on structures of an unliganded and LapG-bound output domain, and further informed by protein and cell-based switching assays. The results shed light on the control of bacterial proteolysis in the periplasm via conserved signal transduction modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preface to the structural studies</title><p>We previously identified conserved LapD/LapG-containing operons in many, diverse bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>).

While we identified a surface-exposed loop that contains a strictly conserved GWxQ motif important for LapG binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>), how access of LapG to the loop is controlled was not apparent. Also, the structure of LapG revealed a transglutaminase-like fold with functionally important calcium ions bound near its active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>), but did not explain how this protease interacts with LapD.

There is only a minor entanglement of the terminal short β-strands, which connect to the transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Such an arrangement is in stark contrast to our previously determined structure of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD<sup>Output</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel), in which the PAS domain dimer originated from an unusually extensive domain-swap. Although the folds of the dimer half-sites between the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD<sup>Output</sup> and CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> are almost identical (rmsd of 1.9 Å) and the conserved GWxQ motifs, which are important for LapG binding, are positioned in identical, surface-exposed loops within each half-site, the dimer topology of the two output domain ortholog structures is substantially different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, one notable difference between the crystallographic models for the output domains of LapD and CdgS9 is the relative position of the conserved GWxQ motifs. CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> adopts a ‘parallel’ conformation as opposed to the open, V-shaped form that we observed in case of LapD<sup>Output</sup>. As a consequence, the tryptophan residues (W<sup>125</sup> in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD; W<sup>126</sup> in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CdgS9) that form the distal tip of the PAS fold and appear to be a main anchor point for LapG binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>) are farther apart in the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> dimer than the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LapD ortholog (50 Å vs 35 Å between their respective Cβ positions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Considering the discrepancy in the two output domain structures, we developed a structure-guided assay, which allows us to distinguish between the two topologies in the context of the intact, full-length LapD protein from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The approach relies on the site-specific incorporation of a non-natural amino acid with altered functionality, in this case <italic>para</italic>-azido-phenylalanine (pAzF) for target cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mehl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peeler and Mehl, 2012</xref>). Upon UV irradiation, pAzF reacts efficiently with N-H and C-H bonds in its vicinity, forming covalent adducts within a radius of approximately 3 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keana and Cai, 1990</xref>). Specifically, we introduced pAzF via an amber codon-suppression system at sites that we predict would yield cross-links either in only one of the two topologies (A<sup>50</sup>, T<sup>54</sup>, A<sup>115</sup>, based on V-shaped <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> model; A<sup>48</sup>, S<sup>52</sup>, L<sup>66</sup>, based on a homology model using the parallel <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> structure as the target), in both (H<sup>41</sup>, Y<sup>75</sup>) or in none (F<sup>71</sup>, V<sup>91</sup>, R<sup>93</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Choosing several sites in each category increases confidence in the results. LapD variants containing pAzF incorporated at these positions were expressed in a construct wherein the protein was fused to super-folder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedelacq et al., 2006</xref>) at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which enables the use of in-gel fluorescence to detect monomeric and cross-linked species in SDS-PAGE with high specificity and sensitivity using crude lysates or partially purified proteins. In this particular case, we expect to observe a second band corresponding to a covalent LapD-sfGFP dimer only if the pAzF residue was incorporated at or very close to the dimerization interface.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Distinguishing between the ‘open’ domain-swapped and ‘closed’ parallel conformations of the output domain of LapD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-natural amino acid incorporation into protein.

Also, no cross-links occurred in the wild-type protein lacking pAzF.

The only cross-linked LapD dimers were seen with proteins that contained pAzF at interfacial positions that were consistent with both models (H<sup>41</sup>, Y<sup>75</sup>) or identified in the parallel, unswapped model (e.g., A<sup>48</sup>, S<sup>52</sup>, L<sup>66</sup>) based on the CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> structure. Taken together, the cross-linking data clearly indicate that the topology observed in the CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> structure represents the biologically relevant model, which is conserved in the two LapD orthologs, LapD and CdgS9, despite only moderate overall sequence conservation (31% identity/52% similarity).

As predicted by the biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>), the aforementioned conserved tryptophan residue (W<sup>126</sup>) is the major anchor point on CdgS9 as it inserts into a hydrophobic pocket at the bottom of LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). The pocket is formed by strand β4 of LapG's C-terminal lobe and several other disjointed motifs preceding β4. While there are contributions from a limited number of hydrogen bonds and a water-mediated interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the interface appears to be dominated by hydrophobic contacts and shape-complementarity of the interacting elements. Besides the binding pocket for the conserved tryptophan residue, LapG contributes surfaces surrounding the pocket and the central strand β4 that binds to the CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> dimer interface, yielding a continuous interfacial area bridging both protomers of the CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> dimer.</p><p>Based on an alignment of 18 distantly related LapDG ortholog pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>), we mapped sequence conservation onto the molecular surface of CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> and LapG. Notably, there is a disparity regarding surface conservation between the two proteins: LapG presents a cluster of conserved residues on the side that coincides with the active site and the region that interacts with CdgS9<sup>Output</sup>, while the opposite side of the protease shows poor sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel).

Yet, the main docking site for the CdgS9–LapG interaction, the loop that contains the GW<sup>126</sup>xQ motif, is well conserved. As discussed below, pronounced shape complementarity between the interacting surfaces may contribute to the stable recruitment of LapG to the periplasmic output domain of LapD orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Comparison between apo- and LapG-bound CdgS9<sup>Output</sup></title><p>Determination of the structure of apo- and LapG-bound CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> permits us to describe the conformational changes that tune the affinity of LapD-like receptors for LapG proteases.

In the apo-state, the output domain dimer of CdgS9 contains central four-helix bundles, either via packing of helices α1 and α2 of the PAS domain fold close to the distal end, or helices α1 and α4 at the membrane-proximal region. The types of interactions that facilitate the formation of the two 4-helix bundle segments are quite different. Closer to the membrane, a cluster of 4 phenylalanine residues (2 per protomer; F<sup>33</sup> and F<sup>34</sup> of CdgS9) stack in a perpendicular fashion, as opposed to the packing near the distal tip, which involves the burying of two symmetry-related arginine residues (R<sup>75</sup> of CdgS9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As a consequence, the overall structure of the output domain appears bulged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>When engaged with LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3A and 4B</xref>), this perfect symmetry between the two protomers observed in the apo-state is broken. The resulting complex is asymmetric with regard to the output domain dimer, manifested by a 5 Å tilt and vertical offset of one PAS domain fold relative to the other. The central helices α1 are pushed closer together—a movement permitted by smaller residues at the interface (S<sup>48</sup> and S<sup>52</sup>), a perpendicular-to-parallel stacking transition of one of the F<sup>33</sup>–F<sup>34</sup> residue pairs, and the relocation of R<sup>75</sup> from the dimer interface to a more surface-exposed position. The net result is a transition from a four-helix bundle with poor shape complementarity with LapG to a two-helix bundle and an overall shape that is able to accommodate LapG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We argue that the isolated output domain is in a deregulated state and spontaneously populates the high-affinity conformation for LapG binding (on-state) since regulatory domains that would lock the receptor in its off-state (the apo state) or on-state are lacking. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the isolated output domain is an inefficient competitor for the interaction between LapG and full-length LapD (data not shown). Nevertheless, the conservation of the interfaces and motifs involved in LapG binding in the otherwise fairly divergent LapD family of receptors suggest that the proposed mechanism is more generally applicable.</p><p>Taken together, the crystal structures of apo-CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> and a CdgS9<sup>Output</sup>-LapG complex and our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>) yield a detailed model for the activation of LapD by c-di-GMP binding to its cytosolic module. It involves the release of an autoinhibitory interaction, triggering a conformational change in the periplasmic domain through the juxtamembrane HAMP domain and transmembrane segments. High-affinity LapG binding to the off-state of LapD is prevented by an apparent surface mismatch.

This issue is particularly important considering that intact LapD is a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic module that is crucial for the regulation of signal transmission across the membrane. To assess the soundness of our structure-based models, we again turned to a cross-linking assay utilizing non-natural amino acid pAzF incorporation. The cross-linking assay awards several advantages over other binding experiments. It provides site-specific information that can be directly correlated with crystallographic data. In addition, it is very sensitive, allowing us to work at low, more physiologically relevant protein concentrations that support c-di-GMP-dependent regulation of LapD, which is lost at higher protein concentrations required in alternative binding assays. Also, the assay reflects on equilibrium binding. Finally, although the cross-linking efficiency is low, the results are semi-quantitative since empirically the fraction of the successfully established cross-links appears to be proportional to the number of bound molecules. We followed the strategy that we employed to assess LapD homo-dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but in contrast to previous experiments, we introduced pAzF site-specifically into sfGFP-tagged LapG and assessed UV-induced cross-linking to LapD variants, which can be detected as up-shifts of a fluorescent band in SDS-PAGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Validation of the crystallographic CdgS9<sup>Output</sup>-LapG complex interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the Lapd-LapG cross-linking assay. The right panels show a representative experiment in which detergent-solubilized LapD-sfGFP is incubated with non-fluorescent LapG-containing pAzF incorporated at a site predicted to be at the LapD–LapG binding interface in the presence and absence of c-di-GMP. Upon UV irradiation, a fluorescent band corresponding to LapD-sfGFP covalently linked to LapG is observed, which is more intense in the presence of c-di-GMP indicative of more LapD–LapG binding.

We also included a control where we do not add any LapD variant, which will allow us to distinguish between LapG–LapD interactions and possible LapG homo-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Without UV irradiation, no cross-links were observed in any of the conditions. We also did not observe any band shift in the sample that only contained pAzF-derivatized LapG variants but no LapD, consistent with our previous studies that did not indicate signs of LapG oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, pAzF at position Y<sup>108</sup> of LapG, which is distal to the LapD–LapG interface, did not support cross-linking. In contrast, all the LapG variants that contained a pAzF residue at positions that, based on the structure, are predicted to be close to the interaction site yielded band shifts to variable extents (V<sup>205</sup>pAzF &gt; Y<sup>206</sup>pAzF/Y<sup>176</sup>pAzF/A<sup>169</sup>pAzF &gt;&gt; Y<sup>108</sup>pAzF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). It is worth noting that the isolated output domains of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CdgS9 and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD cross-link to LapG readily, suggesting that they are in a binding-competent state, which is in agreement with our crystallographic analysis. However, cross-linking is more robust in the presence of c-di-GMP-activated full-length LapD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data are consistent with the conclusion that our structural models and assays accurately report on the complex formation between full-length LapD and LapG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Stoichiometry of the complex</title><p>Next, we sought support for the asymmetric ensemble of a CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> dimer bound to one LapG protease observed in the crystal structure of the complex.

Investigation of the measurements across the peak reveals a trend towards slightly higher molecular weights at the beginning of the elution peak, but it never reaches values that would indicate the formation of a stable 2:2 complex (two LapG molecules bound to a CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> dimer; theoretical molecular weight of 75.2 kDa). We also purified the homogeneous complex with both LapG and CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> coming from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.

The trend towards higher molecular weights was less apparent, attesting to the homogeneity of this complex. More importantly, even addition of an excess <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LapG to the purified complex failed to drive the formation of a 2:2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom panel).</p><p>Similar experiments for the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> proteins could not be performed due to complexity of the LapD<sup>Output</sup> elution profiles (data not shown), which indicated high polydispersity and the presence of multiple species that complicated the analysis by SEC-MALS.

Based on the crystal structure of the complex, Y<sup>206</sup>pAzF is predicted to cross-link to the LapD protomer that engages LapG with its GWxQ loop, whereas V<sup>205</sup>pAzF faces helix α2 of the other protomer.</p><p>Both LapG variants showed poor but detectable cross-linking in the absence of c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with previous pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>). Activation of LapD by the addition of c-di-GMP produced more robust cross-linking across the LapG concentration series. Strikingly, in all cases, maximum cross-linking was achieved at sub-stoichiometric LapG concentrations, roughly corresponding to a ratio of one LapG molecule per LapD dimer. While the LapG-V<sup>205</sup>pAzF variant resembled a regular saturation-binding curve, LapG-Y<sup>206</sup>pAzF cross-linking peaked between LapG:LapD molar ratios of 0.3–0.5 and then dropped at higher LapG concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

The difference in cross-linking profiles may be rationalized by the observation that V<sup>205</sup>pAzF could form a covalent bond with the LapD output domain protomer for which binding does not require interaction with the tryptophan-containing loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig8">Figures 6B and 8A</xref>). Taken together, these experiments establish the asymmetric complex observed in the crystals as the predominant species in solution and the membrane, and this complex appears to be conserved across the two bacterial genera assessed here.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Attenuating LapD–LapG interactions with a peptide containing the GWxQ binding motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-linking assay using purified proteins.

Spiking wild-type LapD with increasing amounts of c-di-GMP shows an appreciably sharp transition in LapG binding, with the switch occurring between 0.75 μM and 1 μM dinucleotide. In contrast, the mutant variants of LapD with alterations in the S helix (S<sup>229</sup>D and F<sup>222</sup>E) or the HAMP domain (I<sup>187</sup>E) show a shallower dose–response curve, in addition to the aforementioned higher basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These experiments establish that the deregulation of LapD through destabilization of regulatory interactions in the cytoplasmic domains is a result of altered sensitivity of these mutant c-di-GMP receptors. These studies also reveal a switch-like behavior of the wild-type protein, which suggests cooperativity as an important regulatory feature for LapD activation.</p><p>Next, we asked whether LapD regulation in vivo can be altered through mutations in the periplasmic output domain. In particular, we targeted either strictly conserved residues and/or residues that we identified as important for establishing the distinct crystallographic conformations and for the proposed activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this analysis, we also included a panel of HAMP domain mutations, including I<sup>187</sup>E, for which switching phenotypes had been established in chemoreceptors such as TSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). As done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>), the mutations were introduced in a <italic>lapD</italic>/<italic>lapG</italic> co-expression plasmid to ensure balanced expression of both genes in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. As the read-out, the static biofilm that forms preferentially at the air-liquid interface was quantified using an established crystal violet-based assay. Deletion of <italic>lapD</italic> and <italic>lapG</italic> (Δ<italic>lapD</italic>/<italic>lapG</italic>) results in a hyperbiofilm phenotype, since the adhesin LapA cannot be processed due to the absence of the protease LapG and thus the adhesin is retained at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newell et al., 2011a</xref>). On the other end of the spectrum, expression of LapG alone in the double-deletion strain results in hypo-biofilm formation or maximal dispersal, since LapG will process LapA in a constitutive, unregulated fashion. Simultaneous expression of wild-type <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD and LapG in the double-deletion strain restores the phenotype of the parent strain with native LapDG levels, characterized by a low-to-intermediate biofilm mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>). This range of phenotypes allows us to assess the functionality of mutant constructs. A non-functional LapD variant would phenocopy a double-deletion strain overexpressing only LapG. In contrast, a constitutively active LapD variant would present itself in a hyper-biofilm phenotype, resembling the phenotype of the double-deletion strain. Any phenotype in-between the two extremes would be indicative of a functional LapD protein that retained regulation via c-di-GMP and near-wild-type levels of LapG recruitment.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03650.014</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Mutational analysis of LapD regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biofilm phenotypes of LapD point mutants.

Some of these mutations would have been expected to be activating (i.e., hyper-biofilm forming) via destabilization of the apo-LapD<sup>Output</sup> conformation, but no such phenotypes were observed. The more apparent hypo-biofilm phenotypes of mutant LapD variants D<sup>72</sup>K and Y<sup>76</sup>R can be explained by disturbance of the LapG binding interface by these mutations. The weaker phenotypes of the output domain mutants are in stark contrast to the effect of sequence alterations in the HAMP domain. More than half of the single-point mutations made in the HAMP domain result in hyper-biofilm phenotypes indicative of a constitutive LapD–LapG interaction. Of note, the positions in the helical segments of the HAMP domain, which are important for the differential packing interactions within the dimeric HAMP domain (positions <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> in the knobs-into-holes packing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>), have the most pronounced effect on LapD function. These positions are the key elements in the gear-box model for HAMP domain switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferris et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>), which describes two states of the HAMP four-helix bundle that are separated by 26° rotations of the helices. This observation indicates that LapD's HAMP domain adopts a canonical fold and is likely subject to a similar mode of regulation as has been described for other HAMP domains. Together, these results confirm the regulatory role of the HAMP domain, but also indicate a clear hierarchy of LapD's control elements, with the HAMP domain driving the main regulatory effects, which may be important to bias the system to inside-out signaling and to prevent accidental activation through basal LapD–LapG encounters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Conservation of LapD regulation across bacterial species</title><p>Conservation of key residues and surfaces does not imply functional conservation; however, our previous results indicated that complexes between the output domain and LapG from two different bacterial strains form readily and in a physiologically relevant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2012</xref>). To take this point further, and to demonstrate conservation of mechanism and regulation in cells, we created chimeric full-length LapD constructs, in which we replaced the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> output domain or the cytoplasmic domain with the corresponding domains of CdgS9, the putative <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LapD ortholog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Constructs <italic>Lpg-Pfl</italic> C1 and C2 contain the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> output domain with a cytoplasmic module from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD. <italic>Pfl-Lpg</italic> C2 shares the swap point with <italic>Lpg-Pfl</italic> C2, but is the reciprocal construct consisting of output domain and transmembrane helices of LapD and the entire cytoplasmic fragment of CdgS9. In constructs <italic>Pfl-Lpg</italic> C3, C4, and C5, the chimeric swap was introduced at different positions in the HAMP domain (in-between secondary structure elements). The swap-point in C5 is at the HAMP-S helix junction, which would leave the intra-molecular S helix-GGDEF-EAL control module intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>). The constructs were introduced in the dual expression plasmid that also carried the <italic>P. fluorescens lapG</italic> gene for the balanced expression of both proteins, similar to the native operon. Biofilm phenotypes were assessed as before (see above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the majority of our chimeric constructs supported biofilm regulation similar to the levels observed with the native <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Importantly, both the output domain and the cytoplasmic HAMP-GGDEF-EAL module from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> appeared fully functional in this context. The only construct that generated a hyper-biofilm phenotype indicative of a constitutive interaction between LapG and LapD was the one in which the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> S helix-GGDEF-EAL fragment replaced the respective <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapD domains with the HAMP domain coming from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (construct <italic>Pfl-Lpg</italic> C5). This result hints at the importance of the connection between the HAMP domain and the S helix. Most importantly for this study, these data demonstrate conservation of the key mechanism between moderately conserved LapD orthologs and indicate that, despite the mixed origin of the complex structure components, CdgS9 is a suitable proxy for a c-di-GMP receptor that mediates inside-out signaling to control periplasmic proteolysis. Consequently, the two crystal structures of the output domain of a LapD-like protein in two distinct conformations, one representing the inactive state, the other the active, LapG-bound state, provide fundamental insights into the switching mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Biofilm formation in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> as a response to nutritional cues relies on the <italic>lap</italic> operon, which contains genes encoding the signal-integrating transmembrane protein LapD, a c-di-GMP receptor that regulates periplasmic proteolysis through a sequestration of the protease LapG. LapG engagement is regulated through conformational changes in LapD that originate from c-di-GMP binding to LapD's cytoplasmic domain and are transmitted through the juxtamembrane HAMP domain. Our structural analyses establish that LapD's output domain adopts a PAS domain fold and forms homo-dimers with distinct differences in the LapG binding-competent, active state and its inactive state (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Notably, the packing transition that the structures depict can be described as a transition from a four-helix to a two-helix bundle, and follows two principle components: in a piston motion, one half-side of the dimeric output domain shifts vertically along the second half-side, whereas scissor-like motions encompass a tilting of the half-sides along the dimer interface. Considering the current model for HAMP domain-switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Airola et al., 2013</xref>), which involves undergoing small amplitude translations and/or rotations during signal transduction similar to the ones we describe for CdgS9's periplasmic output domain, we predict that the output domain follows the conformational changes in the HAMP domain as a direct response. The cross-over of the membrane proximal elements observed in both output domain conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) may function as the fulcrum about which the output and HAMP domain pivot and/or tilt.</p><p>As for the mode of LapG interaction, the four-helix bundle of the output domain of inactive LapD presents a surface that appears suboptimal for LapG binding, while the activated LapD conformation is characterized by extensive shape complementarity and effective interaction anchors at one face of the LapD output domain dimer, foremost the conserved tryptophan in the GWxQ loop. The notion of geometric compatibility, as opposed to an increase in specific per-residue interactions as a predominant driver for high-affinity LapG binding, is supported by the overall low surface conservation of LapD orthologs. The asymmetry of the LapD–LapG complex further suggests mechanisms inherent to the output domain that counteract an activating signal and may ultimately contribute to anti-cooperativity, which has been described for other PAS domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore and Hendrickson, 2012</xref>). In the current model, (transient) occupation of the second LapG binding site on the dimeric output domain of LapD would release LapG at the first, high-affinity site.</p><p>While the crystal structures provide distinct snapshots of possible conformations, they contain little information regarding the dynamics of the transitions and stability of the functional states. Based on our lack of success to create a constitutively active LapD through structure-guided mutations in the output domain, we offer two explanations for the apparent disconnect between the crystallographic data that are based on the isolated output domain and the functional analysis of the regulated full-length protein. In the first model, the regulatory HAMP and GGDEF-EAL domains would constrain the conformation of the LapD output domain to an extent that mutations are insufficient to destabilize the output domain dimer interface and/or induce the correct high-affinity LapG-binding state. Another, non-mutually exclusive model also consistent with our data is that the apo-state may be described as a dynamic ensemble, preventing efficient LapG binding. It would follow that the crystallized output domain in the absence of LapG depicts only one possible conformation of the ensemble with the mutations only having minimal effect on the activity. At the same time, crucial interaction motifs are exposed even in this state, consistent with a basal level of LapG binding in the absence of c-di-GMP. LapD activation by c-di-GMP on the other hand increases the affinity of LapG with the output domain following conformational changes dictated by the cytoplasmic HAMP domain. It is interesting to note that both principles, switching through dynamic states or between more stable conformations have also been discussed for HAMP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferris et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mechaly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stewart, 2014</xref>), consistent with the idea that the output domain may mirror the behavior of the regulatory domains. Future experiments investigating the dynamics of full-length LapD, including those in a lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), should help to distinguish between the two models.</p><p>The dominance of the HAMP domain over the output domain in regulating LapD may bias the system towards inside-out signaling and against tenacious conformational changes induced by LapD–LapG encounters in the periplasm. At the same time, the observed basal and/or transient interactions of LapG with LapD's output domain at low c-di-GMP levels may translate into low frequency conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains, which would yield pre-activated receptors that would lock in place only when c-di-GMP levels are high. Such a mechanism would explain how c-di-GMP has access to the EAL domain in the first place, given that the autoinhibited conformation is incompatible with c-di-GMP binding. The mechanism would be best described as ‘coincidence detection’, requiring both c-di-GMP and LapG being available for LapD engagement and full activation. The HAMP domain would function as an attenuator in the inactive state, yet determine the active conformation upon c-di-GMP binding, which would prevent an immediate reversion to the autoinhibited state.</p><p>The presence of LapD-like signaling nodes was validated in a few other biofilm-forming bacteria. Unfortunately, while we have evidence that they are regulated in a similar fashion, we know very little about their physiological role. Gene deletion of the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LapD ortholog locus <italic>cdgS9</italic> has no obvious phenotype, yet overexpression of CdgS9 has an effect on intracellular growth of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levi et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting functional relevance of this ortholog. Stronger functional similarities to the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> system are apparent in more closely related bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gjermansen et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2010</xref>). Future studies will address the physiological pathways that LapD and LapG orthologs regulate. Until then, proteins from these other systems remain orphan c-di-GMP receptors and proteases, respectively. Our work lays the foundation and establishes several tools that will be useful to interrogate these signaling nodes in other bacteria.</p><p>As part of these efforts, we demonstrate that, in principle, the LapD–LapG interaction, and likely analogous binding between similar protein pairs, is therapeutically accessible, since LapD-derived peptides containing the conserved GWxQ motif specifically diminish LapG binding to LapD. While effective competition relied on high peptide concentrations, one needs to consider that we used a non-constrained peptide, which competes with the native binding site presented by full-length, c-di-GMP-activated LapD that presents an interaction surface far greater than just the peptide sequence. Unfortunately, the peptides are not bioavailable and likely do not cross the outer membrane of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, preventing us to assess whether inhibiting the LapD–LapG interaction would result in increased biofilm dispersal, as would be predicted if the peptides would release LapG from LapD in vivo. Nevertheless, our data indicate that targeting the interaction site with small-molecule inhibitors could be a fruitful strategy to perturb bacterial biofilm formation and dispersal. Optimized competitors may include synthetic stapled or otherwise designed peptides that mimic the loop structure in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Razavi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Based on the conservation of binding events, regulation and key sequence motifs, we predict that our model is universal for proteins with LapD-like architecture, which includes receptors that signal in the opposite direction (‘outside-in’) by translating environmental signals emerging in the periplasm into changes in DGC and/or PDE activity in their cytoplasmic GGDEF and EAL domains, respectively. As an example, a LapDG-like mode of regulation, yet in the opposite signaling direction and involving an active DGC, controls the clinically important GGDEF domain-containing protein YfiN from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanchez-Torres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giardina et al., 2013</xref>). In this case, the periplasmic protein YfiR suppresses YfiN's DGC activity through a direct interaction with YfiN's periplasmic PAS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malone et al., 2012</xref>). YfiR becomes sequestered by the outer membrane protein YfiB, which activates YfiN, likely involving conformational changes in its HAMP-GGDEF domain module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raterman et al., 2013</xref>).

Where specified, LapD was solubilized for subsequent purifications by incubating membranes in membrane buffer supplemented with 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 1 hr, insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 180,000×<italic>g</italic> for 40 min. The clarified supernatant was incubated with NiNTA resin for 1 hr and washed thoroughly with membrane buffer supplemented with 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME), 20 mM imidazole, and 1% Triton X-100. The Triton X-100 detergent was exchanged for 0.01% (wt/vol) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) in a step-wise fashion while LapD was still bound to the NiNTA resin, followed by elution of LapD with LapD elution buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mM BME, 300 mM imidazole, and 0.01% LMNG). The eluted protein was buffer-exchanged into a low-salt LapD buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 4 mM BME, and 0.01% LMNG) on a fast desalting column. LapD was concentrated by ultra-filtration and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with LapD gel filtration buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 4 mM BME, and 0.0025% LMNG and 0.02% CHAPS). The protein was stored at 4°C and used within 72 hr.</p><p>To prepare LapD-sfGFP for cross-linking assays, isolated membranes were solubilized in membrane buffer supplemented with 1% lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and 0.2% CHAPS for 1 hr at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 100,000×<italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The concentration of solubilized LapD-sfGFP (and LapG-sfGFP) was determined by comparing the amount of fluorescence in the supernatant to a standard curve of purified sfGFP (excitation: 488 nm, emission: 510 nm). Proteins were used in cross-linking assays immediately after solubilization.</p><p>To produce non-fluorescent LapG with pAzF, purified LapG-sfGFP was incubated with TEV protease overnight at 4°C. The His<sub>6</sub>-tagged sfGFP and TEV protease were subsequently removed by incubation with NiNTA resin. Unbound, non-fluorescent LapG containing site-specifically incorporated pAzF was collected in the flow through, concentrated to &gt;2 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Crystallization, data collection and structure solution</title><p>Crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion mixing equal volumes of protein (10–30 mg/ml) and reservoir solution followed by incubation at 20°C. For the native and selenemethionine-derivatized <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> crystals, the reservoir solution contained 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH = 5.0), 14% PEG3350, and 4% vol/vol 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Crystals of the native LapG–CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> complex were obtained from a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH = 6.0) and 0.1 M magnesium formate. Our initial efforts directed towards experimental phase determination proved intractable due to extremely low expression levels of the selenomethione-substituted LapG–CdgS9<sup>Output</sup> complex. Hence phases were determined based on data sets collected on crystals grown from protein mixtures containing selenomethionine-derivatized <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapG and native <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CdgS9<sup>Output</sup>, which grew at conditions identical to the native complex. For cryo-protection, crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 20–25% xylitol. Cryo-preserved crystals were flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on frozen crystals at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS, Ithaca).</p><p>Data reduction was carried out with the software package HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</xref>). Experimental phases for the initial structure determination were obtained from Single Anomalous Diffraction (SAD) experiments on crystals grown from selenomethionine-derivatized proteins by using the software package PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). Refinement in PHENIX and COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) yielded the final models. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Illustrations were made in Pymol (Schrödinger). Alignments were generated using ClustalW2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>).

When indicated, 10 μM c-di-GMP was added to the reaction. All reaction components were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 min, at which time crosslinking was initiated by irradiation with short wave UV light (∼254 nm) for 5 min. After irradiation, samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer and immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE without boiling. Gels were imaged by fluorescence using a BioRad Gel Doc system. Band intensities of the cross-linked adducts were measured using ImageLab software (Biorad, Hercules, CA) and normalized to the intensity of non-cross-linked sfGFP-labeled protein. Reported values of band intensities are the average of three replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Size exclusion chromatography-coupled multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS)</title><p>SEC-MALS measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De et al., 2010</xref>) were carried out by injecting purified proteins (100 µM) onto a Phenomenex gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with MALS buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.4] and 100 mM NaCl). The chromatography system was coupled to an 18-angle, static light scattering detector and a refractive index detector (DAWN HELEOS-II and Optilab T-rEX, respectively; Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). Data were collected at 25°C every second at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and analyzed with the software ASTRA, yielding the molecular weight and mass distribution (polydispersity) of the samples. For data quality control and normalization of the light scattering detectors, monomeric bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Growth conditions</title><p><italic>P. fluorescens</italic> was routinely cultured with liquid LB medium or on solidified LB with 1.5% agar at 30°C.

However they felt that there was a disconnect between the structural analyses that are reported and some of the statements, especially about signal transduction from cytoplasm to periplasm. The decision was to ask for a modified manuscript in which these issues are addressed, either by toning down the language, providing amplified discussions of the caveats and limitations of the structural studies, or providing biochemical evidence. Some of the issues noted in the reviews:</p><p>1) Need to provide a fuller discussion of the failure of mutations to destabilize the LapD-output domain and its implications for your model.</p><p>2) Need to provide an expanded justification for the relevance of CdgS9 as a replacement for LapD.</p><p>3) Address the implications for the missing HAMP domain in your structures by providing a clearer hypothesis based possibly on other published structures about how the structural information inside the cell is communicated to the outside.</p><p>4) Consider using biochemical assays using liposomes and nano disk-type systems as these systems have provided valuable information on GPCRs (Wang et al. Cell 2014 53:929-940).</p><p>The full reviews are included to provide more detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the structure-function study of the LapD/LapG system, in which the level of c-di-GMP is communicated via LapD (c-di-GMP-binding transmembrane protein) to the periplasm. The authors provide new key mechanistic insights into how these signals are actually communicated structurally from the cytosol to the periplasm and especially the changes in the output domain that allow it to go from a weak LapG-binding to a tight LapG binding state. Furthermore, these structures provide novel approaches for targeting this interaction in order to inhibit biofilm formation, one of which (the use of peptides as mimics of a protein interface), was tested directly by the authors.</p><p>In short, the manuscript is very well-written, insightful and compelling. Its only central shortcoming is that it does not yet provide the structure(s) of what the authors clearly demonstrate is the key mediator of the structural signaling across the membrane: the HAMP domain (i.e., “with the HAMP domain driving the main regulatory effects”). A structure of a LapD with the HAMP domain will likely be able to provide these key insights and is eagerly awaited. However, even without this piece of this story, the discoveries described here advance our understanding of this 'inside-out' signaling system and will be of interest to a broad range of readers.</p><p>There are some concerns, as described in detail below, which should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>The model put forward by the authors is that there is a conformational change in the LapD output domain that mediates a transition between a LapG low and high affinity state. This is based largely on the conformational changes observed between apo and LapG-bound LapD output domain. While it is highly likely that the complex is a single stable state, one might ask whether or not in the absence of LapG, the output dimer is actually (somewhat) dynamic. SAXS would be one potential way to get at this question. This is asked in part to address the observation that the mutations generated to 'destabilize' the apo-LapD-output domain did not make it constitutively active as predicted. That is, perhaps this conformation crystallized is not the single 'stable' conformation for the apo-state in vivo and thus mutations that destabilize it have only a minimal effect on activity.</p><p>The superposition shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the elements anchored to the membrane are in nearly identical positions.

The authors work primarily with the LapD/LapG system from Pseudomonas, and also with the LapD homolog CdgS9 from L pneumophila. The P fluorescens system is involved in biofilm formation, and these LapD/LapG systems are present in many different bacterial species. The important aspect of this work is that they use a lot of structural and biochemical studies to map LapD (or in the case of the structural studies CdgS9) with LapG. LapD is a transmembrane protein that binds c-di-GMP in its cytoplasmic domain to modulate its periplasmic domain binding to the LapG protease. The authors showed that they can exchange LapD by CdgS9. There is a lot of work performed here, and some nice structural and biochemical studies. My main concerns here are:</p><p>1) The authors could only co-crystalize CsgS9 from L pneumophila with the LapD from P fluorescences.

However they felt that there was a disconnect between the structural analyses that are reported and some of the statements, especially about signal transduction from cytoplasm to periplasm. The decision was to ask for a modified manuscript in which these issues are addressed, either by toning down the language, providing amplified discussions of the caveats and limitations of the structural studies, or providing biochemical evidence. Some of the issues noted in the reviews:</italic></p><p>We have revised the manuscript following the specific feedback provided by the reviewers. We hope that our edits clarify the issues that were brought up during the review.</p><p><italic>1) Need to provide a fuller discussion of the failure of mutations to destabilize the LapD-output domain and its implications for your model</italic>.</p><p>We added clarifying statements in the corresponding text. Briefly, the mutants behave similar to the wild-type protein, retaining LapD function, which results in an intermediate level of biofilm formation. Although this implies that the proteins are made and intact (otherwise we would observe hyper-biofilm phenotypes), it thus appears that, based on our experiments with full-length proteins, that the crystallographic model does not fully explain the low-affinity state for LapG. We incorporate this point explicitly into the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 1 suggested a model that is identical to the one we proposed in the Discussion (4<sup>th</sup> paragraph). It appears that the reviewer had no issues with our interpretation of the data. We discuss a second, non-mutually exclusive model in the revised manuscript. In this context, we acknowledged the limitations of the crystallographic analysis, which was the main motivation for investigating the regulation of the full-length protein. While the design of the functional studies was heavily informed by the structures, the discussion of the signaling mechanisms is predominantly based on studies using the full-length protein or cellular assays. We feel that we were careful not to over-interpret the structural data, but rather incorporate our biochemical insights in our analysis and interpretations. The resulting functional model is a composite of the different approaches: we feel that combining information from structural studies with assays using full-length proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>, plus genetic studies <italic>in vivo</italic>, to build our overall model is one of the strengths of our study.</p><p><italic>2) Need to provide an expanded justification for the relevance of CdgS9 as a replacement for LapD</italic>.</p><p>While we were only able to obtain crystals of a heterologous complex (<italic>L. pneumophila</italic> CdgS9 output domain and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapG), we would like to point out that we provide ample evidence at several levels that our structural model reveals conserved and relevant features. Simply stated, it was the heterologous complex that provided the structural data, and we leveraged this information to test hypotheses about the structural model in our well-characterized LapD-LapG system in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. We make an explicit statement to address this point in the revised manuscript. Please see our response to Reviewer 2, point #1 for more details.</p><p>In addition, we showed in a previous publication that the isolated output domain orthologs bind their corresponding LapG orthologs, but also show significant cross-specificity. We refer to this work in our manuscript. The use of orthologous proteins as surrogates is common practice to obtain structural models, a point we now mention in the revised manuscript. Our validation experiments comparing the heterologous and homologous complexes provide confidence that the structural model reports on a native-like interaction. We also would like to point out that all functional assays were conducted with the homologous system from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) Address the implications for the missing HAMP domain in your structures by providing a clearer hypothesis based possibly on other published structures about how the structural information inside the cell is communicated to the outside</italic>.</p><p>We included a figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, showing a sequence alignment between LapD’s HAMP domain and that of HAMP domains with known structures, several of which have been investigated by mutagenesis approaches as well. While LapD’s HAMP domain appears more divergent, key residues involved in the proposed switching mechanism of canonical HAMP domains are conserved, and it is those residues that we targeted for our analysis. We expanded the section regarding a potential model for inside-out signaling via the HAMP domains, as described below (response to Reviewer #1, points #2 and #3). The observation that the output domains cross-over right at the membrane surface suggests a scissor-type mechanism where a rotation and/or pivoting of the HAMP and transmembrane domains is coupled to similar conformational changes within the output domain dimer.</p><p><italic>4) Consider using biochemical assays using liposomes and nano disk-type systems as these systems have provided valuable information on GPCRs (Wang et al. Cell 2014 53:929-940)</italic>.</p><p>While nano-discs and proteoliposomes are excellent systems for biophysical approaches that we plan to employ in the future to study the dynamics of LapD in more detail, we demonstrate here (and previous work from our groups) that studies on detergent-solubilized LapD correlate well with our functional assessment of the LapD in cell-based assays. In particular, we observe robust and strictly c-di-GMP-dependent switching between the low- and high-affinity state with regard to LapG binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, a finding that has been corroborated with cell-based studies. Targeted mutations based on structural models of the control elements of LapD override regulatory features, both using <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell-based assays, further attesting to the validity of our approach and results. However, we discuss the potential of membrane-reconstituted systems in the revised manuscript, and refer to the studies on a histidine kinase, which are relevant in the context of our work.</p><p>It was suggested that we revise the title to “Mechanistic insight into the conserved allosteric regulation of periplasmic proteolysis by the signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP”, and we agree that this title helps clarify the central points of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] In short, the manuscript is very well-written, insightful and compelling. Its only central shortcoming is that it does not yet provide the structure(s) of what the authors clearly demonstrate is the key mediator of the structural signaling across the membrane: the HAMP domain (i.e., “with the HAMP domain driving the main regulatory effects”). A structure of a LapD with the HAMP domain will likely be able to provide these key insights and is eagerly awaited. However, even without this piece of this story, the discoveries described here advance our understanding of this 'inside-out' signaling system and will be of interest to a broad range of readers</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that it would be wonderful to obtain a structural view of the HAMP domain of LapD. Unfortunately, this goal is not within reach at the moment. Nevertheless, the homology models and structure-guided mutagenesis approach used here suggests that LapD’s HAMP domain is a dominant functional unit for LapD regulation.</p><p><italic>There are some concerns, as described in detail below, which should be addressed prior to publication</italic>.</p><p><italic>The model put forward by the authors is that there is a conformational change in the LapD output domain that mediates a transition between a LapG low and high affinity state. This is based largely on the conformational changes observed between apo and LapG-bound LapD output domain. While it is highly likely that the complex is a single stable state, one might ask whether or not in the absence of LapG, the output dimer is actually (somewhat) dynamic. SAXS would be one potential way to get at this question. This is asked in part to address the observation that the mutations generated to 'destabilize' the apo-LapD-output domain did not make it constitutively active as predicted. That is, perhaps this conformation crystallized is not the single 'stable' conformation for the apo-state in vivo and thus mutations that destabilize it have only a minimal effect on activity</italic>.</p><p>The model proposed by this reviewer is described in the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion. We did not mention it as part of sections describing the crystallographic results since it is based on the functional and mutational analysis introduced later in the manuscript. We extended this discussion, also in response to point #1 in the editor’s letter.</p><p>We have considered experiments to investigate the dynamics of the isolated output domain. However, as discussed in the manuscript, our data indicate that the isolated output domain is unregulated since it readily binds LapG (in contrast to the full-length protein which requires c-di-GMP binding to the EAL domain for high affinity LapG binding). Hence, SAXS data collected on the isolated output domain may not be relevant or informative for the native functioning of the LapD protein. Also, we suspect that the conformational changes or ensemble may be too subtle to be picked up reliably by SAXS. For these reasons, we decided to shift the focus to the full-length protein. Future studies will address the dynamics of LapD, in particular of the output and HAMP domains in the context of the full-length protein, and address the molecular basis for the switching mechanism elucidated in the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>The superposition shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>shows the elements anchored to the membrane are in nearly identical positions.

More detailed discussion about how the changes observed may be communicated through the membrane is warranted</italic>.</p><p>We added the following sentence to the Discussion (1<sup>st</sup> paragraph), which hopefully clarifies our model in this regard: “The cross-over of the membrane proximal elements observed in both output domain conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) may function as the fulcrum about which the output and HAMP domain pivot.”</p><p><italic>Calcium binding: has Ca been extracted (EGTA) and then ITC performed to quantify the binding and stoichiometry?

This makes me a bit nervous on how accurate the predictions on functions of homologous pairs mirrored the non-homologous pair, especially because some of the main differences between LapD and CdgS9 localize to the site of interaction with LapD</italic>.</p><p>We shared the initial concern with reviewer 2, which is the reason why we validated the structural models and demonstrated conserved functionality in great detail and at several levels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref> show complex formation via similar surfaces and with similar stoichiometries. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> shows functionality of the domain in a cell-based assay and a model system for biofilm formation. While we may miss nuances of the interaction by not having a structural model of the homologous complex, the core machinery relevant for function appears to be well conserved. The homologous complex may resist crystallization for several reasons, which often remain elusive. In this regard, it is important to point out that the complexes (homologous and heterologous) form <italic>in vitro</italic>, and are dependent on the strictly conserved tryptophan residue (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). As noted in the manuscript, we also identify based on the heterologous complex structure a second residue on LapD (D<sup>72</sup>K; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) that is crucial for the LapD-LapG interaction in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, further validating the structural model.</p><p><italic>2) The authors start the manuscript on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>showing two very different crystal structures for LapD and CdgS9, and then do crosslinking experiments to suggest that their previous LapD crystal structure is not in the right conformation, which should be that of CdgS9. That made me nervous</italic>.</p><p>Our data presented here strongly suggests that the <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> output domain crystallized in an aberrant state. We came to this conclusion based on the observation that the two independent CdgS9 output domain-containing structures (apo and LapG-bound) revealed a similar topology compared to our previously determined crystal structure of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LapG’s output domain. The CdgS9 topology is also consistent with the canonical PAS fold. More importantly, our validation by site-directed cross-linking leaves little doubt that the output domain in full-length LapD adopts a similar conformation.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that the model we published previously is correct in that the electron density and resulting structure were interpreted correctly. We considered the possibility that the two orthologs fold differently, or that they represent different activity states of the output domain, but our biochemical assessment indicated that the LapD output domain must have crystallized in some off-pathway state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Together, the evidence strongly supports that nature (or at least our expression/crystallization conditions) played a trick on us with the previously published isolated output domain of LapD.</p><p><italic>3) How can you say that c-di-GMP triggers the conformational change in the periplamsic domain, when most studies were performed with just the periplasmic domain of LapD and not full length?</italic></p><p>The sentence prior to this section refers to the overall model we propose for LapD regulation based on our (previous and current) data, which we then describe in the section the reviewer refers to. While studies described up to this point of the manuscript focused on the isolated periplasmic domain, the majority of experiments in the second half of the manuscript were performed with the full-length protein and support the aforementioned model for c-di-GMP regulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The fact that a CdgS9 mutant has no phenotype</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be desirable to identify the functional role of CdgS9 in <italic>L.</italic> the <italic>pneumophila</italic>.
