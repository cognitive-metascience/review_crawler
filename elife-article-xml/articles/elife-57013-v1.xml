variety of subcortical and cortical inputs, but its synaptic organization in humans is still unknown due to the difficulties involved studying the human brain via electron microscope techniques. However, we have shown that the 3D reconstruction method using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) can be applied to study in detail the synaptic organization of the human brain obtained from autopsies, yielding excellent results. Using this technology, 24,752 synapses were fully reconstructed in CA1, revealing that most of them were excitatory, targeting dendritic spines and displaying a macular shape, regardless of the layer examined. However, remarkable differences were observed between layers. These data constitute the first extensive description of the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human CA1 region.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are billions of nerve cells or neurons in the human brain, and each one can form thousands of connections, also called synapses, with other neurons. That means there are trillions of synapses in the brain that keep information flowing.</p><p>Studying the arrangement of individual neurons in the human brain, and the connections between them, is incredibly difficult because of its complexity. Scientists have tools that can image the whole brain and can measure the activity in different regions, but these tools only visualize brain structures that are large enough to be seen with human eyes. Synapses are much smaller (in the range of nanometers), and can only be seen using thin slices of preserved brain tissue through a technique called electron microscopy.</p><p>The hippocampus is a part of the human brain that is critical for memory, learning and spatial orientation, and is affected in epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. Although numerous studies of the hippocampus have been performed in laboratory animals, such as mice, the question remains as to how much of the information gained from these studies applies to humans. Thus, studying the human brain directly is a major goal in neuroscience. However, the scarcity of human brain tissue suitable for the study of synapses is one of the most important issues to overcome. Fortunately, healthy human brain tissue that can be studied using electron microscopy is sometimes donated after death. Using these donations could improve the understanding of the synapses in normal brains and possible changes associated with disease.</p><p>Now, Montero-Crespo et al. have mapped synapses in the normal human hippocampus in three dimensions – providing the first detailed description of synaptic structure in this part of the brain. Using high-powered electron microscopes and donated brain tissue samples collected after death, Montero-Crespo et al. imaged almost 25,000 connections between neurons. The analysis showed that synapses were more densely packed in some layers of the hippocampus than in others. Most synapses were found to be connected to tiny dendritic ‘spines’ that sprout from dendritic branches of the neuron, and they activated (not suppressed) the next neuron.</p><p>Beyond its implications for better understanding of brain health and disease, this work could also advance computer modelling attempts to mimic the structure of the brain and its activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autopsy</kwd><kwd>FIB/SEM microscopy</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>microanatomy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CB06/05/0066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PGC2018-094307-B-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cajal Blue Brain Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>785907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZEN-15-321663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeFelipe</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005367</institution-id><institution>Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-040-UNED-POST</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blazquez-Llorca</surname><given-names>Lidia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, Spain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU14/02245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montero-Crespo</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Volume electron microscopy reveals the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human hippocampal CA1 field.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus plays a crucial role in spatial orientation, learning and memory, and many pathological conditions (e.g., epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease) are closely associated with synaptic alterations in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Amaral and Lavenex, 2007</xref>). As has been previously discussed, one of the first steps towards understanding the way in which neuronal circuits contribute to the functional organization of the brain involves defining the brain’s detailed structural design and mapping its connection matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Swanson and Bota, 2010</xref>). The connectivity of the brain can be examined at three major levels of resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">DeFelipe, 2010</xref>): (i) macroscopically, focusing on major tract connectivity; (ii) at an intermediate resolution, using light microscopy techniques that allow putative synaptic contacts to be mapped; and (iii) at the ultrastructural level, using electron microscopy (EM) to map true synaptic contacts. Numerous studies have described the ultrastructural characteristics and organization of hippocampal synapses in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Bourne and Harris, 2012</xref>). However, there is very little information about the synaptic organization of the human hippocampus and the brain in general, which is a major problem since the question remains as to how much of the animal model information can be reliably extrapolated to humans. The majority of these studies are performed in specimens removed during the course of neurosurgery in patients with tumors or intractable epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Androuin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Witcher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yakoubi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yakoubi et al., 2019b</xref>). Since it is inevitable that surgical excisions pass through cortical regions that are normal, this represents an excellent opportunity to study human brain material. The problem is that although this material is thought to be close to what would be expected in the normal brain, the results cannot be unequivocally considered as representative of the normal condition of the human brain. Thus, a major goal in neuroscience is to directly study human brain with no recorded neurological or psychiatric alterations. In the present study, we started to address the issue of the hippocampal synaptic organization by focusing on the CA1 field. This hippocampal field receives and integrates a massive amount of information in a laminar-specific manner, and sends projections mainly to the subiculum and to extrahippocampal subcortical nuclei and polymodal association cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Amaral and Lavenex, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Studying the human brain via EM techniques presents certain problems and the scarcity of human brain tissue that is suitable for the study of synaptic circuitry is one of the most important issues to overcome. Recently, we have shown that the 3D reconstruction method using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) can be applied to study in detail the synaptic organization of the human brain obtained from autopsies, yielding excellent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For these reasons, we used FIB/SEM technology to perform a 3D analysis of the synaptic organization in the neuropil in all layers of the CA1 region from five human brain autopsies with a short postmortem delay. Specifically, we studied a variety of synaptic structural parameters including the synaptic density and spatial distribution, type of synapses, postsynaptic targets and the shape and size of the synaptic junctions.</p><p>The data reported in the present work constitutes the first extensive description of the synaptic organization in the human hippocampal CA1 field, which is a necessary step for better understanding its functional organization in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used coronal sections of the human hippocampus at the level of the hippocampal body and examined the CA1 field at both light and EM levels. Following a deep to superficial axis, the following main CA1 layers were analyzed: the alveus, <italic>stratum oriens</italic> (SO), <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> (SP), <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> (SR) and <italic>stratum lacunosum-moleculare</italic> (SLM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, SP was subdivided into a deep part (dSP) close to the SO, and a superficial part (sSP), close to the SR.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light microscopy: volume fraction occupied by cortical elements</title><p>First, we estimated the total thickness of the CA1 field ―including the alveus― in the radial axis. The average thickness was 2.70 ± 0.62 mm. Following a deep-superficial axis, the average length of each layer was: 0.34 ± 0.12 in the alveus; 0.06 ± 0.03 mm in SO; 1.13 ± 0.33 mm in SP; 0.55 ± 0.31 mm in SR; and 0.62 ± 0.16 mm in SLM. Thus, in relative terms, SP contributed the most to the total CA1 thickness (42%) followed by SLM (23%) then SR (20%), the alveus (13%) and SO (2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). We then assessed the cellular composition of every CA1 layer, including the volume fraction (V<sub>v</sub>) occupied by different cortical elements (i.e., blood vessels, glial and neuronal somata and neuropil), estimated by applying the Cavalieri principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gundersen et al., 1988</xref>). The neuropil constituted undoubtedly the main element in all layers (more than 90%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) followed by blood vessels (range from 4.79% in SR to 7.58% in SO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

As expected, the volume occupied by neurons was significantly higher in SP than in any other layer (ANOVA, p&lt;0.001). The neuropil was significantly more abundant in SR (94.19 ± 1.17%) than in SP (90.11 ± 1.32%, ANOVA, p=0.015) and SO (90.01 ± 3.07%; ANOVA, p=0.012).

The contribution of SP to the total CA1 radial extension accounted for almost a half of the total thickness (SP thickness: 1.13 mm; total CA1 thickness: 2.70 mm). This great extent of SP represents a major difference with the rodent brain and other species. Indeed, important variances can be observed in the hippocampal neuroanatomy of humans compared to rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Amaral and Lavenex, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Duvernoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Slomianka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tapia-González et al., 2020</xref>). In the rat hippocampus, SP is around five cell bodies thick and neuronal somata are densely packed, being SR the layer that contributes the most to the total CA1 thickness. In humans, SP can be up to 30 cell somata thick, with a wider separation of neurons compared to other species. As previously discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2020</xref>, this sometimes refers to a ‘corticalization’ of the human CA1 pyramidal cell layer because it resembles a neocortical cytoarchitecture, which most probably has fundamental functional and hodological consequences: the basal and apical dendrites of human pyramidal cells are intermixed in the pyramidal cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), whereas in rodents, the basal and apical dendritic arbors are basically separated (basal dendrites in SO; apical dendrites in SR).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic density</title><p>Synapses were found in all layers except the alveus where they were virtually nonexistent.

Since no quantitative 3D analysis of the synaptic organization in the human hippocampus has been performed before, our data could not be compared to previous reports. However, in recent studies from our group using FIB/SEM to analyze the synaptic density in the rodent CA1 field, the following values were obtained: 2.53 synapses/µm<sup>3</sup> in SO, 2.36 synapses/µm<sup>3</sup> in SR and 1.72 synapses/µm<sup>3</sup> in SLM in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Santuy et al., 2020</xref>), and 2.52 synapses/µm<sup>3</sup> in SR in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2020</xref>).

This data is in line with our study using FIB/SEM to analyze the synaptic density in the mouse (where the proportion of synapses that were inhibitory was 8% in the SLM, and approximately 2% in the case of the SR and SO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Santuy et al., 2020</xref>) and in the rat CA1 field (where 4% of the synapses in SR were inhibitory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Regarding postsynaptic preferences, we observed a clear preference of excitatory axons and inhibitory axons for dendritic spines and dendritic shafts, respectively, which is also characteristic in other cortical regions and species, although variations in their percentages have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Beaulieu and Colonnier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Beaulieu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Bourne and Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Megı́as et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Micheva and Beaulieu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Santuy et al., 2018a</xref>). For example, axospinous AS are especially abundant in sSP (87.61%) when compared to other brain regions in both humans and other species such as layer II of the human transentorhinal cortex, where axospinous AS account for only 55% of the total synaptic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Shape and size of the synapses</title><p>Most synapses presented a simple, macular shape (accounting for 86% of the synapses in all layers of CA1), in agreement with previous reports in different brain areas and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Geinisman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jones and Calverley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Neuman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Santuy et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>The shape and size of the synaptic junctions are strongly correlated with release probability, synaptic strength, efficacy and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Biederer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ganeshina et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, all three types of non-macular synapses (with more complex shapes) were larger than macular ones. Although the functional significance of perforations is still unclear, perforated synapses are known to have more AMPA and NMDA receptors than macular synapses and are thought to constitute a relatively powerful population of synapses with more long-lasting memory-related functionality than their smaller, macular counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ganeshina et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ganeshina et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vincent-Lamarre et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The size of both types of synaptic junctions (AS and SS) can be fitted to log-normal or log-logistic probability density functions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These distributions show a characteristic skewed shape, with a long tail to the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kumar and Kundu, 2009</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that small macular synapses predominate, while larger horseshoe or perforated synapses are less common. Indeed, previous studies from our laboratory found that AS and SS followed a log-normal distribution in all layers of the rat somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Santuy et al., 2018b</xref>). Interestingly, some other synaptic parameters —such as synaptic strength and spike transmission probability— follow log-normal distributions (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>). For example, the distribution of the size of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) is very similar to the distribution of the size of SAS reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Song et al., 2005</xref>). When analyzing the synaptic size distribution of pairs of synapses formed by the same axon, a quantized distribution of synaptic strengths yielding a similar skewed curve was observed in the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Bromer et al., 2018</xref>); since we did not trace the parental axon of each segmented synapse in our samples, it remains unclear whether a similar quantitation process occurs in the human hippocampus. Although the extraordinary diversity of excitatory synapse sizes is commonly attributed to activity-dependent processes that drive synaptic growth and diminution, recent studies also point to activity-independent size fluctuations, possibly driven by innate synaptic molecule dynamics, as important generators of size diversity. Specifically, activity-dependent processes seem to primarily dictate the scale rather than the shape of synaptic size distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hazan and Ziv, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Considering all synapses, excitatory contacts were larger than inhibitory ones, as has also been observed in layer II of the human transentorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2018</xref>); however, this contrasted with the findings in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Santuy et al., 2018b</xref>) and SR of CA1 in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2020</xref>). A tendency towards axodendritic synapses being bigger than axospinous synapses was also observed; however, this difference was only significant in the case of SLM synapses. Complex-shaped AS were also found more frequently associated with axodendritic AS than with axospinous AS in SLM, while the opposite was the case for the rest of the layers. These findings agree with reports in the rat hippocampus, where excitatory synapses on SLM dendrites were observed to be: (i) larger than synapses in other layers; (ii) more frequently perforated (approximately 40%); and (iii) located to a greater extent on dendritic shafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Megı́as et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Relation between synaptic inputs and synaptic organization of each layer</title><p>The wide range of differences in the synaptic organization of the human CA1 layers found in the present study, especially between SLM and the rest of layers, may be related to the variety of inputs arriving to these layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Unfortunately, detailed hippocampal human connectivity is far to be known: data directly obtained from human brains are very scarce and most data are inferred from rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spruston and McBain, 2007</xref>). In the primate brain, the CA1 field receives a wide variety of inputs from multiple subcortical and cortical brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spruston and McBain, 2007</xref>), being the major input to CA1 originated in the EC. Specifically, neurons located in layer III (and layer V) of the EC project directly to SLM, whereas neurons in layer II project to the rest of CA1 layers indirectly via the DG and CA3 field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Insausti and Amaral, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kondo et al., 2009</xref>). Considering both the synaptic data obtained in the present study and the connectivity knowledge in monkeys, it may seem that the synaptic organization in the layers receiving CA3 Schaffer collateral inputs (i.e. SO, SP and SR) differs with the synaptic organization found in the layer receiving direct inputs from the EC (i.e. SLM). Additionally, SLM receives a higher number of glutamatergic inputs from the amygdala and from the parietal and medial temporal cortex and higher numbers of serotonergic and Substance-P immunoreactive fibers, with a possible extrinsic origin in the Raphe nuclei and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the CA3-CA1 synaptic connection plays a key role in the learning-induced synaptic potentiation of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Whitlock et al., 2006</xref>), while the direct projection from EC to SLM of CA1 seems to modulate information flow through the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Dvorak-Carbone and Schuman, 1999</xref>). It has been reported that a high-frequency stimulation in SLM evokes an inhibition sufficiently strong to prevent CA1 pyramidal cells from spiking in response to Schaffer collaterals input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Dvorak-Carbone and Schuman, 1999</xref>). This finding could be supported by our present data showing an elevated inhibitory synapse ratio in comparison to other CA1 layers. It has also been described that afferents from the EC contact not only the apical tuft of CA1 pyramidal cells, but also interneurons of the SLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lacaille and Schwartzkroin, 1988</xref>). One of these interneurons are the neurogliaform cells, which receive monosynaptic inputs from the EC and are also synaptically coupled with each other and with CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Capogna, 2011</xref>). Whether the higher proportion of axodendritic synapses —particularly in aspiny shafts, which are likely to be originated from interneurons —, found in the present study in SLM compared to other CA1 layers is related to a particular synaptic circuit organization involving certain types of interneurons located in this layer remains to be elucidated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Paraformaldehyde</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich: 24898648</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Glutaraldehyde 25% EM</td><td>TAAB</td><td>TAAB: G002</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Calcium chloride</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich C2661</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Sodium cacodylate trihydrate</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich <break/>C0250</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Osmium tetroxide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich O5500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Potassium ferricyanide</td><td>Probus</td><td>Probus: <break/>23345</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Uranyl acetate</td><td>EMS</td><td>EMS: <break/>8473</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Araldite</td><td>TAAB</td><td>TAAB: <break/>E201</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Toluidine blue</td><td>Merck</td><td>Merck: <break/>115930</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Sodium borate</td><td>Panreac</td><td>Panreac: <break/>141644</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Silver paint</td><td>EMS</td><td>EMS: <break/>12630</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Stereo Investigator stereological package</td><td>MicroBrightField Inc</td><td>Version 8.0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Espina Interactive Neuron Analyzer</td><td>EspINA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cajalbbp.es/espina">https://cajalbbp.es/espina</ext-link></td><td>Version 2.4.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>ImageJ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td>ImageJ <break/>1.51</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Prism <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link></td><td>Version 7.00</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows</td><td>SPSS Software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ibm.com/es-es/analytics/spss-statistics-software">https://www.ibm.com/es-es/analytics/spss-statistics-software</ext-link></td><td>Version 24.0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R project</td><td>R software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link></td><td>Version 3.5.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Easyfit Proffesional</td><td>Easyfit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathwave.com/es/home.html">http://www.mathwave.com/es/home.html</ext-link></td><td>Version <break/>5.5</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling procedure</title><p>Human brain tissue was obtained from autopsies (with short post-mortem delays of less than 4.5 hours) from 5 subjects with no recorded neurological or psychiatric alterations (supplied by Unidad Asociada Neuromax, Laboratorio de Neuroanatomía Humana, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete and the Laboratorio Cajal de Circuitos Corticales UPM-CSIC, Madrid, Spain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1AE</xref>).

We used a 7-nA ion beam current with a 30-kV acceleration potential and a first coarse cross-section was milled as a viewing channel for SEM observation. The exposed surface of this cross-section was fine polished by lowering the ion beam current to 700 pA. Subsequently, layers from the fine polished cross-section were serially milled by scanning the ion beam parallel to the surface of the cutting plane using the same ion beam current. To mill each layer, the ion beam was automatically moved closer to the surface of the cross-section by preset increments of 20 nm, which corresponded to the thickness of the layers. After the removal of each slice, the milling process was paused and the freshly exposed surface was imaged using a 1.8-nA probe current with a 1.7-kV acceleration potential using the in-column energy-selective backscattered electron detector (EsB).

Resolution in the z-axis (section thickness) was 20 nm, and image size was 2,048 x 1,536 pixels.

The volume per stack ranged from 356 μm<sup>3</sup> to 727 μm<sup>3</sup> (225 and 459 images, respectively). All measurements were corrected for the tissue shrinkage that occurs during osmication and plastic-embedding of the vibratome sections containing the area of interest, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009</xref>.

The surface area after processing was divided by the value before processing to obtain an area shrinkage factor (p<sup>2</sup>) of 0.933. The linear shrinkage factor for measurements in the plane of the section (p) was therefore 0.966. The shrinkage factor in the z-axis was 0.901. In addition, the total volume was corrected for the presence of fixation artifacts, which did not affect the accurate identification and quantitation of synapses (i.e., swollen neuronal or glial processes). The volume occupied by these artifacts was calculated applying the Cavalieri principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gundersen et al., 1988</xref>) and was discounted from the volume of the stacks of images to avoid underestimation of the number of synapses per volume.

The main characteristic distinguishing these synapses is the prominent or thin post-synaptic density, respectively. Nevertheless, in single sections, the synaptic cleft and the pre- and post-synaptic densities are often blurred if the plane of the section does not pass at right angles to the synaptic junction. Since the software EspINA allows navigation through the stack of images, it was possible to unambiguously identify every synapse as AS or SS based on the thickness of the PSD. Synapses with prominent PSDs are classified as AS, while thin PSDs are classified as SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, based on the postsynaptic targets, synapses were further classified as axospinous synapses (synapses on dendritic spines) and axodendritic synapses (synapses on dendritic shafts).

For axodendritic synapses, dendritic shafts were further classified as spiny (when dendritic spines could be observed emerging from the shaft) or aspiny.

Since the AZ and the PSD are located face to face, their surface areas are very similar (correlation coefficients over 0.97; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schikorski and Stevens, 1999</xref>). Thus, as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref>), they can be simplified to a single surface and represented as the surface of apposition between the AZ and the PSD. This surface can be extracted from the 3D segmented synaptic junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref>). For the sake of clarity, we have referred to this surface as the synaptic apposition surface (SAS). We consider SAS morphological measurements to be a better approach to the assessment of synaptic size than measurements obtained from the 3D segmented synaptic junctions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morales et al., 2013</xref> for more detailed information about SAS extraction and its relation to presynaptic density and PSD). We observed in our samples that the SAS area is highly correlated to the surface (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96 for AS; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 for SS) and the volume (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for AS; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90 for SS) of the 3D segmented synaptic junctions.</p><p>The SAS area and perimeter of each synaptic junction was extracted with EspINA software to study morphological parameters regarding synapses. EspINA software also permits the quantitation of the curvature of the synapses as it adapts to the curvature of the synaptic junction. Specifically, curvature measurements are calculated as 1 minus the ratio between the projected area of the SAS and the area of the SAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Morales et al., 2011</xref>). This measurement would be 0 in a flat SAS and would increase its value to a maximum of 1 as the SAS curvature increases.</p><p>The spatial distribution of synapses was determined by performing a Spatial Point Pattern analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Anton-Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Merchán-Pérez et al., 2014</xref>). The position of centroids of the synapses was compared to the Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) model, which defines a situation where a point is equally probable to occur at any location within a given volume. For each stack of images, functions F, G and K were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the distance of every synapse to its nearest synapse was measured. This study was carried out using Spatstat package and R Project software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Baddeley et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using GraphPad Prism statistical package (Prism 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software Inc, USA), SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp), Easyfit Proffessional 5.5 (MathWave Technologies) and R Project software (R 3.5.1; Bell Laboratories, NJ, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>). Differences in the V<sub>v</sub> occupied by cortical elements; synaptic density; and morphological and spatial parameters were analyzed performing either a two-sided, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey post hoc corrections, or Mann-Whitney U (MW) nonparametric test, as appropriate. Frequency distributions were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) nonparametric tests. Chi-squared (χ<sup>2</sup>) tests were used for contingency tables. In general, for any contingency table, the expected frequency for a cell in the i<sup>th</sup> row and the j<sup>th</sup> column is E<sub>ij</sub> = T<sub>i</sub>T<sub>j</sub>/T, where T<sub>i</sub> is the marginal total for the i<sup>th</sup> row, T<sub>j</sub> is the marginal total for the j<sup>th</sup> column, and T is the total number of observations. χ² tests of association were applied to these tables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sharpe, 2015</xref>). The criterion for statistical significance was considered to be met for p&lt;0.05 when the sample size was equal to the number of subjects (i.e., ANOVA and MW tests), and for p&lt;0.001 when the sample size was equal to the number of synapses (i.e., KS and χ<sup>2</sup> tests), in order to avoid overestimation of the differences due to a very big sample size.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Carmen Álvarez, Miriam Martín and Lorena Valdés for their helpful technical assistance and Nick Guthrie for his excellent text editing.

Additionally, CA1 sends projections to the medial septal nucleus (Ch1), vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (Ch2) and the nucleus accumbens, and it is known that these projections are not shared with the subiculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aggleton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Friedman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosene and Van Hoesen, 1977</xref>).

Electron microscopy (EM) remains the golden standard in mapping synaptic connections, but reconstructing synaptic circuits from even a modest volume of brain tissue remains technically challenging. Montero-Crespo et al. used the novel focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to reconstruct a large number (24,752) of synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region from human brain autopsy specimens. They analyzed a variety of structural parameters including synaptic density, spatial distribution, synapse type, shape, size, and postsynaptic targets. They found remarkable differences in these parameters across CA1 layers.</p><p>This study provides a wealth of data on synaptic connections in hippocampal CA1 region, which will be highly informative for future studies on its physiological and computational roles. Moreover, this paper examines brain autopsy samples from deceased humans without recorded neurological or psychiatric alterations.

This is clearly the most extensive description of the human CA1 neuropil to date. While primarily being solely descriptive in nature, I think it is nevertheless a benchmark paper that will serve as a reference for future human and comparative studies. The major findings include differences in synaptic density across CA1 layers, differences in synapse shape between layers and specializations particular to the SLM layer. In the Discussion, the authors do a reasonable job trying to relate their findings to connectivity information from primate studies. If anything, I would recommend expanding the discussion comparing the results to those in rodents since I think that would broaden the interest. I think perhaps adding a table to a main figure summarizing the most important species differences would also help.</p><p>I had just a few questions/points:</p><p>1) Please add the imaging parameters of the FIB/SEM (e.g., electron energy and current, dwell time, ion beam current, etc…)</p><p>2) I didn't really understand the correction applied to compensate for fixation artifacts (subsection “FIB/SEM technology”). Please expand. It sounds like two corrections were performed, one for EM/embedding shrinkage of around 7%, and then a stack specific correction for fixation artifacts. I didn't understand how the fixation artifact was measured and what was actually done to the FIB/SEM volumes to correct for it. Since these corrections are critical to the interpretation of the data (such as synapses densities, etc…), an explicit example of how the corrections were done is important to show.</p><p>3) Were all judgments about synapse type and shape made by a single annotator or as a consensus among multiple annotators?</p><p>4) Did the authors ever find multiple synapses onto a postsynaptic target originating from the same presynaptic axon? Or were the volumes too small for this?</p><p>5) Typo in the last paragraph of the subsection “Relation between synaptic inputs and synaptic organization of each layer”, should be 'afferents' I think.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57013.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This study provides a wealth of data on synaptic connections in hippocampal CA1 region, which will be highly informative for future studies on its physiological and computational roles.

We completely agree with the reviewer that tracing the dendritic and axonal segments to get further information about individual segmented synapses is of great importance in terms of the human connectome. However, performing this study with thousands of synapses, dendrites and axons would be very time-consuming and technically challenging. Certainly, we could carry out this study with a relatively small subset of the reconstructed synapses to accelerate the process, but the obtained connectivity data would be less robust than if we were to use all of the reconstructed synapses that we were able to achieve. For these reasons, our laboratory is currently developing a software tool that will allow us to accurately and reliably trace and reconstruct a large number of axonal and dendritic segments contained within the FIB/SEM stacks. In our opinion, this analysis would make it possible to accurately answer important questions regarding pre- and post-synaptic elements in detail and in relation to their parental neuronal processes. Thus, we are expecting to answer these questions in the near future.

These distributions, with some variations in the parameters of the functions (Supplementary file 1L), were found in each layer and the whole CA1 (all layers pooled together) for both AS and SS (Supplementary file 1L; Figure 6—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“The size of both types of synaptic junctions (AS and SS) fit log-normal or loglogistic probability density functions (see Figure 6—figure supplement 2). […] Specifically, activity-dependent processes seem to primarily dictate the scale rather than the shape of synaptic size distributions (Hazan and Ziv, 2020).”</p><p>In the Materials and methods, the sentence:</p><p>“Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using GraphPad Prism statistical package (Prism 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software Inc, USA), SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0.

This is clearly the most extensive description of the human CA1 neuropil to date. While primarily being solely descriptive in nature, I think it is nevertheless a benchmark paper that will serve as a reference for future human and comparative studies. The major findings include differences in synaptic density across CA1 layers, differences in synapse shape between layers and specializations particular to the SLM layer. In the Discussion, the authors do a reasonable job trying to relate their findings to connectivity information from primate studies. If anything, I would recommend expanding the discussion comparing the results to those in rodents since I think that would broaden the interest. I think perhaps adding a table to a main figure summarizing the most important species differences would also help.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for his/her support. Certainly, one of our main interests is in the comparative studies. Indeed, we are planning to write a review paper dealing with comparative analysis of the synaptic organization in the CA1 neuropil of humans compared to CA1 in rats and mice. Importantly, estimations of synaptic density, size and types of synapses, using conventional electron microscopy (TEM) – which is the technique used in most EM studies – is based on the analysis of relatively few serial EM sections or stereological approaches, whereas with FIB/SEM it is possible to obtain multiple samples with thousands of serial sections with the number of synapses being directly counted in the stacks of images. Thus, at present we are performing comparative studies between species and techniques in order to get a clearer picture of these studies. For example, we are comparing the synaptic organization in the CA1 of rats and mice using FIB/SEM examined in our lab with previous data using TEM in the same species. In addition, we are comparing the data obtained in the present study of the human CA1 with that obtained in the rodents. We hope to finish this review in the next few months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had just a few questions/points:</p><p>1) Please add the imaging parameters of the FIB/SEM (e.g., electron energy and current, dwell time, ion beam current, etc…)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional information regarding the sample preparation for FIB/SEM and FIB/SEM imaging.</p><p>The following information has been added:</p><p>“The blocks containing the embedded tissue were then glued onto a sample stub using conductive adhesive tabs (EMS 77825-09, Hatfield, PA, USA).

Please expand. It sounds like two corrections were performed, one for EM/embedding shrinkage of around 7%, and then a stack specific correction for fixation artifacts. I didn't understand how the fixation artifact was measured and what was actually done to the FIB/SEM volumes to correct for it. Since these corrections are critical to the interpretation of the data (such as synapses densities, etc…), an explicit example of how the corrections were done is important to show.</p></disp-quote><p>To make the two volume corrections applied clearer, the following paragraph:</p><p>“Volume measurements were corrected for tissue shrinkage due to EM processing (Merchán-Pérez et al., 2009) with a shrinkage factor obtained by dividing the area of the tissue after processing by the area of the same tissue before processing (p=0.933).
