In the original MicroED proof of concept paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2013</xref>), electron diffraction data were collected from stationary lysozyme microcrystals and the structure was determined to 2.9 Å resolution from a series of still diffraction patterns. The method was substantially improved by employing ‘continuous rotation’ where data were recorded as the crystals were continuously rotated, resulting in higher quality data and allowing simple integration with existing processing programs used for X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nannenga et al., 2014</xref>). This led to the structure of lysozyme being determined to 2.5 Å resolution with improved statistics and data quality relative to the original lysozyme MicroED study.</p><p>In this work, we used thin bovine liver catalase 3D microcrystals for structure determination by MicroED. Catalase is a more difficult target than lysozyme, because it has a much larger unit cell, lower symmetry, and four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Moreover, each catalase monomer contains one heme group as well as a bound NADP molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fita and Rossmann, 1985</xref>). Catalase is one of the earliest samples studied by EM, but despite extensive efforts spanning decades, the 3D structure of catalase has not been solved using electron diffraction. This is because the crystals have variable thicknesses (6–10 protein layers have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dorset and Parsons, 1975b</xref>]), and therefore these crystals were not suitable for 3D structure determination by traditional electron crystallography procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Longley, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matricardi et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Unwin, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorset and Parsons, 1975a</xref>). Here we report the 3.2 Å structure of catalase determined by MicroED. This is an important next step for the MicroED method as the analysis was rapid, taking a total of 3 weeks from crystal growth to final structural refinement, and used data from only a single catalase microcrystal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sample preparation and data collection</title><p>Catalase was chosen for this study as it readily forms thin 3D microcrystals, which can be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sumner and Dounce, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorset and Parsons, 1975a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). Well-ordered catalase microcrystals were grown by solubilizing crystalline catalase from an aqueous suspension followed by overnight dialysis in 0.05 M Sodium phosphate, pH 6.3. Following crystal formation, crystals were deposited on holey carbon grids and the sample was blotted and vitrified in liquid ethane prior to TEM analysis. The grids were screened in over-focused diffraction mode for the presence of thin 3D crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, inset). The average crystal dimensions were found to be on the order of 8 µm by 4 µm in length and width and approximately 150 nm thick, in good agreement with previous crystallization results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dorset and Parsons, 1975b</xref>). Suitable crystals were assessed by collecting a single still diffraction pattern at a total dose of 0.05 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, where well-ordered crystals showed sharp reflections extending to approximately 3.0 Å for untilted crystals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When high-quality diffraction was observed for an untilted crystal, the crystal was then tilted to 60° to check the diffraction quality at higher tilt angles as crystal flatness and embedding could affect the diffraction quality at higher tilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonen, 2013</xref>). Typically, well-embedded and relatively flat crystals yielded data to ∼2.8 Å resolution untilted but only ∼3.2 Å at high tilt. Data sets were then collected as a sequence of 6 s exposures per frame. An example data set is shown in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and was recorded as the stage was continuously rotated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nannenga et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03600.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diffraction from catalase microcrystals.</title><p>Representative untilted still diffraction pattern of a catalase microcrystal that shows sharp reflections extending to approximately 3.0 Å.

We quantified the dynamic scattering of the catalase crystals using the ratio of the strongest diffracted intensity to the unscattered incident beam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>), as well as the ratio of the sum of all diffracted intensities on an image to the incident beam intensity as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorset and Parsons (1975a)</xref>. For the kinematical theory to apply, these ratios must be low. A representative crystal, which was approximately 200 nm thick, showed a ratio of 8.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for the maximum intensity and 0.18 for the sum of all intensities, which are close to the previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorset and Parsons, 1975a</xref>), indicating that kinematical assumption is valid for these diffraction data.</p><p>Data sets from five microcrystals were each integrated with MOSFLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leslie and Powell, 2007</xref>) followed by merging and scaling with POINTLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans, 2011</xref>) and AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>). All crystals yielded comparable resolution but varied in data completeness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We combined all five data sets in an effort to increase completeness, multiplicity and to improve the quality of the data and in parallel we processed the data from crystal 4 separately for comparison. Crystal 4 was chosen for processing separately because it had a good compromise between resolution and completeness. The data sets were processed to a range of resolutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and phases were determined by molecular replacement (MR) as implemented in MOLREP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997</xref>) with PDB ID: 3NWL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foroughi et al., 2011</xref>) as a search model. Following MR, refinement using PHENIX and REFMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) with electron scattering factors was performed. Merging data from multiple crystals did not have a significant effect on data completeness, because the catalase crystals all orient on the grid with the c-axis parallel to the electron beam (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). When comparing the statistics presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, it was clear that merging multiple crystals had a negative impact on the final refinement statistics, most likely due to non-isomorphism between crystals, and therefore the multiple crystal data sets were disregarded. Crystals 1, 2, 3, and 5 were relatively isomorphous and their diffraction data merged well, but the completeness of this data set was low (∼62%), and we chose not to use it.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03600.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Resolution and completeness for catalase data sets</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03600.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03600.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Crystal 1</th><th>Crystal 2</th><th>Crystal 3</th><th>Crystal 4<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></th><th>Crystal 5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Resolution (Å)</td><td>27.9–2.8</td><td>21.1–2.9</td><td>16.4–2.9</td><td>21.2–3.0</td><td>20.8–3.5</td></tr><tr><td>(3.0–2.8)</td><td>(3.0–2.9)</td><td>(3.0–2.9)</td><td>(3.1–3.0)</td><td>(3.9–3.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Unit cell dimensions</td></tr><tr><td> a (Å)</td><td>68.7</td><td>68.5</td><td>67.8</td><td>67.8</td><td>67.9</td></tr><tr><td> b (Å)</td><td>170.4</td><td>170.1</td><td>171.1</td><td>172.1</td><td>171.3</td></tr><tr><td> c (Å)</td><td>205.0</td><td>203.6</td><td>204.5</td><td>182.1</td><td>202.3</td></tr><tr><td> α = β = γ (°)</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Completeness (%)</td><td>30.2</td><td>28.1</td><td>51.7</td><td>76.5</td><td>61.6</td></tr><tr><td>(37.1)</td><td>(24.0)</td><td>(42.2)</td><td>(62.4)</td><td>(56.9)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Values in parentheses reflect the highest resolution shell.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>Data set used for final structure.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03600.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Comparison of merging and refinement statistics for catalase data sets</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03600.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03600.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Multi-2.8 Å</th><th>Multi-3.0 Å</th><th>Multi-3.2 Å</th><th>Single-3.0 Å</th><th>Single-3.2 Å<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total crystals</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Resolution (Å)</td><td>27.8–2.8</td><td>27.8–3.0</td><td>27.8–3.2</td><td>21.2–3.0</td><td>21.2–3.2</td></tr><tr><td>(2.9–2.8)</td><td>(3.1–3.0)</td><td>(3.4–3.2)</td><td>(3.1–3.0)</td><td>(3.4–3.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">R<sub>merge</sub> (%)</td><td>25.8</td><td>25.5</td><td>24.8</td><td>18.7</td><td>17.5</td></tr><tr><td>(42.0)</td><td>(41.2)</td><td>(38.2)</td><td>(38.8)</td><td>(32.7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">CC<sub>1/2</sub></td><td>0.906</td><td>0.920</td><td>0.933</td><td>0.886</td><td>0.891</td></tr><tr><td>(0.231)</td><td>(0.348)</td><td>(0.574)</td><td>(0.426)</td><td>(0.555)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Multiplicity</td><td>4.8</td><td>5.2</td><td>5.6</td><td>2.4</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>(2.0)</td><td>(3.1)</td><td>(3.6)</td><td>(2.2)</td><td>(2.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Completeness (%)</td><td>71.8</td><td>78.1</td><td>80.1</td><td>76.5</td><td>79.4</td></tr><tr><td>(35.2)</td><td>(61.8)</td><td>(72.2)</td><td>(62.4)</td><td>(75.5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Mean (I/σ(I))</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.4</td><td>3.5</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.4</td></tr><tr><td>(2.5)</td><td>(2.2)</td><td>(2.1)</td><td>(1.7)</td><td>(2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub></td><td>36.1/39.2</td><td>37.1/38.4</td><td>34.6/37.3</td><td>27.3/31.9</td><td>26.2/30.8</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Values in parentheses reflect the highest resolution shell.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>*</label><p>Data set used for final structure.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>The single crystal 4 dataset was used for the remainder of the study.

While the incompleteness of data is significant, the resulting maps are still expected to be good enough for proper interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glaeser et al., 1989</xref>). To test the quality of the data and the resulting maps, and to identify any significant model bias or negative effects of the data incompleteness, the data were put through several validation tests. First, the robustness of the MR solution was tested by repeating the MR with a single monomeric chain of PDB ID: 3NWL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foroughi et al., 2011</xref>) instead of the complete tetramer that was used originally. Even with a single chain, a strong solution was found with all four molecules successfully placed to recreate the complete tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; top MOLREP contrast score = 35.8, where a score of &gt;3.0 is considered a strong solution. An identical test with synchrotron X-ray data yielded a top score of 23.7). We also phased the data with a poly-alanine model derived from PDB ID: 3NWL, and the resulting maps show clear density beyond the model where the correct side-chains could be rebuilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the quality of the resulting maps following MR, autobuilding with Buccaneer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cowtan, 2006</xref>) was performed and yielded 2120 residues in 160 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Out of the built residues, 1280 traced the correct backbone and 467 side-chains were correctly assigned. Manual curation in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), exploiting the fourfold non-crystallographic symmetry, resulted in a nearly complete model indicating the maps initially produced from our data were of good quality.</p><p>The next validation test performed involved removing sections of the model and analyzing the effect this had on the resulting refined density maps. This was done in order to examine the strength of the data and to find any potential model bias introduced by the MR search model. For this test, two validation models were used, in which the same sections of all four monomers of the final tetrameric structure were removed. The first model had residues 181 to 185 removed (∆181–185) and the second model lacked the four heme groups (∆heme) that are normally found in catalase. Following refinement and simulated annealing, the resulting difference maps from the ∆181–185 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and ∆heme model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) both showed significant positive difference density corresponding to the deleted regions of the model. Additionally, automated ligand identification was performed on the ∆heme maps using phenix.ligand_identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Terwilliger et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2007</xref>), and the program was able to correctly place two of the four heme groups present in the structure. The results of these tests indicate that the data do not suffer from bias introduced by the MR search model.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03600.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Final Model validation tests.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) To check for model bias in the final MicroED data (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>C</bold>), and to compare with data obtained from synchrotron X-ray diffraction (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>D</bold>), residues 181–185 (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) or the heme groups (<bold>C</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) from all four chains were removed prior to simulated annealing and re-refinement.

Bovine catalase binds four NADP cofactors, one per monomer through several side-chain interactions including F197 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirkman and Gaetani, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fita and Rossmann, 1985</xref>). Recently, the structure of bovine catalase was solved lacking the NADP cofactor (PDB ID: 3RGP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Purwar et al., 2011</xref>), and in the NADP-free structure F197 underwent a conformational change as it no longer interacted with NADP. The crystals used for our MicroED analysis do contain NADP. Therefore, we used PDB ID: 3RGP (NADP-free structure) as a molecular replacement model against the MicroED data to determine whether NADP could be visualized in our catalase crystals using difference maps. When analyzing the difference maps, positive density was observed in the location expected for NADP although it appeared fragmented even at lower contour levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). For visual comparison, structure factors from PDB ID: 3NWL, which was solved by X-ray crystallography, were truncated to 3.2 Å, and difference maps were calculated for ∆181–185, ∆heme and NADP-free model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,F,H</xref>). Maps from both MicroED and synchrotron X-ray diffraction appear fragmented around the NADP even at lower contour levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). The difference maps for both the MicroED and X-ray synchrotron data suggest that F197 should change its orientation to assume its correct position for NADP binding.</p><p>These results demonstrate the MicroED data is of sufficient quality to detect subtle differences among structures at atomic resolution. At the current level of methodology with samples that suffer from missing data like catalase, MicroED produces lower quality maps than synchrotron X-ray diffraction. However, the catalase crystals used for MicroED were approximately 1000 times smaller in volume than those used at the synchrotron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foroughi et al., 2011</xref>), and the resulting maps are still of high enough quality to determine the structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>We present here the second protein structure determined by the emerging MicroED method. Bovine liver catalase resisted structural determination by traditional electron crystallography for decades, but the structure was readily determined by MicroED in 3 weeks from crystal formation to final structure determination using a single crystal. This is the second example where a single crystal was sufficient for structure determination by MicroED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nannenga et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the continuous rotation method yields data similar in quality to X-ray diffraction allowing simple processing with existing X-ray data reduction software and further accelerating structure analysis by MicroED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nannenga et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting maps allow us to distinguish between subtly different protein conformations and to identify of small-molecule ligands such as NADP. This study shows that MicroED can be used as an alternative to X-ray crystallography using extremely small crystals for both mechanistic studies as well as structure-based drug design studies where small ligands are assayed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Catalase crystallization and sample preparation</title><p>Catalase was recrystallized from a commercial aqueous suspension of catalase (C100; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by first centrifuging the crystalline suspension and dissolving the pellet in 1.7 M NaCl.

Your Research advance has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Henderson (one of the peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This submission, a Research advance to the earlier Shi et al. paper, shows that electron diffraction can be used to determine the structure of catalase by molecular replacement from the known structure from x-ray crystallography. Does it add anything to the earlier paper on MicroED of lysozyme? Catalase is a much larger protein than lysozyme with much weaker diffraction, and it is a crystal form with a long track record for use as a test specimen for magnification calibration. The paper therefore does move the method forward, and it is in principle suitable to publish as an “advance”.</p><p>The reviewers were disappointed that the analysis was not very thorough. In particular:</p><p>1) The diffraction image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) shows spots well past 2.8 A, but the structure was refined only to 3.2 A. Why was it not processed and refined to the diffraction limit of the crystal? A similar concern was raised by the reviewers of the original paper on lysozyme. It should be noted that the deposited crystal structures of catalase obtained by conventional X-ray crystallography were refined to substantially higher resolution.</p><p>2) The diffraction data are rather incomplete (∼80%), in a systematic way that by itself diminishes accuracy (missing wedge).</p><p>3) The omit maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C, D, E</xref>) are poor, even considering a refinement-diffraction limit of 3.2 A. The authors need to determine why these maps are so poor. Is it related to data quality? They may wish to use the X-ray diffraction data of catalase (PDB IDs 3NWL or 4BLC), truncated to 3.2 A, and then perform similar validation tests, as a benchmark. It certainly would have been nearly impossible to identify the NADP molecule in such a poor map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), and the heme group would have been a stretch, even knowing the identity of the ligand.</p><p>4) Only a single data set was analyzed, Redundancy could have improved the quality of the data, and it would have allowed the authors to assess the limitations imposed by data accuracy.</p><p>Reviewers also raised some more specific technical questions:</p><p>1) In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the crystal shown is not the crystal (size roughly 12x4 um) used for data collection. The electron diffraction pattern is not the one used to collect the data used in the structure determination. The legend and the text state that the crystals were 8x4 um on average, yet the crystal used for the data collection was one of the larger ones at 15x7 um, and at 0.18um thick was also one of the thicker ones. In a sense, this rather undermines the unique selling point of MicroED. This observation does not invalidate the paper, but does reduce its potential impact. On the other hand, the work presented does demonstrate that there are no other serious problems (such as dynamical scattering); if it works on a big crystal, then it should also work on a smaller crystal, although it will be more work to collect the data because more crystals would be needed.</p><p>2) It is stated that an average crystal shows a maximum intensity for the strongest spot of 8.4 x 10**-3 of the direct beam. This is about 1% so the amplitude of that diffracted beam would be about 10% of the direct beam. This would produce some dynamical scattering. Since the crystal they actually used for the data collection was bigger than the average, it would presumably have a larger contribution from dynamical scattering. It would be useful if the authors had tried to further refine the structure using a protocol such as used by Grigorieff &amp; Henderson in Ultramicroscopy, 1996. This would show how much the R-factor had been affected by dynamical scattering (i.e. increased by how much).</p><p>There was some discussion among the reviewers about whether these weaknesses eliminated the submission from further consideration, but we ultimately concurred that with careful attention to the points above, this work would meet the criteria of the new <italic>eLife</italic> category of “advance”. We would thus be willing to review a revised version that met the following criteria:</p><p>1) Analysis at full resolution. In the current version, the authors write that they cut off the data at 3.2 A because of merging statistics (text,<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). But an Rmerge of 32.7% and I/sigma(I) of 2 in the highest resolution bin is too strict. The authors should go at least to I/sigma(I) ∼ 1 and Rmerge in the last bin of 50% or even higher.</p><p>2) Efforts to reduce the substantial missing wedge (incompleteness).</p><p>3) Explicit evaluation of data quality and the effect of data quality on the clarity of the omit maps.</p><p>4) Evaluation of data from multiple crystals (this could be part of the response to criteria 2 and 3).</p><p>Additional analyses that the authors might wish to carry out (but not required for review) include use of several smaller and thinner crystals for data collection and a quantitative effort to get a lower R-factor by an explicit attempt to model the dynamical scattering quantitatively.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your Research advance entitled “Structure of catalase solved by MicroED” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers (Axel T Brunger and Richard Henderson). The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that many of their questions were answered by the revisions, although at least one of them felt that the paper would have been better had the authors collected more data from more crystals. Despite some mild disappointment, the consensus was to recommend publication, if the authors comply with the requests that follow.</p><p>1) The section that describes how the authors collected diffraction data from five different crystals is useful, since it shows how merging the data did not result in any improvement. They ascribe this outcome to lack of isomorphism, presumably due to slight cell dimension changes during the freezing. The authors should include in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> what the cell dimensions were for each of the five crystals, to show whether the non-isomorphism is apparent as cell dimension variability.</p><p>2) A useful addition is comparison of the molecular replacement solution and Fo-Fc difference maps with those from a set of X-ray data truncated to the same (3.2 Å) resolution. A “MOLREP contrast score” of 35.8 and 40.8 for the electron diffraction and equivalent truncated X-ray data will not be understood by most readers, however, as few of them will have used MOLREP. The authors should give a reference to an earlier paper or to a review by Vagin &amp; Teplyakov in which the significance of 35.8 or 40.8 is discussed.</p><p>3) The reasons for data truncation at 3.2 Å should be stated clearly again (i.e., that the tilted crystals did not yield data beyond that limit).</p><p>4) Figure 4–figure supplement 2. This entire supplemental figure is an important validation of the method, so it must be included in the main part of the manuscript. Moreover, two different contour levels must be provided in panels C and D – it appears that the synchrotron map is better connected, whereas the microED map shows a false connection for the NADP. These differences will become probably become even clearer at a lower contour level.</p><p>5) In connection with the omit map results, currently in Figure 4–figure supplement 2 (to be moved to main part of the manuscript), it should be stated clearly in the main text that at the current level of the microED methodology, the maps obtained by microED are not of the same quality as those obtained by x-ray diffraction at synchrotrons. The microED maps are certainly not of “similar quality”, as stated (incorrectly) in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03600.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The diffraction image (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>) shows spots well past 2.8 A, but the structure was refined only to 3.2 A. Why was it not processed and refined to the diffraction limit of the crystal? A similar concern was raised by the reviewers of the original paper on lysozyme. It should be noted that the deposited crystal structures of catalase obtained by conventional X-ray crystallography were refined to substantially higher resolution</italic>.</p><p>As presented in the revised manuscript, we have processed the data to 2.8 Å resolution. However, we note that such high resolution was obtained from untilted crystals. Once the crystals were tilted the resolution was typically lower. Therefore the data completeness at high resolution was rather low and we decided to truncate the resolution to a final 3.2 Å.</p><p><italic>2) The diffraction data are rather incomplete (∼80%), in a systematic way that by itself diminishes accuracy (missing wedge)</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct in that this data does suffer from a missing wedge. Catalase crystals are long and wide but are thin and they always orient on the grid with their c-axis parallel to the electron beam. As the reviewers know, one can only tilt to a maximum angle of ∼70° in the EM before the beam is blocked by the holder. Therefore, crystals such as these will always have a missing wedge and are analogous to traditional 2D crystals in that respect.</p><p>We note that for different crystal forms, for example lysozyme, as crystals randomly orient on the grid the addition of multiple data sets from different crystals reduces and can eliminate the missing wedge. Therefore this problem is not universal but unfortunately does exist for catalase.</p><p>As we tilted the crystals up to 60° the expected missing wedge is ∼15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glaeser et al., 1989</xref>) while our data suggests ∼80% completeness. Therefore we have covered the reciprocal space as much as we could and additional data from multiple crystals did not increase the completeness. We present this data in the revised version.</p><p>Nevertheless, all of our map and model validations indicate that the final map is of good quality that does not suffer from major deformations (for example stretching of the maps as observed in some examples of density maps from 2D crystals).</p><p><italic>3) The omit maps (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B,C, D, E</italic></xref><italic>) are poor, even considering a refinement-diffraction limit of 3.2 A. The authors need to determine why these maps are so poor. Is it related to data quality? They may wish to use the X-ray diffraction data of catalase (PDB IDs 3NWL or 4BLC), truncated to 3.2 A, and then perform similar validation tests, as a benchmark. It certainly would have been nearly impossible to identify the NADP molecule in such a poor map (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D,E</italic></xref><italic>), and the heme group would have been a stretch, even knowing the identity of the ligand</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now generated maps using the published X-ray data (PDB ID: 3NWL) truncated to 3.2 Å and perform a comparison with our density maps for the NADP. The analysis suggests that at this resolution the density map from X-ray is equivalent in quality to the density map from MicroED. Moreover, we performed additional analyses that are presented in this revised manuscript. Phasing with a poly-alanine model indicated that the density “mutates” toward the correct residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Supplementary Figure 1B and C</xref>). Finally, we subjected the initial resulting maps (prior to refinement) to auto ligand find and auto build. The first found strong match for 2 of the 4 heme groups and the latter was able to build ∼65% of the protein automatically. These results indicate that the catalase data are of high quality.</p><p>All of these tests have been included in the revised text.</p><p><italic>4) Only a single data set was analyzed, Redundancy could have improved the quality of the data, and it would have allowed the authors to assess the limitations imposed by data accuracy</italic>.</p><p>Please see discussion above. We now include an analysis of 5 crystals and show that since all catalase crystals orient the same way on the grid with their c-axis parallel to the electron beam, we will always have a missing wedge of data in the catalase example. Therefore data from additional crystals did not increase the completeness. This discussion is now included in the revised text.</p><p><italic>Reviewers also raised some more specific technical questions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) In the legend to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, the crystal shown is not the crystal (size roughly 12x4 um) used for data collection. The electron diffraction pattern is not the one used to collect the data used in the structure determination. The legend and the text state that the crystals were 8x4 um on average, yet the crystal used for the data collection was one of the larger ones at 15x7 um, and at 0.18um thick was also one of the thicker ones. In a sense, this rather undermines the unique selling point of MicroED. This observation does not invalidate the paper, but does reduce its potential impact. On the other hand, the work presented does demonstrate that there are no other serious problems (such as dynamical scattering); if it works on a big crystal, then it should also work on a smaller crystal, although it will be more work to collect the data because more crystals would be needed</italic>.</p><p>We believe that there is a misunderstanding. Even though the crystals are wide and long, they are still very thin at 100-200 nm. It is the thickness of the crystal, through which the electron beam must pass, that could be the limiting factor when considering dynamical scattering, not the width and length of the crystal. Please remember that we cannot tilt the crystals completely on their side so the beam never travels through a 15 micron or 7 micron thick crystal. Moreover, we use a selected area aperture (6 micron diameter at the specimen), therefore we disagree that this “undermines the unique selling point of MicroED” because crystals of 100-200 nm thickness cannot be studied by traditional x-ray crystallography but are studied here.</p><p><italic>2) It is stated that an average crystal shows a maximum intensity for the strongest spot of 8.4 x 10**-3 of the direct beam. This is about 1% so the amplitude of that diffracted beam would be about 10% of the direct beam. This would produce some dynamical scattering. Since the crystal they actually used for the data collection was bigger than the average, it would presumably have a larger contribution from dynamical scattering. It would be useful if the authors had tried to further refine the structure using a protocol such as used by Grigorieff &amp; Henderson in Ultramicroscopy, 1996. This would show how much the R-factor had been affected by dynamical scattering (i.e. increased by how much)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this fine suggestion.</p><p>We have shown previously that an error of up to 35% in intensity values still yield acceptable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Others have also shown that for catalase crystals of this thickness, kinematic scattering can be assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorset and Parsons, 1975a</xref>). Even though the crystal we chose to focus on is one of the thicker ones in our sample, it is still only ∼180 nm in thickness and kinematic scattering can still be assumed as we discussed.</p><p>We agree, however, with the reviewers that some dynamical scattering will be produced and we have not, as of yet, applied any corrections. We plan to do so in the future.</p><p><italic>There was some discussion among the reviewers about whether these weaknesses eliminated the submission from further consideration, but we ultimately concurred that with careful attention to the points above, this work would meet the criteria of the new</italic> eLife <italic>category of “advance”</italic>. <italic>We would thus be willing to review a revised version that met the following criteria:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Analysis at full resolution. In the current version, the authors write that they cut off the data at 3.2 A because of merging statistics (text,</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref><italic>). But an Rmerge of 32.7% and I/sigma(I) of 2 in the highest resolution bin is too strict. The authors should go at least to I/sigma(I) ∼ 1 and Rmerge in the last bin of 50% or even higher</italic>.</p><p>We now include analysis at full resolution and from multiple crystals. We have presented a more detailed analysis on how the final data set was chosen based on completeness, merging and the final refinement statistics. In short, the low information content in the higher resolution shells precludes their inclusion.</p><p><italic>2) Efforts to reduce the substantial missing wedge (incompleteness)</italic>.</p><p>As discussed above, the preferred orientation of the catalase crystals on the grid means that one will always suffer from a missing wedge with this sample. Nevertheless, we now present data from multiple crystals and explain that because of the preferred orientation of the crystals, merging multiple data sets together does not improve the data completeness over the completeness of crystal 4 dataset alone. Tilting the TEM stage beyond ∼60° for this sample (the angle used for the single crystal data set) did not provide useful data as the diffraction was generally quite poor at such high tilts.</p><p><italic>3) Explicit evaluation of data quality and the effect of data quality on the clarity of the omit maps</italic>.</p><p>We have provided more detailed analysis in the Model validation section, specifically the results of autobuilding, automated ligand finding, and comparisons with X-ray data as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>4) Evaluation of data from multiple crystals (this could be part of the response to criteria 2 and 3)</italic>.</p><p>Done.
