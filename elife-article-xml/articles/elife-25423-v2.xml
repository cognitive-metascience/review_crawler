However, the neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. The medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) is involved in both reward and olfaction, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons are considered to be engaged in reward and motivation. Here, we found that the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway could be activated by different types of naturalistic rewards as well as odors in DAT-cre mice. Optogenetic activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic fibers was able to elicit preferences for space, location and neutral odor, while pharmacological blockade of the dopamine receptors in the mOT fully prevented the odor-preference formation. Furthermore, inactivation of the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons eliminated the previously formed odor-preference and strongly affected the Go-no go learning efficiency. In summary, our results revealed that the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway mediates a variety of naturalistic reward processes and different types of preferences including odor-preference in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>medial olfactory tubercle</kwd><kwd>odor-preference</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Xiaoping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Xiaobin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015CB755600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Fuqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB02050005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Fuqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81661148053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Fuqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91632303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Fuqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Fuqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The VTA-mOT DAergic pathway mediates a variety of naturalistic reward processes and different types of preferences including odor-preference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory perceptions are influenced by life experiences. For us, it’s a pleasure to unexpectedly smell the odor of grandmother’s cookies that we loved in our childhood, and people of different cultures may have different odor-preferences, such as blue cheese to European and stinky bean-curd to Chinese. For rodents, reward-related odor perception is critical for food foraging and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doty, 1986</xref>). The formation of odor-preference should involve the interaction between the olfactory and reward systems, although the mechanisms, the engaged brain regions and neural circuits are still unclear.</p><p>The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a long and narrow tubular brain structure located at the ventral part of striatum. It belongs to the olfactory system and receives dense direct inputs from the main olfactory bulb (OB) and other olfactory cortexes such as the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and piriform cortex (PCX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wesson and Wilson, 2011</xref>). As a part of the ventral striatum reward circuitry, the OT is also heavily innervated by dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voorn et al., 1986</xref>]). Belonging to both the olfactory and reward circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wesson and Wilson, 2011</xref>), the OT is at the proper position to play critical roles in the formation of odor-preference. Previous results from relatively limited studies are in agreement with this intuition. The OT encodes natural reinforcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadziola and Wesson, 2016</xref>), odor valence and pheromone reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadziola and Wesson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DiBenedictis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustín-Pavón et al., 2014</xref>), and also influences reward behaviors and odor-preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fitzgerald et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, specific domains of the OT represent reward or punishment-associated odor-cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>). These works have revealed that the OT is involved in the formation of odor-preference. The OT directly receives olfactory inputs; however, how it is regulated by the reward system to form odor-preferences and whether it plays roles in other reward behaviors are still largely unknown.</p><p>An earlier study showed that the VTA can modulate the activities of olfactory-related OT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mooney et al., 1987</xref>). The VTA DAergic neurons have been proposed to play central roles in general reward and motivation, via innervating the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roeper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ungless et al., 2010</xref>). As a component of the ventral striatum, most of the OT neurons are D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Millhouse and Heimer, 1984</xref>), which are heavily innervated by DAergic neurons from the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voorn et al., 1986</xref>). From these anatomical and functional facts about the two brain regions, we hypothesized that the VTA (DAergic)-OT pathway play pivotal roles in the formation of odor-preference and reward behaviors involving other modalities. Compared with the lateral OT, the medial OT (mOT) is more involved in addiction, reward and reward associated odor perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikemoto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikemoto, 2003</xref>). In fact, the mOT mediates self-administration of cocaine or D-amphetamine even more robustly than the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which is crucially important for reward learning and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koob and Volkow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikemoto, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rodd-Henricks et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we focused on the pathway made up of VTA DAergic projection and the mOT (VTA (DAergic)-mOT) to test our hypothesis that it plays a key role in the formation of odor-preference and the other reward behaviors.</p><p>In attempting to answer these questions, we first confirmed the direct DAergic projection from VTA to the mOT by using virus-based tracing system. Using fiber photometry recording, we subsequently showed that the activities of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection and the mOT can be changed by reward or odor stimulation respectively. Besides, optogenetic activation of the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway was able to activate multiple brain regions and form space/location preferences (even overcame the aversion to central zone). Further, coupling this activation with odor stimulation simultaneously could not only generate preference for a neutral odor, but also abolished the avoidance for an aversive odor. On the other hand, inactivating the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons, or blocking the dopamine receptors in the mOT, abolished the expression of previously formed odor-preferences. These results demonstrate that activation of the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway generates odor-preference as well as the other types of preferences. Thus, this pathway might be a key player in modulating perception of a given stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping the input network of the mOT</title><p>To map the direct inputs of the mOT, a recombinant RV expressing green florescent protein (RV-dG-GFP) was injected into the mOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

We chose two other odors, a preferred (sesame butter) and an aversive (TMT) odor to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>). After 2 days of optical stimulation in the mOT pairing with TMT sampling, mice were tested on the following day without light activation.

These results indicate that activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection can also abolish the avoidance of mice to an innately aversive odor.</p><p>However, optical stimulation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection might lead to the activation of the passing-by DAergic fibers in the mOT or VTA DAergic cell bodies, which may then activate afferents projecting to the other brain regions. To exclude these possibilities and address the role of the local mOT dopamine release in producing the odor-preference, we infused the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH-23390 and raclopride) 5 min before pairing the projection activation with odor stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that administration of these drugs abolished the formation of preference for the paired odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, p=0.757, n = 6, t-test), which is preferred by animals with only saline infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, p=0.027, n = 6, t-test). These results indicated that the local mOT dopamine released by the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway is responsible for the formation of odor-preference as we have observed.</p><p>We have shown that it is sufficient to generate odor-preference by activating the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway while exposed to the odor simultaneously, and that dopamine in the mOT is necessary for this process. However, the potentially supra-physiological activation produced by optogenetic manipulation might elicit artificial behaviors. Therefore, whether this pathway is really necessary for the formation of odor-preference under the influence of hedonic life experience still remains unclear. Further, whether or how this pathway plays roles in the perception of the preferred odors after the formation of odor-preference is also unknown. To address these questions, we decided to train water deprived mice for Go-no go task, with one of the two odors associated with water, a naturalistic reward, then examine the effects caused by the chemogenetical inactivation of the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons. At first, we co-injected RV-dG-GFP into the NAc and RV-dG-dsRed into the mOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and found that the co-labeled rate (1.65%) of the VTA neurons were negligible, which implied that it may not be common for a VTA DAergic neuron to co-innervate the NAc and the mOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Thus, we are able to selectively target the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons and further express hM4Di in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>) to silence them. To achieve this goal, we injected CAV-CMV-Cre and AAV9-EF1a-floxed-hM4Di-mCherry or AAV9-EF1a-floxed-mCherry into the mOT and VTA, respectively, in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The mCherry positive cells are restricted to the VTA area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>), and the projections in the OT are mainly distributed in the medial part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We found that although the mCherry-positive cells only took a small portion (37.20%) of the whole VTA DAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), most (90.86%) of the mCherry-labeled cells were also co-expressing TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The ratio of co-labeled TH+ neurons produced by CAV is much higher than by RV-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Since the expression of endogenous proteins are often severely reduced followed by RV infection, the lower co-labeling ratio for RV might be underestimated. Thus, with CAV-CMV-Cre retrograde transport from the mOT, we are able to selectively silence the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons.

In the present study, we first showed that various types of odors and diverse naturalistic reward stimulations can activate the mOT and the VTA-mOT DAergic projection, respectively. Then we found that activation of the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway can generate preference for a neutral odor or abolish the avoidance for an aversive odor; inhibition of the projection downstream in the mOT through specific dopamine receptor antagonists prevented odor-preference formation completely; and inactivation of the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons fully blocked the formed odor-preference, and strongly attenuated the Go-no go learning performance which leads to the odor-preference established through naturalistic reward odor-preference. These data suggest that the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway mediates the formation of odor-preference.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>VTA-mOT DAergic projection in reward</title><p>Although previous study has shown that electrical stimulation of the OT promotes reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fitzgerald et al., 2014</xref>), the behavioral effects have never been evaluated by directly targeting the VTA-mOT DAergic projection. It is reported that the ventral striatum is heterogeneously innervated by GABAergic, glutamatergic and DAergic afferents from the VTA. DAergic neurons in the VTA are involved in diverse functions, depending on their projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). The roles of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection still remain unclear. Here, using optogenetics, we found that, activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection elicited RTPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stamatakis and Stuber, 2012</xref>), and the rewarding effect was strong enough to rapidly overcome the instinctive avoidance of mice to drive-positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, taking advantage of in vivo calcium-dependent fiber photometry, we found for the first time that the VTA-mOT DAergic projection was activated by diverse naturalistic rewards, including sucrose solution, solid food and social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our results consolidate the rewarding role of the mOT and demonstrate that the VTA-mOT DAergic projection is involved in this function.</p><p>Lacking cellular specificity, electrical stimulation might activate local neuron population, and axon fibers projecting to the area and passing-by non-selectively. Therefore, it was difficult to decide which component(s), local neurons, afferent to or efferent from the OT, and fibers passing-by the OT, contribute to the observed effects. Our results using optogenetics proved that activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection contributes to the rewarding role of the mOT, although the downstream neurons in the mOT involved in this pathway still need to be elucidated. It was reported that activation of the trimeric G-protein Gs-coupled D1R increases the excitability of the D1R + neurons, and that activation of the Gi-coupled D2R decreases the excitability of the D2R + neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoof and Kebabian, 1981</xref>). Thus, the rewarding effect observed here might be due to the simultaneous activation of D1R + neurons and inhibition of D2R + neurons followed by dopamine release in the mOT. Besides, cholinergic neurons in the OT also respond to DAergic terminal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wieland et al., 2014</xref>), which might also lead to reward, because rats easily learned to self-administer cholinergic receptor agonists carbachol in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikemoto et al., 1998</xref>). Together, these researches implicated that the rewarding effects produced by stimulation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection might be the results of diverse activation and/or inactivation response of different populations of neurons in the mOT. Further studies using optogenetic and chemogenetic to manipulate cell-type-specific neurons in the mOT with corresponding Cre-line transgenic mice for the elucidation of the downstream pathway would be of great interest.</p><p>On one hand, artificial activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic terminals generates reward behavior; on the other hand, this pathway is activated by naturalistic rewards, including sucrose solution, solid food and social interactions. It is reported that the activities of the VTA DAergic projection are target-dependent in response to rewards and shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). For example, the projection to NAc has been shown to increase activity during reward and decrease activity during shock, while the projection to basolateral-amygdala displayed increased response to both reward and shock. Also, the projection to prefrontal cortex exhibited increased activity to shock but not reward. We found that the VTA-mOT DAergic projection is activated by different types of naturalistic rewards, thus suggesting that it might mediate generalized rewarding processes. Besides, the VTA-mOT DAergic projection is also slightly activated by the bitter quinine solution, although it is more weakly activated than by sucrose solution. Furthermore, although the NAc/mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons may hardly be completely labeled limited by the efficiency of RV infection, it could be speculated that the VTA DAergic neurons may not commonly innervate both the NAc and mOT depending on the very low co-labeled rate of VTA neurons by RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results added new information to the functional heterogeneity of VTA DAergic projections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway in odor and other preferences</title><p>Reward-related odor perception is critical for survival and reproduction of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doty, 1986</xref>). As recent studies have shown that the OT neurons encode odor valence by enhancing firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadziola et al., 2015</xref>), and that rewarding odor cues preferentially activate the D1R + neurons in the mOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>), the mOT seems to be involved in odor-preference. However, the mechanism of how the odor-preference is established under the influence of life experience remains unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we found that the VTA-mOT DAergic projection is activated by diverse naturalistic rewards, the activities of the mOT are altered by a wide range of odorants, and mice exhibited a preference for a given odor if that olfactory stimulant is paired with the activation of the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway. Our results thus provide an insight that the activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection by hedonic life experience might contribute to the generation of the preference for experience-related odors.</p><p>We showed that it is sufficient to artificially generate odor-preference by optogenetic activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since this phenomenon is abolished by the dopamine receptor antagonist administration in the mOT, and it may not be common for a VTA DAergic neuron to co-innervate the NAc and the mOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we can exclude the contributions of the activation of passing-by DAergic fibers in the mOT or VTA DAergic cell bodies, and confirm that the mOT dopamine released by the VTA-mOT DAergic projection should be responsible for this odor-preference formation. Besides, this pathway is also necessary for odor based reward learning and the expression of naturalistically formed odor-preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). However, whether or how this pathway plays roles in the formation of odor aversion, or the perception of the instinct preferred/aversive odors is still unknown.</p><p>In the present study, inactivating the mOT projecting VTA neurons did not affect the learnt Go-no go performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>), mice were both highly motivated and still remembered how to seek water rewards. The possible reasons are that, the limited population of DAergic neurons labeled by CAV-CMV-Cre from the mOT may lead to incomplete inhibition or alternatively, the specific VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway might not be necessary for established reward-seeking behavior. Thus, the other neural pathways such as the different populations of VTA DAergic neurons projecting to the NAc, dorsal striatum and other brain regions may compensate the motivation and expression of reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Inactivating the mOT projecting VTA neurons did not affect reward seeking, but strongly affected the learning efficiency for a new odor pair. Dopamine has been widely reported to strengthen environment stimuli-encoded glutamate inputs in the NAc, thus facilitated environment cue-based reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britt et al., 2012</xref>). However, the function of the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway in reward learning has been rarely studied. Here, we reported that the pathway plays important roles in odor cue-based reward learning, toward which mice are able to establish an odor-preference. Since inactivating the mOT projecting VTA neurons abolished the preference for S+ odor, together, we summarized that the VTA (DAergic)-mOT pathway is both necessary for the expression of established odor preference and may influence the establishment of odor-preference.</p><p>The reasons why paired activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection generates odor-preference could be complex. Given that the mOT is directly innervated by mitral/tufted cells from the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scott et al., 1980</xref>]) and participates in odor perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustín-Pavón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mooney et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson et al., 2014</xref>]), and that the D1R + neurons in the mOT are involved in reward-related odor perception, the first possibility is that activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection might induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in mOT D1R + neurons, and enhance the paired odors related input connections with these neurons. Hence, future occurrences of the paired odors should result in an increased rate of activation of D1R + neurons in the mOT, even without artificial activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection, as is the case in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keeler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hikida et al., 2010</xref>). Another possibility involves a broader network. In the present study, we found that activating the VTA-mOT DAergic projection induced increased c-fos expression in both the NAc and PCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the NAc is involved in reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlezon and Thomas, 2009</xref>) and the PCX is responsible for olfactory memory and odor perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</xref>), it’s likely that the simultaneous activation of these two and the other brain regions may refer the olfactory memory of the paired odors to reward, leading to altered odor-preference. Further studies with specific manipulation and recording of neurons in the mOT and PCX are needed to address the mechanism in detail.</p><p>Animals learn to associate diverse sensory cues, not only odors, with rewards depending on their life experience. The striatum plays an important role in experience-dependent reward learning behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wickens et al., 2003</xref>). Blockade of the striatum D1R + neurons damages both the visual cue-based reward learning and cocaine-induced conditional place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yawata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hikida et al., 2010</xref>). Besides, the activation of striatum D1R is necessary for the generation of corticostriatal LTP that induced by concurrent phasic dopamine release and cortical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keeler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahon et al., 2004</xref>). Visual, auditory and other sensory cues can usually stimulate the cortical activation. As a part of the ventral striatum, the OT neurons also respond to an auditory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wesson and Wilson, 2010</xref>). It is pleasant for pet dogs to hear the voice of their owners and for lovers to hear the melodies of the songs they sang together. Whether the VTA-mOT pathway influences these auditory preferences is also an interesting question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The functional differences between the mOT and the adjacent brain regions</title><p>The OT is composed of the medial and lateral parts, which are functionally different from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DiBenedictis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agustín-Pavón et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikemoto, 2003</xref>). Thus, how the VTA DAergic projection to the lateral OT affects and responds to reward or aversion compared with the mOT still remains to be examined.</p><p>It should also be pointed out that, although we intended to reveal the functions of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection in odor-preference, the border for the mOT and the lateral OT could be potentially imprecisely divided due to limited knowledge about this. Besides, it is also a difficult problem to perfectly demark the OT from the ventral pallidum. In the present work, we divided the mOT from the lateral OT at the most gyrated part of the layer 2 as we did before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), and assigned the mOT with the region containing the superficially located Islands of Calleja and surrounded cortex-like compartments according to the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong and Wesson, 2016</xref>). Besides, the layers of the OT were also divided using methods in Xiong’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong and Wesson, 2016</xref>). The border of the layer 3 was demarked by the deep layer’s islands of Calleja.</p><p>Besides, the NAc and OT, components of the ventral striatum, mediate reward processing similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Striano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Millhouse and Heimer, 1984</xref>) and both are innervated by DAergic projections from the VTA. Although the NAc has been extensively studied, the OT has received much less attentions, in spite of the unique anatomical position. Previous studies found that the mOT robustly mediates self-administration of cocaine or D-amphetamine more than the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikemoto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikemoto, 2003</xref>). Given that pharmacological agents can diffuse easily, it is difficult to specifically target the mOT while leaving the adjacent brain areas (like the NAc) undisturbed. Meanwhile, a recent research reported that optogenetic activation of DAergic terminals innervating the NAc is sufficient to drive-positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steinberg et al., 2014</xref>), whether there would be any functional difference between activation of DAergic projection in the mOT and NAc is unknown. Further studies using optogenetic activation of VTA DAergic projections in the NAc might be of great help to reveal their features.</p><p>In summary, we have provided evidence that the VTA-mOT DAergic projection can be activated by a variety of rewards and that activation of the projection can generate robust rewarding, leading to formation of olfactory as well as spatial preferences if the corresponding stimulation is coupled with the activation of the projection simultaneously. These results may underlie a circuit mechanism for how preference is influenced by life experience.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All surgical and experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committees at the Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (reference number: WIPM-(2014)39).

Eight weeks later, subjects were ipsilaterally or bilaterally implanted with a chronic optical fiber (NA = 0.37, <italic>Φ</italic> = 200 µm; Fiblaser, Shanghai, China) or a cannula (OD = 0.48 mm, ID = 0.34 mm, RWD, 68030) targeted to the mOT with the following coordinates: AP, 1.20 mm; ML, 1.10 mm; and DV, −5.15 mm.</p><p>To specifically record the activities of the mOT neurons, we ipsilaterally injected 150 nL of AAV9-hsyn-Gcamp6s into the mOT of male C57BL/6J mice with the following coordinates: AP, 1.20 mm; ML, 1.10 mm; and DV, −5.50 mm. Two weeks later, subjects were implanted with a chronic optical fiber targeted to the mOT with the following coordinates: AP, 1.20 mm; ML, 1.10 mm; and DV, −5.15 mm. Implants were fixed to the skull using two small screws, Cyanoacrylate Adhesive (Tonsan Adhesive, Beijing, China) and followed by dental cement (New Century, Shanghai, China). After the surgery, lincomycin hydrochloride and lidocaine hydrochloride gel were applied to the incision sites to prevent inflammation and decrease pain. Mice were allowed to recover for at least 1 week before behavioral tests. Brain sections containing the mOT (AP from about 1.40 mm to 0.60 mm) were collected to confirm the site of optical fiber.</p><p>To specifically inactivate the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons, 250 nL of CAV-CMV-Cre was bilaterally injected into the mOT of adult male C57BL/6 mice with the same coordinate as above, and 300 nL of AAV9-EF1a-floxed-hM4Di-mCherry or AAV9-EF1a-floxed-mCherry into the VTA of the C57BL/6 mice with the following coordinates: AP, −3.20 mm; ML, 0.45 mm; and DV, −4.30 mm. About 3 weeks later, subjects were implanted with a small home-made metal bark to the skull for head-fixed Go-no go training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Odor stimulation</title><p>For the odor stimulation, isoamyl acetate, carvone, citral, and geraniol (all from Sigma, MO) with 5% dilutions of saturated vapors were used. And mineral oil was used as a control. Each odor was presented for four consecutive trials. The duration of the odor pulse was 2 s with an inter-trial interval of 28 s to prevent habituation. Verification of the optic fiber placement were done at the end of the experiments, using methods described in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optogenetic manipulations</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Slice recording</title><p>The DAT-Cre mice with AAV9-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mCherry injected into the VTA were used. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. After rapid decapitation, the brains were quickly removed and placed into ice-cold oxygenated slicing solution saturated with mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Coronal sections (300 μm thick) of the VTA were acquired using a vibratome (Leica, VT1000S) at 0–4°C. The slices were incubated at 34°C for 30 min and then at room temperature (22–24°C) with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) consisted of (in mM): 118 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.9 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 11 D-glucose. After incubation, a slice was transferred to the recording chamber, superfused with oxygenated ACSF at a rate of 2 ml/min for recording.</p><p>Whole cell recording was performed with borosilicate glass pipettes pulled to a tip resistance of 3 to 5 MΩ (Sutter Instrument Co., P-1000). Recording electrodes were filled with intracellular solution (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 0.6 EGTA (pH 7.2, osmolarity 290 MOsm). Signals were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA) and digitized at 10 kHz with DigiData 1440A (Molecular Devices, USA). The somas of ChR2-expressing VTA DAergic neurons (mCherry-positive) were easily identified. To optically stimulate ChR2-expressing neurons, a single-wavelength LED system (λ = 470 nm, CoolLED PE-100) with light pulses at 5 ms, 20 Hz was used. Data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 software and origin 9.0.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>For all behavioral experiments, we handled the mice for 2 days before the training experiment, 3–5 min for each day, allowing them to get used to the tethering procedure. For optogenetic stimulation, the implanted optic fiber was connected to a blue light laser <italic>via</italic> patch cords (Fiblaser, Shanghai, China) and a fiber-optic rotary joint (Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada), which could release the torsion of the fiber resulted from rotation of the mouse. All opto-stimulation experiments used 5 ms, 10–15 mW, 473 nm light pulses at 20 Hz via a solid-state laser for light delivery (Shanghai Laser and Optics Century, Shanghai, China) triggered by a stimulator (Model 2100, Isolated pulse stimulator, A-M systems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Real-time place preference (RTPP)</title><p>The mice were placed in a behavioral arena (50 × 50 × 25 cm) for 20 min and assigned one counterbalanced side of the chamber as the stimulation side. Mice were placed in the non-stimulation side at the onset of the experiment. Laser stimulation at 20 Hz were constantly delivered when they crossed to the stimulation side, but stopped when they returned back to initial non-stimulation side. All behavioral tests were recorded using an HD digital video camera (Sony, Shanghai, China) and the offline analyses were performed by a video tracking software (ANY-maze; Stoelting Co, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>iClass</title><p>The behavioral arena (47 × 32 cm) contained a red rectangle as the target area for reinforcement, located in the center of the open field. The red central rectangle, formed by border line with the height of about 1 cm, is one-tenth of the whole arena. During the experiment, the floor of the arena was covered by fresh padding, with the red central area easily seen. The behavior task consisted of three phases (pre, light training, and test) and lasted for 5 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). During the pre-phase on day 1 (pre), mice with fiber patch cord connected were habituated in the arena without light pulses delivery. The basal locomotor activities of the mice were recorded and measured. The following light training sessions consisted of three consecutive days (L1-L3), on each day mice with fiber patch cord connected were put in the arena, and their activities were monitored for 15 min. When the centrals of the mice were located within the marked central rectangular area, blue light pulses at 20 Hz were constantly delivered into the mOT. Light stimulation was immediately terminated when the centrals of the mice left the red area. On test day (test), the same experimental procedures as in day 1 (pre) were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Odor-light pairing</title><p>The pairing procedure was performed for 2 consecutive days, which was two weeks post-surgery and plate placement. On each of the pairing days, the mouse was head restrained and adapted to the holding and odorant delivery conditions for 1–2 hr. Carvone and geraniol (Sigma, MO) were randomly delivered to the mouse’s nose (2 s delivery, 30 s inter-stimulus interval, 20 trials each session for 5 sessions) with 5% of saturated vapors using a custom 8-channel olfactometer and balanced across mice. Only geraniol was delivered simultaneously with 2 s, 20 Hz trains of light pulses (473 nm). Control mice were treated identically. Furthermore, another pair of odors (v/v 5% TMT and sesame butter) was delivered in the same way, with TMT as the paired odor.</p><p>In the subsequent receptor blockade experiments, saline (200 nL in total) contained the D1R antagonist (SCH-23390, 1.0 mg/ml) and D2R antagonist (Raclopride, 1.5 mg/ml) as blocking agent, or saline alone (200 nL) as control, was administered into the mOT through the cannula 5 min before optogenetic activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection paired with odor stimulation, which were described as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Odor-food reward associative learning</title><p>The protocols were adapted from Sophie’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tronel and Sara, 2002</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, the investigation time of the mice to the two odors (geraniol and carvone) were measured (odor-preference test), and then mice were fasted 24 hr pre-training. The training apparatus was a square box with two sponges which had a hole of 1 cm in diameter cut into the center and were placed in glass side-holders of the same size. Two sponges were randomly placed in two opposite corners of the box. Food reinforcement was placed at the bottom of the opening in the sponge. Sponges were impregnated with an odor on each corner of the sponge. Training was performed in a single session with five trials. The mouse was introduced into the box at a corner without a sponge, head toward the wall. The spatial configuration of the sponges was changed between trials and the reinforcement was always associated with the geraniol. The constant 593 nm yellow light were constantly delivered into the mOT once the mouse was introduced into the box and during the training session. After the training was finished, the mice were taken to the odor-preference test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Odor-preference test</title><p>Mice were tested with the two odors (5% in mineral oil, v/v), applied by two glass sticks simultaneously, to their home cages. Home cage testing was chosen to minimize potential influences of stress and anxiety (because of the new environment/context) on the behavioral measures. The food and water were removed from cages just before tests. Tests took place during the light phase of the animals' 12/12 hr dark/light cycle. Odors were delivered for 6 min by inserting the odorized sticks from one side of the animal’s home cage. Mice were first habituated to the odor sticks for 1 min, and the time spent investigating, defined as sniffing within 1 cm of the odor stick, was recorded by a single observer blind to the experiment group over a 5-min period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Go-no go task</title><p>After about 24 hr of water deprivation, mice were exposed to these two odors randomly. They were trained to either lick the water pipe to get the reward (a drop of water) when they smelled one odor (defined as S+ odor), or wait without any licking when presented the other odor (defined as S- odor). After several days of training, when the accuracy reached above 85%, the mice were ready for further experiments. They were intraperitoneally injected with CNO (3 mg/kg of body weight) and then tested for odor-preference blockade experiments. Moreover, in the following days, the mice were trained to distinguish another pair of odors using the same principle they learned before, until the accuracy achieved above 85% again.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Sucrose solution and food pellets consumption</title><p>Mice were water deprived for 24 hr before placed in a chamber (20 × 20 × 22 cm), which was equipped with a bottle filled with 5% (w/v) sucrose solution.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Activation of the Dopaminergic Pathway from VTA to the Medial Olfactory Tubercle Generates Odor-Preference and Reward&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. All reviewers agree that showing that the DA-mOT pathway mediates reward processing and olfactory learning is indeed novel and interesting. However, the reviewers were also unanimous about the potential confounding factor of non-selective activation of DA projections to other brain areas, for example the NAc. Although the others provide some pharmacology to try to tackle this, the reviewers were not convinced by these data. The authors need to conduct some additional experiments to strengthen the study. The authors could demonstrate that the DA neurons separately project to the NAc and the mOT. If this turns out not to be the case, a combination of optogenetic stimulation of DA fibers in the mOT with pharmacological inactivation of DA cell bodies would be important. This would at least rule out the potential effect of antidromic stimulation, although the activation of axonal collaterals can still be an issue.</p><p>Additionally we attach the point-by-point comments of the reviewers below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) receives dense dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area and has often been considered an extension of the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc) in the ventral striatum. Although the roles of the NAc in reward processing have been the major focus of numerous research groups, the mOT has also been implicated in drug rewards. Unlike the NAc, the mOT receives strong direct olfactory inputs. Wesson and Wilson (2011) put forward some intriguing hypotheses regarding the potential functions of the mOT in olfactory processing, but progresses thus far on this mysterious structure have been very limited.</p><p>Here, Zhang et al. from Fuqiang Xu's group provide several interesting observations indicating that the dopaminergic projection from the VTA to the mOT might mediate a variety of naturalistic reward processes and contributes to the formation of experience-dependent odor preference. They mapped the presynaptic partners of mOT neurons using rabies virus. By employing fiber photometry, they demonstrated that natural rewards activate dopaminergic terminals in the mOT. Optogenetically stimulating these terminals reinforces animal behavior and guides the formation of odor preference in a dopamine receptor-dependent manner. Finally, they showed that chemogenetically inactivating mOT-projecting neurons in the VTA abolishes conditioned odor preference and disrupts odor-discrimination learning using the go/no-go paradigm.</p><p>I like many aspects of the study. The authors took a comprehensive approach and used several latest tools for functional dissection of neural circuits. The data are overall solid. The conclusions should be exciting to a broad audience working on reward-related behaviors and olfactory processing. I am mainly concerned that some of the behavioral effects might be produced by the projection of VTA dopamine neurons to the NAc through axonal collaterals or fibers of passage. The authors performed some experiments to address this potential caveat. For example, infusing dopamine blockers into the mOT and chemogenetically inhibiting mOT-projecting VTA neurons significantly reduce the behavioral effect of optogenetic stimulation. However, drugs may diffuse into the nearby NAc region. Similarly, injecting canine adenovirus (CAV) into the mOT might have labeled VTA neurons projecting to the NAc.</p><p>The authors have several choices to address this concern. First, they could examine whether dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc and the mOT belong to separate subpopulations. Second, they could test whether the reinforcing effect of optogenetic stimulation in the mOT remains intact following lidocaine administration into the VTA. Third, they could show whether CAV-Cre injection into the mOT only drives gene expression in mOT-projecting dopamine neurons from the VTA. To the minimum, if none of these experiments work out, the authors should discuss the potential caveat and tone down some of the conclusions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a potentially interesting manuscript proposing that the dopaminergic innervation of the medial olfactory tubercle (mOT) by dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a role in reward. The authors show projection of dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the mOT. They show that the neuronal circuit of mOT responds to reward and to odorants. They then proceed to activate or inhibit dopaminergic axons in the mOT and they argue that these manipulations elicit changes in behavior consistent with a role for mOT in reward. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm is diminished significantly by substantial problems outlined below.</p><p>1) A potential major problem is that optogenetic stimulation might have resulted in direct or indirect stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The authors should provide evidence that the behavioral results for optogenetic stimulation of mOT are not due to direct stimulation of NAcc.

The figures need to be modified to clearly show that this is not the case. Was this tested for every single experiment? This criticism holds for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2.</p><p>3) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors should include an image showing that the infection did not spread to NAcc.

Are the cells surrounding the incision site neurons, or glia? They do not have the typical morphology of neurons. Perhaps the authors should show a slice that does not include the lesion. Please include a panel at a high magnification of the olfactory bulb showing clearly whether tufted cells were labeled.</p><p>4) The LFP is an indirect measure of activity in the mOT.

Did the authors perform this experiment with halorhodopsin?</p><p>7) The statistics of the manuscript are not acceptable.

Olfactory tubercle has been implicated in both reward and olfactory information processing. However, in both the olfactory field and in the reward field, OT is a far less studied brain region compared with other olfactory regions and reward regions. The role of the VTA(DAergic)-mOT pathway in the regulation of reward and olfactory process have not been investigated in behaving animals. This work represents an important and timely study addressing fundamental questions regarding the circuit mechanisms underlying the behaviors involving olfactory processing and/or reward. With the presynaptic optogenetic activation, local administration of DA receptor antagonists in mOT, and chemogenetic silencing of mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons, the importance of the DAergic input from VTA to mOT in the odor-preference is reasonably well established. However, the role of this pathway in other reward processes is far less clear with the current experiments.</p><p>The major issue of this study concerns the broad and non-specific effect of the optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. VTA DAergic neurons innervate multiple regions of the brain, and the neurons that innervate mOT likely also innervate other brain regions. Indeed, optogenetic activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic terminals was able to activate multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For optogenetic manipulations, the authors certainly realized this issue, as they have clearly stated, &quot;[…] optical stimulation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection might lead to the activation of the passing-by DAergic fibers in the mOT or VTA DAergic cell bodies, which may then activate afferents projecting to the other brain regions.&quot; The authors addressed this issue in one odor preference test by specifically administering DA receptor antagonists to mOT, and the results showed convincingly that the DA input from VTA to mOT is necessary for the odor-preference. However, the similar antagonist administration experiments were not conducted in the place preference behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the reward behaviors elicited by optogenetic activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic terminals may result from non-specific activation of other brain regions innervated by the activated VTA DAergic neurons, instead of activation of the VTA(DAergic)-mOT pathway. The authors should either tone down their conclusion to reflect this possibility or conduct at least the mOT DA receptor antagonist experiments to validate their conclusion regarding other preferences.</p><p>In the case of the chemogenetic silencing experiments (Figure 9), the global inhibition of the CAV-Cre/AAV9-EF1a-floxed-hM4Di-mCherry infected VTA neurons would also abolish their function in other brain regions. Therefore, it is possible that the attenuation in the odor-cue based reward learning (Figure 9H) may result from non-specific silencing of the projections to other brain regions. It is not clear what portion of VTA DAergic neurons are labeled by CAV-Cre/AAV9-EF1a-floxed-hM4Di-mCherry. If there were only a small portion labeled, it could be less problematic. Also, could the authors administer CNO locally at mOT to achieve local inhibition of VTA-mOT terminals?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Activation of the Dopaminergic Pathway from VTA to the Medial Olfactory Tubercle Generates Odor-Preference and Reward&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Previously I raised the major concern that some of the behavior effects induced by optogenetic stimulation might be produced by collaterally activating dopaminergic fibers in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In the revision, the authors performed several new experiments to address this and my other concerns. They now show that the NAc and the mOT receive largely separate dopaminergic inputs. In addition, optogenetically inhibiting dopaminergic activity in the mOT blocks many of the reward-like effects. These new results make the authors' conclusion much more convincing. The presentation of the manuscript has also been substantially improved.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Outstanding; the authors have addressed the questions thoroughly.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the revised manuscript the authors conducted two sets of experiments, as per reviewer 1's suggestion, to address the major concern raised by all reviewers concerning the potential non-specific effect of the optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. In one, the authors conducted dual tracing experiments by injecting in the same animal distinct retrograde labeling viral vectors to mOT and NAc, respectively. They found that there was only a very small percentage (&lt; 2%) of VTA neurons being double labeled (Figure supplement 4, C-G). The data suggest that VTA comprises separate populations of neurons innervating mOT and NAc. This is a significant finding. The result provides a strong support for their interpretation about the observed behavioral outcome being the specific effect of manipulation of VTA-mOT pathway. With this piece of data, the major concern on the previous submission of this manuscript should be satisfactorily addressed. I would suggest including this piece of data in the main body of paper, not as a figure supplement.</p><p>In another set of experiments, authors conducted real-time place preference test upon VTA administration of lidocaine and optogenetic stimulation of VTA-mOT projecting terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The authors showed that there was still a low level of place preference. However, there are several issues involved in this experiment. First, there is no information provided in the manuscript regarding the dose of drug, the efficiency of inhibition, the total distance of movement after inhibition etc. The small enhancement of preference in the stimulation side could be due to incomplete inhibition of VTA. Second, the effect of global inhibition of VTA on specific reward behaviors is not known, and a control for non-stimulation is lacking. Third, the data analysis can be problematic. The authors made the comparison between the two sides of the chamber, not the stimulated-side to random. To me, this experiment in its current stage does not add much to this paper.

We co-injected RV-dG-dsRed into the mOT and RV-dG-GFP into the NAc, respectively, and found that the co-labeled rate of the VTA neurons were negligible (1.65%), which implied that it may not be common for a VTA DAergic neuron to innervate both the NAc and the mOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, limited by the efficiency of RV infection, the mOT-projecting VTA DAergic neurons may hardly be completely labeled. Thus we have also reminded readers about the potential caveat in the Discussion section (subsection “VTA-mOT DAergic Projection in Reward”).</p><p>2) We have conducted additional experiments on pharmacological inhibition of the VTA cell bodies, followed by optogenetic stimulation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection. First, we found that the acute place preference induced by activation of the VTA-mOT DAergic projection were still retained even though the VTA cell bodies were inhibited by lidocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that the VTA-mOT DAergic pathway is involved in place preference formation. Second, after odor-preference was established, inhibition of the mOT- projecting VTA DAergic neurons (through hM4Di) abolished the paired odor preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), and inactivation of this pathway significantly decreased the performance in learning a new pair of odors in well-trained mice for Go-no go task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).
