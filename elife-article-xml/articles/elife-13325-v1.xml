networks in plants. Despite their importance, our knowledge of these two protein families is largely based on analysis of stabilized forms of the Aux/IAAs, and studies of a subgroup of ARFs that function as transcriptional activators. To understand how auxin regulates gene expression we generated a <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> line that completely lacks Aux/IAAs. Loss of the repressors causes massive changes in transcription with misregulation of over a third of the annotated genes. Further, we find that the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant is blind to auxin indicating that auxin regulation of transcription occurs exclusively through Aux/IAA function. We used the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant as a simplified platform for studies of ARF function and demonstrate that repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes and fine-tune their expression. Further the repressing ARFs coordinate gene induction jointly with activating ARFs and the Aux/IAAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13325.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13325.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Auxin is a plant hormone that regulates many aspects of growth and development. It does so by promoting the degradation of proteins called the Aux/IAAs. These proteins normally act to keep genes switched off by interacting with another family of proteins called ARFs that can bind directly to the genes. Some ARFs activate genes, while others repress gene activity. In most plants, large families of genes encode Aux/IAA and ARF proteins and individual members often have overlapping roles, which makes it more difficult to study how they work.</p><p>To avoid this problem, Lavy et al. chose to study how these proteins work in a moss called <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, which only has three genes that encode Aux/IAA proteins. The experiments show that the loss of all three Aux/IAA proteins results in the plants becoming completely insensitive to auxin. Furthermore, over a third of known moss genes had altered activity in the mutant plants compared to normal moss. These findings suggest that the Aux/IAA proteins have a bigger role in regulating the activities of genes than previously thought.</p><p>Further experiments show that repressive ARFs act by directly competing with the activating ARFs for binding to auxin-regulated genes. However, repression of gene activity by the ARFs is weaker than the effect of the Aux/IAAs. Unexpectedly, the loss of repressive ARFs causes moss plants to become less sensitive to auxin, which Lavy et al. suggest is due to the recruitment of additional Aux/IAA proteins to the genes. Thus these findings demonstrate that control of gene activity by auxin involves the coordinated action of both types of ARFs and the Aux/IAAs. Future challenges are to find out which genes directly bind ARFs and the Aux/IAAs, and to use computational approaches to create models of how auxin regulates gene activity in the moss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13325.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13325.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Physcomitrella patens</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>Aux/IAAs</kwd><kwd>ARFs</kwd><kwd>plant development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estelle</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estelle</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Estelle</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors regulate approximately 35% of the annotated genes in <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and exhibit complex interactions with both the activating and repressing ARF transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in plant growth and development. Depending on the context, the cellular response to auxin can be very different, including changes in cell division, cell expansion, and differentiation. The hormone acts by regulating the transcription of auxin responsive genes. Strikingly, auxin-regulated gene sets can vary significantly between different cell types consistent with cell specific cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargmann et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of auxin, transcription of auxin-regulated genes is repressed by members of a family of repressors called Auxin/INDOLE-3-ACETIC-ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins. The Aux/IAAs are recruited to promoters through an interaction with AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors. Repression is relieved when auxin binds to a co-receptor complex consisting of a TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT 1/AUXIN F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) F-box protein and an Aux/IAA protein. The Aux/IAA protein is degraded, permitting ARF-dependent transcription to occur [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calderon Villalobos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dharmasiri et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2007</xref>) reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salehin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang and Estelle, 2014</xref>)]. The elucidation of the auxin co-receptor mechanism provided the molecular link between auxin perception at the cellular level and subsequent changes in gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which the interactions between TIR1/AFBs, ARFs and Aux/IAAs results in the induction of specific gene sets, as well as the establishment of gene regulatory networks, are not known.</p><p>The Aux/IAAs contain, in most cases, three domains: an N terminal repression domain required for the recruitment of the co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szemenyei et al., 2008</xref>) domain II, required for interaction with the TIR1/AFB co-receptors; and a C terminal region (designated domains III and IV ) that forms a Phox and Bem1 (PB1) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guilfoyle and Hagen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>ARF proteins are generally comprised of an N terminal B3-type DNA binding domain, a variable middle region (MR), and a C terminal PB1 domain. The ARFs have been characterized as activating or repressing based on their behavior in transient protoplast assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guilfoyle and Hagen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tiwari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ulmasov et al., 1999</xref>). It was recently shown that Arabidopsis ARF5, an activating ARF, interacts with SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPases through its MR, and that this interaction mediates changes in chromatin required for gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand the repressing activity of the putative repressing ARFs has not been demonstrated in plants. Similar, the mechanism of repression is unknown.</p><p>ARF-Aux/IAA interactions occur through their PB1 domains. In addition, the PB1 domain permits homo- and heterodimerization both within and between the Aux/IAA and ARF families. Recent structural studies revealed that ARFs can form higher order ARF and Aux/IAA protein complexes through both their DNA binding domain [ARF-ARF dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2014</xref>)] and the acidic and basic faces of their PB1 domains [ARF-ARF and ARF-Aux/IAA multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinesh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korasick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nanao et al., 2014</xref>)Â reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korasick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright and Nemhauser, 2015</xref>)]. This combinatorial diversity may result in complex regulation of gene expression. Further, tightly regulated negative feedback loops in which the <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes are regulated by the ARFs, present an additional layer of complexity.</p><p>The body plan of the early-diverged moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens (P. patens)</italic> is relatively simple. The vegetative gametophyte is composed of only a few cell types and developmental stages. Auxin was shown to have a central role in the vegetative growth of <italic>P. patens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge and Bezanilla, 2010</xref>). In the filamentous protonemal stage, auxin promotes the differentiation of chloroplast-rich filaments called chloronemata into elongated filaments with fewer chloroplasts called caulonemata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 1979</xref>). The development of leafy gametophores is also affected by auxin including stem elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eklund et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>), elongation of the gametophore leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Decker et al., 2006</xref>), formation of rhizoids from gametophore epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 1979</xref>), and gametophore branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coudert et al., 2015</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the molecular mechanism of auxin signaling is conserved between <italic>P. patens</italic> and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>). This finding, together with its morphological simplicity establishes <italic>P. patens</italic> as a powerful model for studies of auxin signaling.</p><p>Here we utilized a <italic>P. patens aux/iaa</italic> null mutant to determine the effects of the complete loss of Aux/IAA-based transcriptional repression. Our analysis reveals that the Aux/IAAs are essential for auxin regulation of transcription indicating that at least in moss, auxin does not affect transcription independently of the Aux/IAAs. Complete loss of Aux/IAA repression dramatically alters the transcriptome, including expression of a large number of genes that are not affected by auxin treatment. In addition, our studies revealed new features of repressing ARF function. We demonstrate that auxin induction of gene expression is controlled by complex interactions between the Aux/IAAs and both activating and repressing ARFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of the Aux/IAA repressors result in an auxin-constitutive phenotype</title><p>Flowering plants possess large families of <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes (29 in Arabidopsis). Genetic studies of these genes have relied almost entirely on gain-of-function mutations in the degron motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mockaitis and Estelle, 2008</xref>). These dominant mutations prevent interaction between the Aux/IAA and the TIR1/AFB co-receptors resulting in stabilization of the affected Aux/IAA and reduced sensitivity to auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Very few loss-of-function mutants have been described in flowering plants, presumably because of gene redundancy and a plant completely lacking the entire <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> family is not available. In a recent study, the single <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> gene in the early diverging Liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha)</italic> was knocked down using an artificial microRNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Sandoval et al., 2015</xref>). The resulting lines were auxin hypersensitive. However, because these plants retained some auxin responsiveness, there are unlikely to be nulls. The genome of <italic>P. patens</italic> encodes only three <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes: <italic>IAA1A, IAA1B</italic>, and <italic>IAA2</italic>. To study the role of these genes in auxin response and plant development, and to simplify the study of auxin response mechanisms, we generated a mutant lacking all three genes. To generate the triple mutant, we replaced the <italic>IAA1B</italic> coding region with a Î²<italic>-glucuronidase (GUS</italic>) marker gene, followed by deletion of the <italic>IAA1A</italic> and <italic>IAA2</italic> coding regions (<italic>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS aux/iaaÎ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Because expression of the <italic>IAA1B</italic> gene is induced by auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>), we could use the <italic>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</italic> gene as an auxin reporter. Following auxin treatment, very low levels of GUS staining was detected in the <italic>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</italic> line, whereas GUS staining was high in the <italic>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS aux/iaaÎ</italic> line both in the absence and presence of applied auxin, indicating that this line displays a constitutive auxin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant displays a severe phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme representing the auxin-signaling pathway in WT plants (left panel) and in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant (right panel).

When grown on minimal medium (BCD), WT plants grew leafy gametophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>-left panel), while in the presence of auxin, these plants produced gametophores consisting of shoot structures with ectopic brown-pigmented rhizoids and without leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>-right panel). The <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant produced gametophores with ectopic rhizoids and was completely insensitive to auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To characterize plants at the filamentous protonemal stage, we compared WT, a highly auxin-resistant <italic>IAA2</italic> degron mutant (<italic>iaa2-P328S</italic>), and the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant. The plants were grown for one month on medium supplemented with ammonium tartrate to allow for slower protonemata differentiation (BCDAT medium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâH</xref>). Under these conditions, WT plants responded to exogenous auxin by developing long caulonemal filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Whereas the differentiation of the <italic>iaa2-P328S</italic> auxin-resistant mutant arrested at the primary chloronemal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> plants contained disorganized brown-pigmented filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

To minimize these differences, we performed RNAseq on protonemata grown on BCDAT for seven days after tissue homogenization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>)</p><p>We first analyzed the WT auxin-responsive gene set following five hours of IAA treatment and identified 723 upregulated and 762 repressed genes [1.5 fold or more; p value adjusted (padj)Â &lt;0.01] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1AâC</xref>). Among the upregulated genes were several well-characterized early auxin response genes including the <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes as well as several genes homologous to <italic>SAURs</italic> and <italic>LBD/ASLs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paponov et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>P. patens</italic> genome encodes only two <italic>GH3</italic> homologs with a conserved function in IAA-conjugate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ludwig-Muller et al., 2009</xref>). Neither of these genes displayed differential regulation in the auxin-responsive gene set and one of them was downregulated in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant. A few <italic>ARF</italic> genes in Arabidopsis have been shown to respond to auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paponov et al., 2008</xref>). Five out of sixteen <italic>P. patens ARFs</italic> (including both activating and repressing) were upregulated by auxin in the WT protonemata. Nine additional ARFs were upregulated in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant compared to WT, indicating the presence of an ARF-dependent feedback loop that may have evolved in the ancestral land plant lineage. The larger number of auxin regulated ARFs in our datasets may reflect the fact that by comparing the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant to WT, we uncover all Aux/IAA-repressed genes, whereas the Arabidopsis transcriptome data describes the effect of exogenous auxin on a complex tissue and under specific conditions.</p><p>Strikingly, our results show that the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant is completely insensitive to auxin, with no changes in gene expression upon auxin treatment under our experimental conditions and statistical threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A less stringent statistical threshold of padjÂ &lt;0.05 revealed only a few genes displaying a low fold change further validated this finding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). These results imply that any factors that regulate auxin-dependent changes in gene expression must act through the Aux/IAAs, emphasizing the central role of these proteins in auxin signaling.</p><p>The <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> transcriptomic analysis revealed that a third of all annotated genes were differentially regulated in the mutant compared to WT (with 3752 and 4031 up- and downregulated genes, respectively), demonstrating the broad role of the TIR1-Aux/IAA pathway in land plant growth and development. Strikingly, approximately 80% of these genes were not differentially regulated by auxin in WT plants whereas most of the regulated genes in WT were presented in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, our analysis allowed us to identify genes that were not revealed by auxin treatment. These may include genes that are regulated in a specific developmental, temporal, or environmental context as well as genes that are indirectly affected by the loss of the Aux/IAAs. Additionally, some genes may be revealed only when the Aux/IAAs are completely absent. For example, it is possible that very low levels of Aux/IAAs are sufficient to repress expression of some genes while for others the Aux/IAAs may be protected from auxin dependent-degradation. Finally, some genes may be represented by a small number of transcripts and/or exhibit a low level of differential expression, making them difficult to identify with standard procedures.</p><p>As illustrated by a hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes, the absence of the Aux/IAAs also had a strong effect on transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Numerous up- and downregulated genes identified in WT plants displayed higher or lower expression levels in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant respectively, indicating that many genes can be expressed over a broad range. For example, while the highest fold-change of differentially expressed genes following auxin treatment was fifteen, some of the same genes were differentially expressed in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant with a fold-change of up to 430 compared to WT. These results indicate that significant levels of the Aux/IAA are present even after auxin treatment, further illustrating the robust nature of the auxin system. Several up- and downregulated genes that were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lavy et al., 2012</xref>), and genes displaying differential expression in this analysis, were selected as representative auxin-responsive gene markers, and used to validate the transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The moss auxin-responsive transcriptome may facilitate discovery of ancestral auxin gene targets. We analyzed Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with auxin responsive genes and found specific enriched categories for up- and downregulated genes. Analysis of upregulated genes revealed overrepresentation of genes involved in regulation of transcription and biosynthesis, whereas downregulated genes were highly enriched for processes occurring in the chloroplast and associated with photosynthesis, including light responses and carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The set of downregulated genes differentially expressed in the mutant but not in WT presented a higher level of enrichment of these processes. Thus, our GO analysis suggests that in <italic>P. patens</italic> photosynthetic tissues, auxin signaling mediates separation of auxin-induced responses from energy production via induction of specific gene sets and the concurrent repression of others.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The repressing ARFs regulate auxin-induced genes</title><p>The constitutive auxin response displayed by the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant and the broad effect of loss of Aux/IAA function on gene regulation highlight the central role of ARF transcription factors on gene expression. Based on sequence analyses and transient activity assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tiwari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ulmasov et al., 1999</xref>), the ARF proteins were classified as either activators or repressors of transcription. While it is clear that the activating ARFs do activate transcription in plants and their mode of action is beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), this is not the case for the repressing ARFs. It has not been clearly demonstrated that the repressing ARFs act as transcriptional repressors in plants and a conceptual understanding of their role is lacking. For example, it is not known if repressing ARFs require the Aux/IAAs for their function or if the repressing and activating ARFs regulate the same genes. In addition it is not known if the repressing ARFs have a specific role in targeting downregulated genes.</p><p>The <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant allows us to study the function of the repressing ARF in a relatively simple context lacking Aux/IAA repression and the negative feedback loops associated with their activity. Phylogenetic analyses reported that the <italic>P. patens</italic> ARF protein family consists of three clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plavskin and Timmermans, 2012</xref>) shared between all land plants and a fourth, non-seed-plant-specific clade characterized by the lack of the DNA binding domain [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paponov et al., 2009</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>]. One of the clades, comprising four proteins, groups with Arabidopsis repressing ARFs, whereas another clade, comprising seven ARF proteins, groups with Arabidopsis activating ARFs. The <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> ARF proteins were recently shown to affect transcription in a transient expression assay in accordance with their phylogenetic classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2015</xref>) strongly suggesting that ARF function is conserved in land plants. Furthermore, in <italic>P. patens</italic>, higher levels of putative repressing ARFs resulted in decreased auxin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plavskin et al., 2016</xref>). We selected <italic>ARFb4</italic> as a representative repressing ARF, and overexpressed an ARFb4 c-Myc fusion in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant background (<italic>ARFb4OE_aux/iaaÎ</italic>). We found that overexpression of ARFb4 suppressed the constitutive auxin phenotype of the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant including the formation of green chloronemal-like filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In fact, in a high expressing transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> #1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), the phenotype was quite similar to that of dominant auxin-resistant <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>)]. This result demonstrates that repressing ARFs do function as repressors in plants and that this activity does not require the Aux/IAAs. It is worth noting that ARFb4, as well ARFb2 and ARFb3 do not contain any of the known motifs that are thought to recruit TPL and therefore may not affect chromatin remodeling directly. To define the mechanism underlying the suppression of the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> phenotype we assessed the expression of the <italic>P<sub>IAA1B</sub>:GUS</italic> marker and other auxin-responsive genes. The GUS marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as the additional reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) had dramatically lower expression levels compared to the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant indicating that activating ARFs and the repressing ARFs can affect, either directly or indirectly the same target genes. Further, the auxin response genes did not respond to auxin in the <italic>ARFb4OE_aux/iaaÎ</italic> line confirming that overexpression of the repressing ARF converted the constitutive auxin response line to an auxin resistant line. Overexpression of Arabidopsis ARF1 resulted in similar effects, indicating that the role of repressing ARFs is conserved between <italic>P. patens</italic> and Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Repressing ARFs target auxin-induced genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WT, <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> and two <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> lines overexpressing ARFb4 (<italic>ARFb4OE_aux/iaaÎ)</italic> grown for one month on BCDAT.

The loss of <italic>ARFb2</italic> and <italic>ARFb4</italic> in the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> line (<italic>arfb2 arfb4ÎÂ aux/iaaÎ</italic>) did not result in any morphological changes or a clear trend with respect to changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Conversely and surprisingly, the <italic>arfb2 arfb4</italic> knockout in both the WT and the <italic>iaa1b iaa2Î</italic> double mutant (<italic>arfb2 arfb4Î and arfb2 arfb4ÎÂ iaa1b iaa2Î</italic>, respectively) resulted in lower expression levels of some of the upregulated auxin responsive genes, and higher levels of downregulated genes compared to their backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Although the expression of these genes in both untreated and auxin-treated <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> plants was reduced, the fold change was either similar or even higher compared to the WT and <italic>iaa1b iaa2Î</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>RSL4</italic>: 7â3 fold higher and <italic>Dox</italic>: 2â1.4, respectively). Phenotypic analysis of the <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> revealed developmental defects including shorter filaments and fewer leafy gametophores consistent with reduced auxin response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These findings further support our hypothesis that repressing ARFs can affect the same genes as activating ARFs. However, they revealed an unexpected trend in which the loss of repressing ARFs affects transcription in the same direction as their overexpression. To further confirm these contradictory results we also used transient RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bezanilla et al., 2005</xref>) targeting the four repressing ARFs (<italic>arfb1-4</italic>). The RNAi construct was expressed in a transgenic plant expressing the synthetic auxin-responsive reporter <italic>DR5:DsRED</italic>. In agreement with the analysis of the <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> stable lines the resulting transformants displayed a lower expression level of the <italic>DR5:DsRED</italic> reporter compared to the control plants when treated with auxin, indicative of reduced auxin sensitivity of the <italic>arfb1-4</italic> RNAi knockdown lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Both repressing and activating ARFs affect auxin response in the same direction in the presence of the <italic>Aux/IAAs</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) qPCR showing the expression levels of auxin responsive genes in WT, <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î (arfb2,4), iaa1b iaa2Î (iaa1b,2</italic>), and <italic>arfb2 arfb4</italic>Â <italic>iaa1b iaa2Î (iaa1b,2 arfb2,4</italic>), mock- or 10 Î¼M IAA-treated for five hours.

The expression level of an auxin responsive gene is determined by the interplay between the Aux/IAAs, the repressing ARFs, and the activating ARFs. At low auxin levels the Aux/IAAs provide stringent repression. At high auxin levels, the Aux/IAAs are degraded resulting in increased transcription through the action of the activating ARFs. The repressing ARFs act to buffer gene expression by attenuating the activity of the activating ARFs. The interplay between the three protein groups results in a wide range of gene expression levels that contribute to a dynamic and context specific auxin response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13325.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13325.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13325-fig5-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.015</object-id><label>Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>PCR detecting the insertion position of different <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Validating the absence of the genomic sequence of <italic>ARFb2</italic> and <italic>ARFb4</italic>PCR.

However, this possibility does not appear to explain the phenotype of <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> lines, as the transcript levels of <italic>IAA1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>-<italic>IAA1A</italic>) are low. Alternatively, it is possible that both activating and repressing ARFs as well as the Aux/IAAs jointly coordinate gene induction. This hypothesis is consistent with our analysis of the <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î</italic> lines. In the presence of the Aux/IAAs, loss of ARFB2 and ARFB4 results in reduced auxin response. However, this effect is suppressed by the deletion of the <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes in the <italic>arfb2 arfb4Î aux/iaaÎ</italic> line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the activating and repressing ARFs can target the same genes, loss of the repressing ARFs may result in increased levels of activating ARFs on the auxin-responsive promoters. This may have the unexpected effect of recruiting more Aux/IAA repressors to these promoters. To test this idea we overexpressed the activating ARFa8, in WT plants (<italic>ARFa8OE</italic>). The resulting lines displayed a phenotype characteristic of auxin-resistant plants and exhibited reduced expression of auxin responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), which supports our hypothesis. Collectively, our results support a model in which repressing ARFs can affect the occupancy of activating ARFs and Aux/IAAs on auxin responsive promoters. These interactions may provide buffering capacity that allows fine-scale regulation of auxin responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we exploited the relative simplicity of <italic>P. patens</italic> to address the complexity of auxin-regulated transcription. The Aux/IAA proteins have a central role in auxin signaling, serving as both auxin co-receptors and transcriptional repressors. However, genetic analysis of these genes has been limited in flowering plants because of genetic redundancy. By deleting all three <italic>Aux/IAAs</italic> in moss we have determined the effects of the complete absence of Aux/IAA function on plant growth and auxin response. Remarkably, we found that the Aux/IAAs have a broad impact on the expression levels of a great number of genes, the majority of which do not respond to auxin treatment of moss protonemata. Thus our analysis demonstrates that existing transcriptomic studies conducted in flowering plants may significantly underestimate the effects of auxin on the genome and illustrates the central roleÂ of the TIR-Aux/IAA pathway on plant growth and development. While our work highlights the remarkably broad impact of the Aux/IAA proteins on gene expression, it also demonstrates an absolute requirement for the Aux/IAAs in auxin-responsive transcription. Some auxin-mediated signaling pathways have been proposed to affect transcription independently of the TIR1/AFB-Aux/IAA signaling cascade. These include a negative role of Mitogen-Activating Protein Kinase (MAPK) activity on auxin-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), and the effect of the F-box protein SKP2A on the stability of cell division transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jurado et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings indicate that at least in moss, any possible effect of these pathways on auxin-regulated transcription requires Aux/IAAsâ function.</p><p>In <italic>P. patens</italic>, auxin-dependent modulation of gene expression triggers developmental transitions and differentiation. Our mutant analyses reveal that the transition from chloronema to caulonema is regulated by a dynamic balance of quantitative auxin responses. When auxin response is low, as in the auxin-resistant mutants, protonema growth is not accompanied by developmental transition to the caulonemal stage. In contrast, a constitutive auxin response, as exhibited by the <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant, results in rapid and abnormal maturation.</p><p>It has been proposed that repressing and activating ARFs might compete for binding to the same promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>). Structural studies of Arabidopsis ARF1 and ARF5 revealed that both classes of ARF can potentially bind to similar cis elements and form high order oligomers of ARFs and Aux/IAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korasick et al., 2014</xref>). Our work provides experimental evidence that auxin responsive genes are targeted by both repressing and activating ARFs, which in turn coordinate their levels of expression. The structural studies as well as our results can support two models of ARF activity. Repressing and activating ARFs can either compete on the same binding sites or cooperatively induce transcription by forming heterodimers. Despite its classification as an activating ARF, the Arabidopsis ARF5 was shown to repress some of its identified gene targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Given that ARF transcription factors may display opposing roles in different contexts, ARF activity can result in a very complex gene expression pattern. These mechanisms, by which different ARFs coordinate transcriptional responses, can explain the broad effect of auxin on gene expression and the complexity of the resulting transcriptional networks as each gene can display a wide range of expression levels. Recent studies in liverwort support this hypothesis. The <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> encodes only one Aux/IAA and one member of each ancient ARF clade yet these transcription factors are sufficient to pattern a complete body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores-Sandoval et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the activating ARFs, our understanding of the repressing ARFs is limited. For some repressing ARFs, the presence of an EAR domain suggests that repression could involve recruitment of the TPL co-repressor. However, many repressing ARFs, including PpARFb2, PpARFb4, and AtARF1 used in this work do not have this motif. We show that repression provided by these repressing ARFs is weaker compared to the repressing effect of the Aux/IAAs. Based on this observation, we suggest that repressing ARFs may fine-tune gene expression. The Aux/IAAs repress gene expression through interactions with co-repressors such as TPL and the subsequent recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagale and Rozwadowski, 2011</xref>). This may provide stable and long term repression when auxin levels are low. In contrast, when auxin levels are high and/or when auxin response needs to be dynamic, the repressing ARFs may provide a less stable repression that fine-tunes auxin response in the absence of the Aux/IAAs. The fact that the repressing <italic>ARF</italic> genes are induced by auxin and therefore constitute a negative feedback module is consistent with this idea.</p><p>In flowering plants, auxin integrates light signals and growth responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halliday et al., 2009</xref>). While we have some knowledge of how light affects auxin synthesis and distribution, the effects on auxin transcriptional responses are less known. In moss, the interplay between light, auxin, and growth has been implicated in the transition from chlronema to caulonema. In addition to auxin, light intensity and the availability of nutrients affect the transition from one cell type to the other. High light and glucose triggers caulonema formation while low light inhibits caulonemal growth and stimulates chloronemal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thelander et al., 2005</xref>). These observations suggest that favorable conditions promote the differentiation of elongated caulonemal cells, whereas low energy conditions promote the formation of chloroplast-rich chloronemal cells thus increasing photosynthetic capacity and energy production. We found that the auxin downregulated gene set is dominated by genes involved in photoperception and carbon fixation. This finding establishes the molecular basis for auxin signaling in response to light stimuli and suggests that auxin may function as a molecular switch between energy production and growth.</p><p>Our model cannot explain a direct effect of the ARF transcription factors on downregulated genes. Only a few repressed genes have been identified after a short auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paponov et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the GO analysis presented here it seems likely that transcription factors that are directly induced by auxin repress many processes downstream of auxin, particularly those associated with photosynthesis. These auxin-induced regulators and their downstream targets are yet to be defined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Moss strains and growth conditions</title><p>WT âGransden-2004â and mutant <italic>P. patens</italic> strains were grown at 25Â°C under continuous light at an intensity of 40â70 Âµmol/m2/s on BCD or BCDAT (BCD supplemented with 5âmM Ammonium Tartrate) media.

From the macroscopic images, the mutant sometimes just looks like a small wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> right panel) to someone not familiar with the <italic>Physco</italic> system.</p><p>I believe an important addition to the paper would be a more detailed, microscopic analysis of the protonema stage in wild type and the mutant. The authors find a large number of gene expression differences in the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant, with ca. 80% of those genes not being auxin-responsive in wild type. I believe this does not really mean that these genes are directly regulated by the AUX/IAA-ARF system. Presumably, many of those differences could arise as secondary effects, for instance because after all, the protonema grown from wild type and mutant is not that similar morphologically as well as physiologically. Differences could also be amplified by the phenotypic variation the authors describe. So I believe they have to be more careful in their claims.</p><p>Regarding the ARF analysis, I believe it would considerably strengthen the manuscript if the authors could provide RNAseq data for the mutant compared to the mutant carrying the <italic>ARFb4OE</italic> construct.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Lavy et al. addresses the function of auxin response components in <italic>Physcomitrella</italic>. Little is known about the evolution of auxin signaling, or its ancestral role, and this manuscript fills in many gaps. By studying a plant lacking all Aux/IAA function, the authors show the impact of auxin response on the genome, which turns out to be very large. This, in itself is a very important finding. Next, by functionally studying several ARFs, the authors come up with a model of gene regulation by functionally distinct ARF types. The manuscript is generally of good quality and will have major impact in the field. There are however a number of rough edges and lacking controls, as well as leaps of logic that I would like to see addressed.</p><p>1) The transcriptome shows large effects of Aux/IAA deletion on gene expression. However, the analysis was done in 7-day old protonema, which allows for numerous layers of secondary effects. While this is not necessarily a problem, it becomes difficult when the authors use this approach to support their claim that &quot;activating and repressing ARFs share target genes&quot;. To make such a strong and direct statement, other types of support are necessary, such as for example EMSA or ChIP.</p><p>2) An alternative interpretation to the unexpected requirement of &quot;repressive&quot; ARFs for auxin-dependent gene activation is that the two types of ARFs interact, and that heterodimers of both mediate gene activation <italic>and</italic> repression. Yet another interpretation is that the distinction between the function of activating and repressing ARFs is not strict, and the ARF2 and ARF4 also contribute to gene activation. Similarly, ARF5 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has been shown to repress certain target genes (ARR7, ARR15 and STOMAGEN). I would ask the authors to discuss this and consider multiple interpretations.</p><p>3) A central premise of the current manuscript is based on the distinction between activating and repressing ARFs. However, the definition seems to be based only on phylogenetic relationship to the few <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ARFs that were functionally assayed. However, a lot of time has passed since <italic>Physcomitrella</italic> and the precursor of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> diverged. The authors seem to rule out the possibility that functions have changed in the past few 100's of millions of years. I would suggest that the assumptions about being activators or repressors are tested according to standard assays (using synthetic promoter in a protoplast assay), at least for the ARFs used here (ARFb2, b4, a8).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents an impressive body of work that yields fundamental new insights into auxin signaling â a key regulatory process in plant development. As such I think that it will be an important contribution to the literature. I found the genetics quite heavy duty, but I think that the work is presented in a clear and logical way, and I thought that most of the conclusions drawn were fully supported by the data shown.</p><p>The only conclusion that I thought should be strengthened is to do with the auxin blindness of the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> null â it is conceivable that the mutant has very high auxin levels, and if it has a maxed-out auxin response, I would not expect it to be sensitive to the addition of further auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>I would like to see that the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> null is insensitive to depletion of auxin levels (e.g. with L-kyn), and that <italic>ARFB4OE</italic> line 1 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) does not produce caulonema if grown on NAA.</p><p>I would like to see the data showing that the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> null is non responsive to auxin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13325.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All reviewers agree that your work represents an important advance in the field.

The main point of the extended description was to show that although the phenotype of the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant is very severe, we performed the experiment under conditions that minimize the differences between WT and the mutant, as much as possible. Using these conditions we were also able to collect healthy mutant tissue.</p><p>B) We now include a characterization of wild-type and mutant plants grown under the same specific conditions as for the RNAseq. This includes the microscopic analysis of the cells including measurements of length and width, as well as measurements of chlorophyll concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>C) In addition to the data described above, we now also present a clearer analysis of 7-day-old plants following protoplast recovery in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This was done in order to compare growth rate and individual plant morphology, which was not possible using the conditions adopted for RNAseq (in the case of the RNAseq we grew plants from blended tissue in order to be able to collect the same amount of tissue).</p><p>D) Finally, we emphasized in the text that differentially expressed genes in the mutant will include indirect auxin targets.</p><p><italic>2) Please show that ARF activators are really ARE activators and that ARF repressors are really ARE repressors in a direct assay, not only based on phylogeny. For example, the '&quot;classic&quot; protoplast assays to monitor ARF activity could be helpful here.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately we were unable to obtain conclusive results using several transient expression assays based on moss or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts. However, we strongly believe that our conclusions not affected by the absence of this data for three reasons.</p><p>A) In a recent paper describing the auxin pathway in <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> (Kato et al., 2015, Plos Genetics) the authors confirm that MpARF2 predicted to be repressing ARFs based on phylogeny, did indeed act to repress transcription in tobacco cells. Since <italic>Marchantia</italic> is an early diverged land plant, these results strongly suggest that ARF function is conserved in all land plants.</p><p>B) In Plavskin et al., (Dev Cell 36 276-289), the authors show that accumulation of PpARFbs (in a Ppsgs3 mutant and in an over-expression line) results in reduces expression of auxin resistant genes and a morphology very similar to previously described auxin-resistant mutants.</p><p>C) Our genetic analysis of stable ARF lines clearly shows that different ARFs behave according to their phylogenetic classification. For example: in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> we show that overexpression of repressing ARF in the <italic>aux/iaa</italic> mutant results in repression of gene expression. Inducible expression of an activating ARF in the same background line and results in opposite direction of gene expression levels as well as suppresses the repressing ARF phenotype.</p><p>We have added several sentences to the Results describing points A and B.</p><p><italic>3) Please demonstrate that different ARFs can bind to or compete for the same binding site. This could be done by ChIP experiments, or by gel-shift experiments, using a few example genes and appropriate controls.</italic></p><p>We performed gel shift experiments and presented the binding of ARF4b and ARFa8 to the same DNA sequencesin three auxin responsive gene promoters, in the absence and presence of specific or mutated competitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Please show experimentally that the aux/iaa null is insensitive to depletion of auxin levels (e.g. with L-kyn), and that the ARFB4OE line 1 (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) does not produce caulonema if grown on NAA.</italic></p><p>A) This is a good suggestion. We grew both WT and <italic>aux/iaaÎ</italic> mutant on L-kyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and, as expected, differentiation of caulonema was inhibited by the compound in wild-type plants. In contrast the triple mutant was insensitive.</p><p>B) We now present data showing that even after exposure to NAA for one month, the <italic>ARFB4OE (aux/iaaÎ)</italic> line does not produce caulonema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Please fix the formatting errors that are spread throughout the manuscript and consider a rewrite of some sections to make the paper easily accessible for the reader.</italic></p><p>We apologize for these errors. All references to figures and panels have been carefully checked and corrected where needed. In addition, the order of panels and their references in the text was changed for clarity.

Is the reviewer proposing that there is a fourth <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> gene in our strain? If so, we have performed many PCR and RT-PCR experiments, and sequenced many PCR products, and there is no evidence of another gene. In addition, we have a number of lines of evidence (PCR, RT-PCR and RNAseq), all of which indicate the complete absence of <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> transcripts.
