RTT is distinguished by a period of 6–12 month of overtly normal development followed, then, by a rapid regression with the loss of the purposeful motor skills and the onset of repetitive and autistic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2016</xref>). In the vast majority of cases RTT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>MECP2</italic> gene, which encodes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a global chromatin regulator highly expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bienvenu and Chelly, 2006</xref>). Neuropathological studies have shown that RTT brains exhibit abnormal neuronal morphology, but no sign of neuronal death. <italic>Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice recapitulate key neurological deficits observed in RTT patients offering an invaluable model where to investigate pathological mechanisms as well as test innovative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to human patients, RTT mice show microcephaly without gross neuropathological changes or neurodegeneration. In contrast, recent studies have convincingly revealed that the <italic>Mecp2</italic> loss significantly alters neuronal activity leading to a progressive imbalance of the excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity across the brain with divergent modalities occurring between different circuits and regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>). In 2007, a seminal study by the Adrian Bird’s group demonstrated that the RTT pathological phenotype can be significantly reversed in mice by re-activating the <italic>Mecp2</italic> even at advanced disease stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guy et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, genetic reactivation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in more than 70% of the neurons in adult mice normalized brain morphology and significantly improved several sensory-motor dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>). These findings provide a strong evidence that Mecp2 is a key factor in maintaining full neurological function during adulthood. Consistently, multiple pathological manifestations exhibited by adult mutant RTT mice can be fully recapitulated by deleting <italic>Mecp2</italic> exclusively in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheval et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGraw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the proven genetic reversibility of the RTT disease phenotype in mice, translational treatments aiming at curing the disease or some of its neurological symptoms have not been successful yet. In fact, MeCP2 is a global determinant of the neural chromatin structure and is a pervasive regulator of gene expression in brain cells and, thus, it remains challenging to target a single MeCP2 downstream pathway to obtain a substantial therapeutic benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2016</xref>). The inherent monogenic nature of RTT makes gene therapy a strong translational option for this disease. However, <italic>MECP2</italic> gene duplication in humans is responsible for a serious and clinically distinguished neurodevelopmental disorder. Affected males present with early hypotonia, limb spasticity and severe intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miguet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Esch et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, a successful gene therapy for RTT has to deliver the correct MeCP2 dosage in a tight range that overlaps with endogenous levels. Different studies have recently provided encouraging results showing that intravenous administration of an Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing the wild-type (WT) <italic>MECP2</italic> attenuated neurological dysfunctions and extended lifespan in RTT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadalla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matagne et al., 2017</xref>). However, the AAV9 does not cross efficiently the blood-brain barrier in adult mice while having a preferential tropism for peripheral organs. In fact, intravenous delivery of high doses of AAV9 can lead to severe liver toxicity and sudden death due to ectopic MeCP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the limited brain transduction obtained in these studies was not sufficient to determine a correlation between the viral dose, transduction efficiency and therapeutic benefits. Finally, it remains to be determined whether a gene therapy approach is capable to rescue molecular dysfunctions and transcriptional alterations caused by loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in the adult brain.</p><p>Recently, novel AAV9 synthetic variants have been generated through selected mutagenesis of the capsid proteins to enhance gene transfer in the brain after viral systemic delivery. In particular, using a cell type-specific capsid selection screening, the novel engineered capsid AAV-PHP.B has been developed through a 7-amino-acid insertion in the AAV9 VP1 capsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deverman et al., 2016</xref>). The AAV-PHP.B viral particles are able to permeate the blood-brain barrier of adult mice and diffuse throughout the neural parenchyma transducing with high efficiency both neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deverman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morabito et al., 2017</xref>). A subsequent enhanced version has been isolated, named AAV-PHP.eB (PHP.eB in short), with increasing efficiency in brain targeting, thus, requiring lower doses of virus for high neuronal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). We sought to use the PHP.eB as viral platform to sustain a global and efficient <italic>Mecp2</italic> brain transduction in adult mutant and WT mice. This system provided us with a flexible and potent tool to determine the efficacy and safety of diffuse <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene transfer in the adult mouse brain. Herein, using PHP.eB transductions in neuronal cultures, we characterized the viral gene expression cassette in all its elements to define its overall transcripts instability and limited translational efficiency. For this reason, the use of a constitutive strong promoter resulted more suitable to restore Mecp2 protein levels in a physiological range and limit viral overload, without compromising its disease rescue efficacy. Indeed, we obtained a robust phenotypic amelioration both in male and female <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice, without severe toxicity effects in wild-type animals. In addition, we identified and characterized a strong immune response to the exogenous Mecp2 in male mutant mice, that severely affected the life-span of treated animals. This limitation was overcome by chronic immunosuppression that granted a life-span extension of up to nine months.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Designing an instable <italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene cassette with reduced translation efficiency</title><p>Given that the therapeutic range of <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene expression is very limited, earlier studies employed a viral cassette with a minimal <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter with the attempt to reconstitute endogenous gene expression levels. However, the regulatory regions of <italic>Mecp2</italic> remain poorly characterized and the use of self-complementary AAV9 with a limited cargo capacity has obliged to include only very short fragments of the proximal promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matagne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinnett et al., 2017</xref>). With these conditions, it remains very unlikely to recapitulate the endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression pattern, whereas the risk of insufficient expression becomes higher. More generally, the lack of a system to compare exogenous with endogenous levels of MeCP2 is preventing the optimization of the viral transgene cassette. Herein, we overcame these limitations by setting a novel validation assay to compare the transcriptional efficiency of different viral <italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene cassettes directly in neuronal cultures. We initially confirmed that more than 90% of primary mouse neurons can be transduced with the PHP.eB virus. Then, we generated a transgene cassette with the <italic>Mecp2_e1</italic> isoform including the coding sequence and a short proximal 3’UTR (3’pUTR,~200 bp). This <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcript occurs naturally in embryonic stem cells and various tissues, but during development of the neural system this form is progressively replaced by transcripts with longer 3’-UTR (8,6 Kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene sequence carrying an N-terminal V5 tag was driven by two types of promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We opted to use the chicken-β-actin promoter, which has been extensively used in gene therapy for driving high levels of expression in both neurons and glial cells (M2a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Alternatively, we cloned a 1.4 kb fragment of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter (that following previous studies includes the vast majority of regulatory regions identified so far) with the intent to recapitulate the endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression pattern (M2b, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> primary neurons were infected with either viruses. As control we used wild-type (WT) neurons infected with a GFP vector (GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and two weeks later were lysed for immunoblotting and genome copy quantification. Surprisingly, using this <italic>Mecp2</italic> promoter fragment, the total viral Mecp2 protein amount remained significantly lower respect to endogenous levels in transduced neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Conversely, mutant neurons infected with the cassette containing the CBA promoter exhibited a physiological range of total Mecp2 protein. Moreover, similar results were obtained using Mecp2 immunofluorescence staining on infected neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This difference was not depended on the relative infection load, since viral copy numbers were equivalent in neurons transduced with either of the two viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Thus, only the use of the CBA strong promoter was capable of re-establishing Mecp2 protein levels in a physiological range without exceeding viral doses. We, then, asked why and through which mechanism the CBA-<italic>Mecp2</italic> cassette (M2a) could not exceed the endogenous Mecp2 protein range despite the use of a strong promoter and the presence of multiple copies of the virus in the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We speculated that the lack of the 5’- and 3’-UTR complete sequences from the <italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene might intrinsically impair protein production. During neuronal development, <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcripts with a long 3’-UTR are highly stabilized leading to progressive Mecp2 protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, alternative <italic>Mecp2</italic> isoforms with shorter 3’-UTRs are less stable and poorly regulated during development. Thus, we sought to compare the relative stability of the viral <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcript respect to the total endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> mRNA by measuring its half-life after gene transcription arrest with Actinomycin D (ActD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Using the same qRT-PCR primers and reaction, viral <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcripts were selectively amplified from PHP.eB-<italic>Mecp2</italic> transduced neuronal cultures isolated from <italic>Mecp2</italic> knock-out (KO) embryos, while total endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> mRNAs were obtained from WT neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Remarkably, viral <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcripts showed significant lower RNA levels respect to the total endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcripts after 300 min of ActD treatment (51 ± 4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Thus, the lack of a long 3’-UTR generates an instability-prone <italic>Mecp2</italic> (i<italic>Mecp2</italic>) isoform which is significantly destabilized in neuronal cultures. To determine if this reduction in RNA half-life was only determined by the pUTR, we generated an additional cassette with a synthetic assembled 3’-UTR (aUTR) which merged most of the known regulatory elements scattered in the 8,6 Kb long 3’-UTR as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matagne et al., 2017</xref>) (M2c, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In addition, we generated two more vectors, one including the physiological 5’-UTR sequence in combination with the pUTR sequence (M2d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and a second lacking the 3’-UTR thus carrying only the polyA (pA) sequence (M2e, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <italic>Mecp2</italic> RNA levels in neurons transduced with these viral vectors remained very unstable over time compared to endogenous mRNA levels (M2e: 48 ± 13%; M2c: 62% ± 0,2%; M2d 46 ± 20%; M2b 53 ± 3%). Finally, we generated and tested a cassette lacking the V5 tag, to exclude a possible interference on the transgene mRNA stability (M2f, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), without observing significant differences in comparison with previous configurations (73 ± 18%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).Thus, our results confirmed that Mecp2 gene expression is regulated by complex mechanisms and multiple factors, especially at RNA level. This complexity can hardly be restricted in the limited capacity of an AAV vector but is essential for the design of future <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene replacement strategies. <italic>Mecp2</italic> mRNA instability was independent by the genotype of the transduced neurons since similar mRNA loss was detected in WT, <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant and heterozygote neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNA stability and translational efficiency of the viral <italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Illustration of the AAV vectors expressing V5-tagged <italic>Mecp2_e1</italic> or GFP under the control of Chicken β-Actin (CBA) promoter or <italic>Mecp2</italic> core promoter.

For this aim, we employed the RiboLace, a novel methodology based on a puromycin-analog which enables the isolation of the ribosomal fraction in active translation with their associated RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clamer et al., 2018</xref>).

Next, the relative stability of the Mecp2 proteins produced by either the endogenous or the viral gene were assessed in neurons after treatment with cycloheximide (CHX).

In contrast, transgene RNA levels were proportionally less abundant compared to the relative viral genome copy in brain respect to the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a</xref>). In addition, despite the significant increase in i<italic>Mecp2</italic> genomic copies and total mRNA, protein levels were only marginally augmented in brain and partially in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a</xref>). This effect was particularly evident in cortical brain samples with the 10<sup>12</sup> vg dose that compared to wild-type triggered an increase of 80-fold in mRNA, but only of 3-fold in protein. These observations confirmed that i<italic>Mecp2</italic> mRNA is poorly transcribed and translated in brain tissue as previously shown in neuronal cell cultures. Altogether, these data clearly highlight the robust efficiency of the PHP.eB capsid to cross the blood-brain barrier in adult mouse brains and to spread throughout the neural tissue transducing large number of cells.

This phenomenon presented only in 10<sup>11</sup> vg treated mice (9 out of 12) and occurred 3–4 weeks after AAV injection. It started with a small lesion near the injection site, that progressively expanded to the entire tail and to the body showing a marked hair loss on the lumbar area. These mice were initially unaffected but while necrosis aggravated weight and general health started to be compromised and sacrifice was necessary. Overall none of the mice treated with lower doses of i<italic>Mecp2</italic> or GFP virus presented with this adverse symptom.</p><p>Given the systemic delivery of the virus in Mecp2 deficient mice, we set out to assess whether the immune response to the transgene could explain the health deterioration observed in the treated mice. This was unanticipated at least since none of the previous attempts of systemic gene therapy have considered or described such response to happen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinnett et al., 2017</xref>). However, Mecp2 has been implicated in the regulation of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lal et al., 2009</xref>) and of FoxP3 expression, a transcription factor required for the generation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the lack of Treg-mediated regulation was responsible for the strong immune response observed in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2. Indeed, treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) of <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to a 10<sup>11</sup> vg dose of PHP.eB-iMecp2 resulted in a striking amelioration of the general health conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The analysis of the frequency of cells in the spleen of <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to 10<sup>11</sup> vg and 10<sup>12</sup> vg of PHP.eB-iMecp2 (KO-iMecp2-10<sup>11</sup> vg and KO-iMecp2-10<sup>12</sup> vg, respectively) showed the increased number of splenocytes harvested from the latter mice compare to untreated <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice showed a significantly lower number of splenocyte compared to WT littermates, in line with the general status of inflammation due to spontaneous activation of T cells in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>). No major differences were observed in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartments in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice untreated or exposed to 10<sup>11</sup> vg and 10<sup>12</sup> vg of PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to the higher PHP.eB-iMecp2 dose (10<sup>12</sup> vg), analyzed two weeks post treatment, showed a significantly higher frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to untreated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Hence, we can speculate that treatment with the higher dose of PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice lacking Treg-mediated regulation led to an uncontrolled inflammatory response associated to the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that resulted in rapid death. We, next, investigated the induction of Mecp2-specific immune response by analyzing proliferation of T cells in response to Mecp2, cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and anti-Mecp2 antibody production in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus. Neither Mecp2-specific T cells nor Mecp2-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were detected in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, and data not shown). However, an increased non-specific (anti-CD3-stimulated cells) proliferative response was observed in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus compared to untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Finally, we detected anti-Mecp2 antibodies in the sera of <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus but not in WT mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus or in control untreated <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). Importantly, treatment with CsA prevented the induction of anti-Mecp2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Overall, these studies indicate, for the first time, the induction of uncontrolled proliferation of T cells and induction of Mecp2-specific antibodies in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice exposed to PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus, which can be overcome by immunosuppression. This severe immune response to the transgene can explain the rapid phenotypic deterioration and premature death occurred to the <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice treated with the highest dose of the therapeutic virus (10<sup>12</sup> vg). This conclusion is corroborated by the fact that WT and females <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> animals exposed to the same virus at a comparable dose did not develop any of these complications (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PHP.eB-iMecp2 and Csa co-treatment triggers a significant behavioral rescue of male <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice</title><p>Next, <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice were co-treated with 10<sup>11</sup> vg PHP.eB-iMecp2 or PHP.eB-GFP with daily injections of Csa starting 1 day before viral administration and longitudinally profiled for survival rate, general healthy conditions and motor behavior. Remarkably, CsA-treated respect to untreated Mecp2 deficient mice administrated with PHP.eB-iMecp2 showed a triplicated mean survival rate, reaching up to 38 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; median survival: KO-GFP: 52d; KO-GFP +Csa: 56d; KO-iMecp2-10<sup>11</sup>: 68d; KO-iMecp2-10<sup>11</sup> + CsA: 168d). Unfortunately, not all iMecp2-treated animals responded to CsA. Uncomplete immunosuppression led to tail lesion and premature sacrifice in 3 out of 10 cases, nonetheless all mice presented significant behavioral improvement. In fact, this group of mice exhibited only very low grades (&lt;3) in the aggregate severity score for an extensive period of time reflecting their general good healthy conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In particular, recovery in inertia, gait, hindlimb clasping, and irregular breathing were fully maintained over long time. Only some degree of tremors was still manifested in some of these mice accounting for the scores recorded in this test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This manifestation is likely associated with abnormalities in the mutant peripheral nervous system which is known to be not efficiently transduced by this particular AAV capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). Motor behavior was strongly rescued after gene therapy as shown by a significant recovery in the rotarod performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and spontaneous locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) up to 15 weeks. <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice were previously reported to have reduced anxiety levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, control treated mutant mice tarried and moved less within the elevated closed arms, while PHP.eB-iMecp2 treated mice displayed anxiety levels more similar to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Finally, sustained improvement in motor coordination and balance was also evident in the beam balance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>). In summary, this phenotyping assessment showed how a single injection of PHP.eB-iMecp2 adjuvated by the immunosuppressing treatment can elicit a robust and long-lasting recovery in survival (up to 38 weeks). More importantly the general health state and behavioral skills in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice was also restored to levels comparable to wild-type animals. This is the first clear evidence that a gene therapy approach could rescue for a long period RTT mice and significantly ameliorate their general condition and motor behaviour. The association of a significant life-span increment and evident phenotypic amelioration is the main goal of gene therapies applied to life treating diseases.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Behavioral rescue of symptomatic <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> animals after PHP.eB-iMecp2 treatment in combination with cyclosporine.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Survival curve of KO mice Cyclosporine (CsA) treated (n = 5, green line) and GFP-treated alone (n = 10, black line) or in combination with cyclosporine (CsA) (n = 6, brown line) or injected with a 1×10<sup>11</sup> dose of PHP.eB-iMecp2 alone (n = 10, orange line) or in combination with cyclosporine (CsA) (n = 10, violet line).

Computational analysis identified 1876 differential expressed genes (DEGs) with p&lt;0.05 significance between <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> and control mice roughly divided in two equal groups between up- and down-regulated genes in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This dataset significantly overlaps with the results published in a previous RNA-seq study which profiled the same brain tissue at a comparable mouse age, confirming the consistency of our results (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pacheco et al., 2017</xref>). The number of significant DEGs between Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup> mice administrated with therapeutic or control virus was 1271 with a small increase in upregulated genes. However, only a third of DEGs were shared between viral transduced and untreated <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice, while the remaining DEGs of the mutant mice were normalized in the treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,d,e</xref>). This data suggested that the viral treatment was able to correct a large fraction of gene expression changes associated with the RTT phenotype. However, a large set of DEGs was only associated with the treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice and, thus, to uncover their significance we performed Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis (GO). Remarkably, most of these DEGs were associated with immunological pathways such as immune response, immune system regulation and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Hence, these results corroborated at the molecular level the previous observations on the strong immune response mounted in the treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice against the inoculated transgene. We, then, performed gene ontology analysis on the DEG dataset enriched in the <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice but normalized after gene therapy. Interestingly, the most significant enrichment was in metabolic networks associated with lipid biosynthesis/transport and in particular cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Previous studies have shown brain and peripheral cholesterol levels are altered in <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice and patients’ specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segatto et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, gene responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis has been shown to be downregulated in severe symptomatic <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buchovecky et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, a large component of the molecular pathway for cholesterol production was downregulated in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice, but significantly rescued in PHP.eB-iMecp2 transduced animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). RT-qPCRs on independent cortical tissue lysates confirmed that gene expression levels of crucial enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis such as Squalene epoxidase (<italic>Sqle</italic>), NAD(P)-dependent steroid deydrogenease-like (<italic>Nsdhl</italic>) and Methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (<italic>Msmo1</italic>) were significantly restored by PHP.eB-iMecp2 gene therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>). An additional molecular group highly divergent between transduced and control <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice included genes encoding for potassium (Kv) channels. This class of ion channels serve diverse functions including regulating neuronal excitability, action potential waveform, cell volume and fluid and pH balance regulation.

Moreover, the strong immune response has complicated the readout of the symptomatic recovery of gene therapy in these animals. Thus, we thought to validate our approach in female <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mutant mice (Het). To this end, 5 months old <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> animals were intravenously injected with 10<sup>11</sup> vg of either PHP.eB-iMecp2 or control virus and examined over time up to 11 months post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). For these experiments, we selected only a single viral dose that sustained a general brain transduction rate between 65% and 90% and raising Mecp2 protein levels similar to those in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g,h,I,j</xref>). As previously reported, <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> females started to exhibit pathological signs from 10 months of age acquiring breathing irregularities, ungroomed coat, inertia and hindlimb clasping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guy et al., 2001</xref>).

In the severity score the control treated <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> females progressed to values over 4, whereas animals given the therapeutic virus rarely overcome a score beyond 2 in the entire observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

Likewise, in the beam balance test the therapy largely rescue the motor skills of the mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e,f</xref>). After 11 months from the injection, mice were euthanized to analyze the transgene expression levels and the transduction profile.

Animals were administrated with either 10<sup>11</sup> vg or 10<sup>12</sup> vg of PHP.eB-iMecp2 or left untreated (n = 9 each) and closely inspected over time.

According to aforementioned results, brain transduction efficiency was very high with a net increase of 20% between the lower and the higher viral dose (cortex: 45 ± 8% 10<sup>11</sup> vg, 68 ± 7% 10<sup>12</sup> vg; striatum: 58 ± 7%, 10<sup>11</sup> vg; 82 ± 5%, 10<sup>12</sup> vg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>). Viral copy number analysis confirmed a significant and prevalent targeting of the virus in the neural tissues respect to the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the high expression of the transgene, the total Mecp2 protein levels in cortex and striatum were only increased by 30% and 60% upon transduction with 10<sup>11</sup> vg and 10<sup>12</sup> vg of virus, respectively as assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). General health state and behavior were, then, scored in the remaining treated animals up to 12 weeks after treatment. During this time, growth curve, locomotor activity and fine coordination were slightly different between transduced and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d,e</xref>). General health state examination (severity score) revealed some breathing irregularities and tremor at rest which slightly increased the scoring output in the treated animals although with minimal difference compared to WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). Altogether, these observations indicated that high doses of PHP.eB-iMecp2 virus did not exert deleterious effects in WT animals in this window of time.

Importantly, an initial set of viral infections on primary neuronal cultures enabled us to select the most suitable configuration of the transgene cassette in order to achieve Mecp2 protein levels within a physiological range. Our results showed that the lack of a long 3’-UTR sequence destabilizes <italic>Mecp2</italic> mRNA significantly reducing its relative half-time. Moreover, all the combinations of <italic>Mecp2</italic> regulatory regions tested in this work did not enhance the i<italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene RNA stability. Thus, more work is necessary to identify additional <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcript stabilizing elements in the long 3’UTR. Additionally, using the RiboLace system to determine the amount of <italic>Mecp2</italic> transcripts associated with active translating ribosomes, our data showed a major loss in translation efficiency of the viral compared to the endogenous mRNA. These results strongly imply the strong functional impact of untranslated elements in the post-transcriptional control of Mecp2 expression. Along these lines, it was previously reported that endogenous Mecp2 protein levels correlate poorly with mRNA levels during development and in different adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shahbazian et al., 2002</xref>). For this reason, we favored to combine the <italic>Mecp2</italic> cDNA with the CBA strong promoter, building the i<italic>Mecp2</italic> cassette, in order to reach physiological range of Mecp2 proteins levels. Based on our in vitro results we be believe that more broadly, a preliminary in vitro screening in primary neuronal cultures is a valuable tool to characterize the properties of newly designed transgene cassette and vector transduction.</p><p>We decided to package the i<italic>Mecp2</italic> construct in the PHP.eB that was selected for its unprecedented capability to efficiently penetrate the brain after intravenous delivery and widely transduce neuronal and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2017</xref>). We showed that administration of high dose of PHP.eB-iMecp2 at the initial symptomatic stage can ameliorate disease progression with robust beneficial effects and significant lifespan extension. Moreover, we observed that both transduction efficiency and Mecp2 protein levels can impact the final outcome of phenotypic recovery. Indeed, animals treated with 10<sup>9</sup> vg dose of PHP.eB-iMecp2 (which transduced less than 15% of brain cells cortex and striatum) did not present significant therapeutic effects. This is only apparently different from previous observations reporting a phenotypic improvement in mutant mice with restoration of Mecp2 in only 5–10% of total brain cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrette et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, in our study, low-titer viral transduction targeted much better astrocytes rather than neurons, revealing a higher tropism of this viral capsid for the former cells. Thus, weak neuronal transduction (&lt;5% of total neurons) could be the reason for the absence of any phenotypic improvement. An additional difference is that in the present work we reconstituted Mecp2 function only in adulthood, differently from Mecp2 gene reconstitution through mouse breeding which occurs already during embryonic development. Thus, the phenotypic outcome of the gene-transfer protocols is highly dependent by the viral dose and the specific tropism of the capsid and not always is directly comparable to genetic rescue achieved with different approaches.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the intermediate viral doses (10<sup>10</sup> e 10<sup>11</sup>) had respectively moderate and robust effect in reverting phenotypic symptoms. In this last case the beneficial effects of the treatment were concealed by an adverse effect consisting of a strong immune response against the transgene. Importantly, this adverse complication is the result of using the male <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice that have no Mecp2 from birth and therefore recognize the therapeutic gene product as <italic>nonself</italic>. This is not the case for human female patients that are a mosaic of mutant and WT <italic>Mecp2</italic> cells, moreover even male hemizygous patient rarely present with protein complete loss, thus immune response against this transgene is unlikely to occur in human patients. Nonetheless this is a clinical aspect that need to be carefully considered during patient selection. It was initially surprising to us why former studies of <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene therapy in KO mouse strains did not highlight such adverse event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2013</xref>). A possible explanation could be related to the different tropism of the PHP.eB in comparison to AAV9.</p><p>The life-span of animals treated with 10<sup>12</sup> vg/mouse dose was not long enough to justify a similar response thus indicating a different mechanism of toxicity. This serious inflammatory response to the transgene, associated to the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, can explain the sudden death of the <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> animals treated with the highest PHP.eB-iMecp2 dose (10<sup>12</sup> vg). In fact, a similar dose of the therapeutic virus in WT animals was free of deleterious effects. Despite previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadalla et al., 2017</xref>), we could not detect any sign of toxicity in livers treated with PHP.eB, irrespectively of the transgene or the mice genotype, thus ruling out epatotoxicity in these conditions.</p><p>Beyond this immune reaction, we could not score any additional adverse manifestations directly caused by the therapy neither in mutant <italic>Mecp2</italic> or WT animals. This is consistent with the mild increase in total Mecp2 levels achieved by the i<italic>Mecp2</italic> transgene both in a mutant or WT background. Nonetheless we cannot exclude that the deleterious effect observed in mice treated with the highest dose (10<sup>12</sup> vg/mouse) could be related to an increase of Mecp2 above physiological level (~3 fold). In fact, abrupt <italic>Mecp2</italic> reactivation in Mecp2 knock-out mice has been reported to often lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guy et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, viral (10<sup>11</sup> vg) and CsA co-treatment was able to promote an unprecedented life-span recovery and robust improvement in general health state, locomotor activity and coordination. After months of cyclosporine treatment, the mice showed a deterioration in quality life and eventually had to be euthanized mainly for symptoms related to immunosuppression or relapsing immune response. PHP.eB-iMecp2 intervention significantly corrected also the abnormal gene expression alterations observed in <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mouse cortical tissue, including the reduced expression in multiple molecular components of the cholesterol pathway and some genes encoding for Kv channels. More broadly, PHP.eB-iMecp2 gene therapy sustained a strong recovery of the genome-wide transcriptional and mTOR-mediated translational processes affected in <italic>Mecp2</italic> deficient mice.</p><p>The molecular characterization <italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice rescue combined with its phenotypic analysis is a powerful tool to assess molecular pathways involved in the disease and more importantly in its recovery.</p><p>Taken together, the diffuse penetration of the PHP.eB in the adult mouse brain parenchyma is a unique property among all the recombinant viral strains in current use. Recently, two studies concomitantly discovered Ly6a as the endothelial receptor that allows PHP.B and PHP.eB variants to cross the BBB and diffuse the brain parenchyma of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hordeaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, this receptor is not conserved in primates and humans, thus implying species-specific difference in the transduction efficacy of these capsids. On this line, new findings indicate that brain transduction in adult primates is not improved with PHP.B compared to AAV9 although only few animals have yet been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hordeaux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuzaki et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, the PHP.B/eB receptor belongs to the large family of Ly6/uPar proteins, some of which are conserved in mammalian evolution and can be found in human brain endothelium, representing valuable targets for capsid engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loughner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kong et al., 2012</xref>). In this prospective, the PHP.B platform is fundamental to test the validity of new gene therapy strategies in mice models that can be translated into the clinical setting as soon as, in the next future, PHP.B-like AAVs penetrating the primate brain will be confirmed. Despite this caveat, RTT is a neurodevelopmental disorder and the therapeutic intervention should be finalized in the first months after birth as soon as the early signs of the disease manifest and genetic diagnosis is certain. At similar age, an intravenous infusion of AAV9 particles packaging the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene resulted in extended survival and improved motor functions in infants suffering for spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendell et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that at this early age, AAV9 systemic gene therapy might sustain a beneficial clinical outcome in RTT patients and even more so using AAV9 synthetic variants selected in the near future. Altogether in this study we characterized an i<italic>Mecp2</italic> viral cassette which sustained significant improvements in transgene delivery, safety and efficacy leading to the long-term symptomatic amelioration of RTT mice. These results might accelerate the introduction of new gene therapy strategies for RTT with clinical prospective.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were maintained at San Raffaele Scientific Institute Institutional mouse facility (Milan, Italy) in micro-isolators under sterile conditions and supplied with autoclaved food and water.

The author's show phenotypic improvement, rescue of gene expression alterations, improvements in hypoactive protein synthesis pathways in treated mice, and identify and address an immune response complication seen in male mice treated with higher doses of rescue virus. While the results on the whole are very interesting, add to existing work in the area, and further establish the phenotypes of Rett syndrome mice are correctable by functional Mecp2 gene reintroduction, there is a significant issue that lessens my enthusiasm for this work to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major Issue:</p><p>The premise of the study is a pre-clinical assessment of peripherally-administered gene therapy using an improved AAV serotype that could bypass some of the major hurdles currently hindering clinical trial development in the field. Unfortunately, and likely while the study was in progress, the PHP.B series of viral serotypes were found to cross the BBB efficiently only in species (or strains) expressing a specific Ly6A haplotype that is not present in primates. This indicates PHP.eB likely has no clinical utility in humans unless directly infused into CNS, and thus offers no clear advantage over other current gene therapy serotypes such as AAV9. This significantly decreases the impact for the lack of peripheral organ toxicity, high efficiency of CNS transduction when peripherally administered, and potentially the efficiency of brain expression that are reported here. The work itself is well conceived and executed (notwithstanding some of the less critical comments below), and would still be of interest to the field. But the limits of the PHP.eB system to experimental contexts lessens the impact of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript by Luoni et al., the authors perform a proof of concept for the use of AAV- PHP.eb viruses, which were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice, to restore physiologically relevant levels of Mecp2, a gene which mutation is causal to Rett syndrome. Because high levels of Mecp2 can also induce deficits in brain development and function, the authors set out to explore different constructs including one that drive the expression of a relatively unstable mRNA (iMecp2). Using an elegant combination of cell cultures and in vivo injections, the authors show: (i) that they can drive a broad expression of Mecp2 in the brain; (ii) that the expression levels, assessed by western blot and immunostainings, can restore Mecp2 expression levels in mutant conditions. They further tested several viral doses of iMecp2 to test the rescue in male mutants (Mecp2y/-), which harbor a severe phenotype, but do not reflect the pathological condition (Females Mecp2-/+). They found that increasing doses were progressively rescuing behavior deficits and expression levels, except at high dose, where they found that the viral injections triggered an immune response, specifically in mutants, probably linked to a role of Mecp2 in regulatory T cells. By using cyclosporine treatment to the high dose viral injection, the authors could trigger a robust rescue at all levels. The authors also show a mild albeit significant improved rescue in female Mecp2+/- (Figure 7). Finally using RNA-seq, the authors show in Mecp2y/- males that iMecp2 injections rescued most of the transcriptional defects normally associated with Mecp2 deficiency as well as established that this viral infection does not major changes in control males and females.</p><p>Collectively, this study includes an impressive and highly convincing set of experiments that are well presented and support the main claims of the authors. The expression rate and levels obtained by the viral transfection are quite remarkable, the controls extremely solid and the effects observed will be of interest for both neurobiologists and clinicians. However, in its present form, several issues need to be addressed before the article is suitable for publication.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>- Because this article is really designed and presented as a proof of concept for therapy, the females should be presented in a main figure (instead of Figure 5) and should be stressed in the analysis. Is there any difference in transduction/expression levels in males vs females? Is there an immune response as well?</p><p>- While the cyclosporine A treatment has been performed on iMecp2 transfected mutants, there does not seem to have a control group. The authors should provide either a clear reason to discard this condition since it would change the statistical power of their analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52629.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Currently, the AAV-PHP.eB represents the main technology to achieve this aim, due to its efficient whole brain delivery, at least in mouse models, where a critical evaluation of the gene therapy effects is still missing. Indeed, recent works based on the AAV9 have shown that the gene therapy efficacy during the symptomatic stage is low (Gadalla et al., 2017; Sinnett et al., 2017). Indeed the same authors claimed that: “…While AAV9 appears to be insufficiently efficient in terms of brain transduction after systemic delivery of MECP2 to achieve the desired therapeutic benefit, combining the safer second-generation cassette together with capsids with improved brain penetrance may effectively pair effective CNS gene transfer with safe levels of peripheral MeCP2 transgene expression]…” (Gadalla et al., 2017). Thus, the use of the AAV-PHP.eB allowed us to overcome this important limitation, validating the strong potential of gene therapy also in symptomatic mice, that closely resembles the pathological condition of RTT patients. The reviewers are right in emphasizing that the engineered synthetic AAV-PHP.eB capsid has not the same efficiency in nonhuman primates as in mice to transduce the brain upon systemic intra-vascular delivery (Hordeaux et al., 2018). Exactly this same subject has been highlighted also in our discussion since it’s a hot topic in the field. However, considering the three arguments explicated below our study should be considered a fundamental step to develop an efficient and safe therapy for RTT which necessitates of a brainwide gene therapy approach.</p><p>1) Following the seminal discovery of the PHP.eB capsid family, large projects in academics and companies have been carried out to identify and characterize similar engineered PHP.eB-like capsids with conserved brain transduction efficiency from mouse to non-human primates. Indeed, participating to the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) in early May this year, I have personally attended some presentations that described the generation of new PHP.eB-like capsids with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce the brain in non-human primates.</p><p>Thus, it can be anticipated that these novel viral capsids will become available to the community in a short while.

Notably, AAV9.DT-N exhibits the highest transduction of neurons in the brain of any engineered variant to date, with less than 1% of cells in the liver transduced, a decrease of over 100-fold from AAV9. Most importantly, these capsids’ ability to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce CNS neurons is not limited to the rodents they were selected in, having also been validated in non-human primates.</p><p>Oral Presentation Abstract #48. Targeted In Vivo Biopanning of AAV Capsid Libraries Using Cell TypeSpecific RNA Expression. Nonnenmacher et al.</p><p>.…. Interestingly, several variants highly similar to the PHP.eB capsid were recovered, suggesting that our method allowed a rapid selection of high-performance capsids. Top-ranking capsids were then individually tested, and several variants showed CNS transduction similar to or higher than the PHP.eB benchmark. Through this method, we’ve identified a panel of novel engineered capsids capable of high levels of production, extremely efficient transduction of the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous delivery, and negligible presence throughout the rest of the body both in mice and non-human primates.</p><p>2) Moreover, our viral vector design and administration route have a strong relevance to define safety and efficacy of a systemic gene therapy approach for RTT. These important issues need to be addressed and delved as much as possible in pre-clinical settings. PHP.eB capsid has given us the possibility to investigate this matter in a way that no other natural capsid as ever displayed.</p><p>3) Finally, we strongly believe that translating a therapy from a murine model to the human system is long a process that cannot be limited to a single choice. All the possible settings have to be carefully evaluated and weighted in order to develop the best therapeutic treatment. In this perspective, our contribute can be seminal in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study should include an expanded analysis of female heterozygotes as pointed out by the two reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Most of our work is executed in male, and not female RTT mice, since only these animals recapitulate the cardinal features of the human RTT phenotype including the severe motor and cognitive deficits (Guy et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2001). Whereas heterozygous female mice have mild deficits that appear only starting from 8-10 months of age. Moreover, these symptoms are highly variable and more difficult to evaluate than those of null male mice. Indeed, most of the studies aimed to evaluate the effect of Mecp2 restoration mediated by genetic or viral strategies have been conducted in male RTT mice (Guy et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2012; Gadalla et al., 2013; Gadalla et al., 2017; Sinnett et al., 2017). Nevertheless, we can further expand our analyses in heterozygous female mice comparing the transduction profile between males and females animals after the treatment as requested by the two reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Luoni et al., highlights observations stemming from pre-clinical gene therapy efforts conducted in a mouse model of the neurodevelopmental condition Rett syndrome. The author's show phenotypic improvement, rescue of gene expression alterations, improvements in hypoactive protein synthesis pathways in treated mice, and identify and address an immune response complication seen in male mice treated with higher doses of rescue virus. While the results on the whole are very interesting, add to existing work in the area, and further establish the phenotypes of Rett syndrome mice are correctable by functional Mecp2 gene reintroduction, there is a significant issue that lessens my enthusiasm for this work to be published in eLife.</p><p>Major issue:</p><p>The premise of the study is a pre-clinical assessment of peripherally-administered gene therapy using an improved AAV serotype that could bypass some of the major hurdles currently hindering clinical trial development in the field. Unfortunately, and likely while the study was in progress, the PHP.B series of viral serotypes were found to cross the BBB efficiently only in species (or strains) expressing a specific Ly6A haplotype that is not present in primates. This indicates PHP.eB likely has no clinical utility in humans unless directly infused into CNS, and thus offers no clear advantage over other current gene therapy serotypes such as AAV9. This significantly decreases the impact for the lack of peripheral organ toxicity, high efficiency of CNS transduction when peripherally administered, and potentially the efficiency of brain expression that are reported here. The work itself is well conceived and executed (notwithstanding some of the less critical comments below), and would still be of interest to the field. But the limits of the PHP.eB system to experimental contexts lessens the impact of the results.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript by Luoni et al., the authors perform a proof of concept for the use of AAV- PHP.eb viruses, which were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice, to restore physiologically relevant levels of Mecp2, a gene which mutation is causal to Rett syndrome. Because high levels of Mecp2 can also induce deficits in brain development and function, the authors set out to explore different constructs including one that drive the expression of a relatively unstable mRNA (iMecp2). Using an elegant combination of cell cultures and in vivo injections, the authors show: (i) that they can drive a broad expression of Mecp2 in the brain; (ii) that the expression levels, assessed by western blot and immunostainings, can restore Mecp2 expression levels in mutant conditions. They further tested several viral doses of iMecp2 to test the rescue in male mutants (Mecp2y/-), which harbor a severe phenotype, but do not reflect the pathological condition (Females Mecp2-/+). They found that increasing doses were progressively rescuing behavior deficits and expression levels, except at high dose, where they found that the viral injections triggered an immune response, specifically in mutants, probably linked to a role of Mecp2 in regulatory T cells. By using cyclosporine treatment to the high dose viral injection, the authors could trigger a robust rescue at all levels. The authors also show a mild albeit significant improved rescue in female Mecp2+/- (Figure 7). Finally using RNA-seq, the authors show in Mecp2y/- males that iMecp2 injections rescued most of the transcriptional defects normally associated with Mecp2 deficiency as well as established that this viral infection does not major changes in control males and females.</p><p>Collectively, this study includes an impressive and highly convincing set of experiments that are well presented and support the main claims of the authors.

This very subject has been highly regarded also in our discussion since it’s a hot topic in the field. However, given the considerations that we argument below, our study should be considered a fundamental step in order to develop an efficient and safe therapy for RTT. This an important goal, since a brain-wide gene therapy is the only clinical option for an efficient treatment of this disease.</p><p>Following the seminal discovery of the PHP.B capsid family, large projects in academics</p><p>(Church, Gradinaru, Maguire, Gray, Buening labs) and companies (Voyager, Spark Ther., Passage Bio) have been carried out to identify and characterize similar engineered AAV9like capsids with conserved brain transduction efficiency from mouse to non-human primates and preliminary data have been presented to international meetings in the last 12 months (ASGCT-Washington 5/2019, ESGCT-Barcelona 10/2019). Thus, it can be anticipated that these novel viral capsids will be published and become available to the community in a short while. On this line, the Maguire’s lab has already published a new engineered AAV9 capsid, named AAV-F, with a new 7-aminoacid peptide in the exact same site were PHP.B capsid has been engineered, corresponding to position 588-589 of VP1 aminoacidic sequence (Hanlon et al., 2019). However, differently from the PHP.B, the AAV-F capsid is able to efficiently transduce the brain tissue after systemic delivery in BALB/c mice where the PHP.B receptor (Ly6A) is mutated and unfunctional. This finding suggests that the AAV-F crosses the brain endothelium through a different membrane receptor, that if conserved in evolution, might provide AAV-F the ability to transduce non-human primates and humans as well. Additionally, the Gradinaru’s lab has reported the characterization of two new PHP.B-like engineered capsids, named AAV-CAP.b10 and b22 that after systemic delivery in adult marmosets can transduce brain neurons 15-fold and 17-fold higher than AAV9, respectively (ASGCT 2020, Abstract). Thus, new AAV9 engineered capsids will be soon available with similar operative properties of the PHP.B, but with a strong translational potential for gene therapy applications in humans.</p><p>In this perspective, our viral vector design and administration route has a strong relevance to define the safety and efficacy of a systemic gene therapy approach for RTT. The results obtained in our study with the PHP.eB remain absolutely valid and, therefore, can accelerate the use of the new engineered capsid compatible with translational applications. PHP.eB capsid has given us the possibility to investigate this matter in a way that no other natural capsid would allow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript by Luoni et al., the authors perform a proof of concept for the use of AAV- PHP.eb viruses, which were shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in mice, to restore physiologically relevant levels of Mecp2, a gene which mutation is causal to Rett syndrome.

For this reason, we moved these data to a principal figure (now Figure 7). Nevertheless, both the mild phenotype and the variability of heterozygous females do not recapitulate the strong neurological deficits affecting RTT patients. In fact, only hemizygous mutant male mice present severe neuropathological symptoms resembling somehow the patient condition. For these reasons, we consider that results obtained both in male and female mice are important to be presented in the main figures.</p><p>Concerning the first question, a direct comparison of transduction/expression levels between males and females cannot be performed since the experimental conditions tested in this work are intrinsically different. In fact, females were injected after 5 months of life and sacrificed after around 11 months post-treatment, while males received the same amount of viral vectors after 4 weeks of age and they were euthanized about 2 months post-treatment. Thus, either the weight at the time of the injection (27 grams median weight of 5-months old Mecp2 heterozygous female vs 12 grams median weight of 4-weeks old Mecp2 KO animals) and the time of the final analyses were significantly different. Having said that, we completely agree with the reviewer that a more detailed characterization of the treated females is required to strengthen our work. For this reason, we have analyzed the levels of transduction and expression of our transgene also in this group of mice and included these results in the Supplemental Figure 6. As described in the revised manuscript, we observed that Mecp2 levels in the cortical tissue were higher in treated females in comparison with WT untreated mice (males and females) or control females (Supplementary Figure 7A). Conversely, in the liver we detected only a mild increase of both transduction and expression levels in comparison with the control group (Supplementary Figure 7A), indicating a reduced viral persistence. Loss of AAV genomes after 11 months from the injection is probably a consequence of small but continued proliferation of the liver cells, a general phenomenon which affects AAV transduction in this organ (i.e. Dane et al., 2009). Moreover, we have included in the revised manuscript a comprehensive characterization of the viral transduction profile in the brain tissue of this group of mice, showing a similar distribution of transduced neurons and astrocytes between males and females (Supplementary Figure 7B).</p><p>Concerning the second question, in Mecp2 mutant females as well as wild-type mice we did not detect any notable immune response to the viral transgene. These data are in line with our hypothesis that only Mecp2 null mice have an exacerbated immune response due to an impaired immune regulatory system as initially described by Li et al., (2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While the cyclosporine A treatment has been performed on iMecp2 transfected mutants, there does not seem to have a control group.
