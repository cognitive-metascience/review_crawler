In the nervous systems of diverse organisms neural connections are arranged into layered networks, wherein each layer is defined by a unique cellular composition and the axonal arborizations of different input neurons are restricted to specific layers. This organizational strategy is thought to optimize the precision of synaptic connectivity and information processing. Layered connections define many regions of the vertebrate nervous system, including the cerebral cortex (mammals), the spinal cord and retina, and connections in the insect optic lobe are also organized in a layer-specific manner. Elucidating how neurons organize into layered networks is crucial for understanding how the precision of neural connectivity is achieved, and may provide key insights into neural function.</p><p>Previous studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates have identified molecules that are necessary for layer specificity in particular neuron types (reviewed in) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanes and Yamagata, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly of specific layers remain poorly characterized. For example, how different neurons innervate the same layer, and whether they do so through shared or different mechanisms is not known. To address this, we study layer formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, wherein the cell types that innervate specific layers are well-described and genetically accessible.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), visual input converges on the medulla, wherein it is processed within parallel layers. The medulla receives input directly from R7 and R8 photoreceptors, which are UV and blue/green sensitive, respectively, and indirectly from broadly tuned photoreceptors (R1-R6) through second order lamina monopolar neurons L1-L5 (lamina neurons). Photoreceptor and lamina neuron axons innervate discrete medulla layers and synapse with medulla neurons that process information and transmit signals to higher centers. Information from specific regions of the visual field is processed in modular columnar units, organized perpendicular to the layers. Lamina and photoreceptor axons carrying input from the same point in space converge on targets in the same column. Input from neighboring points in space is processed in neighboring columns, establishing a retinotopic map.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33962.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system and lamina monopolar neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anatomy of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (Adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>).

Prior to innervating discrete layers, lamina growth cones terminate in broad distal or proximal domains within the outer medulla.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33962-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>The medulla comprises ten layers (M1-M10) organized into outer (M1-M6) and inner (M8-M10) regions that are divided by tangential processes that form the serpentine layer (i.e. M7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The cell bodies of medulla neurons are excluded from the layers, and thus layered connections develop within a dense meshwork of cellular processes. Laminar-specific connections within the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the vertebrate retina develop in a similar manner. Medulla layers are defined in adult flies by the morphologies of the axon terminals and dendritic branches of particular cell types, which in general overlap completely or not at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The positions of these processes are largely indicative of the location of synapses, although some neurites do not stratify and form synapses en passant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2015</xref>). In total, ~40,000 neurons that fall into more than sixty cell types form connections within one or more layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Studies of lamina neuron and photoreceptor axon development indicate that medulla layers emerge dynamically from broad domains. The morphologies of L1-L5 axons define layers M1-M5 in the outer medulla of adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, in early pupal development the outer medulla is a fraction of its adult size, and lamina growth cones terminate in two broad domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>). L2 and L4 growth cones terminate in a distal domain of the outer medulla, while L1, L3 and L5 growth cones terminate in a proximal domain. The mechanisms underlying specificity for the distal or proximal domain are not known. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that lamina neurons innervate broad domains prior to segregating into discrete layers. In the mouse IPL, it has been proposed that neurons initially innervate broad domains defined by the complementary expression of repulsive cell surface molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsuoka et al., 2011</xref>). Together with studies in the medulla, this suggests that the refinement of broad domains into discrete layers may represent a conserved developmental strategy for constructing layer-specific circuits.</p><p>Characterization of the targeting of L3 axons and the axons of R8 photoreceptors to the M3 layer has provided insight into how discrete layers emerge from broad domains. L3 and R8 axons innervate M3 sequentially during development. R8 neurons are born first and project axons that terminate near the distal surface of the medulla (known as M0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ting et al., 2005</xref>). L3 axons within the same column project past R8 axons and terminate within a broad domain in the proximal outer medulla (discussed above) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequently, L3 growth cones segregate into the developing M3 layer through a stereotyped structural rearrangement that is regulated by mechanisms that are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>). Within M3, L3 growth cones secrete Netrin, which acts locally to regulate the attachment of R8 growth cones within the layer after they extend from M0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the M3 layer develops in part through the stepwise innervation of L3 and R8 axons, and R8 layer specificity depends on a signal from L3 growth cones.</p><p>Taken together, these developmental studies point to a model, wherein outer medulla layers emerge in a stepwise manner from broad domains through a precise sequence of interactions between specific cell types. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that control stepwise layer assembly we concentrate on assembly of the M3 layer, and in this study focus on L3 neurons. Previously, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fezf (dFezf)/Earmuff, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the Fezf zinc finger transcription factors in vertebrates (Fezf1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hashimoto et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Matsuo-Takasaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weng et al., 2010</xref>), is selectively expressed in L3 neurons in the lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that dFezf might regulate the expression of genes that control cell-specific aspects of L3 development, including broad domain specificity, layer specificity, and synaptic specificity within the target layer.</p><p>Interestingly, our genetic analyses of dFezf function in L3 neurons revealed a critical role for dFezf in regulating the M3-specific innervation of both L3 <italic>and</italic> R8 axons. DFezf functions cell autonomously to promote the targeting of L3 growth cones to the proximal domain of the outer medulla, which is essential for L3 layer specificity. We find that members of the dpr cell surface gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>) are prominent direct or indirect dFezf targets in L3 neurons, and we propose that dFezf regulates growth cone targeting by controlling the expression of dpr proteins that mediate interactions with target cells in the medulla. In addition, we show that dFezf non-autonomously regulates R8 layer specificity through the activation of <italic>Netrin</italic> expression in L3 neurons. When dFezf function is lost in L3 neurons, L3 and R8 axons innervate inappropriate layers while the dendrites of a common synaptic target (Tm9) innervate the M3 layer normally. As a result, synaptic connectivity with the target cell is disrupted. We conclude that dFezf represents a transcriptional module that constructs M3 layer circuitry by controlling the stepwise layer innervation of specific cell types through cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms. We propose that the use of such modules to coordinate neural connections within correct layers is a widespread strategy for building laminar-specific circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DFezf is selectively expressed in L3 neurons during pupal development and in adult flies</title><p>As a first step towards characterizing the function of dFezf in L3 neurons we examined its expression during development. Previously, we showed that dFezf is expressed in L3 neurons at 40 hr after puparium formation (h APF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), when L3 growth cones are in the process of segregating into the developing M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>). To assess if dFezf is also expressed in L3 neurons at other stages of development and determine whether expression remains restricted to L3 neurons, we assessed dFezf immunostaining in the lamina using confocal microscopy. We discovered that dFezf is expressed in L3 neurons from early pupal stages (at least as early as 12 hr APF) through to adulthood, but is not expressed in late third instar larvae when lamina neurons begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). DFezf expression was not detected in lamina neuron precursor cells or any other cells besides L3 at any stage of development in the lamina. The timing and selectivity of dFezf expression is consistent with dFezf playing an important role in regulating L3 development.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33962.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>DFezf</italic> is cell autonomously required for L3 layer specificity and axon terminal morphology.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Confocal images showing dFezf protein expression in the lamina from the late 3<sup>rd</sup> Instar larval stage through to adulthood (newly eclosed flies).

This allowed us to generate single, fluorescently labeled wild type or <italic>dFezf</italic> mutant L3 neurons while simultaneously visualizing the active zone protein Bruchpilot (Brp), expressed from its native promoter (see Materials and methods for detailed description). The <italic>dFezf</italic> null allele used in these experiments (<italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic>) contains a single A to T nucleotide change leading to the substitution of a leucine for a conserved histidine in the third zinc-finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weng et al., 2010</xref>). We found that L3 neurons homozygous for <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> displayed defects in axon terminal morphology and layer specificity in the medulla. Wild type L3 neurons elaborate stratified axon terminals within the M3 layer (100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,J</xref>).

The remaining 16% of the axons either terminated in the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,J</xref>) or in more proximal layers (e.g. M4-M6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>), and these also had terminal-like swellings in M1-M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Presynaptic Brp puncta were present in mis-targeting L3 terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K,L</xref>), suggesting that mutant neurons formed synaptic connections within incorrect layers. However, whether these represent active synapses, and if so whether they are established with appropriate partners, inappropriate partners, or both is unclear. In the lamina, L3 neurons display a unique dendritic projection pattern in which all dendrites project to one side of the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

In early pupal development (~24 hr APF), the axons of wild type L3 neurons terminate in the proximal domain of the outer medulla directly above R7 growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,E</xref>). The axons of <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> neurons incorrectly terminated within the distal domain of the outer medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Under these conditions L3 growth cones terminated just underneath the growth cones of R8 photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and occasionally terminated slightly more distally so that they completely overlapped with R8 growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By mid-pupal development (~48 hr APF), the growth cones of wild type L3 neurons have segregated into the developing M3 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G,K</xref>). However, we found that all of the growth cones of <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> L3 neurons displayed abnormal morphologies, defects in layer specificity, or both. Most of the abnormal growth cones (67%) exclusively innervated the developing M1 and M2 layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,K</xref>). The remaining 33% of the growth cones terminated in the developing M3 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,K</xref>) or in more proximal layers (e.g. M4-M6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). However, each of these growth cones also displayed abnormal swellings in distal layers (i.e. the developing M1 and M2 layers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>, arrowheads). These defects in morphology and layer innervation are consistent with the abnormalities observed in adult flies under these conditions. We observed similar deficits in L3 growth cone targeting in MARCM experiments when we used a different <italic>dFezf</italic> mutant allele (<italic>dFezf<sup>2</sup></italic>) that eliminates the entire <italic>dFezf</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weng et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, defects in growth cone targeting during pupal development, as well as abnormal layer innervation in adult flies caused by <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> or <italic>dFezf<sup>2</sup></italic> were completely rescued by a single copy of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the <italic>dFezf</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,M</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that <italic>dFezf</italic> is cell-autonomously required for the targeting of L3 growth cones to the proximal domain of the outer medulla, which may be necessary for the subsequent segregation of the growth cones into the developing M3 layer.</p><p>We reasoned that the growth cones of <italic>dFezf</italic> null L3 neurons could directly terminate within the distal domain of the outer medulla, or could initially target correctly to the proximal domain and then retract. Direct mis-targeting would be consistent with a change in axon target specificity, while retraction would suggest a defect in stabilizing growth cone position. To distinguish between these possibilities we took two approaches. First, in MARCM experiments we focused on the L3 clones that had most recently innervated the medulla (i.e. the youngest clones, see dashed box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Unlike the youngest wild type clones, the large majority of the nascent <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> clones (82%) terminated within the distal domain of the outer medulla similar to their older counter parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,N,O</xref>), consistent with most of these neurons directly innervating this region. Second, we investigated growth cone targeting when <italic>dFezf</italic> was disrupted in combination with <italic>CadN</italic> and <italic>Sema-1a</italic>. CadN and Sema-1a function synergistically to restrict L3 growth cones to the outer medulla during pupal development, preventing innervation of the serpentine layer and inner medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pecot et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that if the growth cones of <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> L3 neurons initially target correctly and then retract, then in the absence of CadN and Sema-1a function the growth cones would inappropriately innervate the serpentine layer and inner medulla, as in <italic>CadN</italic> and <italic>Sema-1a</italic> double mutant neurons. Conversely, if the growth cones of <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> L3 neurons directly mis-target to the distal outer medulla, this should prevent mis-targeting beyond the outer medulla caused by the loss of CadN and Sema-1a function, and the triple KO phenotype should resemble the loss of dFezf function only. MARCM experiments revealed the latter to be correct. L3 neurons lacking the function of dFezf, CadN and Sema-1a predominantly innervated the distal domain of the outer medulla in early pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,P</xref>), similar to L3 neurons lacking dFezf function only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), although the triple KO neurons more frequently terminated within the R8 growth cone layer. Importantly, the triple KO neurons did not mis-target beyond the outer medulla like <italic>CadN</italic>/<italic>Sema-1a</italic> double mutant L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q,R</xref>). Combined with our analyses of newly born <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic> L3 neurons, these data suggest that L3 neurons lacking dFezf function directly innervate the distal domain of the outer medulla, which is consistent with a switch in broad domain specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DFezf acts instructively to regulate growth cone targeting to the proximal domain of the outer medulla</title><p>DFezf could function permissively or in an instructive manner to regulate the targeting of L3 growth cones to the proximal domain of the outer medulla. To discriminate between these possibilities we performed mis-expression experiments in other lamina neurons. If dFezf function is instructive, then mis-expressing it in L2 or L4 neurons, which normally target to the distal domain of the outer medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), should cause their growth cones to terminate in the proximal domain. By contrast, as L1 and L5 growth cones normally terminate in the proximal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), dFezf-mis-expression in these neurons should not affect growth cone targeting. For technical reasons we decided to focus on L2 and L5 neurons. In L5 neurons, we mis-expressed cDNA encoding dFezf-HA using 6–60 GAL4, which has been shown to selectively drive expression in L5 neurons in the lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nern et al., 2008</xref>). In these experiments all L5 neurons and a small number of medulla and lobula neurons expressed dFezf-HA, as determined through HA immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and a subset of L5 neurons were specifically labeled by myr::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that the expression of dFezf-HA had no effect on L5 growth cone position in early pupal development. The growth cones of dFezf-expressing L5 neurons innervated the proximal domain of the outer medulla in a manner indistinguishable from wild type neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). In adult flies, L5 terminals are confined to the M5 layer, and L5 neurons also arborize within distal layers M1 and M2 through branching that occurs off the main neurite during mid-late pupal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). DFezf expression did not affect the layer position or morphology of L5 terminals, but caused defects in the distal arborizations of the vast majority of L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). 82% of L5 neurons mis-expressing dFezf displayed reduced distal arborizations that failed to extend into the M2 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,H</xref>), and 15% of neurons extended distal branches into neighboring columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). These findings, along with the fact that <italic>dFezf</italic> null L3 neurons inappropriately arborize in distal medulla layers, suggests that dFezf function may antagonize innervation of the distal outer medulla.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33962.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>DFezf plays an instructive role in regulating growth cone targeting.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) L5 mis-expression experiments.

The expression of dFezf-HA was assessed through HA immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–I’’’</xref>). In these experiments, GAL80 prevented GAL4 expression (and therefore dFezf-HA expression) in lamina neurons that did not undergo mitotic recombination (non-clones), which represented the large majority of lamina neurons. In lamina neuron clones GAL4 induced the expression of dFezf-HA and GFP, and the GFP positive clones that also expressed the L2 marker were confirmed as L2 clones. Only isolated L2 clones within each column were considered, eliminating the possibility of non-autonomous effects from dFezf mis-expression in other lamina neurons in the same column. Using this criteria we found that, in early pupal development, the growth cones of all L2 neurons mis-expressing dFezf-HA inappropriately terminated within the proximal domain of the outer medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–L</xref>), and in adult flies the large majority of these neurons (88%) incorrectly innervated the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M–O</xref>).

In all cases dFezf-HA expressing L2 neurons still displayed terminal-like swellings within the M2 layer, indicating a partial rather than complete change in layer specificity. These experiments demonstrate that mis-expressing <italic>dFezf</italic> in L2 neurons is sufficient to induce innervation of the proximal domain of the outer medulla, and cause ectopic innervation of the L3 target layer M3. Collectively, our mis-expression studies in L2 and L5 neurons support that dFezf acts instructively to direct growth cone targeting.

However, ranking the DE genes based on significance revealed several intriguing candidates. For example, using this criteria, the top three genes are <italic>dprs 17</italic>, <italic>13</italic>, and <italic>1</italic>, respectively, which are members of the dpr cell surface family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>). The mRNA levels of all three genes change more than 1000 fold when <italic>dFezf</italic> is disrupted in L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>Dpr 17</italic> is exclusively expressed in L3 neurons in the lamina and <italic>dpr1</italic> is expressed in L3 and L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Both are downregulated in the absence of dFezf function, and for dpr17 we confirmed this at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>). <italic>Dpr13</italic> is highly expressed in L2 neurons and moderately expressed in L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), and is upregulated in <italic>dFezf</italic> null L3 neurons. In addition to these, eight other <italic>dpr</italic> genes are differentially expressed between wild type and <italic>dFezf</italic> null L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>dpr</italic> genes are prominent direct or indirect dFezf targets.</p><p>Dpr proteins are immunoglobulin (Ig) domain containing cell surface molecules (21 dprs) that bind heterophilically to dpr interacting proteins (DIPs) (9 DIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>), which are also cell surface molecules and members of the Ig superfamily (IgSF). Dpr and DIP proteins are expressed in a matching manner between lamina neurons (including L3) and their synaptic targets in the medulla, and specific dpr-DIP interactions, or combinations of them, have been proposed to encode synaptic specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, one possibility is that dFezf regulates L3 growth cone position by controlling the expression of specific <italic>dpr</italic> genes, whose products mediate interactions with appropriate DIP-expressing target cells in the medulla. In the absence of dFezf function, an abnormal complement of <italic>dprs</italic> is expressed (L3 <italic>dprs</italic> are downregulated and <italic>dprs</italic> expressed by other lamina neurons are upregulated), and this may promote interactions with incorrect target neurons, altering growth cone position and laminar specificity (see discussion).</p><p>In summary, a large number of genes change in their levels of expression when <italic>dFezf</italic> is disrupted in L3 neurons, and similar numbers of these are up or downregulated. Nearly a quarter of the DE genes are cell surface and secreted molecules, suggesting that dFezf regulates communication between L3 and other cells. <italic>Dpr</italic> genes are strong candidates for acting downstream of dFezf to regulate growth cone targeting. However, as many candidates exist, additional studies are necessary to identify the genes relevant for this process (see discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DFezf is necessary and sufficient for netrin expression</title><p>L3-derived Netrin is necessary for the M3-specific innervation of R8 photoreceptor axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>).

This suggested that, in addition to cell autonomously regulating L3 targeting, dFezf non-autonomously regulates R8 layer specificity via activation of <italic>Netrin</italic> expression in L3 neurons. To test this we first assessed Netrin protein expression in L3 neurons during development. Previous gene expression and genetic studies implied that L3 neurons express Netrin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>), but this had not been shown directly. To address this we used a NetB-GFP protein trap, wherein endogenous NetB is tagged with GFP. We focused on NetB protein because <italic>NetB</italic> is expressed at much higher levels than <italic>NetA</italic> in L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), and the expression of <italic>NetB</italic> in L3 neurons is sufficient to support proper R8 layer specificity in the background of a <italic>NetA/B</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>). At 24 hr APF we observed NetB expression in the perinuclear region of the oldest lamina neurons (most anterior) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D’</xref>). Using markers specific for different lamina neuron subclasses we discovered that NetB is expressed by L3, L4 and L5 neurons, but not L1 or L2 neurons. We assessed NetB expression in L3 by labeling L3 somata with FLAG-tagged dFezf (dFezf-FLAG) expressed from its native promoter within a BAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). At 48 hr APF NetB expression remained specific to L3, L4 and L5 neurons in the lamina, although it was most strongly expressed in L3 neurons at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). Thus, while NetB immunoreactivity is first detected within the M3 layer at ~40 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>), which coincides with the segregation of L3 growth cones into the developing M3 layer, L3 neurons express NetB much earlier in development.

Thus, determining how cells arrange their connections into layered networks is critical for understanding how the nervous system is assembled. Molecules that are necessary for layer specificity in particular neuron types have been identified in different systems. However, molecular strategies that organize the assembly of specific layers have remained elusive. Here, we illuminate a transcriptional mechanism that coordinates different cell types to the same layer in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Based on our findings and previous studies, we propose that specific layers are built in a stepwise manner through use of transcriptional modules that cell-intrinsically instruct targeting to specific layers, and cell-extrinsically recruit other circuit components. Moreover, based on research in the mammalian nervous system we propose that this represents an evolutionarily conserved strategy for building laminar-specific neural circuits (see below).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33962.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>DFezf coordinates the formation of laminar-specific connections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Early in medulla development, dFezf promotes the targeting of L3 growth cones to the proximal versus distal domain of the outer medulla.

These broad domains represent a primitive form of layer organization, and thus determining how they are established is likely to be central to understanding how specific layers are constructed. The targets of lamina neuron axons within broad domains are unknown, and could include synaptic partners, intermediate targets, guidepost cells, and molecules embedded in the extracellular matrix. Our findings demonstrate that dFezf regulates broad domain specificity in L3 neurons, and indicate that this step in development is crucial for L3 laminar specificity, synaptic connectivity, and for the proper assembly of the M3 layer.</p><p>We show that dFezf functions in parallel to CadN and Sema-1a in L3 neurons to regulate targeting to the proximal domain of the outer medulla. We envision three models by which proper growth cone position could be achieved through the combined actions of these molecules. (1) In the first model precise growth cone position is achieved by preventing innervation of inappropriate regions. Here, dFezf prevents growth cone termination within the distal domain of the outer medulla, potentially by repressing the expression of cell surface molecules that interact with targets in this region. And CadN and Sema-1a prevent the growth cones from extending beyond the proximal domain, into the serpentine layer and inner medulla. Thus, proper growth targeting is achieved through mechanisms that prevent both superficial and deeper innervation. (2) Alternatively, growth cone position may be controlled though a direct targeting mechanism. In this model, dFezf could promote targeting to the proximal domain of the outer medulla by activating the expression of cell surface genes that interact with targets in this region. In this context, CadN and Sema-1a would then regulate growth cone consolidation within the proximal domain of the outer medulla. (3) And finally, dFezf function could serve to both prevent termination in the distal domain of the outer medulla, and direct targeting to the proximal domain (combination of (1) and (2)).</p><p>In the absence of dFezf function, cell surface genes that are normally expressed by L3 neurons are downregulated, and cell surface genes expressed by other lamina neurons become upregulated. Thus, we favor the third model involving both prevention of superficial termination and directed growth cone targeting. We hypothesize that dFezf function serves to (1) activate the expression of cell surface genes that promote interactions with targets in the proximal domain of the outer medulla, and (2) repress the expression of cell surface genes that mediate interactions with targets in the distal domain. DFezf could accomplish this by directly binding the loci of cell surface genes to control their expression, by acting through intermediate factors, or a combination of both. <italic>Dpr</italic> genes are prominent dFezf targets, and one interesting possibility is that dFezf regulates growth cone targeting by controlling a program of <italic>dpr</italic> gene expression. Dprs that are activated by dFezf function in L3 neurons may mediate interactions with DIP-expressing synaptic targets in the proximal domain of the outer medulla. In contrast, dprs that become upregulated in <italic>dFezf</italic> mutant L3 neurons may mediate inappropriate interactions with DIP-expressing targets in the distal domain of the outer medulla.</p><p>Future studies will be dedicated to determining which dFezf target genes regulate L3 growth cone targeting, and the mechanisms by which dFezf regulates their expression. Since, in addition to <italic>dprs</italic>, many cell surface genes change in their levels of expression in the absence of dFezf function, RNA-seq analyses performed at earlier stages of development and in dFezf mis-expression experiments (e.g. in L2 neurons) may help narrow down the list of relevant target genes. In addition, to circumvent issues of functional redundancy it will be important to undertake combinatorial genetic approaches targeting similar genes (e.g. the <italic>dprs</italic>) in loss and gain of function experiments. That a number of transcriptional regulators are differentially expressed between wild type and <italic>dFezf</italic> mutant L3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that dFezf, at least in part, acts through intermediate regulators to control gene expression. Identification of direct dFezf targets will provide a way of testing this and addressing how dFezf controls gene expression in L3 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DFezf regulates layer innervation through a cell-extrinsic mechanism</title><p>Our genetic investigation of dFezf function in L3 neurons revealed a cell-extrinsic role for dFezf in regulating R8 layer specificity through the activation of <italic>NetA/B</italic>.

However, additional experiments are necessary to rigorously assess this, and determine how <italic>NetA/B</italic> expression is controlled in L3 neurons.</p><p>Many different neurons have been shown to form synapses within the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>), and whether L3-derived Netrin is necessary for the M3-specific innervation of neurons other than R8 remains an open question. The Netrin receptor Frazzled is broadly expressed in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>), and Netrin released from L3 growth cones is well-suited to serve as an M3-specific signal to other cell types, due to its concentration within the layer. Genetic studies disrupting dFezf function and assessing the morphologies of neurons that innervate M3 would provide a way of testing whether L3-derived Netrin broadly organizes M3 circuitry, or specifically controls R8 layer innervation.</p><p>In the absence of <italic>dFezf</italic> function in L3 we observed R8 axons inappropriately innervating distal layers (i.e. M0-M2), as expected in the absence of Netrin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>), and a significant fraction of R8 axons terminating in proximal outer medulla layers (M4-M6), which was unexpected. In vivo time lapse imaging studies showed that the axons of <italic>Frazzled</italic> (Netrin receptor) null R8 neurons targeted to M3 normally and then retracted, indicating that Netrin/Frazzled signaling is required for growth cone stabilization <italic>within</italic> the target layer, but is dispensable for recognition <italic>of</italic> the target layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akin and Zipursky, 2016</xref>). Thus, additional molecules regulate R8 layer specificity. One interesting possibility is that in addition to <italic>Netrin</italic>, dFezf regulates the expression of a gene(s) important for R8 axons to ‘recognize’ the M3 layer, and in the absence of this cue a subset of R8 axons overshoot M3 and innervate proximal layers. Consistent with this idea, the genetic ablation of L3 neurons caused a significant percentage of R8 axons to terminate in proximal outer medulla layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to <italic>Net-A</italic>/<italic>B</italic>, dozens of cell surface or secreted genes are downregulated in L3 neurons at 40 hr APF when <italic>dFezf</italic> is disrupted. Thus, there are a number of candidates that could act downstream of dFezf in parallel to Netrin to regulate R8 layer specificity. Disrupting these genes in L3 neurons and visualizing R8 axons would provide a way of identifying additional L3-derived cues necessary for R8 layer innervation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A transcriptional mechanism for controlling the stepwise formation of layer-specific circuits</title><p>Previous studies indicate that medulla layers are not pre-established regions that serve as a template for circuit formation, but rather that layers are built over time from broad domains as the neurites of different cell types are added in a precise order. Thus, central to elucidating the molecular and cellular logic underlying assembly of the medulla network is identifying the molecular and cellular components involved in the sequence of interactions giving rise to specific layers, and discovering commonalities or connections between interactions and how different layers are assembled. Insight into the cellular mechanisms giving rise to the M3 layer circuitry was provided by the discovery that R8 innervation of M3 relies on a signal from L3 axons (Netrin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pecot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timofeev et al., 2012</xref>), which innervate M3 at an earlier stage despite being born later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Selleck and Steller, 1991</xref>). These studies and the fact that L3 and R8 neurons contribute input to common pathways suggest that the cellular mechanisms governing circuit formation reflect functional relationships between neurons, rather than birth order.</p><p>Less progress has been made in identifying the molecular logic underlying the stepwise assembly of layer-specific circuits. This is likely due in part, to the fact that how neurons innervate particular layers is cell type-specific, rather than layer-specific. For example, while R8 neurons depend on Netrin for layer specificity, Netrin is dispensable for the layer innervation of L3 and Tm9 neurons (unpublished results). Thus, identifying commonalities in the mechanisms used by neurons to innervate layers has been challenging. However, here we show that L3 and R8 layer innervation is linked through dFezf, which controls a program of gene expression that regulates the layer innervation of both neurons. Thus, while L3 and R8 utilize different molecules to achieve layer specificity, the expression of key molecules required by each neuron is controlled by the same transcription factor.</p><p>Using the same transcriptional pathway or module, to control genes that function cell-intrinsically and cell-extrinsically to regulate layer innervation, represents a simple mechanism for controlling the series of interactions that lead to circuit formation. Employing specific transcriptional modules in specific neurons would ensure that those neurons innervate the correct target layer, and also express the genes necessary for the targeting of other circuit components. We hypothesize that this strategy is widely employed to regulate the assembly of circuitry within the medulla. For example, cell-specific transcription factors analogous to dFezf in L3 have been identified in each of the other lamina neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), and the positions of lamina neuron arborizations in the medulla are well suited to produce signals that regulate the precise layer innervation of other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, CadN-based interactions between L2 terminals and L5 axons are necessary for L5 branching within the M2 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nern et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the function of cell-specific transcriptional modules in lamina neurons coordinates the assembly of discrete outer medulla layers.</p><p>We also speculate that the function of dFezf in L3 neurons is conserved in laminated regions of the mammalian nervous system. For instance, in the inner plexiform layer of the mouse retina, which is analogous to the medulla in structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>), Fezf1 is expressed in a subset of bipolar cells that innervate specific sublaminae (i.e. layers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>). Bipolar cells are analogous to lamina neurons, and we hypothesize that Fezf1 in specific types of bipolar cells functions analogously to dFezf in L3 to coordinate laminar-specific connectivity.</p><p>In the cerebral cortex of mice, Fezf2 cell-intrinsically controls the identity of subcortically projecting pyramidal neurons that predominantly reside in layer V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>), and pyramidal neuron identity was shown to be important for the laminar positioning of specific classes of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lodato et al., 2011</xref>). While it remains unclear as to whether Fezf2 in pyramidal cells regulates the expression of molecules that act non-autonomously to recruit specific inhibitory neurons (analogous to Netrin), one interesting possibility is that Fezf2 in the cortex organizes laminar-specific circuitry through cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms similar to dFezf in the medulla. In conclusion, we expect our findings regarding the function of dFezf in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system reflect an evolutionarily shared strategy for assembling laminar-specific neural circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species)</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Add. info.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>9–9 GAL4</td><td>Gift from U.

In L3 clones R recombinase was expressed (9–9 GAL4) and induced recombination within the Brp locus in a bacterial artificial chromosome (79C23S) resulting in the incorporation of smFP_V5 at the C-terminus. In addition, this resulted in the co-translation of LexA, which activated the expression of LexAop-myr::tdTomato to visualize the morphology of L3 clones. Together, this allowed visualization of L3 morphology and endogenous pre-synaptic sites with single cell resolution in wild type conditions or when <italic>dFezf</italic> was disrupted, in an otherwise normal fly. smFP_V5 contains ten V5 epitopes built into a superfolding GFP backbone (Viswanathan et al., 2015).

Stochastic expression was accomplished through inefficient expression of Flp recombinase in lamina neurons (R27G05-FLP::PEST [attp18]). For reasons that are unknown, this Flp source results in stochastic recombination allowing for visualization of single neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>RNA seq experiments</title><p>For each genotype (control, <italic>dFezf<sup>1</sup></italic>) 120 crosses were set, with 15 females and seven males in each cross. After three days, each cross was flipped every day for a week. From those vials we picked out Tb-negative white pre-pupae that formed within a one-hour window and placed the pupae in separate vials. GFP-positive pupae were scored under the fluorescence microscope and removed from the vials. The rest of the pupae were kept at 25°C. After 40 hr, we dissected the staged pupae within an hour in cold Complete Schneider’s Medium (CSM: 50 mL of CSM consists of 5 mL of heat inactivated fetal bovin serum, 0.1 mL Insulin, 1 mL PenStrep, 5 mL L-Glutamine, 0.4 mL L-Glutathione and 37.85 mL Schneider’s medium, filter setrilized). About 50–100 brains were dissected for each independent replicate experiment. After dissection of the brains, the optic lobes were collected and pooled together in 1x Rinaldini’s solution (100 mL Rinaldini’s solution consists of 800 mg NaCl, 20 mg KCl, 5 mg NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mg NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and 100 mg Glucose in H<sub>2</sub>O, filter setrilized) for subsequent dissociation. We used a modified dissociation protocol based on one described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harzer et al., 2013</xref>). The pooled lobes were washed once with 500 uL 1x Rinaldini’s solution and then incubated at 37°C for 15 min in dissociation solution that consists of 300 uL papain (100 U/mL) and 4.1 uL Liberase at a final concentration of 0.18 Wu/mL. After the enzyme digestion, the lobes were washed twice with 500 uL of 1x Rinaldini’s solution and then twice with 500 uL of CSM. The lobes were then disrupted in 200 uL of CSM by pipetting up and down until the solution became homogeneous. The cell suspention was then filtered through a 30 um mesh 5 mL FACS tube, and diluted with another 500 uL of CSM. The FACS sorting was done on the BD FACS Aria with a nozzle size of 70 um. GFP and dsRed double positive cells were sorted directly into 300 uL of RLT buffer (Qiagen, RNeasy kit) containing 1:100 beta-mercaptoethanol. Total RNA was purified with Qiagen RNeasy kit and eluted in 15 uL of water. After all the samples from five replicates (each genotype) were available, we concentrated the RNA into 5 uL by speed vac. 1.5 uL of the concentrated RNA was used to make cDNA library by Smart-seq2 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>). The quality control of the libraries was done on the Bioanalyzer by Tapestation. The pooled libraries were then loaded onto a single flow cell and sequenced by NextSeq High Output. Between five and fourteen million mapped reads were obtained for each sample.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification and statistical analyses</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>General</title><p>The quantification for immunohistochemistry experiments can be found either within the figure or in the figure legend.

They were then trimmed to remove contaminant sequences (like polyA tails), adapters and low-quality sequences with cutadapt. These trimmed reads were aligned to the drosophila genome (Flybase relase dmel_r6.15_FB2017_02) using STAR aligner. Alignments were checked using a combination of FastQC, Qualimap, MultiQC and custom tools. Counts of reads aligning to known genes were generated by featureCounts. In parallel, Transcripts Per Million (TPM) measurements per isoform were generated using Salmon. Differential expression at the gene level was called with DESeq2. We used the counts per gene estimated from the Salmon by tximport as input to DESeq2 as quantitating at the isoform level has been shown to produce more accurate results at the gene level. As described in the DESeq2 documentation, the differential expression is assessed using a Wald Test and p-values are adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research has been aided by grants from the Lefler Center for the Study of Neurodegenerative Disorders (MYP, JP) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (Gilliam Fellowship for Advanced Study, IJS).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As you see, reviewers complimented the technical quality of the study, but were split in their assessment whether the advance is sufficient for <italic>eLife</italic>. After extensive discussions, we are writing to invite you for a revision that shall address reviewers' critiques as thoroughly as possible. In particular, all reviewers agreed that a full description of the RNA-seq data and thorough analysis, hopefully with more insights, are required for the revised manuscript to cross the threshold of advance for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Neural circuits both in vertebrates and invertebrates are frequently arranged in a layered organization, essential for correct function of these circuits. However, identifying the molecules involved in the precise building of this laminar arrangement, and in the formation of layer-specific connections has been a long-standing question in the field. The present work by Santiago and colleagues furthers our understanding of neuropil targeting and neural circuit formation in the medulla of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe. Building on previous results and the data presented in this manuscript, the authors show that layer targeting of two different neurons, lamina neuron L3 and photoreceptor R8, is controlled by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the transcription factors Fezf, genes that play an important role in cortical patterning in mammals. dFezf instructs L3 layer targeting specificity from early pupal stages, being necessary both for broad domain specificity and for final M3 layer targeting specificity. Using RNA-seq and genetic approaches, the authors found that dFezf is cell autonomously required for Netrin expression in L3 neurons.</p><p>Importantly, the authors determined that the expression of this transcription factor in L3 neurons is required for correct R8 layer targeting, likely through the activation of Netrin expression in L3 neurons. The authors propose that transcription factors modules regulating layer targeting by acting into different neurons can be a common mechanism of neural circuit formation.</p><p>Since Fezf controls the expression of Netrin in L3 neurons and Netrin provided by L3 has been shown to be important for R8 growth cone stabilization in the M3 layer (Akin and Zipursky, 2016), the authors assume that Fezf is controlling R8 targeting through Netrin expression in L3 neurons. However, they also point out that Fezf in L3 neurons could be controlling the expression of additional molecules involved in R8 targeting/recognition. They do not go into detail about the possible molecules/mechanisms.</p><p>Our editorial discussions raised some important general concerns which need to be addressed. An expectation, perhaps high, from this study was an evaluation of layered connectivity that goes beyond a single pair of neurons that target one particular layer. In addition, some insight into the genetic program that FezF regulates to control L3 targeting also seems important. There are many examples of ligand receptor systems that control layered targeting, and in many cases, prior studies have gone well beyond a description of the anatomy to evaluate the importance of layer-specific targeting for the control of the physiological properties of the connected neurons. The current paper can also go beyond what is appears a limited scope if the following essential revisions are squarely addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is well written and all the figures clearly represent the findings. While we are positive about the quality of this work its significance could be made much more compelling if the complete results of the RNA-seq were included in the paper. This would be simplest. Alternatively other methods should be used to document changes in the expression of relevant transcripts.</p><p>The question remains, which molecules downstream of dFezf are involved in L3 layer targeting. It is interesting that the authors did not find candidate molecules in the RNA-seq experiments performed at 40h APF, given that it is an important developmental stage for L3 layer targeting. The authors should provide the results of the screen and comment on what they find in the Discussion. (Also, this question could be better addressed with similar RNA-seq experiments performed at different stages throughout development, although this would be outside of the scope of this paper). Specifically, also see subsection “DFezf functions in parallel to CadN and Sema-1a to regulate L3 growth cone targeting”: the single-cell type RNA-seq analysis for L3 neurons is elegantly performed. While, this is technically attractive, yet very limited data are presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Subsection “DFezf acts instructively to regulate growth cone targeting to the proximal domain of the outer medulla”: When authors describe the instructive role of Fezf, authors firstly expressed Fezf only in L5, which did not exhibit defects in L5 neurons (innervation to the proximal domains). On the other hand, authors expressed Fezf in all the lamina neurons (pan-lamina neuron GAL4 driver, 11-164-GAL4) and independently labeled L2 neurons, which exhibited mis-innervation defects. These experiments do not directly indicate the instructive role of Fezf for M3 layer innervation. It is still possible that the forced Fezf expression in the lamina neurons except L2 neurons indirectly affect L2 neuron innervation. Authors should explain this possibility. In addition, it is better to express Fezf only in L2 neuron to check the instructive role of Fezf for M3 layer innervation.</p><p>Also, in subsection “DFezf is necessary and sufficient for Netrin expression”: Authors described that forced expression of Fezf in L2 neurons is sufficient to induce Net-B expression without showing any images. It is better to present some images or graphs to explain this result.</p><p>The authors show that L3 terminal mis-targeting is associated with changes in the localization of presynaptic Brp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, L</xref>), suggesting that dFezf mutant L3 neurons have defects not only in layer innervation but in synaptic partner matching. However, this analysis leaves several questions unresolved that would aid in interpreting the results. Are there quantifiable differences in the number of Brp puncta that are associated with dFezf mutant L3 neurons compared to wild type clones? Also, is there additional evidence that would support the conclusion that L3 presynaptic sites in dFezf mutants represent functioning synapses formed with ectopic partners?</p><p>The model strongly predicts that the FezF gain of function phenotypes should depend on induction of Netrin expression and thus should be suppressed in a Netrin mutant background.

The data are presented in several new figures. In general, many genes change in their levels of expression in the absence of dFezf function (455 differentially expressed genes). Similar fractions of genes are either up or downregulated, indicating that dFezf function acts to repress or activate gene expression, directly or through intermediate factors (~20 TFs are differentially expressed). Members of the dpr gene family are prominent targets (the top three most significant genes are dprs). We propose a model wherein dFezf regulates growth cone targeting by controlling a program of dpr gene expression. However, given the complexity of the dFezf gene program, addressing which genes regulate growth cone targeting and how dFezf regulates their expression will require considerable effort and further analyses. This was one of the reasons behind our hesitation for including the data.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the efficacy of L3 purification from MARCM experiments using FACS, shows a heat map of all differentially expressed genes and their expression levels in all samples, and also includes a table of differentially expressed dpr genes (11 in total).</p><p>In the Materials and methods section (Quantification and statistical analyses: Analysis of RNA seq data), we have included a link to an HTML document containing all quality control and differential gene expression analyses performed on the RNA-seq data.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> is an excel file containing normalized transcript values for all genes across all samples (regardless of significance).</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> is an excel file containing information regarding differentially expressed genes: gene name, bio categories, gene family information, normalized transcript values across all samples, fold change, and p-values.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows validation of changes in mRNA expression for 4 genes at the protein level.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the distribution of differentially expressed genes in specific biological categories.

It is interesting that the authors did not find candidate molecules in the RNA-seq experiments performed at 40h APF, given that it is an important developmental stage for L3 layer targeting. The authors should provide the results of the screen and comment on what they find in the Discussion. (Also, this question could be better addressed with similar RNA-seq experiments performed at different stages throughout development, although this would be outside of the scope of this paper). Specifically, also see subsection “DFezf functions in parallel to CadN and Sema-1a to regulate L3 growth cone targeting”: the single-cell type RNA-seq analysis for L3 neurons is elegantly performed. While, this is technically attractive, yet very limited data are presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the first essential revision comment above, which we feel also addresses the issues brought up here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “DFezf acts instructively to regulate growth cone targeting to the proximal domain of the outer medulla”: When authors describe the instructive role of Fezf, authors firstly expressed Fezf only in L5, which did not exhibit defects in L5 neurons (innervation to the proximal domains). On the other hand, authors expressed Fezf in all the lamina neurons (pan-lamina neuron GAL4 driver, 11-164-GAL4) and independently labeled L2 neurons, which exhibited mis-innervation defects. These experiments do not directly indicate the instructive role of Fezf for M3 layer innervation. It is still possible that the forced Fezf expression in the lamina neurons except L2 neurons indirectly affect L2 neuron innervation. Authors should explain this possibility. In addition, it is better to express Fezf only in L2 neuron to check the instructive role of Fezf for M3 layer innervation.</p><p>Also, in subsection “DFezf is necessary and sufficient for Netrin expression”: Authors described that forced expression of Fezf in L2 neurons is sufficient to induce Net-B expression without showing any images. It is better to present some images or graphs to explain this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly describing how the L2 mis-expression experiment was done in the main text. Like the reviewer, we were also concerned about non-autonomous effects of dFezf mis-expression. Since there is not an L2-specific driver that is active in early pupal development (none has been published, and we have thus far not discovered one despite considerable effort) we decided to use a pan-LN driver, but use MARCM to generate sparse clones expressing dFezf. This is now clearly described in the text (Results and Discussion sections) and also included in the Materials and methods section in more detail. Briefly, in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-O</xref>) only L2 clones that were isolated in the column (no other lamina neuron clones present) were considered. This eliminates the possibility of non-autonomous effects from dFezf expressing clones in the same column. We also performed additional MARCM experiments using an alternative genetic background to generate an even sparser distribution of L2 clones (weaker source of Flp recombinase). This allowed a significant number of L2 neurons that were isolated in the home column, and also with respect to adjacent columns (i.e. no neighboring lamina neuron clones) to be identified. Assessment of these L2 clones produced similar results (these are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>).</p><p>The dFezf mis-expression experiments to assess NetB expression were shown in 6G-J (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-J</xref>). We have indicated this more clearly in the main text (subsection “DFezf is necessary and sufficient for Netrin expression”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that L3 terminal mis-targeting is associated with changes in the localization of presynaptic Brp puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, L</xref>), suggesting that dFezf mutant L3 neurons have defects not only in layer innervation but in synaptic partner matching. However, this analysis leaves several questions unresolved that would aid in interpreting the results. Are there quantifiable differences in the number of Brp puncta that are associated with dFezf mutant L3 neurons compared to wild type clones? Also, is there additional evidence that would support the conclusion that L3 presynaptic sites in dFezf mutants represent functioning synapses formed with ectopic partners?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the finding of L3 neurons still elaborating presynaptic sites within the wrong layers is provocative and could suggest a change in synaptic specificity. And that additional analyses would indeed help clarify whether this is the case. However, we feel that addressing this issue is beyond the scope of this paper for several reasons:</p><p>1) The main conclusions of the paper do not depend on whether L3 synaptic specificity is altered beyond what we already show when dFezf is disrupted. We feel that our data provide strong evidence that connectivity with Tm9 neurons is disrupted in dFezf mutant L3 neurons, which supports the importance of dFezf for proper laminar-specific connectivity. Especially considering that the L3-Tm9 synapse is the only L3 synapse shown to be functionally and behaviorally relevant to vision. Whether, in the absence of dFezf function, L3 forms inappropriate connections addresses the degree to which connectivity is altered, which we feel is an important but separate issue.</p><p>2) Rigorously determining if L3 forms active synapses with inappropriate targets in the absence of dFezf function requires extensive and difficult analyses, including EM (or other synaptic mapping experiments, difficult to preform rigorously at the level of light microscopy), and experiments involving optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging to confirm EM data and demonstrate the functionality of synapses. Realistically, such studies would take at least a year and likely more to complete.</p><p>3) We also thought about comparing the number of presynaptic sites formed between wild type and dFezf mutant L3 neurons. However, it’s unclear what would be gained by this analysis. Forming more or less synapses in the absence of dFezf would not provide insight into whether synapses are active, or the cellular partners involved. In addition, differences in numbers could result from changes in gene expression caused by the loss of dFezf or result non-specifically due to an altered extracellular environment.</p><p>We have included a sentence in the main text clarifying the limitations of our data (subsection “DFezf is cell autonomously required for L3 layer specificity”) so that we do not overstate our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model strongly predicts that the FezF gain of function phenotypes should depend on induction of Netrin expression and thus should be suppressed in a Netrin mutant background. Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We actually disagree with the reviewer comments in this case. The gain of function phenotypes we show in the paper involve mis-expression of dFezf in L2 neurons. Under these conditions, rather than terminating in the distal domain of the outer medulla in early pupal development, L2 growth cones mis-target to the proximal domain of the outer medulla. In adult animals, the dFezf expressing L2 neurons innervate the L3 target layer M3. Thus mis-expressing dFezf causes a change in broad domain specificity, and layer specificity. Our model predicts that these gain of function phenotypes are due to the cell-intrinsic function of dFezf, rather than the cell-extrinsic function involving Netrin expression. Indeed, L3 neurons and all lamina neuron subtypes innervate the correct layers in a <italic>NetAB</italic> null background (unpublished results).</p><p>In L3 neurons, we hypothesize that dFezf (1) represses the expression of cell surface molecules that mediate interactions with target neurons in the distal domain of the outer medulla, and (2) activates the expression of cell surface molecules that mediate interactions with targets in the proximal domain of the outer medulla, thereby directing growth cone position and laminar specificity. When mis-expressed in L2 neurons, we speculate that dFezf functions in the same way thereby altering L2 growth cone position and layer specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the core of this paper is the function of Fezf, authors should present how Fezf works as &quot;a transcription factor&quot; in M3 layer innervation.
