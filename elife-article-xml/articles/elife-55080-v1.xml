homing abilities in dogs, their homing strategies are not fully understood. We equipped 27 hunting dogs with GPS collars and action cams, let them freely roam in forested areas, and analyzed components of homing in over 600 trials. When returning to the owner (homewards), dogs either followed their outbound track (‘tracking’) or used a novel route (‘scouting’). The inbound track during scouting started mostly with a short (about 20 m) run along the north-south geomagnetic axis, irrespective of the actual direction homewards. Performing such a ‘compass run’ significantly increased homing efficiency. We propose that this run is instrumental for bringing the mental map into register with the magnetic compass and to establish the heading of the animal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homing</kwd><kwd>magnetoreception</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>dog</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, EVA 4.0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006533</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MZE-RO0718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartoš</surname><given-names>Luděk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006206</institution-id><institution>Czech University of Life Sciences Prague</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIGA CZU (Project No. 20174319)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006207</institution-id><institution>Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IGA (Project No. B07/16)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grant Agency of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 15-21840S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, EVA 4.0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Programme Research, Development and Education, CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burda</surname><given-names>Hynek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Before returning home, and when using novel routes, dogs align along the north-south axis, presumably to bring the mental map into register with the magnetic compass.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homing, broadly defined as the ability to return to a known goal location (e.g. breeding grounds, shelter sites) after displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schmidt-Koenig and Keeton, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Papi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wiltschko and Wiltschko, 1995</xref>), has been shown in a taxonomically diverse range of vertebrates that rely on a multitude of cues, for example visual, olfactory, acoustic, celestial, magnetic, and idiothetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schmidt-Koenig and Keeton, 1978</xref>;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mouritsen, 2018</xref>). However, designing systematic studies to characterize the navigational strategies and underlying sensory mechanisms mediating homing behaviour in non-migratory species, particularly in free-ranging mammals, have proven difficult, and our understanding of large-scale navigation and homing remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Poulter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsoar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wolbers and Wiener, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Anecdotal accounts of the impressive navigation abilities of dogs have been commonplace, maybe best exemplified in World War I when ‘messenger dogs’ were used as couriers to deliver sensitive information across battlegrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Richardson, 1920</xref>). Nearly a century ago, the first studies designed to examine navigational abilities in dogs were performed, revealing homing success even if displaced to unfamiliar sites (Schmid 1932, 1936 cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nahm, 2015</xref>). Decades later, a more comprehensive study observed consistent homing success in a total of 26 dogs displaced without exposure to visual cues in various geographic directions. Dogs often homed using novel routes and/or shortcuts, ruling out route reversal strategies, and making olfactory tracking and visual piloting unlikely. Indeed, as previous authors have suggested, shedding light on the mystery of mammalian homing may require unconventional research approaches that focus on ‘unusual’ senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nahm, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hunting dogs, particularly the so-called scent hounds, have been selected over generations to detect and pursue tracks of game animals and, if not followed by the hunter, to return to the place where the pursuit started, often over distances of hundreds or thousands of meters. How dogs pinpoint the owner’s location using novel routes of return in highly variable densely forested habitats remains perplexing.</p><p>We expect that either dogs can find their way to the owner following their own scent trail back (a strategy called ‘tracking’) or they can perform true navigation, the ability to home over large distances without relying on route-based landmarks or information acquired during the displacement, a strategy we termed ‘scouting’, searching for a new way. While tracking may be safe, it is lengthy. Scouting enables taking shortcuts and might be faster but requires navigation capability and, because of possible errors, is risky.</p><p>Using GPS data complemented by video recordings by action cams, we analyzed orientation of free-roaming scent hounds. We expected to find evidence for either tracking or scouting, to test the predictions about the route length and duration, and to see indications for the type of decision made at the turning point. Furthermore, we expected that should visual piloting (orientation towards landmarks) take place there would be an effect of the height of the dog as higher (taller) dogs should have better overview (farther horizon) than lower dogs.</p><p>Altogether, 27 hunting dogs from ten breeds were equipped with a GPS collar and in several cases also with an action camera capturing a portion of the dog’s head, thus providing information about its movement, behaviour, and the landscape in front of and around the dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In total, 622 trials (excursions) were performed at 62 locations during diurnal walks in forested hunting grounds in the Czech Republic from September 2014 to December 2017. Based on the records, we determined turning points, dividing the whole excursion into the outbound and inbound tracks, and we measured azimuths at particular points, length and speed of particular tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Still shots of a fox terrier (left column) and a miniature dachshund (right column) used in this study showing the tracking equipment and habitat.</title><p>Above: The GPS transmitter and antenna are fixed to a collar and fitted around the animal’s neck (note that for safety and comfort of the animal, the collar is free to rotate).

In all four distributions, the compass run was significantly orientated along the ~north south geomagnetic axis, suggesting that its orientation was independent of the direction to the owner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>- Table 6).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Orientation of the compass run plotted relative to the position of owner.</title><p>To test for an influence of the owner on the orientation of the compass run (azimuth C) during scouting, the data was partitioned into four distributions corresponding to when the owner was located at one of the four cardinal compass directions (±45°) relative to the turning point. Therefore, the distributions above show the orientation of azimuth C when the owner is positioned at magnetic ~north (316°−45°),~east (46°−135°),~south (136°−225°), or ~west (226°−315°) relative to the turning point (i.e. relative to the start of the compass run). If the N-S orientation of the compass run is a direct response to the owner (i.e. olfactory or visual piloting towards the owner), then in situations when the owner is located along the ~east west axis relative to the turning point, the orientation of the compass run should also align along the ~east-west axis. Alternatively, if the compass run is independent of the owner, then there should be no statistical difference in the orientation of azimuth C when the owner is position in different magnetic directions. Each distribution plots the axial bearings recorded from each excursion. The position of the owner relative to azimuth C is shown on the outside of each distribution and the shaded section of each plot bounded with green arrows shows the range of possible positions of the owner in each distribution (45° range centered on each cardinal compass direction).

Next, the sun azimuth direction was recorded for each hour during the 15th day of each month, for all available daylight hours. Thus, we created an average sun azimuth direction for each month of the year, with one-hour resolution. For circular analyses, we pooled the orientation of azimuth C relative to the sun position for each excursion, using the nearest hour of sun position according to each excursion time. A Rayleigh test was used to determine if the distribution of azimuth C was non-random when plotted relative to sun position. The position of sun, and thus polarization pattern, did not significantly influence the orientation of azimuth C during scouting returns at the individual level (n = 251, µ = 69°/249°, r = 0.04, p=0.673) or at the group level (n = 27, µ = 146°/326°, r = 0.021, p=0.989).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Effect of wind</title><p>Wind direction was recorded at the study site for each excursion by the owner. To test for an effect of wind direction, particularly in conditions when wind was blowing from the owner to the direction of the dog at the turning point, we used a Rayleigh test to determine if the wind direction was non-random across excursions when dogs used a scouting return strategy. In 55 cases (22 % of all scouting excursions), no wind was detected and therefore these excursions could not be included in the analyses. For the remainder of excursions (n = 196), Azimuth B (i.e. direction between the turning point and owner) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was plotted relative to the wind direction.</p><p>Partitioning the circular data into eight equal bin sizes (each bin ±22.5° and centered on the 45’s, i.e. 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, etc.), we found that the wind conditions in only 24 scouting returns (&lt;10 % of scouting returns) were suitable for olfactory piloting to the owner (i.e. &lt;10 % of scouting returns had wind conditions where the wind was blowing in the direction (±22.5°) from the owner to the dog at the point of return/start of azimuth C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that dogs returning in a forest either follow back their outbound trajectory, a strategy called <italic>tracking</italic> or chose a completely new route, a strategy called <italic>scouting</italic>. In this study, we analyzed only scouting events and found a conspicuous phenomenon. In most cases, dogs start their return with a short (about 20 m long) run, called here <italic>compass run</italic>, mostly performed along the north-south axis irrespective of the actual homeward direction.</p><p>It is unlikely that the direct involvement of visual, olfactory or celestial cues can explain the highly stereotyped and consistent ~north south alignment of the compass run. For example, the forested habitat and dense vegetation of the study sites make visual piloting unreliable and, in many cases, not possible. Furthermore, there was no effect of the body height (and thus the degree to which the dog’s field of view of its surroundings was limited) on the probability of north-south alignment when compared to east-west alignment, a fact which is not consistent with a visual piloting hypothesis. Highly variable wind conditions, coupled with turbulence in the forest understory, rule out the use of olfactory piloting during scouting. In many cases, the Sun’s disk was fully obstructed by cloud cover and/or overhead vegetation, making it challenging to use a sun or polarized light compass. And, although polarized light has been shown to calibrate the magnetic compass in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Greif et al., 2014</xref>), detection of skylight polarization is not thought to be widespread in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Horváth and Varjú, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Marshall and Cronin, 2011</xref>). More generally, it is difficult to reconcile what advantage a north-south orientation response would provide for any of the sensory modaities discussed above.</p><p>In contrast, the Earth’s magnetic field provides a stable, omnipresent cue, regardless of daily or seasonal temporal variation, visual cue availability or weather conditions. The north-south alignment of the compass run in dogs is consistent with a wealth of studies providing support for spontaneous magnetic alignment along the north-south magnetic axis in a range of vertebrates in the field (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Malkemper et al., 2016</xref>) as well as in the laboratory under controlled conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burda et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Phillips et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Muheim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Malkemper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Painter et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the functional significance of magnetic alignment is not fully understood, magnetic alignment may help to organize and structure many aspects of spatial behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begall et al., 2013</xref>). This may help to explain the compass run at the beginning of homing in scouting dogs. Indeed, several recent studies have shown that dogs are sensitive to magnetic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adámková et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Martini et al., 2018</xref>), and behavioural studies show that Earth-strength magnetic fields play a direct role in homing responses also in the blind mole-rat, a subterranean mammal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kimchi et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, we propose that the compass run is mediated by magnetic cues, and it helps to increase the accuracy and reduce the complexity of long-distance navigation across unfamiliar and/or highly variable environments.</p><p>Noteworthy, scouting dogs in unfamiliar locations cannot use visual landmarks to recalibrate a path integration system. Therefore, in the absence of familiar landmarks, the compass run may serve to recalibrate a path integration system relative to Earth’s magnetic field, so that errors accumulated during the outbound trajectory are not incorporated into the estimate of the homing direction. Importantly, dogs in our study were not passively displaced as is usual in most homing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsoar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ostfeld and Manson, 1996</xref>), and therefore, the involvement of path integration seems plausible, and may be one of several reasons why the compass run has not been identified in previous studies.</p><p>Our findings clearly show the importance of further research on the role and involvement of magnetic cues in canine (and more generally mammalian) navigation. More specifically, the research suggests that the magnetic field may provide dogs (and mammals generally) with a ‘universal’ reference frame, which is essential for long-distance navigation and arguably the most important component that is ‘missing’ from our current understanding of mammalian spatial behaviour and cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>A total of 27 hunting dogs (10 M, 17 F) from ten breeds were used in the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>- Table 1). All dogs come from breeds with pedigrees in hunting and animal tracking and were regularly assessed by veterinarians throughout the study. These dogs innately detect and pursue the olfactory tracks of game, and in rare cases, dogs were able to spot game animals from a distance (i.e. &gt;20 m) through the forest. However, the small breeds used in this study are unable to keep pace with the much larger and faster game animals. Therefore, dogs were almost immediately left to rely on olfactory tracking and never posed any physical threat to wild animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tracking equipment</title><p>Dogs were equipped with a Garmin T5 mini (or DC50) GPS collar (Garmin Ltd., USA) fitted around the neck and programed to record GPS positions at 2.5 or 5.0 s intervals (GPS accuracy ±4.2 m based on ground-truth measurements collected at study site locations). A portion of the trials (31 %) were carried out using a Garmin Virb Elite action camera (Garmin Ltd., USA) housed inside a non-magnetic stainless steel mount fixed to the side of a custom-fitted fabric harness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The camera captured a similar field of view to that of each dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and thus provided information about the dog’s visual surroundings, including habitat characteristics. In addition, a portion of the dog’s head was also captured, providing information about the dog’s behaviour and movement (e.g. activity, head scanning, head orientation) and an on-board microphone detected barking behaviour, an indicator that the dog was in pursuit of a game track (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The customized harness was designed to minimize discomfort and allowed full mobility for all dogs. Dog owners were equipped with a handheld Garmin Alpha 100 or Astro 320 receiver (Garmin Ltd., USA) used to monitor and record GPS tracks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>A total of 622 trials were performed in forested hunting grounds at 62 independent locations in the Czech Republic from September 2014 to December 2017. All trials were performed with a single dog (i.e. trials were not carried out with groups of dogs), in areas free from high voltage power lines, paved roads or buildings, and at different times of day (daylight hours only) and different times of year. Dogs were transported to each site by a car and were given a 10 min rest and acclimation period in the close surroundings of the car (&lt;20 m radius). Dogs were then equipped with the GPS collar, and in some cases, the harness-camera setup, and walked off-leash alongside the owner into the surrounding forest. Dogs could freely roam and explore the area to search for wild game tracks using olfactory cues, as is an innate behaviour in this context for the breeds used in this study. The following game animals are common in the study region: fallow deer (<italic>Dama dama</italic>), red deer (<italic>Cervus elaphus</italic>), roe deer (<italic>Capreolus capreolus</italic>), wild boar (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>), European hare (<italic>Lepus europaeus</italic>), and red fox (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>). During the search period, owners did not provide visual or acoustic commands to instruct the dog. The handheld GPS device was programmed to indicate when the dog had travelled ≥100 m from the position of the owner. At this moment (designated as ‘excursion start’) the owners stopped walking and marked their location on the handheld GPS. Owners then hid behind trees or dense vegetation within a 10 m radius from the ‘excursion start’ to minimize the possibility of visual piloting by dogs in final stages of their inbound return (see below). The owners remained at this place until the dog returned. The location of each trial, the dog’s familiarity with the location, and weather conditions (wind speed, wind direction, and temperature) were recorded. Locations visited for the first time were considered to be unfamiliar, whereas dogs who had visited the location at least once previously were considered familiar with the area. The entire trial, including excursions (see below), lasted between 30 and 90 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of excursions</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Identifying excursion features</title><p>‘Excursions’ are defined as the track recorded between the excursion start (see above) and the point when the dog started its return to the owner, staying at, or within 10 m from the excursion start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All excursions were analyzed using Garmin BaseCamp 4.6.2 software (Garmin Ltd., USA). In very rare cases when dogs did not return to the owner, they were found via GPS position and excluded from further analysis (n = 16, 2.4 % of all excursions).</p><p>Based on preliminary analyses of GPS tracks used to standardize the study protocol, excursions were divided into three distinct phases: 1) <italic>outbound trajectory</italic>: from the excursion start to the point where the dog terminates its pursuit of the game track; 2) <italic>turning trajectory</italic>: the part where the dog initiates its return to the excursion start/owner; within this part, we narrowed the <italic>turning point</italic>; 3) <italic>inbound trajectory</italic>: the return track to the owner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

If the so determined place seems to be improbable (either too close to the start/goal or the dog pauses relatively long at one point) we checked the situation at video to exclude the possibility that the dog stopped to drink, bath, sniff at some interesting place or encountered difficult terrain.

If this segment was also located near the excursion start/owner, the respective situation was again checked at the video if available, and/or the slower segment with the farthest straight-line distance from the excursion start was labelled as the turning trajectory (n = 53, 8.5 % of all excursions).</p><p>Within the turning trajectory, the average speed was calculated between each successive GPS point.

Azimuth B represents the magnetic direction of the owner relative to the dog at the turning point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These criteria helped to omit short-lived track deviations often caused by obstacles (e.g. fallen trees, dense clusters of vegetation) and were applied to all tracks. A criterion for classifying the compass run as either north-south or east-west, was established by grouping runs into one of four sectors corresponding to a sector of ±45° of the cardinal compass axes, i.e. ~north (316°−45°),~east (46°−135°),~south (136°−225°), or ~west (226°−315°).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Return strategies</title><p>Based on preliminary evaluations from a subset of excursions, each inbound return was categorized into two distinct return strategies:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Tracking: The inbound return trajectory followed the outbound trajectory, i.e. the dog ‘simply’ followed its outbound track back to the owner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Before evaluation, all directional responses were grouped by return strategy. Magnetic headings for azimuth A and azimuth B were treated as angular data. However, preliminary results for azimuth C revealed a strong bimodal response within individuals, and therefore, azimuth C was treated as axial data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batschelet, 1981</xref>). The Rayleigh test was used for circular statistics to determine if distributions were indistinguishable from random at the p&lt;0.05 significance level. To test for non-random orientation, all responses were evaluated at the individual level (i.e. measurements from excursion treated as an independent bearing) and at the group level by calculating mean directional response from each dog then calculating a grand mean vector. A Watson's U2 test was used to test for differences between distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batschelet, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Non-circular data were analyzed using SAS System (version 9.4). Associations between inbound speed and return strategy, as well as homing efficiency and geomagnetic alignment (N-S or E-W) were tested using a multivariate General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM, PROC MIXED), with inbound speed or homing efficiency as a dependent variable. A homing efficiency index was expressed by calculating the ratio (in %) between the track length of the inbound trajectory (i.e. track length of dog between turning point and excursion start) and the direct distance (i.e. beeline) between the turning point and excursion start. Additional analyses (i.e. alignment or return strategies as dependent variables) were performed using a GLMM with PROC GLIMMIX for binary distributions. Link function was logit and the distribution of error terms was binomial in the GLMM. Since models with PROC GLIMMIX did not converge due to an effect with considerably larger classes (dog ID and/or breed), we applied the procedure with Method = Laplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kiernan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Models were constructed by entering the predicted effects, i.e. return strategy for dependent variables, inbound speed and alignment (modelling the probability that geomagnetic alignment = N s); and dependent variable for homing efficiency index.

Owner = initials of owner accompanying dog during walks, Age = age or age-range during the study period, N<sub>OUT</sub> = number of outbound trajectories, N<sub>IN</sub> = total number of inbound trajectories, N<sub>T</sub> = number of inbound returns using a tracking strategy, N<sub>S</sub> = number of returns using a scouting strategy. (B) Table 2 Factors in the final GLMMs for the dependent variables (in bold). a) probability for N-S alignment (±45°) during the initial inbound segment (i.e. ‘compass run’); b) probability for scouting strategy; c) efficiency of return; d) speed of inbound trajectory; e) inbound track length. (C) Table 3 Effects used in General Linear Mixed Models. (D) Table 4 Length parameters during different phases of the excursion (data from combined strategies are excluded). (E) Table 5 Circular analyses of individual (‘raw’) and grouped means for azimuth A, B and C during scouting and tracking strategies, and when a scouting strategy was used as the second return strategy (tracking used as a second return strategy not shown). Means were calculated by averaging directional headings for each dog, then calculating a grand mean from all individuals. Raw data were calculated by treating each azimuth as an independent bearing. Note that due to the bimodal preference found within individual dogs for azimuth C, these bearings were treated as axial data. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. (F) Table 6 Axial analyses of azimuth C (=orientation of the compass run) partitioned into four groups to test for an influence of the owner on the orientation of the compass run during scouting strategy returns. Each analysis corresponds to the orientation of the compass run when the owner was located in one of four cardinal compass directions (±45°) relative to the turning point. Therefore, owner positions relative to the turning point are: owner = magnetic ~ north (316°−45°),~east (46°−135°),~south (136°−225°), or ~west (226°−315°). All data are treated as independent bearings.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.

Using GPS tracking, the researchers studied the paths that the dogs took away from and then back to their owner and characterized the strategy employed by the dog as either &quot;tracking&quot;, a strategy whereby dogs follow their outbound track back to their starting point, or &quot;scouting&quot;, a strategy whereby dogs use a novel path back to their starting point. It was observed that dogs run oriented along the north-south geomagnetic axis for a short distance following the turning point of their overall route, which was observed when dogs employed a &quot;scouting&quot; strategy but not a &quot;tracking&quot; strategy. The major conclusion presented by the authors is that dogs utilize the Earth's magnetic field as a navigational cue when dogs navigate over distances of 100s of meters. All reviewers found the study of interest and agreed that as an observational study it was well conducted. However, the reviewers noted that a number of concerns need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Identification of the &quot;turning point&quot; and the definition of the &quot;compass run&quot; require further attention. At minimum the authors should provide some a priori justification for this. We would like the authors to consider providing some form of analyses of how the result change with different speed and degree of turn.</p><p>2) The argument that the &quot;compass run&quot; could be used to bring a cognitive map back into register was found to be vague and unclear, and the reviewers believed that there was no evidence for this. This interpretation should be revisited or additional data provided in favour for it.</p><p>3) A discordance between the Introduction and the Discussion needs to be addressed. The Introduction seems to focus on true navigation as the explanation for scouting, but the Discussion focuses on path integration and cognitive maps as the explanation, neither of which are true navigation by the standard definitions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55080.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Identification of the &quot;turning point&quot; and the definition of the &quot;compass run&quot; require further attention.

Speed within the <italic>turning trajectory</italic> is/was the slowest relative to other comparable segments of the excursion, consistent with this reflecting change in the underlying behaviour. However, this parameter was relative to the speed of each outbound track, and therefore, varied within and between dogs. Also, the degree of turn was relative; because the <italic>compass run</italic> generally coincided with the north-south axis, irrespective of the actual homeward azimuth (Figure 3), the turn angle depended on the deviation of the last outbound segment from the north-south axis. Therefore, we believe, a formal analysis of speed and turn angle may be uninformative and/or misleading given our methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The argument that the &quot;compass run&quot; could be used to bring a cognitive map back into register was found to be vague and unclear, and the reviewers believed that there was no evidence for this.
