tetrads. DNA G4 structures have been extensively studied, however, less is known about G4 motifs in mRNAs, especially in their coding sequences. Herein, we show that Aven stimulates the mRNA translation of the mixed lineage leukemia (<italic>MLL</italic>) proto-oncogene in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. The Aven RGG/RG motif bound G4 structures within the coding regions of the MLL1 and MLL4 mRNAs increasing their polysomal association and translation, resulting in the induction of transcription of leukemic genes. The DHX36 RNA helicase associated with the Aven complex and was required for optimal translation of G4 mRNAs. Depletion of Aven led to a decrease in synthesis of MLL1 and MLL4 proteins resulting in reduced proliferation of leukemic cells. These findings identify an Aven-centered complex that stimulates the translation of G4 harboring mRNAs, thereby promoting survival of leukemic cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06234.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06234.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06234.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To make a protein, the DNA sequence that encodes it is first copied to make a molecule of messenger RNA (or mRNA for short). The mRNA is then used as a set of instructions to assemble a protein in a process called translation. Both DNA and RNA molecules can fold into particular shapes. One such structure is known as a G-quartet and involves the DNA or RNA folding back on itself to form a highly stable planar structure. Stacks of G-quartets can form structures known as G-quadruplexes, but little is known about the G-quadruplexes that form in mRNA molecules.</p><p>Leukemia affects cells in the bone marrow and causes blood cells to develop abnormally. A protein called Aven is often found in increased amounts in certain types of leukemic cells, but it was not clear how Aven affects how leukemia develops. Thandapani, Song et al. have now found that in leukemic cells, Aven binds to G-quadruplexes found in two mRNA molecules that encode proteins that are linked to leukemia. This binding increases the translation of these mRNAs, with translation occurring most efficiently when a particular enzyme called a helicase—which remodels RNA—also bound to Aven. Reducing the amount of Aven in cells caused fewer of the leukemic proteins to be produced, which also reduced the growth and multiplcation of leukemic cells.</p><p>These findings raise the possibility that drugs that disrupt how Aven works could form part of treatments for leukemia. The next challenge will be to identify the signaling pathways that communicate with Aven and to define all the G-quadruplex mRNAs that are regulated by Aven.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06234.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06234.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>G-quadruplex</kwd><kwd>arginine methylation</kwd><kwd>PRMT1</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts de recherche en santé du Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-67070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé (Fonds de la recherche en sante du Quebec)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Arginine methylation regulates mRNA translation of key protooncogenes via an RGG/RG motif-containing protein called Aven.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) coordinate many steps of RNA metabolism ranging from splicing, RNA processing, RNA transport, mRNA translation, and RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Glisovic et al., 2008</xref>). RBPs associate with specific RNA motifs and/or secondary structures within coding, untranslated regions, and non-coding RNAs in functional units called ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell and Parker, 2014</xref>). Defects in RBPs have been associated with many complex diseases ranging from neurological disorders to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lukong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Castello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramaswami et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>RBPs are predominantly defined by the presence of RNA-binding domains within their sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chen and Varani, 2013</xref>). Recently, several ‘interactome capture’ strategies have been performed to identify RBPs genome-wide. In addition to identifying the known RBPs, these approaches have identified numerous mammalian proteins that do not possess a canonical RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, RBPs that harbor repeated sequences including YGG and RGG motifs were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Castello et al., 2012</xref>). The RGG/RG motif is enriched in proteins associated with RNA and is a known RNA-binding interface (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>). The RGG/RG motif, also called RGG box, was shown to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kiledjian and Dreyfuss, 1992</xref>). Subsequently, the RGG/RG motifs of Nucleolin, FMRP, FUS, and EWS were also shown to bind guanine-rich sequences that are potential G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takahama et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haeusler et al., 2014</xref>). RGG/RG motifs also mediate protein–protein interactions. Notably, the RGG/RG motif of yeast Scd6 mediates interactions with eIF-4G, which leads to stress granule formation and inhibition of cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajyaguru et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these recent advances, little is known about the role of RGG/RG motifs that bind both RNA and proteins.</p><p>G-quadruplexes (G4) are planar structures of stacks of guanine tetrads stabilized by monovalent potassium or sodium ions. G-quadruplexes have been shown to regulate DNA replication, DNA repair, gene expression, and telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2007</xref>). Less is known about G4 structures found in RNA. There are &gt;1500 potential G4s (PG4s) in 5′-UTR of mRNAs alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaudoin and Perreault, 2010</xref>), but not all PG4s form stable G-quadruplexes, which are influenced by the numbers of G-quartets, the possibility of bulge formation, the length of the loops, and the presence of alternative Watson–Crick base pair-based stable structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mukundan and Phan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jodoin et al., 2014</xref>). Some PG4s in the 5′-UTR of mRNAs form <italic>bona fide</italic> G-quadruplexes and inhibit cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kumari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaudoin and Perreault, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bugaut and Balasubramanian, 2012</xref>). Recently, inhibitors of DEAD box RNA helicase eIF4A or eIF4A1 depletion have been shown to selectively inhibit translation of mRNAs with G-quadruplexes in their 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Modelska et al., 2015</xref>). However, presence of G-quadruplexes in 5′ UTRs does not appear to be sufficient to render translation of mRNAs sensitive to changes in eIF4A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubio et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to the incomplete understanding of the role of 5′ UTR G-quadruplexes in translation control, little is known about how G4 structures in open-reading frames (ORFs) affect translation.</p><p>Arginine residues within RGG/RG motifs are preferred substrates for methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>). Arginine methylation is known to regulate many cellular processes including signal transduction, transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bedford and Richard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). PRMT1 generates &gt;85% of asymmetric dimethylarginines found in cells with preference for RGG/RG motif containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>). PRMT1 is known for its nuclear roles in regulating gene expression and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Strahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boisvert et al., 2005</xref>), however, less is known about its cytoplasmic roles. PRMT1-deficient mice die at E6.5 and the absolute removal of PRMT1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pawlak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). To identify other biological processes regulated by arginine methylation, we performed a bioinformatics approach to identify proteins harboring RGG/RG motifs and one such protein we identified was Aven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Aven is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein required for cell survival and it has been shown to function as an apoptotic inhibitor by interaction with and stabilizing the pro-survival protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, as well as inhibiting the function of Apaf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chau et al., 2000</xref>). It was proposed that the proteolytic cleavage of Aven by Cathepsin D is required for its anti-apoptotic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, Aven is required for ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guo et al., 2008</xref>) and ataxia telangiectasia-related activation following DNA damage in osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranski et al., 2015</xref>). High Aven expression correlates with poor survival in metastatic patients with osteosarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranski et al., 2015</xref>). The elevated Aven expression is also frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and is associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Paydas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Choi et al., 2006</xref>). A transgenic mouse model with T cell-specific overexpression of Aven showed that its expression enhanced T-cell lymphomagenesis in the absence of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eismann et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism by which Aven promotes hematological malignancies is yet to be understood.</p><p>Herein, we report that the methylation of the RGG/RG motif of Aven functions in the translational control of mRNAs harboring G4 structures in their ORFs. The association of Aven with polysomes was dependent on the arginine methylation of its RGG/RG motif and on the methyl-dependent interactions with the Tudor domains of SMN and TDRD3, previously shown to be associated with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goulet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanchez et al., 2013</xref>). We identify Aven to be an RBP, as its RGG/RG motif bound G4 motifs in the ORFs of mRNAs encoding the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) family proteins MLL1 and MLL4. The RGG/RG motif of Aven also associated with the G4 RNA helicase, DHX36, and this helicase was required for optimal translation of Aven-regulated mRNAs. Furthermore, Aven-deficient T-ALL cell lines had reduced MLL1 and MLL4 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, which were paralleled by proliferation defects. These findings define a hitherto unknown mechanism of action for arginine methylation in regulating translation of a subset of mRNAs including those encoding pivotal leukemogenic transcriptional regulators MLL1 and MLL4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aven RGG/RG motif is methylated by PRMT1</title><p>Aven harbors an N-terminal RGG/RG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>), a nuclear export sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Esmaili et al., 2010</xref>), and a predicted BH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hawley et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To define the function of the Aven RGG/RG motif, we initially investigated whether the motif was methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1).

The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize loading, and the methylated proteins were observed by fluorography.

The presence of bound Aven was detected by SDS-PAGE followed with anti-FLAG immunoblotting.

U2OS cells transfected with pcDNA3.1, FLAG-Aven, or FLAG-AvenΔRGG were light (L), medium (M), or heavy (H) SILAC labeled, respectively, and IP with anti-FLAG antibodies. The data were expressed as fold-enrichment of Aven over control (M/L) and AvenΔRGG over control (H/L). Aven was identified and quantified with high M/L and H/L ratios, while PRMT1 was only found with a high ratio M/L showing as expected that it associates with its RGG-containing substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Of the 146 proteins enriched with Aven, but not AvenΔRGG, ∼23% were ribosomal proteins and ∼10% were RBPs, their association is likely RNA-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These data suggested that Aven, but not AvenΔRGG, associates with ribosomal proteins and/or RNP complexes, thereby implying that Aven associates with ribosomes in an RGG/RG motif-dependent manner. To address this question, we first assessed whether endogenous Aven and PRMT1 associate with ribosomes by sedimenting cytoplasmic extracts on 5–50% sucrose gradients by ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Subsequently, sucrose gradients were fractionated to separate cytoplasmic mRNPs, ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gandin et al., 2014</xref>), and the amount of Aven, PRMT1, rpS6 (ribosomal protein S6), and β-tubulin in each fraction was determined by immunoblotting. Aven and PRMT1 co-sedimented with the heavier polysomal fractions with rpS6, while β-tubulin was restricted to the lighter fractions of the sucrose gradient corresponding to cytoplasmic mRNP fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, fractions 11 to 16). To investigate whether the RGG/RG motif and its methylation regulates the recruitment of Aven to polysomes, we performed polysomal fractionation in HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-Aven or FLAG-AvenΔRGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). FLAG-Aven co-sedimented with the heavier polysomal fractions, while FLAG-AvenΔRGG was more shifted towards the lighter fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>) and this was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest that RGG/RG motif of Aven is required for its recruitment to polysomes. To further investigate the role of RGG/RG motif methylation in polysomal localization of Aven, the FLAG-Aven was co-transfected with siPRMT1, which reduced PRMT1 expression by ∼2.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to what has been reported in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachand and Silver, 2004</xref>), PRMT1 depletion did not have a major effect on the monosome/polysome ratio, thus, indicating that PRMT1 does not exert a major impact on global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Nonetheless, PRMT1 depletion shifted FLAG-Aven into the lighter fractions, as compared to a control (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We identified human KMT2A, KMT2B, and KMT2D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), the family of MLL histone methyltransferases known to be mutated and/or part of fusion proteins, as the result of chromosomal translocations in leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liedtke and Cleary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2011</xref>).

We examined whether Aven associated with the conserved PG4 RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) of KMT2A (MLL1) and KMT2B (MLL4) near the initiator ATG (i.e., 223–253 and 262–287). Indeed, Aven bound either MLL1 or MLL4 PG4 RNA sequences in the RGG/RG motif-dependent manner, but not to those harboring guanine to adenine mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>).

Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations of FLAG-Aven expressing cells, but not pcDNA3.1 or FLAG-AvenΔRGG-transfected cells, enriched ∼30-fold for the MLL4 G4 sequence, whereas an RNA region 300 nucleotides downstream was not enriched (noG4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, right panel).

In the present manuscript, we identify, within the mRNA-coding regions of MLL1 and MLL4, RNA elements that regulate its polysomal association and protein synthesis. These RNA elements are located between 200 and 300 nucleotides downstream of the initiator methionine ATG and encode protein sequences rich in glycines and arginine–glycine repeats in MLL1 and MLL4. The function of these N-terminal repeats is unknown. We show that Aven binds the MLL1 and MLL4 G4 RNA structures in vitro and in vivo with its RGG/RG motif. Aven was required for the translational regulation of MLL1 and MLL4, as Aven-deficient T-ALL cells exhibited decreased MLL1 and MLL4 protein expression and consequently decreased the expression of their downstream targets including, the <italic>HOX</italic> genes. The association of Aven with polysomes required the methylation of its RGG/RG motif by PRMT1 and interaction with methyl-binding proteins, TDRD3 and SMN. The Aven interaction with TDRD3 and SMN may require other protein or RNA components in the complex for enhanced association. Deficiency of Aven or PRMT1 in acute leukemic cell lines led to decreased cell proliferation. Taken together, our studies suggest that Aven regulates the translation of MLL1 and MLL4 required for cancer survival and that targeting this pathway may have therapeutic potential.</p><p>RGG/RG motifs have the biochemical properties to bind both RNA and proteins to fulfill their emerging roles in assembly of RNP complexes and translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rajyaguru and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thandapani et al., 2013</xref>). The RGG/RG motif of yeast proteins Scd6, Npl3, and Sbp1 was shown to interact with the translational initiation factor eIF4G and repress translation by preventing the formation of pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rajyaguru et al., 2012</xref>). In trypanosomes, the RGG/RG motif of SCD6 is involved in regulating the type and number of RNP granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krüger et al., 2013</xref>). Amyloid-like fibers were formed when the RGG/RG motif of FUS was incubated with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). These fibers are characterized by the reversible transformation from soluble to polymeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Although many proteins have an RGG/RG motif, the Aven RGG/RG motif may be more accessible, as it is located at the N-terminus and may protrude outwards. Since the Aven RGG/RG motif is not required for self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), this suggests that an Aven dimer has 2 protruding RGG/RG motifs that can each mediate their own interactions. Therefore, we speculate that Aven functions as a scaffolding protein to assemble translationally competent RNPs for certain mRNAs containing G4 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06234.019</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model denoting the role of arginine methylated Aven by PRMT1 and DHX36 in the translation of G4 harboring MLL1 and MLL4 proteins.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06234.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06234.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06234-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>DHX36 is a DEAH (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, histidine)-box helicase and it is the only G4 RNA resolvase known and is a major DNA G4 resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Creacy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lattmann et al., 2010</xref>). Aven associated with DHX36 to regulate translation of mRNAs with G4 structures. DHX36 knockdown increased the expression of PITX1 protein without changes in mRNA, suggesting that it functions in translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Booy et al., 2014</xref>). Ribosomal footprinting studies have led to the proposal that elongating ribosomes likely use accessory RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rouskin et al., 2014</xref>), and our data suggest that DHX36 may be such an accessory helicase.

This suggests that several RBPs likely function in a similar manner to Aven in regulating accessibility of mRNPs with polysomes. It has been shown that the RGG/RG motif of FMRP is required for its polysomal association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackwell et al., 2010</xref>), however, whether arginine methylation by PRMT1 regulates association is unknown. Our findings show for the first time that arginine methylation by PRMT1 regulates translational control. It is known, however, that the yeast homolog of PRMT3 (RMT3) methylates rpS2, regulating the balance between the small and large ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachand and Silver, 2004</xref>). However, mammalian PRMT3 did not influence ribosomal assembly or polysomal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Swiercz et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is known that secondary RNA structure including G-quadruplex structures within mRNAs hinder mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koromilas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Stable RNA secondary structures within the 5′-UTRs of mRNAs reduce cap-dependent translation by preventing assembly of the translational initiation machinery at the 5′-cap and also impair the scanning of the start site AUG by the initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaudoin and Perreault, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bugaut and Balasubramanian, 2012</xref>). Secondary structure in the 5′ UTRs including G4 motifs has been shown to require eIF4A for optimal translation output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolfe et al., 2014</xref>). The 5′-UTR of NRAS and Zic-1, which harbor G4 structures, reduce translation of a reporter luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kumari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2008</xref>). G-quadruplex structures within ORFs of the virally encoded EBNA1 transcript were shown to hinder translational elongation by either ribosomal pausing or ribosomal dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murat et al., 2014</xref>). We now extend these observations and identify a mechanism regulated by arginine methylation that leads to the positive regulation of mRNAs with G4 structures within their coding region.</p><p>Aven is overexpressed in acute leukemia and was proposed to be a prognostic factor in acute childhood lymphoblastic leukemia for poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Choi et al., 2006</xref>). Aven is a well-established cell survival protein or inhibitor of apoptosis that prevents apoptosis by stabilizing pro-survival protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and inhibiting the function of pro-apoptotic protein Apaf-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chau et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kutuk et al., 2010</xref>). It was reported that an N-terminal deleted fragment of Aven cleaved by cathepsin D harbors its anti-apoptotic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>), however, such a ∼30 kDa Aven species was not visible in MOLT4 and CCRF-CEM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and was faintly observed in HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, cathepsin D mediated cleavage of Aven is unlikely involved in the regulation of translational control described herein. In addition to its pro-survival functions, Aven was identified to be essential for progression of acute leukemia in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eismann et al., 2013</xref>). The regions required for association with Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Apaf-1 reside C-terminal of the RGG/RG motif. Taken together with our findings, this suggests that Aven uses several mechanisms to increase cell survival, (1) preventing apoptosis via Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Apaf-1, and (2) favoring the translation of mRNAs, including those encoding MLL1 and MLL4 required for cell survival.</p><p>PRMT1 was shown to be essential for MLL by the <italic>MLL-EEN</italic> gene fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>).

The reactions were then incubated for 40 hr at room temperature, ethanol-precipitated and the RNAs dissolved in formamide dye loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.025% bromophenol blue). The radioactivity of the in-line probing samples was measured, and equal amounts in terms of desintegrations per minute of all conditions of each candidate were fractionated on denaturing (8 M urea) 10% polyacrylamide gels. The SAFA software was used to quantify each band. The intensity of the band incubated in KCl was then divided by the intensity of the corresponding band incubated with LiCl. G4 formation is confirmed when this value exceed 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaudoin and Perreault, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2013</xref>).

DMEM was supplemented with 10% of dialyzed FBS. Arginine and lysine were substituted with light (Arg0, Lys0), medium (Arg6, Lys4), or heavy (Arg10, Lys8) amino acids (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., UK). The cells were cultured in the labeled medium for 6 passages for metabolic incorporation of the labeled amino acids. The light, medium, and heavy labeled cells were transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1, FLAG-Aven, and FLAG-AvenΔRGG, respectively. Cell lysates were IP with anti-FLAG agarose beads and the IP complexes were mixed prior to mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>Trypsin-digested peptides were separated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system. 10 μl of sample (a total of 2 μg) in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid was loaded with a constant flow of 4 μl/min onto an Acclaim PepMap100 C18 column (0.3 mm id × 5 mm, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). After trap enrichment, peptides were eluted off onto a PepMap C18 nano column (75 μm × 50 cm, Dionex Corporation) with a linear gradient of 5–35% solvent B (90% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 240 min with a constant flow of 200 nl/min. The HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography) system was coupled to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) via a EasySpray source. The spray voltage was set to 2.0 kV and the temperature of the column was set to 40°C. Full-scan MS survey spectra (m/z 350–1600) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 70,000 after accumulation of 1,000,000 ions. The ten most intense peptide ions from the preview scan in the Orbitrap were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (normalized collision energy 35% and resolution of 17,500) after the accumulation of 50,000 ions. Maximal filling times were 250 ms for the full scans and 60 ms for the MS/MS scans. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled and all unassigned charge states as well as singly, 7, and 8 charged species were rejected. The dynamic exclusion list was restricted to a maximum of 500 entries with a maximum retention period of 40 s and a relative mass window of 10 ppm. The lock mass option was enabled for survey scans to improve mass accuracy.

Your article has been overall favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. One of the two reviewers, Ernesto Guccione, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the two reviewers, whose comments are below, discussed their reviews before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript submitted by Thandapani et al. investigates the mechanism through which the protein Aven inhibits apoptosis leading to the promotion of malignancy. The authors present data supporting the role of Aven as an RNA binding protein through its N-terminal RGG/RG domain and suggest that it binds G-quadruplex RNA structures. Arginine methylation of the RGG/RG domain by PRMT1 was shown to affect RNA binding, association with polyribosomes, and interactions with two Tudor domain proteins (SMN and TDRD3). The authors identify G-quadruplex motifs in two mRNAs (MLL1 and MLL4) as targets of Aven. It also appears that the RGG/RG domain of Aven recruits an RNA helicase that can unwind G-quadruplexes (DHX36) to polyribosomes, and this increases the translation of mRNAs. Taken together the data suggest a model where Aven binds the G-quadruplex motifs in the MLL mRNAs, through its RGG/RG domain. It associates with polysomes dependent on methylation of its RGG/RG domain by PRMT1, and its binding to polysome-associated Tudor domain proteins. Polysome-associated Aven recruits a GQ-unwinding helicase that then promotes translation of MLL1 and MLL4 by destabilizing the G-quadruplexes in their coding sequences. Increased expression of these histone methyltransferases affects transcription of HOX mRNAs and this is associated with the increased cell proliferation and survival function postulated for Aven.</p><p>1) The most important issue with this manuscript has to do with incomplete or unclear quantitation of data, use of statistical tests that are not described at all, and lack of demonstration of reproducibility. For example, it needs to be indicated for every experiment how many times it has been performed independently. Blots should be quantified when possible. Error bars are almost never defined (an exception is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) and statistical tests are not described. There is no description of “n” numbers or how “n” is defined. It's difficult to evaluate the experiments presented without this information.</p><p>2) The paper is not very well referenced. There are missing references that should be cited and in some cases better papers could be cited. The most important of the missing references is Melzer et al. (Cell Death and Differentiation, 19:1435, 2012) in which they find cathepsin D cleavage sites and map the anti-apoptotic function of Aven to the C-terminus once released by proteolysis from the inhibitory N-terminus. I'd like the authors to address this work and discuss their findings in relation it.</p><p>3) The authors rely heavily on deletion of the ΔRGG region in Aven. It would be nice to have at least one experiment performed with an R-K mutant instead of the deletion construct.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> suggests that endogenous Aven can be methylated by endogenous PRMT1 on several arginines in the N-terminal RGG/RG domain, though a few definitive controls as mentioned below are missing. However, even without all the controls when all the data is considered together it's likely that the authors are correct.</p><p>However, relevant to panel (A), it's not correct to say that Aven has no other known domains (in the subsection “Aven RGG/RG motif is methylated by PRMT1”). The authors should cite, or defend why they aren't citing, several publications: one by Esmaili et al. (Cell Cycle, 9:3913, 2010) suggesting a CRM1-dependent NES, one by Hawley et al. (Open Biol. J., 5:6, 2012) finding a BH3 motif (binding to Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>), and one from Melzer et al. (Cell Death and Differentiation, 19:1435, 2012) who find cathepsin D cleavage sites and importantly map the anti-apoptotic function of Aven to the C-terminus once released by proteolysis from the inhibitory N-terminus? The authors should comment on these findings.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that transfected Myc-Aven can capture endogenous PRMT1 in HEK cells. The figure, legend and text (in the subsection “Aven RGG/RG motif is methylated by PRMT1”) all need modification to indicate that odd numbered lanes lack Myc-Aven.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> uses OHT to knockout PRMT1 from a floxed allele in MEFs. The authors suggest that this shows that Myc-Aven is no longer methylated after loss of PRMT1 but a control is missing (mock transfection) which would show the methylated band in lane 1 is actually Myc-Aven and not a contaminating methylated PRMT1 substrate. This still would not control for a co-IPing methylated PRMT1 substrate dependent on the IP of Aven – transfection with Myc-Aven lacking the RGG/RG box would be definitive. Finally, MEFs lacking floxed PRMT1 would be an appropriate negative control to show that OHT alone doesn't inhibit methylation of Aven, i.e. show dependence on the PRMT1.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>: Endogenous Aven was IP'ed after tamoxifen-induced deletion of PRMT1, or not. Aven is shown to no longer be phosphorylated if PRMT1 is lost. Again it's possible that OHT treatment alone might lead to decreased Aven phosphorylation independent of PRMT1. Dependence on PRMT1 could be shown using MEFs lacking floxed PRMT1 as a negative control.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>: A line should be added to the text of the paper pointing out the conservation of methylated arginines across species.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: the general conclusion is probably correct, that the Aven RGG/RG domain has the potential to bind G-quadruplex forming sequences in vitro even when it's unmethylated. Whether methylation changes the affinity to any degree can't be determined.</p><p>The RNA binding assays used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are not described in enough detail. For example, what was the volume of cell lysate to which 400-500 pmol of RNA was added (needed to calculate molarity of the RNA)?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>: The statement can't be made that methylated and unmethylated Aven bind equally well to sc1 from the experiment presented. Salt sensitivity is not the same as a Kd. At 150 mM salt either the protein or the RNA needs to be titrated and % bound at each concentration determined to calculate a Kd for methylated vs. unmethylated.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: In this experiment a Kd could be calculated with the right assay since both peptides and RNA concentrations are known. The curves shown do not reach saturation so a solid conclusion about differing affinity can't be made. The method needs to be described including the sequences of the 4 RG motif peptides. RNA should be described as a concentration, not an amount.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>: Though quantitation and evidence of reproducibility are lacking, it does appear that deletion of the RGG box doesn't markedly affect phosphorylation of ATM or CHK2, or it's subcellular localization (though this is not a shuttling assay), or it's dimerization, though this is a double overexpression assay. A small note – the figure legend lists a different anti-pCHK2 antibody than in the figure labeling.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> addresses whether Aven interacts with 3 Tudor domain proteins and whether this is dependent on the RGG box and its methylation status. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, double overexpression GST pull-downs suggest the RGG box is required for TDRD3 and SMN. This is extended in (B) and (C) to the capture of endogenous TDRD3 and SMN and finally in (D) co-IP of endogenous Aven with endogenous TDRD3 and SMN is shown, and found to be dependent on OHT treatment. The authors suggest this means it's dependent on methylation of Aven by PRMT1 but dependence on PRMT1 is not shown. Further support for this would be OHT treated WT MEFS, or a second method of knocking down PRMT1, like siPRMT1 treatment. There is nothing in these studies to rule out complex formation via a third protein(s) or RNA that links Aven to the other two proteins, for example, if they are all polysome-associated, and intact polysomes are being IPed. RNAse treatment would be appropriate here. Note that sc1 is not a substitute for the RNAs that Aven might be interacting with in a cell.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: The authors demonstrate that a percentage of cellular Aven is associated with polysomes that are actively translating based on the puromycin run-off experiment shown. However, the data that the RGG box affects polysome association is not convincing. If the blots in F and G were exposed a little more will they look like E? How many times was the experiment done? Why does rpS6 disappear completely with puromycin treatment? It should appear in the fractions with the monosome peak. Quantitation of the loss from polysomes with error bars would be appropriate to make the point here. In (K-M) the same concerns apply. As presented I don't find the decrease in polysome-associated Flag-Aven convincing.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> should be referred to as table supplement 2 or vice versa. I am not clear about the reasoning behind or the significance of the statement that the mRNA encoding domains rich in R's and G's may have propensity to form G-quadruplexes. Nor why that particular consensus was used to query ORFs for potential G-quadruplex forming sequences. Is there literature to support that that query predicts that RNA fold? The rationale should be made clear. I'm particularly worried about the inclusion of C's without restraints in the N1-7 intervals. A stretch of C's will almost certainly form a duplex with nearby runs of G's interrupting the potential for GQ formation. A folding program could supplement this analysis, as could conservation across species that would predict maintenance of the GQ fold. Compensatory mutation to preserve folding would be even stronger evidence. If it's correct that the C-terminus of Aven holds the anti-apoptotic function once released from the N-terminus, it's not clear why the authors are proposing the connection between PG4 binding in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in leukemic cell survival. Could the authors please comment on the findings in Melzer et al. (Cell Death and Differentiation, 19:1435, 2012)?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Again, this is not a proper RNA binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). The finding that Aven-ΔRGG no longer binds RNA is not evidence for a specific interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). The positive charge of the RGG box will lead to nonspecific RNA association under certain conditions, again it depends on the Kd and that data is not available.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>: In the CLIP experiments presented in this panel, there is no evidence for a direct interaction. A non-crosslinked control is missing. In addition, the “CLIP” technique as described was done under conditions that the same reference (Huppertz et al.) concluded caused substantial cell toxicity, and no washes of the IP are described. It should not be referred to as “CLIP” in the current form, since there is no attempt to take advantage of the covalent bond introduced by crosslinking which would include rigorous purification of Aven:RNA complexes including stringent washes and SDS-PAGE. Moreover, this is PAR-CLIP, not iCLIP as referenced. The reference should be changed to the methodology developed by the Tuschl lab. An unbiased map of where Aven is bound to RNA in vivo could be obtained by performing the whole CLIP protocol including high throughput sequencing of the RNA tags. However, overexpression of Aven with a Flag tag is not optimal, as RBPs tend to associate with targets of lesser affinity and specificity when overexpressed beyond normal stoichiometry with their RNA targets. The antibody against Aven could be used to perform CLIP on endogenous Aven with unbiased and more comprehensive results.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: Panel (B) shows polysome profiles for WT and Aven-null cultured cells. The conclusion is made that the Aven-null cells have less polysomes, but it appears that they have less total ribosomes as well since the monosome peak is decreased. If equal cell numbers were used for the polysome analysis this might suggest a decrease in the total machinery available for protein synthesis. Panels (C)-(F) show the results for only part of the gradient. It would be valuable to see the whole gradient. Moreover, mRNA per fraction can only be plotted as a percentage of the total RNA if the total is determined for the whole gradient. For example, in (C) a large increase in MLL1 mRNA in the WT (blue line) in fractions 1-4 could cause the blue line in fractions 13-14 to actually be less than the red line, which changes the conclusions. If the authors mean that they quantified the mRNA in an aliquot of the lysate applied to the gradient, this should be clarified. For less confusion, real values for each fraction should be shown rather than percentage, which makes the assumption that the total mRNA levels in the presence or absence of Aven are unchanged.

There doesn't seem to be any difference in total levels in panel (A). Does the blot need to be exposed longer? Fractions 1-4, maybe; it would be nice to see this. It does look like DHX36 has normal polysome association in (E) but I'm again unconvinced that there is a significant difference between the results in panels (E) and (F). Quantitation?

How direct is the effect we see on MLL1/MLL4 protein abundance, as opposed to a general toxicity in cell culture?</p><p>[Editors’ note: this article was subsequently rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for sending the revised version of your work entitled “Aven recognition of RNA G-quadruplexes regulates translation of the <italic>Mixed Lineage Leukemia</italic> protooncogenes” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The editor and the referee felt that, while many of the details of the function of Aven were defined, the key question as to the biological significance of the RGG box (and its potential interaction with RNA and the downstream consequences) was not adequately addressed. In light of these deficiencies, it was agreed that your manuscript fails to meet the level of significance required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this resubmission the authors have improved the paper considerably with new data and clarification of the number of independent replicates and explanation of statistical tests. Overall, they have addressed most of my experimental concerns.</p><p>However, there are two bigger issues that are still bothering me. The background to the paper is that the authors previously found that Aven harbors an N-terminal RGG motif conserved across species. It strikes me that the most important issue, before investigating its function, should be to show that the RGG box is required for the anti-apoptotic (or other) biological functions of Aven in affecting cancer progression. Once established, it then becomes of greater interest to understand the molecular functions of the RGG box. My reading of the paper is that those assays haven't been done and in terms of the ones that have been performed, deletion of the RGG box had no effect. Moreover, as I pointed out in my first review, Melzer et al. have published that the anti-apoptotic function of Aven resides in the C-terminus and the N-terminus (containing the RGG box) acts to repress this activity until cleavage of Aven by cathepsin D releases the active C-terminus. I think this at odds with the idea that the RGG box is central to the anti-apoptotic activity unless I'm missing something. I asked the authors to discuss this and they didn't answer the question. They do add a sentence or two to the paper (in addition to agreeing to mention the Melzer et al. work) in which they say they can barely detect the product of cathepsin D cleavage, therefore it's unlikely to be important to what they are studying, but that doesn't address the issue of demonstrating that the N-terminal RGG box is actually required for the anti-apoptotic properties of Aven.</p><p>I think they have skipped the step, or are avoiding the issue, of establishing that the RGG box is important. Because they bioinformatically found an RGG box in Aven, and some RGG boxes bind RNA, and some are methylated by PRMT1, and some have been reported to bind GQ's in vitro, and some GQ's have been identified in RNA, and in some cases may affect translation, the authors have built a story suggesting that this is true for Aven and is relevant for understanding its anti-apoptotic function. They do have good data for a lot of this now, except for the importance of the RGG box in the functions of Aven that make it interesting.</p><p>If they had established that the RGG box was critical, this would still be a higher impact paper if they had then used PAR-CLIP or a similar assay to 1) determine if Aven binds RNA in vivo, and 2) generate an unbiased genome wide map of where it binds. The binding sites would not only reveal mRNA targets but would show GQ motif consensus if that's really the in vivo binding site for Aven. The polysome-association and PRMT1 methylation studies then follow to determine the outcome of Aven binding those sites in those mRNAs (which may or may not be translational control) as well as what regulates it. Instead, the paper reads like a very biased expedition to explore a few reported properties of RGG boxes and RNA G-quadruplexes based on prior literature, not all of which is high quality and many conclusions are from in vitro studies with unclear in vivo relevance. I realize we previously discussed this and agreed that it would be unreasonable to ask them to do these experiments (though it does bother me that they have already done half the PAR-CLIP experiment but didn't finish it, which could transform their paper (or prove their assertions correct) fairly easily).</p><p>The work is appealing because the authors present a compelling argument that understanding how Aven inhibits apoptosis in cancer cells, and consequently allows their progression when it's overexpressed, has potential for increasing therapeutic avenues for some human cancers. But I'm worried about their reticence to discuss the Melzer paper in regard to the issue of the RGG box being required for the anti-apoptotic function. Given the weak experimental approach (which we agreed not to ask them to change) I don't think it’s unreasonable to at least ask them to fully address evidence in support or in conflict with the idea that the RGG box has a relevant biologic role, to validate their experiments that speak to its function.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “Aven recognition of RNA G-quadruplexes regulates translation of the <italic>Mixed Lineage Leukemia</italic> protooncogenes” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

To paraphrase my previous summary of that issue, in order to support the importance of this work investigating the function of the Aven RGG box, it should be demonstrated that the RGG box is required for the anti-apoptotic (or other) biological functions of Aven in affecting cancer progression. Once that's established, it then becomes of greater interest to understand the molecular functions of the RGG box. In general those assays haven't been done and in terms of the ones that have been performed, deletion of the RGG box had no effect. Moreover, as I pointed out in my first review, Melzer et al. have published that the anti-apoptotic function of Aven resides in the C-terminus and the N-terminus (containing the RGG box) acts to repress this activity until cleavage of Aven by cathepsin D releases the active C-terminus. This is at odds with the idea that the RGG box is central to the anti-apoptotic activity.</p><p>In their appeal, they have provided a greater response to that but are still missing/avoiding the point and lacking in the validation experiments that could support the importance of the function of the RGG box.</p><p>The authors cite literature that many groups agree that full-length Aven has anti-apoptotic activity. However, my concern isn't so much whether full length Aven has an anti-apoptotic role but the other finding of Melzer et al.: that robust anti-apoptotic activity can be mapped to fragment of Aven lacking the RGG box, which would be at odds with the current paper finding that the RGG box is mediating the anti-apoptotic activity. What I wanted the Richard group to discuss is the Melzer et al. finding that the RGG-box containing N-terminus of Aven mediates homodimerization, and that its release from FL Aven by cathepson D cleavage activates the C-terminus as an anti-apoptotic molecule. Whether or not the N-terminus is really inhibitory, or FL Aven has anti-apoptotic activity, the Richard group should provide some insight as to why Melzer et al. find that the RGG deleted form of Aven has anti-apoptotic activity.</p><p>The authors now include a new figure for the reviewer (Author response image 1) using an assay for Aven function which is clonogenic survival of U2OS cells, purporting to show that the RGG box is required. The assay shows that without endogenous Aven, the cells are killed with increasing UV irradiation. Overexpression of Aven protects them. There is a small decrease in the ability of Aven to do so if the RGG box is deleted but it is only significant at the highest UV dose and is a modest effect, perhaps 2-fold. Panel B shows a Western blot of the expression of Aven and Aven-ΔRGG and it is quite clear that there's much more WT Aven produced than Aven-ΔRGG. It is impossible to know if the effects they see are due to Aven dose or to the RGG box. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the RGG box from endogenous Aven would be more compelling. They've used that technology to make Aven null cells and perhaps could use the same technique to make an elegant RGG null form of Aven.</p><p>The authors also cite three figures in their paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig7 fig10">Figures 3, 7, and 10</xref>) that they claim support the role of the RGG box, however, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> only shows the RGG box is needed for protein-protein association. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows that the ability of Aven to regulate translation of a luciferase reporter containing a G-quadruplex forming sequence is dependent on the RGG box.

Aven is an RGG box protein that promotes cell survival and is linked to osteosarcoma and AML. The strength of the manuscript is the use of multiple lines of evidence to justify the majority of the conclusions. The weakness is the qualitative nature of many of the assays. Nevertheless, all of the data presented are internally consistent, and I am left with the impression that the data as presented do largely support the authors' conclusions. Both mechanistic and biological insights arise from the study, which increases overall interest to a broad readership. While the manuscript would be improved by a more thorough study of Aven-associated mRNAs through a true PAR-CLIP study, or by further studies into the biological relevance of the handful of newly identified regulated mRNAs presented here, I agree with the authors' rebuttal that addition of such data to this manuscript would increase the scope well beyond what should be found in a single paper.</p><p>Ultimately, it is interesting that Aven binds to G-quartets, that its association with polysomes is methylation dependent, and that it regulates the translation of at least a few leukemia specific mRNAs, ultimately leading to reduced amounts of <italic>HOX</italic> gene transcription. And while a broader study would enhance the impact, it is hard to imagine filling this manuscript full of even more experiments.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It seems disingenuous to call the photocrosslinking IP experiments presented in this paper “PAR-CLIP”. The use of photoactivatable nucleotides to crosslink proteins to RNA to assist in recovery by IP preceded the paper by Hafner et al. by many years. PAR-CLIP, as published, is touted as a transcriptome-wide approach.</p><p>2) The description of the RGG box as an “RNA Recognition Motif” (in the Introduction) could be misleading, as the RRM is a specific RNA-binding domain that is not the same as the RGG box. Though many proteins contain both.</p><p>3) The rationale behind the selection of SMN and TDRD3 for further study was not clear to this reviewer. Have either been implicated in osteosarcoma or myeloid leukemia? There are 71 Tudor domain proteins in humans according to EMBL SMART database.</p><p>4) Can sc1 RNA bind to Aven if it hasn't been induced to fold into a G-quartet?</p><p>5) What fraction of the proteins associated with Aven in the SILAC experiments are RNA-dependent?</p><p>6) I am surprised that real-time PCR was used to detect enrichment of the G-quadruplex structures in the photocrosslinked IPs. I would have guessed that the G quadruplex would have prevented efficient reverse transcription.

There are missing references that should be cited and in some cases better papers could be cited. The most important of the missing references is Melzer et al. (Cell Death and Differentiation 19:1435 (2012)) in which they find cathepsin D cleavage sites and map the anti-apoptotic function of Aven to the C-terminus once released by proteolysis from the inhibitory N-terminus. I'd like the authors to address this work and discuss their findings in relation it</italic>.</p><p>We have added additional functional regions in the diagram of Aven protein in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> including a putative BH3 domain identified using bioinformatics and a functional nuclear export signal (NES).

It also appears that this Aven C-terminal fragment has potent anti-apoptotic activity, as judged by overexpression studies. We used the same ProScience antibody as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Melzer et al. (2012)</xref> which recognizes the Aven C-terminus.

Why does rpS6 disappear completely with puromycin treatment? It should appear in the fractions with the monosome peak. Quantitation of the loss from polysomes with error bars would be appropriate to make the point here. In (K-M) the same concerns apply.

I am not clear about the reasoning behind or the significance of the statement that the mRNA encoding domains rich in R's and G's may have propensity to form G-quadruplexes. Nor why that particular consensus was used to query ORFs for potential G-quadruplex forming sequences. Is there literature to support that that query predicts that RNA fold? The rationale should be made clear. I'm particularly worried about the inclusion of C's without restraints in the N1-7 intervals. A stretch of C's will almost certainly form a duplex with nearby runs of G's interrupting the potential for GQ formation. A folding program could supplement this analysis, as could conservation across species that would predict maintenance of the GQ fold. Compensatory mutation to preserve folding would be even stronger evidence. If it's correct that the C-terminus of Aven holds the anti-apoptotic function once released from the N-terminus, it's not clear why the authors are proposing the connection between PG4 binding in mRNAs encoding proteins involved in leukemic cell survival.

In addition, the “CLIP” technique as described was done under conditions that the same reference (Huppertz et al.) concluded caused substantial cell toxicity, and no washes of the IP are described. It should not be referred to as “CLIP” in the current form, since there is no attempt to take advantage of the covalent bond introduced by crosslinking which would include rigorous purification of Aven:RNA complexes including stringent washes and SDS-PAGE. Moreover, this is PAR-CLIP, not iCLIP as referenced. The reference should be changed to the methodology developed by the Tuschl lab. An unbiased map of where Aven is bound to RNA</italic> in vivo <italic>could be obtained by performing the whole CLIP protocol including high throughput sequencing of the RNA tags. However, overexpression of Aven with a Flag tag is not optimal, as RBPs tend to associate with targets of lesser affinity and specificity when overexpressed beyond normal stoichiometry with their RNA targets. The antibody against Aven could be used to perform CLIP on endogenous Aven with unbiased and more comprehensive results</italic>.</p><p>We have edited the Methods section to indicate that we performed PAR-CLIP, not iCLIP.

The conclusion is made that the Aven-null cells have less polysomes, but it appears that they have less total ribosomes as well since the monosome peak is decreased. If equal cell numbers were used for the polysome analysis this might suggest a decrease in the total machinery available for protein synthesis. Panels (C)-(F) show the results for only part of the gradient. It would be valuable to see the whole gradient. Moreover, mRNA per fraction can only be plotted as a percentage of the total RNA if the total is determined for the whole gradient. For example, in (C) a large increase in MLL1 mRNA in the WT (blue line) in fractions 1-4 could cause the blue line in fractions 13-14 to actually be less than the red line, which changes the conclusions. If the authors mean that they quantified the mRNA in an aliquot of the lysate applied to the gradient, this should be clarified. For less confusion, real values for each fraction should be shown rather than percentage, which makes the assumption that the total mRNA levels in the presence or absence of Aven are unchanged.

Reviewer #2 found our manuscript suitable for presentation, whereas Reviewer #1 found that we were largely responsive to her/his comments, and that the revised version of the manuscript was vastly improved. Reviewer#1 felt, however, that our revised manuscript was not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, which she/he rationalized by two major points:</p><p><italic>I) “I realize we previously discussed this and agreed that it would be unreasonable to ask them to do these experiments (though it does bother me that they have already done half the PAR-CLIP experiment but didn't finish it, which could transform their paper (or prove their assertions correct) fairly easily).

Moreover, it appears that during the first round of reviews consensus was reached that a genome-wide PAR-CLIP experiment was indeed out of scope of our study.</p><p><italic>“I realize we previously discussed this and agreed that it would be unreasonable to ask them to do these experiments”</italic>.</p><p>Therefore, we were unaware of these issues as they were not brought up in the review and thus we feel that is extremely unfair to bring these issues up in the second round of reviews and use it as a major basis to reject the paper.</p><p>In addition, Reviewer#1 states that <italic>“PAR-CLIP experiment but didn't finish it, which could transform their paper (or prove their assertions correct) fairly easily)”</italic>.</p><p>Genome-wide PAR-CLIP experiments are cumbersome and require extensive validation (Riley &amp; Steitz, Mol Cell, 49:601-604, 2013). For this reason, we feel that a standalone study is merited to carefully carry out genome-wide PAR-CLIP analysis, and validate and functionally characterize resulting hits (including all possible scenarios such as that some mRNAs may be bound, but not translationally regulated by Aven), rather than just to provide a list of potential Aven mRNA targets in our present study. Therefore, based on the data presented in our present study, we are undertaking genome-wide PAR-CLIP experiments from total and polysomal extracts, wherein in parallel we are performing ribosome profiling study to identify not just mRNAs that are AVEN bound, but also those whose polysome-association and translation are regulated by AVEN. As we hope you will appreciate, this approach is not widely used and thus we need to take significant time and be prudent not to produce yet another list of false positives. We thus anticipate that this study will take several years to complete.</p><p>II) Moreover, the reviewer was worried about apparent discrepancies between our Melzer et al., paper, which highlighted the role of N-terminal truncated Aven as the major anti-apoptotic form of the protein.</p><p>In contrast to Melzer et al., and consistent with our data, full-length Aven was shown to exhibit anti-apoptotic effects (Chau et al., Mol <underline>Cell, 2000</underline>; Kutuk et al., Eur J. <underline>Cancer, 2010</underline>; Eibmann/Mezler et al.,<underline>Oncogene, 2012</underline>; Ouzounova et al., BMC <underline>Genomics, 2013</underline>). Furthermore, Melzer et al. (Eibmann/Mezler et al., <underline>Oncogene, 2012</underline>) published another paper where overexpression of full-length Aven driven by the <italic>lck</italic> promoter opposes apoptosis in primary thymocytes. Accordingly, we did not observe the truncated form of Aven in MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these findings clearly indicate that Aven plays multiple mutually not excluding, and likely cell type specific, roles in promoting cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, we present a hitherto unprecedented role of Aven in promoting proliferation and long-term survival of leukemic cells (Aven is overexpressed in the vast majority of leukemia) by bolstering the translation of MLL1 and MLL4 which as we demonstrate using multiple experimental approaches is dependent on the integrity of the RGG motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig7 fig10">Figures 3, 7, 10</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we performed clonogenic assay that shows that RGG motif is also required for clonogenic survival of U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>).
