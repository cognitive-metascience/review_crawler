The R-spondin (RSPO) family of four secreted proteins, RSPO1-4, amplifies target cell sensitivity to WNT ligands by increasing WNT receptor levels. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4-6 are considered obligate high-affinity receptors for RSPOs. We discovered that RSPO2 and RSPO3, but not RSPO1 or RSPO4, can potentiate WNT/β-catenin signaling in the absence of all three LGRs. By mapping the domains on RSPO3 that are necessary and sufficient for this activity, we show that the requirement for LGRs is dictated by the interaction between RSPOs and the ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases and that LGR-independent signaling depends on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). We propose that RSPOs can potentiate WNT signals through distinct mechanisms that differ in their use of either LGRs or HSPGs, with implications for understanding their biological functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>R-spondin</kwd><kwd>WNT</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate proteoglycans</kwd><kwd>LGR</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>RSPO</kwd><kwd>ZNRF3</kwd><kwd>RNF43</kwd><kwd>HSPG</kwd><kwd>glypican</kwd><kwd>syndecan</kwd><kwd>LGR-independent signaling</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM105448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohatgi</surname><given-names>Rajat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohatgi</surname><given-names>Rajat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Novartis Post-Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebensohn</surname><given-names>Andres M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006521</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Post-Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebensohn</surname><given-names>Andres M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006521</institution-id><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Biology Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lebensohn</surname><given-names>Andres M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>R-spondins 2 and 3 can potentiate WNT signaling in the absence of LGRs through interactions with ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, defining two alternative modes of R-spondin-mediated signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The WNT signaling pathway regulates patterning and morphogenesis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoppler and Moon, 2014</xref>). In adults, WNT ligands promote the renewal of stem cells, maintaining tissue homeostasis during routine turnover or following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>). Some WNT responses in vertebrates depend on a second signal provided by the R-spondin (RSPO) family of four secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Lau et al., 2012</xref>). RSPOs have emerged as important stroma-derived growth factors that drive the renewal of epithelial stem cells in many adult vertebrate tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lau et al., 2014</xref>). RSPOs markedly amplify target cell sensitivity to WNT ligands by neutralizing two transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, ZNRF3 and RNF43, which reduce cell-surface levels of WNT receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koo et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, chromosomal translocations that increase RSPO expression or mutations that inactivate ZNRF3/RNF43 can drive cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>RSPOs contain tandem furin-like repeats (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type 1 (TSP) domain and a basic region (BR). RSPOs simultaneously engage ZNRF3/RNF43 through their FU1 domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4-6 through their FU2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zebisch et al., 2013</xref>), triggering the clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 and the consequent rise in WNT receptor levels on the cell surface. LGR4-6 are selectively expressed in various tissue stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>) and are considered the primary high-affinity receptors for RSPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carmon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glinka et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Using purified mutant and chimeric RSPOs and cell lines lacking various receptors, we show that RSPO2 and RSPO3, but not RSPO1 or RSPO4, can potentiate WNT/β-catenin signaling in the absence of all three LGRs. The ZNRF3/RNF43-interacting FU1 domain is necessary for LGR-independent signaling, while the LGR-interacting FU2 domain is dispensable. The FU1 domain of RSPO3 is also sufficient to confer the capacity to signal without LGRs when transplanted to RSPO1. The TSP/BR domains of RSPOs and their interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), previously considered dispensable for potentiation of WNT/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>), are essential in the absence of LGRs. These results define two alternative modes of RSPO-mediated signaling that share a common dependence on ZNRF3/RNF43, but differ in their use of either LGRs or HSPGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>), we generated and thoroughly characterized a haploid human cell line (HAP1-7TGP) that harbors a fluorescent transcriptional reporter for WNT/β-catenin signaling. Both the fluorescence of this synthetic reporter and the transcription of endogenous WNT target genes in HAP1-7TGP cells can be activated by WNT ligands and these WNT responses can be strongly potentiated by RSPOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>). HAP1-7TGP cells do not secrete WNT ligands and thus their response to RSPOs requires the co-administration of a low concentration of WNT. A comprehensive set of unbiased genetic screens in HAP1-7TGP identified many of the known components required for a signaling response to WNT and RSPO ligands, establishing this cell line as a valid and genetically tractable system to study this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lebensohn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We made the serendipitous and unexpected observation that RSPO3 could potently enhance WNT reporter fluorescence driven by a low concentration of WNT3A in two independently derived HAP1-7TGP clonal cell lines carrying loss-of-function mutations in <italic>LGR4</italic> (LGR4<sup>KO</sup> cells; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, RSPO1 did not enhance the response to WNT3A in LGR4<sup>KO</sup> cells. RSPO1 and RSPO3 had equivalent activity in wild-type (WT) HAP1-7TGP cells, demonstrating that both ligands were functional, and the response to RSPO3 in both WT and LGR4<sup>KO</sup> cells depended on the presence of WNT3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>LGR4</italic> is the only RSPO receptor expressed in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubey et al., 2016</xref>), we excluded the possibility of compensatory up-regulation of <italic>LGR5</italic> or <italic>LGR6</italic> by simultaneously disrupting both genes in LGR4<sup>KO</sup> cells, generating multiple independent clonal cell lines lacking all three RSPO receptors (hereafter called LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells retained an intact WNT signaling cascade, responding normally to a saturating dose of WNT3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All four RSPOs (1-4) strongly potentiated WNT signaling in WT cells, establishing ligand integrity. However, RSPO1 and RSPO4 were completely inactive in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, even at concentrations that induced maximum WNT reporter induction in WT cells, whereas RSPO2 and RSPO3 strongly potentiated signaling driven by low concentrations of WNT3A in the absence of all three LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, RSPO2 and RSPO3 possess a unique quality absent in RSPO1 and RSPO4 that enables them to potentiate WNT responses without LGRs.</p><p>Dose-response analysis revealed that RSPO1 and RSPO3 enhanced WNT signaling in WT cells with nearly identical pharmacodynamics—both the efficacy (maximum reporter activity) and the potency (measured by the EC50, defined as the RSPO concentration that induced half-maximum reporter activity) were similar for both ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, RSPO1 had no detectable activity at concentrations up to 160 ng/ml, 400-fold higher than its EC50 in WT cells. While RSPO3 potentiated WNT signaling in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, its efficacy was reduced by 33% and its EC50 was increased by 16-fold compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The distinct pharmacodynamics of RSPO3 in the two cell types suggested that its reception was mediated by different mechanisms in the presence and absence of LGRs.</p><p>We sought to determine which domains of RSPO3 were required for LGR-independent signaling using a ligand mutagenesis strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our experimental strategy leveraged a comparison between RSPO1 and RSPO3, since the former depended strictly on LGRs while the latter could signal in their absence. Unless otherwise noted, each WT and mutant RSPO ligand described hereafter was produced as a fusion protein carrying an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and a tandem C-terminal tag composed of an immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain followed by a 1D4 epitope tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Molday and Molday, 2014</xref>) used for immuno-affinity purification (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref> for a description of ligand purification and characterization). Importantly, the pharmacodynamics of the tagged RSPO proteins were similar to those of their untagged counterparts in both WT and LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the FU1 and FU2 domains in all RSPOs, which bind to ZNRF3/RNF43 and LGRs, respectively, are both necessary and sufficient to potentiate WNT responses, while the TSP and BR domains are dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kazanskaya et al., 2004</xref>). Simultaneous deletion of the FU1 and FU2 domains of RSPO3 abolished signaling in both WT and LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Point mutations in the FU1 domain of RSPO3 (R67A/Q72A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) known to weaken the interaction between RSPOs and ZNRF3/RNF43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2013</xref>) entirely abolished RSPO3 signaling in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>) and substantially reduced (but did not abolish) RSPO3 signaling in WT cells (EC50 increased by 21-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Thus, the reduction in the affinity between RSPO3 and ZNRF3/RNF43 caused by the FU1 R67A/Q72A mutation impaired LGR-independent signaling to a much greater extent than LGR-dependent signaling. Indeed, the equivalent R66A/Q71A mutation in RSPO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which only signals in an LGR-dependent manner, also impaired but did not completely abolish signaling in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Point mutations in the FU2 domain of RSPO3 (F106E/F110E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that weaken interactions with LGRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xie et al., 2013</xref>) had little impact on RSPO3 signaling in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, consistent with the lack of LGRs in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In WT cells, the F106E/F110E mutation in RSPO3 did not prevent signaling, but reduced the efficacy by 48% and increased the EC50 by 2.9-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, RSPO3 signaling in WT cells includes contributions from both LGR-dependent and independent pathways. In contrast, the F106E/F110E mutation in RSPO1 abolished signaling in WT cells, demonstrating that signaling by RSPO1 depends entirely on its interaction with LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The C-terminal TSP and BR domains of RSPOs (denoted TSP/BR when discussed together) are considered dispensable for LGR-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glinka et al., 2011</xref>). When we deleted these domains individually in RSPO3, there were only minor effects on signaling in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Deletion of both domains in RSPO3 increased the EC50 in WT cells by 333-fold, but did not change the efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Therefore, while the TSP/BR domains are not essential for signaling in WT cells, consistent with prior work, their loss substantially reduces the potency of RSPO3. In contrast, RSPO3 lacking the TSP/BR domains failed to potentiate WNT responses in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells at the concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). The signaling properties of RSPO3 lacking the TSP/BR domains were unchanged when the dimerizing Fc tag was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>).</p><p>These mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the FU1 and TSP/BR domains of RSPO3 are required for its ability to potentiate WNT responses in the absence of LGRs, while the FU2 domain is dispensable. These domain requirements are distinct from those for LGR-mediated signaling by RSPO1, which depends on the FU1 and FU2, but not on the TSP/BR domains. In WT cells, RSPO3 signaling proceeded through both LGR-dependent and independent mechanisms because disruption of the FU2 or the TSP/BR domains partially impaired but did not abolish signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). The ZNRF3/RNF43-interacting FU1 domain is essential for signaling both in the presence and absence of LGRs.</p><p>To identify the region of RSPO3 that confers the capacity to signal without LGRs, we constructed a series of chimeric ligands by combining regions of RSPO1 and RSPO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Remarkably, replacing the FU1 domain of RSPO1 with the FU1 domain of RSPO3 enabled RSPO1 to potentiate WNT signaling in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). Conversely, replacing the FU1 domain of RSPO3 with that of RSPO1 drastically reduced the signaling capacity of RSPO3 in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). In important control experiments, all chimeric ligands showed equivalent activity in WT cells, establishing ligand integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Thus, a difference in the interaction between ZNRF3/RNF43 and the FU1 domains of RSPO1 and RSPO3 is the crucial determinant of the requirement for LGRs. Of note, the affinities of the FU1-FU2 fragment of RSPO2 (25 nM) and RSPO3 (60 nM) for ZNRF3 have been reported to be much higher than those of RSPO1 (6.8 μM) and RSPO4 (300 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zebisch et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, these affinities correlate with the capacity of RSPO2 and RSPO3, but not RSPO1 or RSPO4, to promote LGR-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While the TSP/BR domains of RSPO3 were required for LGR-independent signaling, they were not sufficient because replacing the TSP/BR domains of RSPO1 with those of RSPO3 did not confer on RSPO1 the capacity to signal in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In fact, the TSP/BR domains of RSPO1 and RSPO3 seemed interchangeable for signaling activity in both WT and LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>These results suggested that the WNT-potentiating activity of RSPO3 in the absence of LGRs depends on its interaction with ZNRF3/RNF43 through the FU1 domain and additional interactions with an alternative co-receptor through the TSP/BR domains. We considered the previous observation that the TSP/BR domains of RSPOs can bind to heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nam et al., 2006</xref>). Addition of heparin to the culture medium completely blocked potentiation of WNT signaling by RSPO3 in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells, but had only a partial inhibitory effect in WT cells, in which RSPO3 can also signal through LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The TSP/BR domains of RSPOs can mediate interactions with the two major families of cell-surface HSPGs, the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked glypicans and the transmembrane syndecans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, both protein families are encoded by multiple, partially redundant genes: six glypican genes (<italic>GPC1-6</italic>) and four syndecan genes (<italic>SDC1-4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2000</xref>), all of which are expressed in HAP1 cells except for <italic>GPC5</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Since all glypicans and syndecans must be post-translationally modified with heparan sulfate chains for receptor function, we disrupted <italic>EXTL3</italic>, a gene encoding a glycosyltransferase that is specifically required for HSPG biosynthesis, but dispensable for the synthesis of other glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). The loss of EXTL3 in LGR4/5/6<sup>KO</sup> cells led to an 81% reduction in RSPO3-mediated potentiation of WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, the loss of EXTL3 in WT cells only reduced signaling by 34%, likely because RSPO3 can also signal through LGRs in WT cells.

Therefore, disrupting any single family of HSPGs does not impair signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), while disrupting EXTL3, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate chains present in all HSPGs, substantially reduces LGR-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study shows that RSPOs can potentiate WNT signals in the absence of LGRs, expression of which has been hitherto considered the hallmark of RSPO-responsive cells. This quality is unique to RSPO2 and RSPO3 and is endowed by their ZNRF3/RNF43-interacting FU1 domain, since transplanting the FU1 domain from RSPO3 renders RSPO1 capable of signaling in the absence of LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D</xref>). Furthermore, the TSP/BR domains of RSPO3, which had been deemed dispensible for LGR-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glinka et al., 2011</xref>), are necessary for signaling in the absence of LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, G</xref>). HSPGs, cell surface proteins capable of interacting with the TSP/BR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>), are also selectively required for RSPO3-dependent potentiation of WNT signaling in the absence of LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that the interaction of the TSP/BR domains of RSPO3 with HSPGs provides an alternative mechanism that neutralizes ZNRF3/RNF43 in the absence of LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). HSPGs are known to mediate the efficient endocytosis of multiple cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson and Belting, 2014</xref>). Hence, we speculate that the simultaneous interaction of RSPO3 with ZNRF3/RNF43 through its FU1 domain and HSPGs through its TSP/BR domains provides an LGR-independent route for the endocytosis and clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the consequent rise in WNT receptor levels.</p><p>Future work will be necessary to define the developmental, regenerative or oncogenic contexts in which this LGR-independent mode of signaling is used to amplify target cell responses to WNT ligands. The presence of three LGRs capable of mediating responses to four RSPO ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lau et al., 2011</xref>) poses significant experimental challenges to addressing this question genetically in mouse models, as we did in human haploid cells, since multiple genes would need to be simultaneously disrupted to test if any responses to RSPOs are retained in tissues lacking all three LGRs.</p><p>However, some information can be gleaned from the developmental phenotypes of mice carrying mutations in <italic>Rspo2</italic> and <italic>Rspo3</italic>, the two members of the family capable of potentiating WNT signaling in cells lacking all three LGRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Rspo2</italic> is expressed in the limb and lung buds of the early embryo and <italic>Rspo2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have defects in both limb development and branching of bronchioles in the developing lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nam et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nam et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, LGR-mediated RSPO signaling may be critical when high-level WNT signaling must be restricted to specific cells, as in the stem cell niches of various tissues, while HSPG-mediated RSPO signaling might confer amplification of WNT responses more broadly during the development of organs like the limbs, the lungs or the placenta.</p><p>In summary, our results define two alternative modes of RSPO-mediated amplification of WNT/β-catenin signaling that differ in their use of either LGRs or HSPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

When more than one clonal cell line was generated targeting the same gene or genes, the ‘Cell Line Name’ column indicates the generic name used throughout the manuscript to describe the genotype and the ‘Clone #' column identifies distinct individual clones. The figures in which each clone was used are also indicated. The ‘CRISPR guide’ column indicates the name of the guide used, which is the same as that of the oligonucleotides encoding sgRNAs (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The ‘Genomic Sequence’ column shows 80 nucleotides of genomic sequence (5’ relative to the gene is to the left) surrounding the target site; when two adjacent sites were targeted within the same gene, 80 nucleotides of genomic sequence surrounding each target site are shown and the number of intervening base pairs that are not shown between the two sites is indicated in parenthesis. Each group of clonal cell lines made using the same CRISPR guides is separated by a horizontal spacer and the ‘Genomic Sequence’ column is headlined by the reference WT genomic sequence (obtained from RefSeq). The guide sequence is colored blue and the site of the double strand cut made by Cas9 is between the two underlined bases. Sequencing results for individual clones are indicated below the reference sequence. Rare differences between the reference RefSeq sequence and the sequencing result obtained from HAP1-7TGP clones, as well as any undetermined sequences, are indicated in green. Some clones obtained following transfection with the indicated sgRNAs and single-cell sorting were found to be WT at the target site or sites; these are indicated as such and were used as controls. For mutant clones, mutated nucleotides are colored red (dashes represent deleted nucleotides, ellipses are used to indicate that a deletion continues beyond the 80 nucleotides of sequence shown and large insertions are indicated in brackets) and the nature of the mutation, the resulting genotype and any pertinent observations are also described. For clones in which multiple genes were targeted, the CRISPR guide (or pair of guides) used to target each gene as well as the genomic sequence, mutation, genotype and observations pertaining to each of the targeted genes are designated ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ and so on in the column headings and are shown under horizontal spacers of different colors.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-33126-supp1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33126.010</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Nucleotide sequences of RSPO1 and RSPO3 WT, mutant and chimeric constructs used in this study.</title><p>The name and length of each construct is indicated.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Jeremy Nathans) and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter. Although there appears to be a difference of opinion between the two primary reviewers, I feel the work merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and a consensus was reached consistent with this view in the consultation session we convened after the reviews were submitted.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>This manuscript by Lebensohn and Rohatgi reported that RSPO2 and RSPO3 could potentiate Wnt signaling in the absence of LGR4/5/6 receptors. The authors found that RSPO2 and RSPO3 enhanced the Wnt signaling in a LGR4/5/6 knockout human cell line, whereas the activities of RSPO1 and RSPO4 required the LGR4/5/6 receptors. The authors also used site-directed mutagenesis and domain swapping experiments to reveal that the LGR4/5/6-independent activity of RSPO3 was determined by the N-terminal FU1 domain and C-terminal TSP/BR domains. Finally they proposed a model that in the absence of LGR4/5/6 receptors, the binding of RSPO2 or RSPO3 by cell-surface HSPGs, replacing the binding by LGR4/5/6 receptors, helped to present the bound RSPO to interact with ZNRF3/RNF43, which facilitates the endocytosis and clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 to increase the Wnt receptor levels on cell surface.</p><p>The discovery described in the manuscript is interesting and may help to differentiate four members in the RSPO family in the future research. However, the novelty and content of current research are still limited. Previous studies have shown that RSPO2 Fu1-Fu2 fragment is able to bind and form complex with ZNRF3 without LGR4/5/6 (Zebisch et al., 2013). The interactions between RSPOs and ZNRF3/RNF43 have been clearly elucidated (Zebisch et al., 2013; Chen P et al., 2013). It has also been reported that the TSP/BR domain is involved in interacting with HSPGs, including the report of syndecan 4 as the receptor of RSPO3 (Okhawara B et al., 2011). Furthermore, the physiological importance and relevance of the discovery was not tested in the current study. Indeed, the author mentioned in the last paragraph that the developmental, regenerative and oncogenic context of this discovery need to be defined.</p><p>Based on the above stated reasons, I feel that the content and significance of current research are not strong enough for the manuscript to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Overall, this work provides significant new insight into the mechanisms of action of R-spondins. The work is very well done from a technical perspective and the work defining the relative roles of syndecans and glypicans added additional important information. The results of this work are likely to be highly influential in the field. I had previously seen this work published on the bioRxiv preprint site and was very intrigued after reading this data there earlier.</p><p>I have no requests for additional data to support the work. However, if possible, I would encourage further discussion in the text speculating on where this LGR-independent mode of signaling is most likely to be operative (Final paragraph of Results and Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33126.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>[…] The discovery described in the manuscript is interesting and may help to differentiate four members in the RSPO family in the future research.

Since the three, partially redundant LGR receptors have not been simultaneously knocked-out in mice, our comments are largely based on the described phenotypes of <italic>Rspo2</italic>-/- and <italic>Rspo3</italic>-/- embryos.</p><p>We would like to also call attention to an additional set of data that has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (panels C and D), along with supportive data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. In our original manuscript, we speculated that the requirement for HSPGs might be mediated by syndecans (one of the two major classes of cell-surface HSPGs, the other being the glypicans). This was based on the observations that (1) preventing all HSPG biosynthesis by depleting EXTL3 impaired LGR-independent signaling but (2) preventing glypican biogenesis by depleting PIGL had no effect on LGR-independent signaling. While this manuscript was in review, we have been able to test this hypothesis by simultaneously introducing loss-of-function mutations in the genes (<italic>SDC1-4</italic>) encoding all four syndecans expressed in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Counter to our initial expectation, eliminating all four syndecans did not impair LGR-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As we now describe in the text that accompanies <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, this implies that either syndecans and glypicans are redundant in their ability to support LGR-independent signaling, or that a different HSPG is involved. Despite not being requested by the reviewers, we feel that this additional data is very relevant to the central message of the paper and thus important to include in the revised manuscript. Presenting this data will also prevent unnecessary work by other investigators to dissect the potential role of syndecans (which have already been implicated in RSPO-mediated WNT/PCP signaling).</p></body></sub-article></article>
