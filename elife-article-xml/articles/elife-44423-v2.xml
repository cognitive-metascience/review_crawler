spared until late stages of the disease. Using a rapid and efficient protocol to differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) to SpMNs and CrMNs, we now report that ESC-derived CrMNs accumulate less human (h)SOD1 and insoluble p62 than SpMNs over time. ESC-derived CrMNs have higher proteasome activity to degrade misfolded proteins and are intrinsically more resistant to chemically-induced proteostatic stress than SpMNs. Chemical and genetic activation of the proteasome rescues SpMN sensitivity to proteostatic stress. In agreement, the hSOD1 G93A mouse model reveals that ALS-resistant CrMNs accumulate less insoluble hSOD1 and p62-containing inclusions than SpMNs. Primary-derived ALS-resistant CrMNs are also more resistant than SpMNs to proteostatic stress. Thus, an ESC-based platform has identified a superior capacity to maintain a healthy proteome as a possible mechanism to resist ALS-induced neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the selective death of specific neuronal cell types. Although fundamental to understanding neurodegeneration and designing effective therapies, the molecular nature of differential sensitivity to neurodegeneration remains obscure. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle denervation and loss of motor neurons leading to paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Al-Chalabi, 2017</xref>). However, not all motor neurons are affected equally. While most spinal motor neurons (SpMNs) degenerate during ALS progression, a subset of cranial motor neurons (CrMNs: oculomotor, trochlear and abducens motor neurons) are typically spared, allowing patients to retain eye movement until late stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gizzi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okamoto et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawyer and Netsky, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanning et al., 2010</xref>). Oculomotor and trochlear motor neurons are also more resistant than SpMNs to neurodegeneration in the ALS mouse model expressing human (h) SOD1 G93A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haenggeli and Kato, 2002</xref>). Understanding the intrinsic neuronal mechanisms that contribute to differential sensitivity of motor neurons will deepen our understanding of ALS pathology and ultimately lead down to a path to more effective therapies.</p><p>With shared clinical manifestations, ~90% of patients suffer from sporadic ALS while ~10% of ALS cases are familial. More than fifty genes involved in different biological processes have been reported to contribute to the familial ALS cases. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rosen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, many ALS pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to motor neuron degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>). One common hallmark found in both familial and sporadic ALS is the accumulation of aggregated proteins, which is also shared by many other neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yerbury et al., 2016</xref>). ALS mutations in <italic>SOD1</italic>, <italic>TARDBP</italic> (TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa), <italic>FUS</italic> (Fused in Sarcoma) and <italic>C9ORF72</italic> generate proteins with a propensity to misfold and aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruijn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zu et al., 2013</xref>). However, ALS protein inclusions contain more than just ALS-causing proteins. In both ALS patients and mouse models, SpMNs and astrocytes typically contain inclusions positive for ubiquitinated proteins and the ubiquitin-binding protein <italic>SQSTM1</italic> (Sequestosome 1, also known as p62) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leigh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gal et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the inability to prevent the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates could contribute to SpMN sensitivity to ALS.</p><p>The ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy are the two major quality control pathways to maintain proteostasis. Soluble and misfolded proteins are degraded primarily by the ubiquitin proteasome system, while large protein aggregates are recognized and removed by the autophagy lysosome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dikic, 2017</xref>). Therefore, ALS-causing misfolding proteins, like mutant SOD1, can be degraded by both the proteasome and autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabuta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo et al., 2013</xref>).

Taken together, this evidence suggests that ALS-sensitive SpMNs are under proteostatic stress during ALS progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hetz and Mollereau, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies comparing vulnerable and resistant cell types in ALS rodent models have employed laser-capture coupled with RNA level measurements to isolate genes that could contribute to differential motor neuron sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allodi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morisaki et al., 2016</xref>). Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) is expressed only in the fast-fatigable α-motor neurons, a selective subtype of SpMNs vulnerable in ALS. Reduction of MMP-9 significantly delayed muscle denervation of fast-fatigable α-motor neurons in the ALS mouse model expressing hSOD1 G93A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, expression of IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is upregulated in the resistant oculomotor neurons. Viral delivery of IGF-2 to the muscles of hSOD1 G93A mice extended life-span by 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allodi et al., 2016</xref>). These studies demonstrate that intrinsic mechanisms influence ALS sensitivity in motor neurons. While manipulating MMP-9 and IGF-2 signaling partially rescues ALS phenotypes, their mechanisms and possible convergent modes of action to resist neurodegeneration are still unknown. Studies attempting to understand the mechanisms of CrMN resistance to ALS have been mostly limited by difficulties in obtaining large homogenous populations of CrMNs.</p><p>Embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based differentiation strategies offer a viable alternative to generate disease-relevant cell types for ‘disease in a dish’ studies. Traditionally, ESCs can be differentiated into different neuronal subtypes by the activity of signaling molecules. Such is the case with differentiating ESCs exposed to retinoic acid and hedgehog signaling that further differentiate into SpMNs. However, there is no equivalent strategy to derive the developmentally distinct CrMNs at an efficiency conducive for biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>). Direct programming of terminal motor neuron fate by transcription factor expression might circumvent this issue. During embryonic differentiation, Isl1 and Lhx3 transcription factors specify SpMN identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>), while Isl1 and Phox2a are essential for CrMN differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirsch et al., 2007</xref>). These different developmental strategies have inspired CrMN and SpMN programming from ESC and human pluripotent stem cells at high efficacy and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Santis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allodi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this work we employed SpMN and CrMN direct programming strategies to investigate a possible mechanism to explain their differential sensitivity to ALS. We found that resistant CrMN subtypes have fewer insoluble hSOD1 aggregates than SpMNs in an ALS mouse model expressing hSOD1 G93A. By over-expressing hSOD1 mutant proteins, ESC-derived induced CrMNs (iCrMNs) and SpMNs (iSpMNs) recapitulated the differential accumulation of insoluble hSOD1 in vitro and revealed more efficient proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins in iCrMNs than SpMNs. As a result, iCrMNs also accumulate less insoluble p62 than iSpMNs over time, which is reciprocally validated in the hSOD1 G93A mouse model showing that resistant CrMN subtypes contain fewer p62 positive inclusions than SpMNs. Moreover, iCrMNs were intrinsically more resistant than iSpMNs to proteostatic stress caused by chemicals interfering with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. Confirming the predictive value of this ESC-based model, primary CrMNs from the ALS-resistant oculomotor and trochlear nuclei also survived better than primary SpMNs to chemically induced proteostatic stress. Finally, we found that iCrMNs contain more proteasome 20S core subunits and have a higher level of proteasome activity than iSpMNs. Chemical and genetic activation of the proteasome significantly increased iSpMN survival under proteostatic stress. Therefore, our comparative study of ESC-derived iCrMNs and iSpMNs identified that CrMNs take better advantage of the ubiquitin proteasome system to degrade misfolded proteins and maintain proteostasis. This superior proteostatic capacity could be an intrinsic and disease relevant mechanism underlying CrMN resistance to ALS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced hSOD1 accumulation in ALS-resistant motor neurons</title><p>To investigate if the ALS-resistant CrMNs maintain a healthier proteome than SpMNs, we compared aggregation of misfolded hSOD1 within these populations in the SOD1 G93A mouse model.

Additionally, O/TrMNs exhibited strikingly lower overall levels of misfolded hSOD1 compared to SpMNs, necessitating imaging under 5–10 times higher confocal laser intensity. Imaging the SpMNs at the same intensity produced an image with fully saturated motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result is consistent with the recent observation of little or no aggregation in eye-innervating CrMNs in the G85R SOD1YFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). These data suggest that ALS-resistant CrMNs might be more capable than SpMNs of clearing misfolded hSOD1 and thus mitigating ALS-induced proteostatic stress. To further investigate this possibility, we sought to establish culture and differentiation conditions for CrMNs and SpMNs to model and understand the intrinsic mechanisms that contribute to motor neurons’ differential ability to resist ALS-induced stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44423.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ESC-derived iCrMNs and iSpMNs resemble molecular and cellular features of primary O/TrMNs and SpMNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of oculomotor neurons and lumber 4–5 SpMNs from P100 hSOD1 G93A mice. Motor neurons were stained by ChAT antibody in red. hSOD1 aggregates were present in SpMNs and stained by misfolded hSOD1 antibody in green.

However, the presence of other cell types in the culture complicates the investigation of cell-autonomous neuronal properties because treatments might act on supporting cells that then affect neuronal physiology. Mixed cultures also complicate and, in some cases, preclude the use of bulk measurements such as RNA sequencing and western blot.

To investigate if iCrMNs and iSpMNs use the proteasome pathway differentially to degrade hSOD1 mutant proteins, we compromised the proteasome pathway and measured the amount of hSOD1 accumulation. To avoid pleiotropic toxic effects, we applied a milder treatment of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 than used in previous reports that tested the proteasomal degradation of SOD1 and TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiskinis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scotter et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, we treated Day 4 hSOD1 expressing neurons with DMSO (vehicle control) or 100 nM MG-132 for 18 hr. 100 nM of MG-132 reduced proteasome activity by ~30% in both iCrMNs (68.27 ± 10.30% compared to DMSO) and iSpMNs (67.63 ± 9.49% compared to DMSO, iCrMNs versus iSpMNs p<italic>=</italic>0.47 by Student’s t-test, n = 3).

The ~30% reduction of proteasome activity did not significantly affect levels of soluble WT or mutant hSOD1 protein in iCrMNs or iSpMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). By contrast, the accumulation of insoluble hSOD1 A4V and G93A mutant proteins (but not WT) was significantly affected by MG-132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). iSpMNs accumulated ~2 fold more insoluble mutant hSOD1 when the proteasome was compromised (1.73 ± 0.21 fold more hSOD1 A4V, p=0.03; 1.93 ± 0.23 fold more hSOD1 G93A, p=0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that proteins that would have normally been degraded by the proteasome instead contributed to the insoluble aggregates.

It is conceivable that iCrMNs rely more on the proteasome pathway to prevent the accumulation not just of hSOD1, but of insoluble proteins in general. Proteins to be degraded by the proteasome are tagged by ubiquitin, so we next investigated whether reducing proteasome activity would result in widespread accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in addition to accumulation of mutant hSOD1. To this end, we again treated iCrMNs and iSpMNs with MG-132 and DMSO, but probed the western blot with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Following MG-132 treatment, there was a visible increase in ubiquitinated proteins in both iCrMNs and iSpMNs that appeared as a smear of bands in both the soluble and insoluble fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Mirroring the response of hSOD1 mutant proteins, there was significantly greater accumulation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins in MG-132 treated iCrMNs compared to iSpMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This response to MG-132 treatment was universal across WT, A4V and G93A hSOD1 expressing neurons (13–18 fold and 3–5 fold more ubiquitinated proteins in iCrMNs and iSpMNs respectively). Therefore, we conclude that there is an intrinsic difference between iCrMNs and iSpMNs in their use of the ubiquitin proteasome system to degrade misfolded proteins that would otherwise contribute to insoluble protein aggregates. p62 is a ubiquitin-binding protein and a common component of ubiquitinated inclusions in degenerating SpMNs of ALS patients and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gal et al., 2007</xref>).

While this result points to a possible mechanism, the upregulation of core proteasome proteins may not be enough to confer iCrMNs with higher proteasome activity. Thus, we sought to directly measure proteasome activity in intact iSpMNs versus iCrMNs. iCrMNs and iSpMNs were treated with Suc-LLVY-AMC that fluoresces when cleaved by the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome. The proteasome activity was represented by the hydrolysis rate of Suc-LLVY-AMC. Non-transgenic iCrMNs had a higher proteasome activity than iSpMNs at Day 2 and 5 in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that iCrMN have a higher capacity to degrade misfolding proteins and prevent the accumulation of insoluble aggregates because they have a higher proteasome activity than iSpMNs.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44423.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>iCrMNs contain more proteasome 20S core subunits and have higher proteasome activity than iSpMNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental outline: mass spectrometry was performed in Day two neurons and proteasome activity tests were performed in Day two and Day five living neurons. (<bold>B</bold>) Unbiased mass spectrometry revealed that iCrMNs contain higher levels of all proteasome 20S core subunits but not 19S regulatory subunits (n = 2).

Thus, we hypothesized that enhancing proteasome activity would improve iSpMN’s ability to cope with proteostatic stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated if the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, which had been shown to enhance proteasome activity in primary mouse neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leestemaker et al., 2017</xref>), could modify iCrMN’s and iSpMN’s ability to survive CPA-induced proteostatic stress.</p><p>First, we confirmed that PD169316 enhances proteasome activity in ESC-derived motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In agreement to what has been described in other neuronal cell types, PD169316 treatment increased chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome in iSpMNs and iCrMNs in a dosage dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Second, because inhibiting p38 can cause differential survival phenotypes in these motor neurons, we quantified its effect on iSpMNs and iCrMNs. 0.25–2 μM PD169316 did not affect the survival of iCrMNs or iSpMNs in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Finally, we tested if PD169316 could rescue iSpMN sensitivity to CPA at concentrations that do not affect survival of motor neurons under normal conditions. Therefore, Day 2 ESC-derived motor neurons were co-treated with 10 µM CPA and 0.25–2 µM PD169316 for three days and their survival was quantified on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In a concentration dependent manner, co-treatment of PD169316 improved the survival of iSpMNs from 66 ± 4% with no PD169316% to 80 ± 4% with 2 µM PD169316 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). 0–2 μM PD169316 treatment did not significantly enhance iCrMN survival to 10 µM CPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).

However, access to large numbers of neuronal subtypes for biochemical and genetic analysis is restricted to a few neuronal classes. Differentiation strategies from stem cells, or even terminally differentiated cell types, promises to bridge this gap by producing neuronal fates that recapitulate key features of embryonically derived neurons. We took advantage of a rapid and efficient ESC differentiation platform that relies on transcription factor expression to generate two types of motor neurons, which not only express key fate markers but also model differential sensitivity to proteostatic stress. Thus, the established ESC-derived motor neuron differentiation and culture conditions can form the basis of an in vitro analysis platform to rapidly screen for genes and chemicals that affect the ability of motor neurons to maintain a healthy proteome.</p><p>During embryonic and in vitro differentiation, SpMNs and CrMNs are established by unique transcription factor combinations that induce different molecular and cellular properties in differentiated neurons. Our data suggest that, among these differences, the differential use of proteasome-dependent protein degradation is critical for the variable accumulation of insoluble aggregates between iCrMNs and iSpMNs. iCrMNs rely more than iSpMNs on proteasome function to degrade misfolded proteins and minimize aggregate formation and accumulation. Importantly, this superior capacity of iCrMNs to handle misfolded proteins is not induced by hSOD1 mutant expression and is not specific to misfolded hSOD1. This capability is likely to be an intrinsic mechanism of iCrMNs that applies to general misfolded proteins ubiquitinated for proteasome degradation. This notion is supported by the differential survival of non-transgenic iCrMNs and iSpMNs under proteostatic stress caused by tunicamycin and CPA induced misfolded proteins. The proteomic study and the proteasome activity test in non-transgenic iCrMNs and iSpMNs suggest iCrMNs’ higher proteasome activity is one of the mechanisms that make them resistant to proteostatic stress. A recent study utilizing a slightly different strategy but also forcing Phox2a expression reported that stem cell-derived CrMNs were more resistant to kainic acid toxicity than SpMNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allodi et al., 2019</xref>). ALS resistant motor neurons might utilize more than one mechanism to resist ALS, and future studies will be necessary to elucidate if they act in parallel during ALS progression. On the other hand, different CrMN features could be exploited to resist different ALS-causing mutations or sporadic ALS.</p><p>Activation of the proteasome by the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 improved iSpMN survival to CPA induced proteostatic stress. In hSOD1 G93A mice, persistent activation of p38 was observed in motor neurons beginning in the presymptomatic stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tortarolo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holasek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morfini et al., 2013</xref>). Chemical inhibition of p38 enhanced SpMN survival and rescued axonal transport defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dewil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibbs et al., 2018</xref>). Our data now suggest that these protective effects, via the treatment of p38 inhibitors, may also benefit from enhanced activity of the proteasome and thereby improved proteostasis of misfolded proteins. Thus, a screen to identify more potent activators of the proteasome degradation pathway or to augment the UPR response might be a promising future therapeutic approach to ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2015</xref>). p62 also serves as a selective autophagy receptor for protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dikic, 2017</xref>). The less insoluble p62 accumulation in iSpMNs compared to iCrMNs after proteasome perturbation implies that iSpMNs may rely more on autophagy to clear p62-containing aggregates than iCrMNs. However, we found that treatment of autophagy inhibitors 3-Methyladenine and Bafilomycin A1 did not significantly alter aggregate accumulation in Day 5 iSpMNs and iCrMNs expressing hSOD1 mutant. Considering the complicated cross-talk between the autophagy and proteasome pathways, we also tested co-treatment of these autophagy inhibitors together with MG-132 but still observed no significant changes compared to MG-132 treatment alone. However, we are not confident to conclude that autophagy does not play a significant role protecting CrMNs simply relying on negative results using chemical inhibitors of the autophagy pathways.</p><p>One challenge of studying neurodegenerative diseases in vitro and for this ESC-based platform in particular is trying to model later aspects of ALS. Late and end-stage features of the disease can take several decades to develop in patients and months to develop in mice. In this study, similar to ALS mouse models, we accelerated the phenotype by expressing high levels of hSOD1. The caveat of this strategy is revealed in the accumulation of insoluble p62 in neurons expressing WT hSOD1, which might be explained by the proteostatic stress induced by high hSOD1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosco et al., 2010</xref>). In the future, this ESC-based platform could be enhanced by co-culturing motor neurons with astrocytes and other cell types that may play a role in ALS progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phatnani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The pathogenic mechanisms behind ALS remain obscure. This, in part, is due to the considerable percentage of sporadic cases and the wide array of ALS-causing genes involved in distinct biological processes. Therefore, studying a single ALS-causing mutation in a single cell type might fall short in revealing a complete picture of the ALS-induced degeneration process. The combination of a rapid ESC-based approach and in vivo validation helps to identify the intrinsic differences that play a role in CrMN’s resistance to proteostatic stress compared to SpMNs. These unique intrinsic characteristics of CrMNs and SpMNs are likely to contribute to their differential vulnerability to ALS neurodegeneration. Using neuronal types with varying ALS sensitivities but comparable genetic makeups helps to juxtapose the differences in their innate physiology and stress response. These distinct differences between CrMNs and SpMNs can then be used to help identify ALS-specific pathogenic mechanisms and develop therapeutic strategies with broader applications within neurodegenerative fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus)</td><td>129S1/C57BL/6J IslMN:GFP</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18031680">18031680</ext-link></td><td>MGI: J:132726</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background (Mus musculus)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>JAX: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Mus musculus)</td><td>B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>JAX: 004435</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (Mus musculus)</td><td>iNIL ESC line</td><td>This paper;

After clean-up, 450 cells remained in the analysis (80% of input). Variable genes were detected with mean.cutoff (0.0125, 3) and dispersion.cutoff (0.5, Inf), resulting 3982 variable genes. The data were then log normalized and scaled to regress out unwanted sources of variation (nCount_RNA, percent.mito). Linear dimensional reduction (principal component analysis, PCA) was performed. The first 50 PCs were evaluated for significance via a combination of tools available in Seurat and PCs 1–10 and 14 were included in subsequent analyses. To visualize high-dimensional single cell data, we chose to implement tSNE (perplexity of 18). Clustering was also performed iteratively from a resolution of 0.1 to 0.8. Batch effect and biological significance of individual principal components was evaluated based on component genes and dataset separation. These datasets were analyzed multiple times with different variables to identify persistent features of the cell populations.</p><p>The single cell RNA sequencing raw FASTQ files used in this study are deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession GSE130938.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Survival assay in primary motor neurons</title><p>Neurons were analyzed by immunofluorescence labeling with the neuronal marker Tuj1 and the motor neuron marker Islet1, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Neuronal cell body death was assessed from pyknotic nuclear morphology and the presence of membrane swelling in the cell body. Neuronal processes that showed signs of beading and swelling were classified as degenerating processes. Cells with neither cell body death nor degenerating processes were counted as viable neurons (Tuj1<sup>+</sup>) or motor neurons (Tuj1<sup>+</sup>, Isl1<sup>+</sup>). Survival ratios in the experiments adding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressors or the proteasome inhibitor MG132 were calculated as the number of healthy viable cells in the drug treated well divided by the number of viable cells in the vehicle (DMSO) only well. All viable cells in each well of the 96-well plate were manually counted under the microscope by one counter (JYL). Random samples were re-counted by a second counter (RF). Cell counts differed by an average of 5 cells/well (&lt;1.6% of the total cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Animal tissue collection, Immunofluorescence Staining and Imaging</title><p><italic>SOD1</italic><sup>G93A</sup> mutant mice and their non-transgenic littermates (first generation cross only) were deeply anesthetized using Avertin (tribromoethanol, Sigma) and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (from 32% stock, 15714, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (70011, Thermo Fisher). Three mice at postnatal days 100 ± 3 were used for hSOD1 aggregate staining. Three mice at postnatal days 66, 66 and 97 were used for p62 aggregate staining. The CNS was removed and fixed overnight in the same solution noted above. Whole brain and lumbar segments 4 and 5 were dissected, embedded in 4% (w/v) agar and sectioned on a vibratomb (Leica VT1000 S). 100 μm transverse spinal cord sections and sagittal whole brain sections were cut. Sections were blocked overnight in PBS with 10% donkey serum (D9553, Sigma) and 0.4% Triton X-100 (T8787, Sigma). Sections then were incubated at room temperature for two days in the above blocking buffer with primary antibodies [goat polyclonal anti-ChAT (1:100; AB144P, Millipore) and mouse monoclonal anti-SQSTM1/p62 (1:500; ab56416, Abcam) or mouse monoclonal anti-misfolded human SOD1 (1:250; MM-0072–02, MédiMabs]. After the primary incubation, six washes (&gt;30 min each) in PBS with 0.4% Triton were followed by a one-day incubation at room temperature in the above wash buffer with donkey anti-mouse and anti-goat secondary antibodies (1.5 μg/mL; Jackson ImmunoResearch). After six more washes (as stated above), sections were mounted on microscope slides in Fluoromount G (OB100, ThermoFisher) using 100 μm spacers and allowed to set for &gt;12 hr. Staining was visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 800).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis </title><p>The quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SEM or mean ± SD of at least 3 (indicated in the figure legends, when the number was more than 3) independent experiments. The only exceptions are the polysome profiling experiment and the mass spectrometry experiment, which have two biological replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and student’s <italic>t</italic> test for data that are normally distributed or log-transformed after normality and variance homogeneity tests.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Paola Arlotta as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Justin Ichida (Reviewer #2); Brian Wringer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a strong, well-executed and highly impactful study reporting on a novel differential capacity by two classes of motor neurons to maintain a healthy proteasome and thus resist protein accumulation linked to ALS. Specifically, the authors report that CrMNs (which are more resistant to ALS) and spMNs (which are susceptible to disease) have different abilities to deal with protein accumulation and stress. Using both a novel in vitro ES-derived culture system for both CrMNs and SpMNs they demonstrate that ESC-derived CrMNs accumulate less human SOD1 and insoluble p62 than SpMNs. They go on to show that CrMNs have a stronger proteasome activity to degrade misfolded proteins and therefore are intrinsically more resistant to induced proteostatic stress than SpMNs. They confirm using optimized cultures of these primary neurons, isolated from the mouse early embryo, that endogenous cells also accumulate SOD1 differently and have different survival capacities connected to this.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is an outstanding study and make some suggestions to further strengthen the claims through revisions. I am summarizing hereafter the main points raised by the three reviewers, which the authors should mostly focus on as their manuscript is revised. In addition, I have appended the original comments to help understand the three specific suggestions.</p><p>1) There is general consensus that the study would benefit from a more extensive characterization of the identity of the ES-derived two classes of MNs. And, additionally, cells made in vitro should be compared to purified endogenous counterparts to more firmly establish their class identity. This is important because the core claims rest on the assumption that the two classes of MNs studied reflect the same classes in vivo. In comments by reviewers 1, 2 and 3 there are suggestions about the experiments that the authors may want to consider to resolve this issue, ideally using single cell RNA sequencing of ES-derived and in vivo purified MNs of the two classes.</p><p>2) There are key questions regarding the expression of SOD1 in the two cell types and how that relates to the phenotypes. It is important to determine if SOD1 is being produced at the same rate in iCrMNs and iSpMNs by examining translation rates. In addition, it is important to establish that insoluble SOD1 increases more dramatically in iSpMNs than iCrMNs after tunicamycin and/or CPA. Is there a way to verify that the proteostasis properties of iCrMNs and SpMNs are truly representative of their primary counterparts?</p><p>3) The authors should clarify how much the SOD1 overexpression and mutation are related to the phenotypes.

While this is needed to obtain neurons that can survive in culture (older neurons would not do so easily), it also brings up the issue that the two neuron types studied are at a different stage of maturation at the time of isolation. Given that SpMN are born earlier than O/TrMNs, is it possible that the differences observed are at least partly due to the fact that one cell type is younger than the other? Would cultures of E13 O/TrMNs (likely still quite viable in culture) give the same results?</p><p>2) How do the authors establish the class identity of the cells that they make from ESCs? Given that there are no single cell profiles of endogenous counterparts and comparisons are not made at the whole transcriptome level (for example by single cell RNAseq), there remain the issue that the cultures may contain cells that are not CrMNs, but rather cells that express a limited number of markers of this class. In addition, the cultures could be heterogenous and reflect different maturation states etc., possibly skewing the results/conclusions. A better characterization of cell identity would address this point.</p><p>With these considerations in mind, the paper is very interesting and on target for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This impressive manuscript by Mazzoni and colleagues reveals an interesting possible explanation underlying the resistance of certain motor neuron subtypes to neurodegeneration in ALS. The authors provide evidence using primary and stem cell-derived spinal and cranial motor neurons to show that cranial motor neurons have a higher proteostatic capacity and more proteasome activity than spinal motor neurons, and that this leads to their ability to tolerate overexpression of mutant SOD1. Overall these findings provide an important conceptual advance for the field and most of the experiments are well-controlled. However, there are a few additional controls that would significantly strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Figure 1 – Although the authors previously published the NIP MN induction protocol (Mazzoni et al., 2013), it does not appear that the NIP-MNs were compared transcriptomically to primary CrMNs. Since much of the current manuscript's conclusions depend on the premise that iCrMNs are representative of CrMNs, it would be helpful to confirm this using RNA seq analysis of ESC-derived iCrMNs, iSpMNs, primary CrMNs, and primary SpMNs. The authors should already have the data for iCrMNs, iSpMNs, and primary SpMNs from their previous manuscript. If it is possible to collect enough primary CrMNs for RNA-seq, this would be a very helpful comparison.</p><p>Figure 3 – It is important to determine if SOD1 is being produced at the same rate in iCrMns and iSpMNs by examining translation rates using ribosome profiling or some other method.</p><p>Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 – One of the interesting points of the paper is that CrMNs and SpMNs may have different proteostasis capacities and different reliance on the proteasome vs. autophagy. The authors suggest that CrMNs have higher proteasomal activity while SpMNs presumably rely more on autophagy activity (or at least more autophagy than proteasome). To verify this, can the authors compare the levels of autophagy between SpMNs and CrMNs using an LC3-mRFP-GFP reporter or a similar assay?</p><p>Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 – The observed results could be explained by the possibility that MG-132 treatment increases autophagy in SpMNs but not CrMNs. The authors should determine if this is true or not.</p><p>Figure 6 and Figure 7 – There are reasons other than more severely impaired proteostasis that could cause tunicamycin or CPA to more profoundly affect iSpMN survival compared to iCrMN survival. The authors should confirm that insoluble SOD1 increases more dramatically in iSpMNs than iCrMNs after tunicamycin and/or CPA.</p><p>Figure 8 – It would greatly strengthen the conclusions if the authors could confirm using lentiviral overexpression or immunostaining of neurons from transgenic SOD1 mice that insoluble SOD1 increases more dramatically in primary SpMN cultures than primary CrMN cultures after tunicamycin, CPA, and MG-132. This would help to verify that the proteostasis properties of iCrMNs and SpMNs are truly representative of their primary counterparts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Mazzoni and colleagues perform a careful and thorough investigation into cell vulnerability in ALS. The parallel use of primary mouse and mouse ES-derived motor neurons adds substantial strength and validates the latter as a valuable tool. First, the authors isolate lumbar spinal motor versus oculomotor neurons and show that SOD1 aggregates are present in the former but not the latter. Isolation of these two populations using an Isl::GFP reporter reveals impaired in vitro survival of the spinal motor neurons. A similar result is observed using iNIL vs iNIP induction of cranial versus spinal motor neurons. Next, isogenic control lines harboring distinct SOD1 mutations are made, and these show similar capacity for differentiations. Compared to the iSpMNs, the ICrMNs have less SOD1 accumulation, particularly, the insoluble form. The authors then show that proteasome inhibition with MG-132 markedly increases the insoluble SOD1 in the SOD1 mutant iCrMNs. This finding is then extended to insoluble ubiquitinated proteins and p62, where the mutation in SOD1 seems less important, and MG-132 again gives a prominent and disproportionate increase in the iCMNs. Next, p62 increase is investigated more closely on cellular level in lumbar motor neurons, both for the induced SOD1 isogenics and primary mouse motor neurons. The iCrMNs are more resistant to Tunicamycin, CPA, and thapsigargin but not Brefeldin A, and a similar finding is shown for primary mouse motor neurons. Unbiased mass spec shows dysregulated 20S core subunits as well as higher proteasomal activity in the iCrMNs. Finally, proteasome activation using PD169316 boosts survival of the CPA-treated but not vehicle-treated iMNs, with the effect reaching significance in the iSpMNs.</p><p>This is an elegant and well-done study, with very nice confirmation between the induced motor neurons and the primary ones. While the authors show markers of resistant brainstem nuclei using the iNIP protocol, the percentages of cells marked by Pho2b and Sim2 are not shown. Some brainstem motor neurons, such as in the hypoglossal nucleus, are vulnerable and severely affected in ALS. Can further characterization of the iCrMN neurons clarify what percentage are oculomotor-like and whether some express markers of motor neurons that are not resistant? This is important because it clarifies a vulnerable vs non-vulnerable effect as opposed to simply a brainstem vs lumbar effect that covaries with vulnerability. Relatedly, is there information in the iSpMNs to compare in terms of lateral vs medial column identity?</p><p>A separate question is how much the SOD1 overexpression and mutation are related to the phenotypes. In the SOD1 results (Figure 3, Figure 4) the effects depend on the SOD1 mutation, whereas in Figure 5 for ubiquitin and p62 the effects largely do not appear to do so. It would be useful to know whether these results (Figure 5C and Figure 5E, Figure 6C, Figure 6F) also do not depend on SOD1 overexpression (ie seen in non-transgenic MNs as well, as mentioned in discussion). This is indirectly addressed in Figure 7 and Figure 9, which appear to use a non-transgenic line (although that does not appear to be clearly stated outside the discussion). Differences in terms of what effects result from SOD1 mutation (or overexpression) vs intrinsic vulnerability of lumbar motor neurons may be relevant to the fairly typical lumbar motor neuron-predominance of SOD1 ALS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44423.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a strong, well-executed and highly impactful study reporting on a novel differential capacity by two classes of motor neurons to maintain a healthy proteasome and thus resist protein accumulation linked to ALS.

In addition, I have appended the original comments to help understand the three specific suggestions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for taking the time and effort to read our work and suggest improvements and are pleased that they find the work to be strong, well executed and highly impactful. While we provide a point-by-point rebuttal below, I would like to first summarize our response to the three primary points highlighted by the reviewers as well as additional new data we have included in the revised manuscript that we believe significantly strengthen the conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>1) We provide single cell RNA-seq data from cultured primary rostral CrMN and SpMN and find a correlation between their gene expression. As expected, the in vitro derived-cells are not identical copies of those found in vivo. However, the cellular response to prostatic stress of ESC-derived motor neurons is predictive of the behavior of embryonically–derived ones. Thus, we believe induced motor neurons are an appropriate system to model that aspect of neuronal biology.</p><p>2) We have measured hSOD1 translation rates in iCrMNs and iSpMNs and found no significant difference.</p><p>3) We have investigated the effect of CPA stress on hSOD1 accumulation. While CPA induced more hSOD1 aggregation in both motor neuron types, iCrMNs still accumulated less insoluble hSOD1 than iSpMNs.</p><p>4) Our data support the conclusion that higher proteasome activity in CrMNs is partially responsible for their resistant phenotype. In the original version, we tested this hypothesis by activating the proteasome with a small molecule. However, small molecules could have off target effects. To test the hypothesis more specifically, we have now over-expressed PSMB5, one of the limiting proteasome subunits in postmitotic iSpMNs, and found improved iSpMN survival to CPA stress. We appreciate the additional time needed to include this additional experiment as we feel it significantly strengthens the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is general consensus that the study would benefit from a more extensive characterization of the identity of the ES-derived two classes of MNs. And, additionally, cells made in vitro should be compared to purified endogenous counterparts to more firmly establish their class identity. This is important because the core claims rest on the assumption that the two classes of MNs studied reflect the same classes in vivo. In comments by reviewers 1, 2 and 3 there are suggestions about the experiments that the authors may want to consider to resolve this issue, ideally using single cell RNA sequencing of ES-derived and in vivo purified MNs of the two classes.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we addressed transcriptomic similarities between ESCderived MNs and primary MNs by single cell RNA sequencing of iCrMNs and iSpMNs cultured for 2, 5 and 7 days and E11.5 primary oculomotor and trochlear motor neurons (O/TrMNs) and SpMNs cultured for 7 days in similar medium.</p><p>Single cell RNA sequencing confirmed that CrMN and SpMN markers are differentially enriched in ESC-derived iCrMNs and iSpMNs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). ESC-derived and primary CrMNs and SpMNs all express motor neuron marker <italic>Isl1</italic>. CrMN fate markers <italic>Phox2a</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> are enriched in iCrMNs and primary O/TrMNs, while SpMN fate markers <italic>Lhx3</italic> and <italic>Mnx1/Hb9</italic> are enriched in iSpMNs and primary SpMNs.</p><p>We compared all the samples together and clustered the cells using all significant principal components shown by T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) plots in Figure 1H and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. The clustering seems to be dominated by two factors: ESC versus primary origin and CrMN versus SpMN fate. About half of ESC-derived Day 5 and 7 iCrMNs clustered close to O/TrMNs on the second dimension, while the other half showed similar expression patterns with Day 5 and 7 iSpMNs. The heterogeneity might be explained by variance in differentiation and maturation speed, as well as in vitro culture stress that constantly selects for cells with higher resilience.</p><p>Principle component analysis (PCA) suggests that PC1 separates in vitro versus in vivo differentiated MNs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and that PC2 separates O/TrMNs versus SpMNs (Figure 1I). Notably, the ESC-derived iCrMNs and iSpMNs cluster toward primary O/TrMNs and SpMNs, respectively, as they mature over time (Figure 1I). Day 7 iCrMNs clustered with primary O/TrMNs in the PC2 dimension.</p><p>In summary, the comparative transcriptome analysis further supports the notion that ESC-derived iCrMNs and iSpMNs resemble molecular features of the ALS-resistant O/TrMNs and ALS-sensitive SpMNs respectively.</p><p>We believe the field should be sincere on the identity of the cells we make and how to use them. The pressure to call ESC-derived cells “identical” to those in vivo is hurting the field by raising unnecessary expectations. As a field we should constantly thrive to improve differentiation outcomes. However, we should embrace differentiation strategies for their strength and be aware of and open about their limitations. Each model system has advantages and disadvantages. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a wonderful model system, but perhaps a poor one to model endometrium-placenta vascularization. Thus, please allow us to be explicit about these ESC-derived cells.</p><p>What these induced motor neurons are:</p><p>Induced CrMN and SpMN (iCrMN and iSpMN) look like neurons and express genes associated with neuronal and motor neuron identity. iCrMNs express <italic>Phox2a, Phox2b</italic> and markers associated with rostral CrMN fate. They lack <italic>Lhx3</italic> and <italic>Hb9</italic>, which are expressed by SpMNs and some more caudal CrMNs. Thus, both iCrMNs and iSpMNs express cardinal markers of cranial and spinal motor neuron fate.</p><p>The iCrMN versus iSpMN approach we take in this manuscript successfully models at least one cellular difference between ALS-resistant and ALS-sensitive motor neurons and suggests higher proteasome activity as a possible mechanism of resistance to ALS induced neurodegeneration. We should note that this might not be the only difference. A recent preprint utilizing a slightly different strategy but also forcing Phox2a expression reports that stem cell-derived cranial motor neurons are more resistant to kainic acid toxicity. We have included this new development in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>What these neuros are not:</p><p>Based on global gene expression profile and the differentiation protocol, neither of these ESC-derived motor neurons are of a unique motor neuron pool identity. This is why we named iCrMNs and iSpMNs as “rostral cranial motor neurons” and “spinal motor neurons”, instead of oculomotor neurons and cervical spinal motor neurons, respectively. We believe iCrMN identity is consistent with rostral CrMN fate but are reluctant to call them oculomotor neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are key questions regarding the expression of SOD1 in the two cell types and how that relates to the phenotypes. It is important to determine if SOD1 is being produced at the same rate in iCrMns and iSpMNs by examining translation rates.</p></disp-quote><p>To measure hSOD1 translation efficiency, we performed polysome profiling in hSOD1 A4V iCrMNs and iSpMNs. Small (40S) and large (60S) ribosome subunits, monosomes (80S) and polysomes are shown as different peaks in the polysome profiles and separated into different fractions accordingly (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B). RNA was extracted from the whole cell lysate and polysome fractions. The ratios between polysome-associated hSOD1 A4V mRNA and whole hSOD1 A4V mRNA were similar between iCrMNs and iSpMNs, which was quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized by ribosomal protein RPL19 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). These data suggest that the hSOD1 transgene is translated at similar rates in iCrMNs and iSpMNs and that the differential accumulation of hSOD1 mutant proteins between them is probably because of differential degradation.</p><p>Additionally, we should note that a more efficient hSOD1 translation is unlikely to explain why iSpMNs contain more insoluble hSOD1 aggregates during maturation. When reducing proteasome activity, iSpMNs revert the trend and accumulate less than iCrMNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it is important to establish that insoluble SOD1 increases more dramatically in iSpMNs than iCrMNs after tunicamycin and/or CPA.</p></disp-quote><p>To test the sensitivity of protein aggregation to additional proteostatic stress in iCrMNs and iSpMNs, we treated the MNs expressing hSOD1 A4V with DMSO or 20 µM CPA from Day 2 to Day 5, similar to the survival assays. The accumulation of hSOD1 A4V was quantified on Day 5 between CPA and DMSO treated cells by western blot (Figure 7—figure supplement 2a).</p><p>CPA treated iCrMNs and iSpMNs accumulated ~3.5-fold more insoluble hSOD1 A4V compared to DMSO treated ones (Figure 7—figure supplement 2B). There was no significant difference between iCrMNs and iSpMNs in terms of increasing hSOD1 accumulation in response to CPA.</p><p>Notably, iCrMNs still accumulated less insoluble hSOD1 A4V than iSpMNs after 3-day 20 µM CPA treatment on Day 5 (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C). Taken together, these data suggest that additional proteostatic stress accelerate the accumulation of insoluble hSOD1 mutant proteins and that iCrMNs maintain the superior capability to deal with misfolding proteins under CPA treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a way to verify that the proteostasis properties of iCrMNs and SpMNs are truly representative of their primary counterparts?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have directly tested if the differential proteostatic properties of iCrMNs and iSpMNs are conserved in primary cultures (Figure 8). iCrMNs, iSpMNs, primary rostral CrMNs (oculomotor and trochlear nuclei), and primary SpMNs were treated with the same CPA and tunicamycin doses. Similar to iCrMNs versus iSpMNs, rostral primary CrMNs survived better than primary SpMNs. Thus, the ESC-derived MNs are representative of their in vivo counterparts.</p><p>Moreover, differential accumulation of hSOD1- and p62-containing aggregates between O/TrMNs and SpMNs in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup>G93A</sup> mutant mice supports the hypothesis that primary rostral CrMNs deal better with ALS-related misfolding proteins (Figure 1A and B, Figure 6D and E).</p><p>Taken together, we first used ALS-associated hSOD1 mutant proteins as an example of ALS-relevant proteostatic stress to reveal the differential proteostatic properties between CrMNs and SpMNs in vitro and in vivo. We then established the inherent differential proteostatic capacity using the non-transgenic ESC-derived and primary MNs, which probably explains why CrMNs are resistant to both familial and sporadic ALS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should clarify how much the SOD1 overexpression and mutation are related to the phenotypes. Differences in terms of what effects result from SOD1 mutation (or overexpression) vs intrinsic vulnerability of lumbar motor neurons may be relevant to the disease.</p></disp-quote><p>The specific effects of SOD1 mutations A4V and G93A are addressed by two results in Figure 3 and Figure 4. As pointed out by reviewer #3, there is differential accumulation of insoluble hSOD1 A4V and G93A but not hSOD1 WT after long-term culture (lower in iCrMNs) and after MG-132 treatment (higher in iCrMNs). The <italic>SOD1</italic><sup>G93A</sup> mutant mice also accumulate less hSOD1 and p62 aggregates in O/TrMNs than in lumbar SpMNs (Figure 1A and B, Figure 6D and E). Thus, hSOD1 carrying ALS mutations behave differently than WT hSOD1.</p><p>The survival assays with CPA and tunicamycin treatment were performed in non-transgenic ESC-derived and primary CrMNs and SpMNs and we have now clarified this in the revised Results section. These data clearly demonstrate that CrMNs are inherently more resistant to proteostatic stress than SpMNs (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Finally, the small molecule (PD169316) (Figure 10D) and genetic (PSMB5) (Figure 10F) rescue of iSpMN sensitivity to CPA were also performed in non-transgenic lines. Thus, sensitivity to proteostatic stress and its rescue are intrinsic motor neuron properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I find the work very interesting and only have some questions about the cellular models used, which I hope the reviewers can address.</p><p>1) In their in vitro cultures of primary cells, both neurons types (O/TrMNs and spMNs) were isolated very early, at E11.5. While this is needed to obtain neurons that can survive in culture (older neurons would not do so easily), it also brings up the issue that the two neuron types studied are at a different stage of maturation at the time of isolation. Given that SpMN are born earlier than O/TrMNs, is it possible that the differences observed are at least partly due to the fact that one cell type is younger than the other? Would cultures of E13 O/TrMNs (likely still quite viable in culture) give the same results?</p></disp-quote><p>We are also aware of this difference of maturation between isolated primary O/TrMNs and SpMNs and agree that it deserves future investigation. Unfortunately, because of technical difficulties of dissection at later stages (changes in MN marker Isl1-GFP transgene expression and dissection difficulties), we are not able to answer this question with the current mice. We believe, however, that our in vivo experiments address some of these concerns. Differential accumulation of hSOD1 and p62 aggregates between O/TrMNs and SpMNs were identified in <italic>SOD1</italic><sup>G93A</sup> mutant mice (Figure 1A and B, Figure 6D and E). Thus, small initial maturation differences should be a minimal contributing factor more than two months after the neurons were born.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How do the authors establish the class identity of the cells that they make from ESCs? Given that there are no single cell profiles of endogenous counterparts and comparisons are not made at the whole transcriptome level (for example by single cell RNAseq), there remain the issue that the cultures may contain cells that are not CrMNs, but rather cells that express a limited number of markers of this class. In addition, the cultures could be heterogenous and reflect different maturation states etc., possibly skewing the results/conclusions. A better characterization of cell identity would address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to further characterize the identity of ESC-derived MNs.

Since much of the current manuscript's conclusions depend on the premise that iCrMNs are representative of CrMNs, it would be helpful to confirm this using RNA seq analysis of ESC-derived iCrMNs, iSpMNs, primary CrMNs, and primary SpMNs. The authors should already have the data for iCrMNs, iSpMNs, and primary SpMNs from their previous manuscript. If it is possible to collect enough primary CrMNs for RNA-seq, this would be a very helpful comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to further characterize the identity of ESC-derived MNs.

The authors suggest that CrMNs have higher proteasomal activity while SpMNs presumably rely more on autophagy activity (or at least more autophagy than proteasome). To verify this, can the authors compare the levels of autophagy between SpMNs and CrMNs using an LC3-mRFP-GFP reporter or a similar assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that SpMNs should rely on a different protein degradation machinery, very likely the autophagy pathway.</p><p>We inhibited autophagy by 3-Methyladenine and Bafilomycin A1 and measured the level of insoluble hSOD1 by western blot.

While the authors show markers of resistant brainstem nuclei using the iNIP protocol, the percentages of cells marked by Pho2b and Sim2 are not shown. Some brainstem motor neurons, such as in the hypoglossal nucleus, are vulnerable and severely affected in ALS. Can further characterization of the iCrMN neurons clarify what percentage are occulomotor-like and whether some express markers of motor neurons that are not resistant? This is important because it clarifies a vulnerable vs non-vulnerable effect as opposed to simply a brainstem vs lumbar effect that covaries with vulnerability. Relatedly, is there information in the iSpMNs to compare in terms of lateral vs medial column identity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to further characterize the identity of ESC-derived MNs.

However, as explained in the answer to the general comment 1 above, iSpMNs do not have a specific rostro-caudal identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A separate question is how much the SOD1 overexpression and mutation are related to the phenotypes. In the SOD1 results (Figures3, Figure 4) the effects depend on the SOD1 mutation, whereas in Figure 5 for ubiquitin and p62 the effects largely do not appear to do so. It would be useful to know whether these results (Figure 5C and Figure 5E, Figure 6C, Figure 6F) also do not depend on SOD1 overexpression (ie seen in non-transgenic MNs as well, as mentioned in discussion). This is indirectly addressed in Figure 7 and Figure 9, which appear to use a non-transgenic line (although that does not appear to be clearly stated outside the discussion). Differences in terms of what effects result from SOD1 mutation (or overexpression) vs intrinsic vulnerability of lumbar motor neurons may be relevant to the fairly typical lumbar motor neuron-predominance of SOD1 ALS.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the general comment 3 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
