We show that Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2) has a key role in regulating myofiber length, as a loss of Abl2 leads to excessively long myofibers in the diaphragm, intercostal and levator auris muscles but not limb muscles. Increased myofiber length is caused by enhanced myoblast proliferation, expanding the pool of myoblasts and leading to increased myoblast fusion. Abl2 acts in myoblasts, but as a consequence of expansion of the diaphragm muscle, the diaphragm central tendon is reduced in size, likely contributing to reduced stamina of <italic>Abl2</italic> mutant mice. Ectopic muscle islands, each composed of myofibers of uniform length and orientation, form within the central tendon of <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice.

This heterogeneity in muscle fiber diameter is initiated during development and regulated throughout life, as muscle fibers adapt their size in response to metabolic demands and neural activity, prompting muscle growth or leading to muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glass, 2003</xref>). Although the mechanisms that control muscle fiber diameter are reasonably well-understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glass, 2003</xref>), the mechanisms that regulate muscle fiber length and ensure a nearly common myofiber length within a muscle, but a wide diversity in length among different muscles, are largely unknown. In principle, the mechanisms for setting muscle fiber length might be regulated by the size of the myoblast pool that is available to fuse, the propensity of myoblasts to fuse, the available space that is set by the positions of fixed skeletal elements, or all of these mechanisms.</p><p>Even less is known about how signaling between muscle and tendon cells influences muscle fiber growth, differentiation and orientation. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that tendon-like cells, pre-positioned at the margins of a muscle, provide guidance cues that direct and orient myotube elongation as well as attachment sites for muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frommer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wayburn and Volk, 2009</xref>). Although there is good evidence that muscle and tendon cells exchange signals to mutually control their differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wayburn and Volk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Volk and VijayRaghavan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004</xref>), far less is known about this process in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kardon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>). As such, it remains possible that muscle fibers provide signals to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 1983</xref>), influence the arrangement and properties of muscle interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathew et al., 2011</xref>) or alter the structure of the extracellular matrix between muscle fibers to ensure a common muscle fiber length and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hauschka and Konigsberg, 1966</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that a loss of Abelson related kinase 2 (Abl2), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, selectively in myoblasts, leads to enhanced myoblast proliferation and an increase in muscle fiber length, consistent with the idea that the size of the myoblast pool has an important influence on muscle fiber length. As a consequence of muscle expansion, the size of tendon is reduced. Moreover, we show that ectopic muscle islands, surrounded by tendon cells, form in <italic>Abl2</italic> heterozygous mice, yet the muscle fibers within these islands are of uniform length and orientation. These findings indicate that pre-positioned tendon cells are not essential to define the length and orientation of myofibers. Because specialized tendon cells form at the ends of these muscle islands, our results raise the possibility that a pioneering myotube induces tendon cells to organize and direct the orientation of later forming myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Abl2 regulates muscle fiber length</title><p>The Abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes Abl1 (c-Abl) and Abl2 (also known as Arg), are widely expressed and crucial mediators of growth factor and adhesion receptors that regulate cell proliferation and cytoskeletal remodeling.

We provide evidence that a loss of Abl2 function in myoblasts leads to enhanced myoblast proliferation and an expansion of the myoblast pool during embryonic development, leading to increased myoblast fusion and elongated muscle fibers.</p><p>It is striking that a loss of Abl2 leads to an increase in muscle length without a hypertrophic increase in muscle fiber diameter. Our in vivo and in vitro data describe an enhancement of myoblast proliferation and fusion during primary/embryonic myogenesis at E13.5 and during secondary/fetal myogenesis at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biressi et al., 2007</xref>), which are developmental stages when myoblasts fuse preferentially to the ends of developing muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang and McLennan, 1995</xref>). This mode of iterative nuclear accrual at ends of developing muscle fibers may favor longitudinal growth of muscle during embryonic development. It is possible that increased myoblast proliferation during early embryonic development favors longitudinal lengthening of muscle fibers rather than an increase in myofiber diameter. In contrast, in adult myofibers, increased satellite cell proliferation may lead to satellite cell fusion all along the myofiber, favoring an increase in muscle fiber diameter and muscle hypertrophy.</p><p>Abl kinases are up-regulated in chronic myeloid leukemia, promoting cell proliferation. Abl2, however, attenuates cell proliferation in solid tumors, suggesting that Abl kinases can negatively or positively regulate proliferation, depending on cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greuber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gil-Henn et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that Abl2 attenuates myoblast proliferation, limiting expansion of the myoblast pool and muscle growth. We do not know what lies upstream of Abl2 in myoblasts to control Abl2 activity, but it seems likely that multiple signals and steps modulate Abl2 activity to regulate myoblast proliferation and muscle growth.</p><p>Muscle precursors migrate to their final destinations using two distinct mechanisms. Body wall muscles, including the intercostal, vertebral, and abdominal muscles, extend and expand to envelop the body as a continuous outgrowth of the myotome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christ et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand-Saberi and Christ, 1999</xref>). In contrast, development of limb and diaphragm muscles requires delamination of muscle precursor cells from the dermomyotome, which engage in long-range migration to their target sites, where they proliferate, differentiate and fuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich, 1999</xref>). Although intercostal and diaphragm muscles develop through non-migratory and migratory mechanisms, respectively, Abl2 has a role in governing muscle length in both muscles, indicating that Abl2 does not act primarily, if at all to regulate myoblast migration.</p><p>Abl2, however, does not regulate muscle fiber length in limb muscles. There is precedence for differing requirements for the development of diaphragm and limb muscles: although both limb and diaphragm muscles are derived from Lbx1-expressing precursors, migration of muscle precursors to the limb, but not the diaphragm, is perturbed in <italic>Lbx1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gross et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the development of diaphragm and limb muscles differ in their requirement for Abl2, as well as Lbx1.</p><p>Further, the role of Abl2 in some but not all muscles may be associated with the location, cellular environment or function of the muscle. Elongated muscle fibers are found in intercostal muscles, which attach to tendons that anchor the muscle to bone. Elongated muscle fibers are also found in muscles that are joined by tendons that interconnect two muscle segments, such as the central tendon of the diaphragm and the midline tendon between right and left levator auris longus muscles. However, muscles that attach to bone by force-transmitting tendons, such as those in the limb, remain unaffected by mutations in <italic>Abl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murchison et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is good evidence that muscle cells provide signals to tendon cells to induce their differentiation. Muscle cells produce Vein, a Neuregulin-like protein, which binds to the EGFR in adjacent tendon cells to mutually promote tendon cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yarnitzky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Volk, 1999</xref>). Activation of the EGFR in tendon cells enhances expression of Stripe and Slit, which signals back to Robo in muscle cells, contributing to muscle-specific tendon attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Volohonsky et al., 2007</xref>). Although there is evidence supporting the idea that muscle and tendon cells signal to one another in vertebrates, these studies have largely focused upon TGF- and FGF-dependent signaling between the developing myotome and the adjacent sclerotome, where muscle is required for tendon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brent et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>). Apart from this early axial signaling system, signaling between muscle and tendon in mammals has been not been fully explored. Unlike the formation of axial tendons, the induction of head and limb tendons does not depend upon muscle, although muscle and muscle contraction play a role in full tendon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaut and Duprez, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We provide evidence that vertebrate muscle cells provide signals that are instructive for tendon cell differentiation, as myotubes that form as islands surrounded by tendon cells, induce tendon cell differentiation at the ends of the muscle fibers. Moreover, the myotubes within these islands are uniform in length and orientation, an unexpected finding if pre-positioned and pre-specialized tendon cells were required to organize muscle length and orientation. Instead, our findings raise the possibility that muscle pioneers, akin to those described in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 1983</xref>) may induce features of tendon cell differentiation, which subsequently lead to reciprocal signaling from tendon cells to muscle and contribute to an arrest of myotube growth, limiting myotube length and organizing the parallel alignment of myotubes.</p><p>Muscle islands are apparent in muscle conditional <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice, indicating that a decrease in Abl2 expression in myoblasts is responsible for formation of the ectopic islands. We do not know whether enhanced myoblast proliferation plays a role in formation of the ectopic muscle islands in <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice. The proliferation rate of <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> myoblasts is intermediate between wild type and <italic>Abl2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> myoblasts, so enhanced proliferation of <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> myoblasts may contribute to the formation of ectopic muscle islands. We also considered the possibility that Abl2 might limit myoblast migratory behavior, preventing promiscuous migration of <italic>Abl2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> myoblasts into the central tendon, but live imaging studies in cell culture failed to detect aberrant migratory behavior of <italic>Abl2</italic> mutant myoblasts (data not shown). In addition, myoblasts that inadvertently migrate into the central tendon domain may normally be eliminated, and this elimination process may be attenuated if Abl2 expression in myoblasts is reduced.</p><p>The ectopic islands were oriented to align with the nearby diaphragm muscle. The oriented alignment of the ectopic muscle islands with the nearby diaphragm muscle raises the possibility that <italic>Abl2</italic> mutant myoblasts, which migrated along the developing myotubes of the diaphragm muscle in a directed manner, aberrantly continued their oriented migration into the central tendon to form the ectopic muscle islands. Alternatively, contraction of the diaphragm muscle, causing oriented deformation of the central tendon, may assist in aligning myotubes in the ectopic islands.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanisms responsible for forming the ectopic islands, the organization of the myotubes within each island reveal mechanisms not previously understood and appreciated for aligning and setting the length of myofibers. Notably, although the muscle islands are enveloped by tendon cells, the myotubes are uniform in length and orientation, demonstrating that pre-positioned, specialized tendon cells are not essential to organize these features of muscle development. Myotubes may signal to one another to establish a common orientation and length. However, our results raise the possibility that specialized tendon cells, once induced by a developing, pioneer myotube, signal back to later arriving myotubes and contribute to their orderly arrangement.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Abl2</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:2653897">MGI:2653897</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Myod iCre</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:014140">IMSR_JAX:014140</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Mck-Cre</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006475">IMSR_JAX:006475</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Pax3 Cre</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005549">IMSR_JAX:005549</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Rosa 26 LacZ</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:003474">IMSR_JAX:003474</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Scx::Cre</td><td valign="bottom">MGI:5317938</td><td valign="bottom">n/a</td><td valign="bottom">Ronen Schweitzer lab</td></tr><tr><td>gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Scx::GFP</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 17497702</td><td valign="bottom">n/a</td><td valign="bottom">Ronen Schweitzer lab</td></tr><tr><td>strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX000664">IMSR_JAX000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Targeting Vector: <break/>Abl2tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</td><td>EUCOMM</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003104">SCR_003104</ext-link></td><td>European Conditional <break/>Mouse Mutagenesis <break/>Program</td></tr><tr><td>cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">C2C12 skeletal muscle cells</td><td valign="bottom">Burden lab/ATCC</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# CRL-1772, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0188">CVCL_0188</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-Abl2</td><td>Proteintech Group</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# 17693–1-AP <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2289025">AB_2289025</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Arg (C-20)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="bottom">Cat# sc-6356 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2221106">AB_2221106</ext-link></td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-β-Actin (13E5)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat #

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Gabrielle Kardon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>An important structure/function characteristic of muscles is their size. Individual myofibers are characterized by their cross-sectional area and their length. While the cross-sectional area of myofibers can change in the adult (e.g. during hypertrophy), their length is generally thought to be fixed. Surprisingly, how myofiber length is regulated is unknown. This paper identifies that the tyrosine protein kinase 2 Abl2 regulates myofiber length in three muscles – diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and levator auris longis. They find that Abl2 acts cell autonomously in myoblasts to negatively regulate levels of proliferation and this, in turn, regulates myofiber length in these muscles. Overall, this is an interesting paper that offers the first insights into how muscle fiber length is controlled on a molecular and cellular level.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide more analysis at the cellular level to explain why fiber length and not diameter of diaphragm myofibers affected.</p><p>Is there an increase in number of muscle progenitors or myoblasts in Abl2-/-mutants, in vitro and in vivo? It is assumed that the increase of muscle fiber length is due to an increase of MyoD+ cell proliferation and then fusion, which is recognized to occur at muscle extremities. Does the increase in the number of MyoD+ cells occur only at the extremities of muscle fibers? Is Abl2 expression regionalized in a subpopulation of myoblasts within muscles. The fusion index should be recalculated as the number of myonuclei over the total number of nuclei.</p><p>2) Do cultures of Abl2-/- give any insights? Are myofibers from cultured Abl2-/- myoblasts longer than controls? in vivo or in vitro, is the number of myonuclei/unit of myofiber length increased or decreased in Abl2-/- myofibers? Is there a difference in the myonuclei distribution along the myofiber? This data should be straightforward to obtain with the myoblast cultures and myofiber preps already in hand. It is important to provide more mechanistic insight into what is different in the longer Abl2-/- myofibers.</p><p>3) Why are only a limited number of muscles affected?</p><p>Why would the increase of myoblast proliferation not occur in limb muscles depleted in Abl2? Is Abl2 only expressed in these muscle regions? Single fiber or myoblast cultures from limb muscles would be more convincing than global length analysis of TA muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>4) Abl2+/- versus Abl2-/- phenotypes: Abl2+/- mice displayed ectopic muscle islands in the tendon region of the diaphragm. Both phenotypes (increased muscle fiber length and ectopic muscle islands) are striking and potentially interesting, albeit difficult to reconcile with each other. There is no obvious attempt in the MS to explain the link between the phenotypes. The authors provide convincing data the islands are not formed from tendon precursors, thus increasing the likelihood it is a myogenic-driven phenotype. It is important to provide more insight at the level of cellular mechanism into the difference between losing one or both copies of Abl2.</p><p>For example, it is not mentioned if there is any change in muscle fiber length or myoblast proliferation in Abl2+/- mice. Are there any ectopic muscles in tendon regions like those in the diaphragm of Abl2+/- mice? The data showing that ectopic muscle islands are also observed in conditional Abl2+/- mice (Pax3 and MyoD + Cells) are important and should be shown and not only mentioned as &quot;data not shown&quot; in the Discussion section.</p><p>5) What happens to Scleraxis expression in axial tendons? Better characterization of the timing of the formation of muscle fibers and somite boundaries would provide critical information for understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to the long muscle fibers. This phenotype of long fibers crossing the borders is reminiscent of that of Notch mutants in zebrafish (Henry et al., 2005). Moreover, in zebrafish, muscles are important for myoseptum development (Tom Schilling's work). How does Scleraxis expression relate to Abl expression in different muscles?</p><p>6) Anatomical variation: The diaphragm muscle is composed of two muscle domains, the costal diaphragm which is a thin sheet of radially arrayed myofibers and the crural diaphragm which is thicker and positioned more posteriorly/dorsally. The authors do not consider these domains or how it may influence the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the dataset. As an example, there is a range of myofiber lengths in control costal and crural muscles by visual inspection. In the abl2 mutants, the range seems to disappear, giving a uniform &quot;long&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); but this isn't reflected in the number of myonuclei added (more of a range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Does this have something to do with these domains and data acquisition? We request that the authors attempt to stratify their data based on the domains or explicitly state the domain they are analyzing in each experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29905.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide more analysis at the cellular level to explain why fiber length and not diameter of diaphragm myofibers affected.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Is there an increase in number of muscle progenitors or myoblasts in Abl2-/-mutants,</italic> in vitro <italic>and</italic> in vivo<italic>?

We have added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and discussed these data in the text. We believe that these data are consistent with the idea that the increased proliferation rate of <italic>abl2</italic> mutant MyoD+ cells, documented in vivoand in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), is accompanied and balanced by rapid fusion of these myoblasts to form syncytial myotubes.</p><p>Our data demonstrate a role for Abl2 in myoblast proliferation and do not support a direct role for Abl2 in myoblast fusion. As such, we do not wish to invoke a novel mechanism for fusion of abl2 mutant myoblasts during development and therefore cited one of several studies (Zhang and McLennan, 1995), demonstrating that myoblast fusion occurs at the growing ends of developing muscle. To determine whether abl2 mutant myoblasts violate this rule and fuse randomly along a developing myotube would be a study in itself and require substantial time and effort, which we believe is not justified.</p><p>We have no reason to suspect that Abl2 expression is restricted to a subpopulation of myoblasts. Moreover, we tested available antibodies to Abl2 by staining wild-type and abl2 mutant cells in culture and found that available antibodies to Abl2 stained abl2 mutant cells and therefore are neither specific for Abl2 nor reliable for identifying Abl2‐expressing cells in tissue.</p><p>We studied primary muscle cultures and not muscle cell lines to measure the fusion index. The fusion index is often calculated by measuring the number of nuclei in myotubes divided by the total number of nuclei in the culture dish. This procedure is meaningful when studying a cell line that contains only myoblasts. However, when studying primary cultures, in which myoblasts and non-muscle cells are nearly equally abundant, including non-muscle cells in this calculation, obfuscates the measure of fusion. Instead, we used a procedure that counts the number of nuclei in myotubes divided by the number of nuclei in myotubes plus myoblasts, marked by MyoD expression, excluding non-muscle cells, which we believe provides a more insightful calculation of myoblast fusion in primary cultures.</p><p>In cell culture, myoblasts fuse promiscuously with myotubes all along their length, and myotubes fuse haphazardly with one another, leading to branched myotubes and myotubes with unusual shapes that do not resemble myotubes found in vivo. We quantified the number of nuclei per myotube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which we believe is a more meaningful assessment of myoblast fusion in cell culture rather than measuring the shape/length of myotubes in vitro.</p><p>We agree that it is important and interesting to know whether the distribution of myonuclei is altered in lengthened, abl2 mutant myofibers. We presented data showing that the myonuclei distribution in lengthened myofibers was not altered: the number of myonuclei/unit of myofiber length was unchanged</p><p>(see graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Do cultures of Abl2-/- give any insights? Are myofibers from cultured Abl2-/- myoblasts longer than controls?</italic> in vivo <italic>or</italic> in vitro<italic>, is the number of myonuclei/unit of myofiber length increased or decreased in Abl2-/- myofibers? Is there a difference in the myonuclei distribution along the myofiber? This data should be straightforward to obtain with the myoblast cultures and myofiber preps already in hand. It is important to provide more mechanistic insight into what is different in the longer Abl2-/- myofibers.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are intrigued that diaphragm, intercostal and levator auris muscles are lengthened, due to increased myoblast proliferation in the absence of Abl2, whereas limb muscle length is unaffected. To determine whether limb muscles had accrued more nuclei but had hypertrophied rather than lengthened, we measured muscle fiber diameter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that the cross-sectional area of limb muscle fibers, like diaphragm muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) was not changed, inconsistent with the idea that limb muscle fibers had hypertrophied and increased in diameter instead of lengthened. We agree that understanding how limb muscle development proceeds in the absence of Abl2 is interesting, but we don’t believe that this knowledge would provide information that is essential to justify the conclusions of this study and would instead extend the study in a new direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why are only a limited number of muscles affected?</p><p>Why would the increase of myoblast proliferation not occur in limb muscles depleted in Abl2?

These findings are consistent with the idea that increased proliferation of abl2 <sup>+/-</sup> myoblasts contributes to the formation of ectopic muscle islands.</p><p>We agree that it is important to include data showing ectopic islands in muscle‐conditional abl2 heterozygous mice. We have now included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>.</p><p>The large and flat central tendon of the diaphragm presents a unique opportunity to visualize the ectopic muscle islands. We are not aware of other muscles that present such a favorable opportunity.</p><p>We provide data showing that ectopic muscle islands are not formed from tendon precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, we analyzed conditional mutant mice (Pax3cre; abl2f/+), which demonstrate that the formation of ectopic muscle islands depends upon the loss of Abl2 from the muscle lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Although it would be interesting to know more about the mechanisms responsible for the formation of the ectopic muscle islands, the conclusions that we draw from the presence and arrangement of the ectopic islands in the diaphragm muscle stand on their own and do not require knowledge of how the islands arose in the first place. Independent of understanding precisely how the muscle islands form, the common length and orientation of the myofibers in the ectopic islands, which are surrounded by tendon cells, excludes certain mechanisms for establishing muscle fiber length and orientation and clearly reveals that tendon differentiation can be controlled by muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Abl2+/- versus Abl2-/- phenotypes: Abl2+/- mice displayed ectopic muscle islands in the tendon region of the diaphragm.

The data showing that ectopic muscle islands are also observed in conditional Abl2+/- mice (Pax3 and MyoD + Cells) are important and should be shown and not only mentioned as &quot;data not shown&quot; in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now presented data showing the stage during development when an increase in muscle fiber length in abl2 mutant mice is first detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What happens to Scleraxis expression in axial tendons? Better characterization of the timing of the formation of muscle fibers and somite boundaries would provide critical information for understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to the long muscle fibers. This phenotype of long fibers crossing the borders is reminiscent of that of Notch mutants in zebrafish (Henry et al., 2005). Moreover, in zebrafish, muscles are important for myoseptum development (Tom Schilling's work). How does Scleraxis expression relate to Abl expression in different muscles?</p></disp-quote><p>We restricted our analysis of the diaphragm muscle to the costal diaphragm muscle, and we have now stated this explicitly in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Anatomical variation: The diaphragm muscle is composed of two muscle domains, the costal diaphragm which is a thin sheet of radially arrayed myofibers and the crural diaphragm which is thicker and positioned more posteriorly/dorsally. The authors do not consider these domains or how it may influence the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the dataset. As an example, there is a range of myofiber lengths in control costal and crural muscles by visual inspection. In the abl2 mutants, the range seems to disappear, giving a uniform &quot;long&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); but this isn't reflected in the number of myonuclei added (more of a range; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Does this have something to do with these domains and data acquisition? We request that the authors attempt to stratify their data based on the domains or explicitly state the domain they are analyzing in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made adjustments to the Figure Legends and supplied additional detail about experimental methods there as well as in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We have also added information to the Materials and methods section, as requested by the reviewers. We believe that the title, “Abelson tyrosine‐protein kinase 2 Regulates Myoblast Proliferation and Controls Muscle Fiber Length”, indicates that Abl2 regulates both myoblast proliferation and muscle fiber length and therefore accurately reflects the data and findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
