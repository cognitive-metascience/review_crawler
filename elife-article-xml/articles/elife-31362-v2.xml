Gata6 is expressed in SMCs and its target genes activation control SMC differentiation. Furthermore, Gata6 is sufficient to promote SMCs differentiation in vivo, and drive preservation of aortic arches that ought to regress.

This separation is contingent upon two critical developmental events: cardiac septation, including division of the outflow tract (OFT) into the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutson and Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirby and Hutson, 2010</xref>); and complex remodeling of the embryonic circulation. In mid embryogenesis, the aortic arches (AAs), five bilaterally symmetric embryonic vessels, traverse the branchial arches and distribute blood from the heart to the dorsal aortae. During remodeling, which in mouse occurs between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E13.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2002</xref>), AA1 and AA2 regress into capillary beds, while asymmetric partial regression of the right-sided vessels leads to AA3-6 being incorporated into the major thoracic arteries (the carotids, aortic arch and subclavian arteries). Failure to separate pulmonary and systemic circulations in this manner results in congenital heart disease characterized by cyanosis, due to the mixing of deoxygenated with oxygenated blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutson and Kirby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keyte and Hutson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>This need for separation and the consequences of cyanosis have made understanding the mechanism(s) of OFT septation and AA remodeling a high priority. In addition to haemodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yashiro et al., 2007</xref>), cardiac neural crest (NC) cells, a subpopulation of the cranial NC, are known to be essential. These cells delaminate from the posterior hindbrain and colonize the branchial arches containing AA3-6 AAs or continue to the OFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Waldo and Kirby, 1993</xref>). At destination, cardiac NC cells differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC), a type of SMC found in the walls of large and medium sized vessels, mainly arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>). Although AAs initially form, ablation of cardiac NC cells in chick or mouse embryos causes their regression and blocks separation of the pulmonary trunk and aorta, leading to severe cyanosis [persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirby and Stewart, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Porras and Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Waldo et al., 1996</xref>). Genetic inactivation has also identified individual factors or pathways required for correct remodelling and separation of the systemic and pulmonary circulation, such as Notch, required to generate SMCs, Tgfß or endothelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">High et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manderfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yanagisawa et al., 1998</xref>); Sema3c and its receptors, Nrp1 and Plxnd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feiner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gitler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawasaki et al., 1999</xref>); or the transcription factor (TF) Gata6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kodo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lepore et al., 2006</xref>). However, at present, the connection between these genetic factors and how cardiac NC cells regulate development and separation of the circulations, and their relative importance versus blood flow is largely unknown.</p><p>By combining microdissection and global transcriptomes analysis, we identify the transcriptional signature underlying NC differentiation to vascular SMCs, uniquely in the aortic arches destined for reorganization into the mature aortic tree. Computing TFs binding levels predicts GATA as main transcriptional regulators in the areas colonized by cardiac NC. We show that Gata6 is sufficient to promote NC differentiation to SMCs in vivo, and also to preserve AAs that normally regress. Our work identifies Gata6 as a crucial regulator of vessel fate and vascular remodelling, both of which are critical for normal development of the mature aortic tree.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of an active SMC differentiation program in the posterior branchial arches and OFT</title><p>To identify the molecular pathways underlying development of the adult great vessels, we examined gene expression in posterior branchial arches (PBA) and OFT at two defined developmental stages, E10.5 (Theiler stage, TS17) and E11.5 (TS19), by RNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The last of the AAs to be formed (sixth) becomes evident at E10.5, and the organization of the branchial AAs is still highly symmetrical at both stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2002</xref>). To identify transcripts specifically enriched in this embryonic area, we compared these datasets with the transcriptome of the second branchial arch (BA2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is similarly colonized by NC, but does not contribute to any of the mature great vessels. Expression profiles display the highest variation across tissues already at the earliest time point examined, shortly after cardiac NC populates the PBA/OFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). After data normalization, we extracted differentially expressed (DE) genes between BA tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). DE genes largely consist of transcripts enriched in the PBA/OFT, and a large fraction of those is shared between early and late stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the contribution of PBA/OFT to the heart circulation, PBA/OFT-enriched transcripts were associated with ‘heart development’, ‘OFT morphogenesis’ and ‘vasculogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On closer inspection, we found that a considerable proportion of genes contained in the gene ontology (GO) ‘heart development’ is associated with AAs and/or OFT phenotypes (36%; 12 out of 33). PBA/OFT-enriched genes also included transcripts highly expressed in the myocardium, owing to the OFT component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Among the transcripts displaying the most significant changes, we found <italic>Acta2</italic>, <italic>Tagln, Cnn1</italic> and <italic>Myocd,</italic> which are highly expressed in SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). <italic>Myocd</italic> encodes for a TF that is sufficient to activate the program of SMC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) and functions in complex with the MADS box TF serum response factor (SRF). Intriguingly, a highly significant fraction of transcripts enriched in PBA/OFT at both developmental stages corresponds to SRF-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In sum, our comparative analysis indicates that a transcriptional program controlling the generation of SMCs is specifically activated in the PBA/OFT.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31362.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global transcriptomes of developing BAs and OFT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In mammals, BA2 (red) hosts aortic arch (AA)2, which regresses, while posterior BAs (PBA, green) host AA3-6, which contribute to the main thoracic arteries.

Therefore, we analyzed the presence of SMCs in the BA region of mouse embryos. BAs are traversed by five embryonic AAs, which connect the heart with the paired dorsal aortae and allow blood circulation throughout the embryo. AAs develop in a rostro-caudal sequence, beginning around E8.5 with formation of the AA1, which traverses BA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waldo and Kirby, 1998</xref>). Within the next two days, AAs 2, 3, 4 and 6 (none of the arteries is named as 5) appear sequentially. Using confocal immunofluorescence analysis, we observed AA2 and AA3 at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We never observed AA1 at this stage, presumably because this vessel, which is the first to form, had already regressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiruma et al., 2002</xref>). One day later (E10.5), we detected well-formed AA3 and AA4, both connected to the aortic sac/OFT and the dorsal aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with the regression process of AA1-2, PECAM staining revealed capillary beds in the BA1-2 instead of the arteries observed in younger embryos. At later stages (E11.0-E11.5), three vessels were present in the BA region, AAs 3, 4 and 6, and regression of the two rostral-most AAs was complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31362.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SMCs are generated exclusively in BA3-6, in a rostro-caudal fashion.</title><p>Confocal analysis of whole mount wild type embryos at E9.5 (<bold>A–C</bold>), E10.5 (<bold>D–F</bold>), E11.0 (<bold>G–I</bold>) and E11.5 (<bold>J–L</bold>) to visualize the endothelial network (PECAM, green) (<bold>A,D,G, J</bold>) and vascular SMCs (SMA, red) (<bold>B, E, H, K</bold>).

At E10.5, we observed the presence of vascular SMCs in AA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), but not in the developing AA4.

These results indicate that the three most posterior AAs (3-6), which will contribute to the mature aortic tree, recruit vascular SMCs to their walls shortly after their initial formation, in a rostro-caudal progression. In contrast, the two most anterior AAs (1-2) never become associated with vascular SMCs. Thus, the distribution of SMCs correlates with vessels selected for preservation. In sum, the process of SMC differentiation specifically takes place in PBA/OFT, consistent with our transcriptomic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of the main regulators of the PBA/OFT transcriptional network</title><p>We devised an unbiased approach to identify main transcription factors (TF) driving gene expression in PBA/OFT.

We analyzed binding of Meis TFs, which regulate development of many diverse organs, including eye, heart and limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capdevila et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mercader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stankunas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Meis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and Meis2 (not shown) are expressed in both BA2 and PBA and bind broadly and to largely overlapping regions in the BAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). Further supporting a widespread role for Meis TFs, Meis occupy up to 60% accessible chromatin in the BA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minoux et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, Meis recognition motifs are overrepresented in cardiac enhancers and TBX5 and NKX2–5oc cupied regions in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luna-Zurita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wamstad et al., 2012</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin et al., 2015</xref>), we found that Meis binding sites in the PBA/OFT are largely shared with BA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Using DiffRep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), we identified 1379 regions at which Meis binding level was highly increased (LogFC ≥3) in the PBA/OFT vs BA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Functional annotation of Meis highly occupied regions in the PBA/OFT revealed association with PBA-specific biological processes, such as ‘regulation of SMC differentiation’, and ‘regulation of vasculature development’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), supporting the validity of this approach. We hypothesized that interrogation of DNA sequence at sites with increased Meis binding signal would reveal the identity of major TFs driving PBA/OFT gene expression. The most highly overrepresented motifs identified by de novo motifs analysis, matched recognition sequences for GATA, Forkhead, HAND and TEAD, together with motifs recognized by Meis and Meis partners Hox/Pbx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The subset of Meis-bound regions containing GATA motifs were associated with ‘blood vessel morphogenesis’, while regions containing Ebox and Forkhead motifs were mainly associated with striated and cardiac muscle development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified 5122 bound regions with fold enrichment (FE) ≥ 10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Gata6 peaks are mostly distributed in intergenic and intronic regions, and a significant percentage overlaps promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed high Gata6 peaks at <italic>Gata6</italic> and <italic>Gata4</italic> loci, which suggest that GATA TFs regulate their own genes in the PBA/OFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Accordingly, in E12.5 heart ventricles, Gata4 binds at the same locations in the <italic>Gata6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2014</xref>). To characterize Gata6 binding, we performed de novo motif discovery on Gata6 peak summits (200nt).

The second top motif was the previously identified recognition sequence for the TEAD family of TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Functional annotation of Gata6 peaks using GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) identified almost exclusively cardiovascular-related GO terms, such as ‘heart and OFT morphogenesis’ and ‘artery morphogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strikingly, and supporting a regulatory activity for Gata6 binding, Gata6 peaks clustered around genes whose mutations cause defects that mirror <italic>Gata6</italic> loss of function phenotypes in the PBA/OFT, such as ‘abnormal outflow tract development’ and ‘heart and great artery attachment’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Next, we asked whether Gata6 binding functions to control gene expression. We first generated independent genome-wide maps of H3K27ac in E11.5 PBA/OFT and BA2 to delineate active enhancers and promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>). Tissue-specific H3K27ac signatures at promoters and distal sites correlated with gene expression differences between PBA/OFT and BA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), confirming that H3K27Ac decorates regions actively engaged in promoting gene expression. Regions marked by H3K27ac in the PBA/OFT overlapped with a large fraction of Gata6 sites (42%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Gata6 sites had the highest degree of overlap with PBA-specific enhancers (820 PBA-specific and 98 BA2-specific regions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which were also significantly associated with DE genes enriched in the PBA/OFT (24.5% of Gata6-bound enhancers were associated with PBA/OFT-enriched genes compared to 11.1% for the entire set of acetylated regions in the PBA; p-value=2.2e-16). These observations suggest that Gata6 binds to distal enhancers and activates gene expression. Notably, active enhancers bound by Gata6 were significantly associated with PBA-enriched genes, involved in ‘vasculature’ and ‘blood vessel development’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>); these include components of the Notch signaling pathway (<italic>Notch1, Hes1</italic> and <italic>Jag1)</italic>, which is essential for cardiac NC differentiation to SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">High et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manderfield et al., 2012</xref>), and the master regulator of SMC differentiation <italic>Myocd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Promoters associated with active enhancers bound by Gata6 were also significantly enriched in GATA and TEAD recognition motifs, further suggesting that the GATA/TEAD module is a regulatory feature of the PBA/OFT transcriptional network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We detected prominent Gata6 peaks at <italic>Jag1</italic> and <italic>Myocd</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>), contained in regions highly acetylated in PBAs but not acetylated in BA2, as expected for active, tissue-specific enhancers (henceforth referred to as <italic>Jag1</italic> Cis Regulatory Element (CRE) one and <italic>Myocd</italic> CRE 1–2; VISTA was reported to drive heart-specific activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Visel et al., 2007</xref>).

Migration of the cardiac NC is a vital requirement for this process. However, how the cardiac NC instructs remodeling and specifies particular AAs for survival has been unclear. Here we identify the TF Gata6 as a crucial regulator of NC differentiation to vascular SMC fates. We find that, in normal embryos, the distribution of Gata6 in the branchial area mirrors colonization by cardiac NC, as it is highly abundant in BAs3-6 and essentially absent from the BAs1-2. Additionally, we show that Gata6 is sufficient both to initiate SMC development and to support the survival of those AAs that are normally not populated by cardiac NC, and regress at early stages of AA reorganization. We propose that Gata6 instructs cardiac NC to generate SMCs, and that the subsequent association of those SMCs with the caudal AAs selects these vessels for reorganization into the mature circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31362.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Gata6-driven SMC differentiation promotes survival of the posterior AAs.</title><p>Gata6 activates <italic>Myocd</italic> and <italic>Jag1</italic> to initiate SMC differentiation in the cardiac NC, migrating to BA3-6.

Positive auto-regulatory loops are a common feature of gene regulatory network. Gata6 occupancy at <italic>Gata6</italic> and <italic>Gata4</italic> loci, together with the high levels of <italic>Gata4, Gata5</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic> transcripts in the PBA/OFT, suggest that GATA TFs regulate their own genes. However the mechanism that initiates and restricts expression of GATA TFs to the cardiac NC is not clear. The BA2 appears to be a non-permissive environment for cardiac fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shenje et al., 2014</xref>). Secondary heart field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly et al., 2001</xref>) progenitor cells only differentiate into cardiac cells when they migrate out of the BA2, or when epithelial-free BA2 cells are grown in vitro, suggesting that signals within the BA2 support the proliferation of cardiac precursor and prevent their differentiation. An intriguing possibility is that the same signals inhibit expression of GATA TFs, which are essential for cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pikkarainen et al., 2004</xref>), in the NC cells that populate the anterior BA2, and block SMC fate.</p><p>Sequence analysis predicted GATA TFs binding at regions with high Meis binding signal in the PBA/OFT. Enrichment of GATA signature motifs at these regions was accompanied by a significantly higher expression of <italic>Gata4, Gata5</italic> and <italic>Gata6</italic> in PBA/OFT relative to BA2. Computing binding levels of general regulators, combined with sequence analysis, is a novel approach which successfully identified tissue-specific instances of combinatorial binding. TFs collaborate in competing with nucleosome to gain access to underlying DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). Increased Meis binding at regions enriched in different binding motifs across the BAs is the highly likely effect of changes in abundance of TFs, resulting in tissue-specific combination of TFs cooperating (directly or indirectly) with Meis for chromatin access. Through annotation of active enhancers and analysis of Gata6 binding in the BAs, we confirm that GATA are critical TFs driving PBA-specific transcription. Active enhancers bound by Gata6 cluster around genes with critical roles in the remodeling of the AAs and the differentiation of SMC, including <italic>Edn1, Tgfb2, Notch1, Jag1, Myocd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">High et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manderfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

However, due to conflicting data, the physiological role of Gata6 in vascular SMC is still unclear. While Gata6 has been suggested to induce and maintain the contractile SMC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), additional studies have questioned a direct role of Gata6 role in the differentiation of vascular SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lepore et al., 2005</xref>). Most importantly, targeted inactivation of <italic>Gata6</italic> in SMCs and in the cranial NC leads to AAs and OFT defects without obvious abnormalities in vascular SMC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lepore et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that ectopic <italic>Gata6</italic> expression in the cranial NC is sufficient to direct differentiation to SMC fates. Our observation that Gata6 functions, at least in part, via activation of <italic>Myocd</italic> and Notch signaling, places Gata6 high upstream in the development of SMCs. Such an early role, possibly at the level of lineage decision, may be difficult to detect in cells that are already differentiated. Compensatory mechanisms can also explain the conflicting results observed. In our transcriptomic analyses enrichment of <italic>Gata6</italic> in PBA/OFT was accompanied by an equally high enrichment of transcripts encoding for other GATA family members, <italic>Gata4 and Gata5</italic>.

How does Gata6 support survival of these vessels? A large body of evidence indicates a striking correlation between the presence of SMCs and the fate of the AAs. During normal embryonic development vessels that will be retained, and later incorporated into the mature circulation (AA3-6), become associated with SMCs, while vessels that regress (AA1-2) do not. This correlation extends to a number of experimental conditions affecting normal remodeling of the AAs. For instance, in <italic>Edn1</italic> and <italic>Ednra</italic> mutant embryos, AA2s form correctly, but fail to regress and are wrapped by SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013b</xref>). Similarly, we have shown here that forced Gata6 expression in BA2 NC cells promote AA2 survival and that this active vessel is also associated with SMCs. Conversely, in <italic>Hoxa3</italic> null mutant embryos AA3 fail to recruit SMCs and exhibit bilateral degeneration by E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kameda, 2009</xref>). Likewise, in NC- ablated chick embryos AA3 formed normally, but became progressively more misshapen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Waldo et al., 1996</xref>). In embryos with right-sided aortic arch (in which right, rather than left, AA4-6 are selected for reorganization into the arch of the aorta and the ductus arteriosus), the distribution of SMCs changed to follow the mature fate of each artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, SMCs specifically associate with vessels selected for preservation and subsequent incorporation into the mature heart circulation. In this study, we show that preservation of AA2 is associated with ectopic SMCs in BA2. We cannot entirely exclude that development of SMCs is secondary to the stabilization of AA2 induced by Gata6. However, we observed ectopic SMCs in all embryos expressing Gata6, including the ones where the AA2 regressed as in wild-type embryos, suggesting that the primary effect of Gata6 ectopic expression consists in SMCs development, and that SMCs subsequently promote maturation and stabilization of the vessels. Recruitment of mural cells is an essential step in the maturation of blood vessels. Mural cells form a muscular wall, which protect endothelium-lined vessels against rupture or regression. They also stabilize nascent vessels by suppressing endothelial proliferation and migration and stimulating the production of extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jain, 2003</xref>). Indeed, blocking the interaction of mural cells with endothelial cells results in loss of vessels integrity and excessive regression of the retina vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benjamin et al., 1998</xref>). Together, these observations support a model in which association of vascular SMCs with the wall of the AAs is a major determinant of the physiological preservation of the posterior AAs (and its absence of the regression of anterior AAs). SMCs form the tunica media, which acts to support vessel integrity under hemodynamic load and is especially critical for the major arteries (the vessels that derive from the AAs). Consistently, the availability of SMCs and their association with the AAs could act as a major determinant in selecting those vessels that will be reorganized into the mature aortic tree.</p><p>Changes in blood flow lead to asymmetric remodelling of the embryonic circulation, and regression of right AA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yashiro et al., 2007</xref>). We cannot exclude a contribution of flow changes (possibly caused by the rapid growth of the head region) to the regression of the anterior AAs. Nevertheless, our results support a model in which activation of a regionally restricted transcriptional program, controlled by Gata6, determines the survival of posterior AAs and their incorporation into the mature circulation. By extension, our findings demonstrate that transcriptional control is a major determinant in selecting which embryonic vessels form the mature circulation, independently from blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yashiro et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources table</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mouse CD1</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">University of Manchester Mouse Facility</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">zebrafish</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">University of Massachusetts Medical Center zebrafish Facility</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-PECAM-1 (rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BD Pharmigen</td><td valign="top">BD Pharmigen:550274</td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-actin, α-SMA, Cy3 conjugated (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich: C6198</td><td valign="top">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-rat IgG Alexa 488-conjugated (goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Molecular probes</td><td valign="top">Molecular probes: A-11006</td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Gata6 (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell signalling</td><td valign="top">Cel signalling: 5851</td><td valign="top">IF: (1:1000); ChIP: (5 μg)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Meis1/2 (goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz: sc-10599X</td><td valign="top">ChIP: (5 μg)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-H3K27ac (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Abcam: ab4729</td><td valign="top">ChIP: (5 μg)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Minitol2-GwB-zgata2-GFP-48</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Provided by JL Skarmeta</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Myocd-CRE2</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Myocd-CRE1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Jag1-CRE1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Myocd-CRE2mut</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Myocd-CRE1mut</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Jag1-CRE1mut</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Gata6 cDNA</td><td valign="top">Origene</td><td valign="top">MC219384</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">a2::Gata6</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Meis ISH probe</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Provided by D.

Embryos were recovered at E10.5, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and taken to methanol through a graded methanol PBT (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) series and stored at −20°C until further processed for imaging. For gene expression analysis, embryos were isolated at E10.5 and BA2 were dissected from individual embryos and snap frozen in dry ice. RNA was extracted from individual BA2 pairs using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen), transcribed into cDNA and analysed using StepOnePlus Real_Time PCR Systems (Life Technologies) and PrimerBank primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spandidos et al., 2010</xref>). To compute the statistical significance of the qPCR data we used Zscore transformation. Zscores were calculated by subtracting the average of 2<sup>-<bold>ΔΔ</bold>Ct</sup> values of each gene in the WT from the 2<sup>-<bold>ΔΔ</bold>Ct</sup> value of the corresponding gene in the transgenic, and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of all 2<sup>-<bold>ΔΔ</bold>Ct</sup> values for the gene in WT. The Zscores thus obtained were converted into pvalues using the Rpackage <italic>pnorm</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Generation of zebrafish transgenic embryos</title><p>Embryos and adults zebrafish were maintained under standard laboratory conditions. Enhancers were amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the primers (listed in Key resources table), cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO vector (Life Technologies) and recombined using the Gateway system (Life Technologies) to an enhancer test vector that includes a strong midbrain enhancer (Minitol2-GwB-zgata2-GFP-48, a kind gift from JL Skarmeta) as an internal control. The mutant enhancers were generated by Genscript in a pUC57 vector, PCR amplified and cloned into Minitol2-GwB-zgata2-GFP-48 as described above. Zebrafish embryos were collected from natural spawning. The plasmid DNA was injected into the cytoplasm of embryos at the one-cell stage. Injected embryos were visualized at 48 hr post fertilization using a Leica fluorescent stereomicroscope. Fisher Exact test was performed to test the changes in activity of the wildtype and mutant enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ChIP-seq and downstream analyses</title><p>CD1 mice were time-mated to obtain branchial arches and OFT from E115 embryos. ChIP-seq has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donaldson et al., 2012</xref>). The antibodies used were: Gata6 (Cell Signaling, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10705521">AB_10705521</ext-link>), Meis (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2143020">AB_2143020</ext-link>) and H3K27ac (Abcam, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2143020">AB_2143020</ext-link>). Following Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), DNA libraries were constructed using the TruSeq ChIP Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc.). The final purified product was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument. For histone ChIP-seq, single-end reads were trimmed to 50 base pairs (bp) and mapped to mouse reference sequence (mm9/NCBI37) using Bowtie v1.0.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476">SCR_005476</ext-link>). Peak calling was done using MACS2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013291">SCR_013291</ext-link>). For Gata6 and Meis ChIP-seq, read pairs (R1 and R2) were filtered using Trimmomatic v0.32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011848">SCR_011848</ext-link>) using paired-end mode, to remove adapters, and truncated reads (3') with a base sequence quality of &lt;Q20. Filtered reads &lt;50 bp were removed. Filtered paired reads were mapped to mouse reference sequence (mm9/NCBI37) using Bowtie2 v2.2.3 with default parameters. Mapped paired-reads were filtered with 'samtools' v0.1.19, to remove reads with mapping quality &lt;Q30 and discordant pairs (i.e. incorrect orientation and/or &gt; 500 bp apart). Peak calling was done using MACS 2 v2.1.0. Binding regions were reported with a minimum q-value of 0.05. For all ChIP-seq only paired reads belonging to chromosomes 1–19, X and Y were used in downstream analyses. Narrow peaks (TF ChIP-seq) were filtered using FE ≥ 10. Each experiment was performed in duplicate; for H3K27Ac and Meis ChIP-seq, two replicates were intersected and peaks present in both replicates were used in downstream analyses. For Gata6 replicate 1 was used for downstream analysis; replicate 2 resulted in fewer binding regions with FE ≥ 10 (=693), which were almost entirely contained in replicate 1 (97%). Details of all ChIP-seq experiments (e.g. number of reads, etc) are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. ChIP-seq peaks were associated to genes using GREAT (version 2.0.2; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005807">SCR_005807</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://great.stanford.edu/">http://great.stanford.edu/</ext-link>) and the ‘basal plus extension’ association rule.

Meis ChIP-seq experiments in PBA/OFT and BA2 (binding locations) were compared using a 200 nt sliding window. Regions with logFC ≥3 binding in PBA versus BA2 were selected and intersected with Meis ChIP-seq 200nt summits in PBA, FE ≥ 10, for de novo motif discovery using HOMER. The workflow is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.</p><p>Heatmaps for Gata6 and H3K27ac peaks in PBA/OFT and BA2 were generated using the histogram matrix produced by ‘<italic>annotatePeaks’</italic> module of HOMER package and an R script. For each dataset, peaks were extended to 5 kb from the summit in each direction. The analysis of gene annotation enrichment was performed using GREAT and the ‘basal plus extension’ association rules. The ratio of the H3K27ac signal for up and down regulated gene in PBA/OFT and BA2 was computed and plotted against the ratio of their corresponding gene expression values (FPKM) using the RNA-seq data. H3K27ac signals for all DE genes were represented by the average RPM (reads per million mapped reads) values of all peaks annotated to the respective gene. For all upregulated (or downregulated) genes, average RPM of their associated regions in PBA (or BA2) were divided by the average RPM values of the corresponding regions in BA2 (or PBA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-seq and downstream analyses</title><p>Branchial arches and OFT were dissected and snap frozen in dry ice. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Life Technologies), pooling 3–5 pairs of BAs for each sample. Embryos with 38–39 (TS17) and 48–50 somites (TS19) were used for E10.5 and E11.5 time points, respectively. RNA-seq was performed in duplicate and the quality of duplicates assessed using PCA. Library preparation of samples was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Fastq files for each tissue were mapped against the mouse genome (mm9) using the spliced aligner Tophat (v2.1.0, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013035">SCR_013035</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2013a</xref>) with default parameter settings. rRNA transcripts were removed from the mapped bam files.

FPKM values were used for the correlation plot to assess the global expression profile. The raw counts from the cuffdiff were subsequently used to quantify the differential expression levels for genes using the package edgeR (v3.12.1; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012802">SCR_012802</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Multiple testing correction was done using the R package qvalue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Storey et al., 2015</xref>). LogFC of the genes was plotted against their log10 (qvalues) as a volcano plot to give an overview of significant DE genes. Hierarchical clustering of different tissues at the two time points was performed using log<sub>2</sub> transformed CPM values and heatmaps plotted using the R package hclust and heatmap2.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have elected to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the full reviews, appended below, the reviewers find your paper very interesting and potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they also raised many concerns that would need to be dealt with for the manuscript to be considered further. Because <italic>eLife</italic> has a policy that papers are only considered for revision if they can be revised within a two month time-frame. The consensus was that the required changes would take considerably longer. Therefore, we cannot accept the paper at this time but would encourage you to make the required changes and submit a new paper that addresses the reviewers' comments. We would then make every effort to return the paper to the same reviewers. I hope you find the reviews helpful in revising the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Losa et al. describes a transcriptional program that is driven by GATA-6 and instructs the remodeling of the arterial tree, as indicated in the title. The results show that the neural crest cells differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells only around aortic arches that are going to survive and reorganize. This process is driven by the transcriptional program driven by GATA-6.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper that however suffers from some bias that are not necessarily introduced by the AA, but are present in most of the literature on Chipseq and similar technologies. However these bias do not affect the final conclusions of the manuscript nor the results of the reported experiments, I feel. However, I believe that they should be taken care of. The fact that several other AA draw conclusions in a certain way does not mean that their conclusion is correct.</p><p>I have the following observations.a) The authors have used Meis1 binding sites to detect tissue-specific combinatorial TF occupancy. They should more carefully explain the basis of this choice.</p><p>b) The AA use data-base consensus sequences to identify, for example, Meis1 binding sites. In particular they use a six bp consensus. This is not correct. Indeed, this consensus is used by other transcription factors of the same family and, in particular, by the Pbx1-Meis1 transcription dimer. This dimer, however, also binds to the same consensus that the AA identify as Hox-Pbx. This is not a mistake as this binding site indeed binds ALSO Hox-Pbx. However, the AA's choices may in part bias the results on the identification of other TF, or at least of their selectivity.</p><p>I don't believe that these problems affect the results presented in the paper. However, the literature, in particular the data banks, are too full of ill-conceived data, like those on some consensus binding sites. The AA do not mention wherefrom they obtain the used consensus sites. I stress the importance of the use of the data obtained in actual experiments rather than those from data banks.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Losa et al. provided evidence for the identification of a GATA transcriptional program in posterior branchial arch tissues that is required for the survival and reorganization of aortic arches. Analysis of ChIP-seq data allows the characterization of GATA6 peaks at the jag1 and Myocd loci. The authors hypothesize that regulation of these genes would promote development of the aortic arches into mature bloods vessels.</p><p>In general, this study is an interesting investigation combining ChIP-seq data and in vivo validations. This is interesting because GATA6 is a critical factor for cardiovascular development and that remodeling of branchial aortic arches is still unclear. Yet, I remain unconvinced as to the role of GATA6-Jag1/Myocd in the branchial arches could regulate the survival and reorganization of these tissues. While, the regulation of Jag1 and Myocd by GATA6 is likely, the mechanistic insights from this paper remain incomplete and could benefit from a more expanded analysis.</p><p>1) Rostro-caudal progression of branchial arches depends on a developmental timing of the embryogenesis. The choice of developmental stages E10.5 and E11.5 for a comparative analysis does not allow a perfect differential study.

However, several other transcripts expressed in myocardium are highly enriched, which could reflect the presence of OFT in their comparative analysis.

Yashiro et al. (2007) have demonstrated that blood pressure is responsible for remodeling of the great arteries. The authors should discuss how haemodynamics could influence genetic program during the formation of aortic arches.</p><p>4) The use of Meis binding to detect tissue-specific is intriguing.

It does not seem that this mechanism was involved in the persistence of the AA2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very nicely presented paper that uses a combination of embryo imaging, transcriptome analysis, ChIP-seq analysis and in vivo mutagenesis (mouse and fish) to identify a critical role for Gata6 in controlling smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation from neural crest cells to support the developing posterior arch arteries. Importantly the authors demonstrate that it is the recruitment of these SMC that is crucial for the maintenance of the posterior arch arteries so that they can persist and remodel into the aortic arch arteries, whereas the anterior arches, without recruitment of SMC, are able to regress. Forced expression of Gata6 in Hox-expressing neural crest cells causes the anterior arch arteries to persist and become invested in SMC.</p><p>The sequencing and bioinformatics analysis all appears to have been conducted to a very high standard.</p><p>There are some considerations, however, with the embryo work that need to be addressed.</p><p>The development of the arch arteries (AA) in the mouse is a rapid process with the formation and regression of the first 2 AA occurring within the E9.5 stage, and the remodelling stage occurring during E11.5.

This is conventionally done by somite counting and should be achievable from the images already acquired. The authors should also state how well stage-matched the embryos are within the experimental groups, and this should be done for all experiments where embryos are used (immunostaining and sequencing). It is well known that embryos from the same litter can be at different stages of development as determined by somite number.</p><p>Only whole-mount images of stained embryos (immuno and in situ) are presented. Although the images are of high quality it is not always obvious which tissue type or layer is being stained. Confirmation can only be achieved through double immunostaining of sections, or sectioning of the in situ stained embryos. This would clarify the location of the cells stained and give confidence to the conclusions drawn from these images. In particular this would be useful for the Gata6/SMA stained embryos shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref> as it is not clear in which cells Gata6 is expressed in the 4th AA. If it is not smooth muscle cells, could it be in NCC? Can this be demonstrated? Would using an alternative antibody, e.g. SM22alpha, label SMC around the 4th PAA at this stage?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A tissue-specific, Gata6-driven transcriptional program instructs remodeling of the mature arterial tree&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Using several embryonic species, the authors conclude that preservation of some (not all) embryonic vessels results from differentiation of neural crest cells into smooth muscle cells around those vessels that are due to be preserved and reorganized. They identify Gata 6 as crucial in this process. Gata 6 is expressed in smooth muscle cells and drives their differentiation through MyoCD and Jag1. They also identify Meis1 as an important player in the process since it allows Gata 6 binding through a chromatin effect.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs some rewriting as it is difficult to read because the &quot;real&quot; ChIP-seq peaks cannot be derived from data with a threshold q&lt;0.05 which is not sufficiently stringent compared to papers using comparable techniques. For example, this results in the identification, of 50,000 Meis1 peaks whereas, using a more stringent threshold one gets 5,000. In the end, the authors only use those peaks and genes which have a high fold enrichment. Are the conclusions based on &quot;all&quot; peaks or only on the subset with high fold enrichment? The authors should clarify this and are encouraged to reevaluate their data using higher stringency.</p><p>2) The reader needs a clearer view of the actual data. A table stating the total number of reads, number of identified peaks (or reads), statistical thresholds, should be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31362.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] This is a very interesting paper that however suffers from some bias that are not necessarily introduced by the AA, but are present in most of the literature on Chipseq and similar technologies.

Based on this phenomenon, or ‘collaborative DNA binding’, we expect binding of TFs to DNA to become more efficient (i.e. higher binding levels) in the event of combinatorial binding. We would also expect combinatorial binding (and the binding motifs recognized) to reflect concentration of TFs in the nucleus, i.e. to be tissue-specific. Based on the above, changes in the binding levels of any TF across multiple tissues (provided the TF of choice is present in multiple tissues), could be used as ‘sensors’ to detect tissue-specific instances of TF combinatorial occupancy. Meis is expressed in both BA2 and PBA. Most importantly, Meis binding is very widespread (Meis TFs bind to tens of thousands of regions) and lends itself very well to the interrogation of a large portion of the genome.</p><p>We have added a few explanatory sentences to the Results section (subsection “3. Identification of the main regulators of the PBA/OFT transcriptional network”, first paragraph), to explain this approach. To support the choice of Meis as a widespread ‘sensor’ for collaborative binding, we analysed ATAC-seq data obtained from E10.5 BA2. We found an extensive overlap between Meis binding and ATAC-seq, with Meis occupying 60% of accessible chromatin regions in the BA2. This overlap is quite remarkable when considering the different experimental approaches used (ATAC-seq vs Meis ChIP-seq) and the different embryonic stage (E10.5 vs E11.5).

As part of the rostro-caudal progression mentioned by the reviewer, new AAs are being formed posteriorly. The area corresponding to the PBAs changes over time, with the addition of new arteries from E9.5 until E10.5. Specifically, AA4 and AA6 appear at E10.0 and E10.5 respectively. These changes in the PBA tissues are not ideal for the BA2/PBA comparison (whose main aim is to identify transcriptional changes between NC-colonized areas where vessels regress to NC-colonized areas where vessels persist). Taking this into account, we decided to use E10.5 as the earliest time stage, because the PBA is ‘complete’, and E11.5 as the latest stage, because shortly after (E12.0) the aortic arches lose their left-right symmetrical organization. To take into account rostro-caudal progression we compared late PBA (E11.5) to early BA2 (E10.5), but this did not change the results, presumably because differences are already established at the earliest time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors comment variation of transcripts expressed in SMCs.

First, we calculated the co-occurrence of TEAD and GATA motifs in Gata6 peaks. We found that the occurrence of TEAD and GATA (most Gata peaks contain a GATA motif) is much more frequent than expected by chance (pval&lt;e-39, see table below) and suggests that TEAD and GATA may indeed bind together in this embryonic area. Within Gata peaks, the average distance of the GATA-TEAD motifs is about 40nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Gata6 peaks, containing GATA and TEAD motifs, cluster around genes involved in heart valve development and import of nuclear proteins, most notably SMAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We also found that several genes essential for aortic arch development (e.g. Bmps, SMAD, Jag1) are associated to Gata6 peaks containing GATA-TEAD motifs. While these observations are interesting, and suggestive of a functional binding interaction, their significance in the context of aortic arch development remains unclear. A rigorous characterization of the GATA/TEAD network would require in vivo binding of TEAD in the same (or a closely related) embryonic tissue as GATA. More specifically, because Gata6 peaks containing GATA-TEAD motifs do not map to the enhancers analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, we feel that, within the current Results section, this additional analysis may seem a bit incongruous. For the reasons above, we would prefer not to include this analysis in the new version of the manuscript. We have slightly modified the TEAD-related section in the Discussion (subsection “GATA TFs and control of vascular SMCs development”) to stress the importance of analyzing in vivo TEAD binding to reach clear conclusions. For the same reasons, we have removed TEAD from the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31362-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31362-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>Frequencies of co-occurring Gata:TEAD motifs in Gata6 peaks</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors used zebrafish to validate the Cis Regulatory Element identified in Myocd and jag1 loci.

We measured transgenes’ activities in hundreds of embryos to generate robust, statistically significant results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In order to do this, we generated transient transgenic embryos and scored the same primarily injected animals for GFP activity (driven by the wild-type and mutant Jag1 and Myocd enhancers) in the heart/OFT. The heart/OFT is partly related to the PBA/OFT and, when analyzing many embryos, GFP signal is easier and more consistent to score as positive in the heart/OFT compared to vessels.</p><p>Because transient transgenesis is characterized by mosaic expression of the transgene, a careful investigation of the transgene expression pattern would require establishing stable lines.

We have chosen to use a gain of function system to address this request and quantified the levels of Jag1 and Myocd transcripts in transgenic embryos overexpressing Gata6 in the BA2. We generated new a2-Gata6 transgenic embryos, isolated BA2 from individual embryos, extracted RNA and quantified transcripts using qPCR. We found a significant increase in Myocd and Jag1 transcripts in the BA2 of all embryos overexpressing Gata6 compared to wild-type. The increase in Jag1 and Myocd levels, following Gata6 overexpression in BA2, reflect their differential expression in PBA versus BA2. Specifically, Jag1, whose levels are around 3 times higher in PBA vs BA2, is upregulated around 2 fold in transgenic embryos. Myocd transcript levels, which are over 50 fold higher in PBA versus BA2, are generally increased to much higher levels in transgenic embryos. The expression variability across transgenic embryos (relative to wild-type embryos) is consistent with each embryo having an independent transgene integration site. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>We believe that upregulation of Jag1 and Myocd transcripts in response to Gata6 overexpression, together with Gata6 binding at functional enhancers within Myocd and Jag1 loci and the requirement of intact GATA motifs for enhancers’ activity, conclusively establishes Jag1 and Myocd as Gata6 direct targets.</p><p>We also used the same experiment to quantify the expression of vascular SMC-specific markers in the BA2 of transgenic embryos. Notably, the 3 transgenic embryos (2-3-4), which displayed blood in the BA2, a sign of a patent artery, had significantly higher levels of Acta2, Cnn1 and Tagln1 in the BA2 relative to wild-type, while embryo 1 (which did not show blood in the BA2 and presumably had no ectopic artery) showed similar levels of these transcripts to wild-type embryos. These data provide additional support to the ectopic differentiation of SMC in the BA2 of a2-Gata6 embryos and complete the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Regarding point 8, we have serious reservations that Gata6 mutants would not conclusively address the functional link between Gata6 and Myocd and Jag1 genes.

The relatively ‘normal’ process of vascular SMC differentiation in these mutants is likely to reflect relatively healthy levels of its upstream regulators, i.e. Jag1 and Myocd.

Theiler stages and somite numbers added to Materials and methods section (subsection “RNA-seq and downstream analyses”).</p><p>Confocal analysis of AAs development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): somite numbers added to figure legend.</p><p>Gata6 and Gata6/SMA Immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>): somite numbers added to figure legend.</p><p>Confocal and expression analysis of transgenic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>): Embryos overexpressing Gata6 were obtained from two separate injections, the first resulting in embryos with &gt; 32 somites, the second resulting in older embryos (&gt;38 somites). In all cases embryos were too advanced to display a wild-type AA2 artery. This has been added to the figure legend.</p><p>The only experiments where somites numbers are not available are ChIP-seq. Careful selection or recording of developmental stages is impractical for these experiments, which require a high number of embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only whole-mount images of stained embryos (immuno and in situ) are presented. Although the images are of high quality it is not always obvious which tissue type or layer is being stained. Confirmation can only be achieved through double immunostaining of sections, or sectioning of the in situ stained embryos. This would clarify the location of the cells stained and give confidence to the conclusions drawn from these images. In particular this would be useful for the Gata6/SMA stained embryos shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-I</xref> as it is not clear in which cells Gata6 is expressed in the 4th AA. If it is not smooth muscle cells, could it be in NCC? Can this be demonstrated? Would using an alternative antibody, e.g. SM22alpha, label SMC around the 4th PAA at this stage?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the location of the cells stained, we have added double immunostaining on section, using Gata6 and α-SMA antibodies (3I). The picture shows SMA-positive cells surrounding AA3, and localization of SMA to Gata6-expressing cells.</p><p>In addition we have added an individual zstack from confocal analysis (3H), which shows the presence of differentiating SMC (SMA-positive) in the proximal region of BA4, in Gata6-positive areas.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs some rewriting as it is difficult to read because the &quot;real&quot; ChIP-seq peaks cannot be derived from data with a threshold q&lt;0.05 which is not sufficiently stringent compared to papers using comparable techniques. For example, this results in the identification, of 50,000 Meis1 peaks whereas, using a more stringent threshold one gets 5,000. In the end, the authors only use those peaks and genes which have a high fold enrichment. Are the conclusions based on &quot;all&quot; peaks or only on the subset with high fold enrichment? The authors should clarify this and are encouraged to reevaluate their data using higher stringency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify these issues.</p><p>As correctly mentioned by the reviewers, we have not used all peaks for downstream analyses, but only high confidence peaks with fold enrichment (FE) values higher than 10. This resulted in the elimination of a large fraction of peaks detected by MACS2. More specifically, in addition to q-value &lt; 0.05, which is MACS2 default cutoff to call significant regions, we have applied an additional stringent cutoff of FE ≥10 to all transcription factors ChIP-seq, i.e. to ‘narrow’ peaks. Additionally, for Meis ChIP-seq downstream analysis, we have used peaks FE≥10, which were present in both replicates.</p><p>As a FE≥10 cutoff is too stringent for ‘broad’ peaks, for histone ChIP-seq (whose peaks are wider and flatter because of nucleosome distribution on chromatin), we selected peaks present in both replicates for downstream analysis.</p><p>One of the standards prior to peak calling is to ensure that the IP experiment contains more than 10 million aligned short reads, and the newly added table (see point below) shows that all ChIP experiments fulfil this pre-requirement. The other standard measurement of the quality of peaks detected in transcription factors ChIP-seq experiments is motif search. For both Meis and GATA ChIP-seq, Homer motif search highlighted a main motif with high <italic>p</italic>-value, and detected the main motif in most of the binding regions.</p><p>To clarify how peaks were selected for downstream analysis, we have enclosed a diagrammatic figure, which highlights the selection of FE≥10 as a step of the workflow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> in the submission). In addition, we have made the following changes to the manuscript (highlighted in the manuscript’s text):</p><p>1) Materials and methods: Narrow peaks (TF ChIP-seq) were filtered using FE≥10.
