plays a crucial role in this process. However, how alternative fate genes are lineage-specifically silenced is unclear. We studied Ultrabithorax (Ubx), a multi-lineage transcription factor of the Hox class, in two tissue lineages using sorted nuclei and interfered with Ubx in mesodermal cells. We find that depletion of Ubx leads to the de-repression of genes normally expressed in other lineages. Ubx silences expression of alternative fate genes by retaining the Polycomb Group protein Pleiohomeotic at Ubx targeted genomic regions, thereby stabilizing repressive chromatin marks in a lineage-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that Ubx stabilizes lineage choice by suppressing the multipotency encoded in the genome via its interaction with Pho. This mechanism may explain why the Hox code is maintained throughout the lifecycle, since it could set a block to transdifferentiation in adult cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hox</kwd><kwd>lineage development</kwd><kwd>alternative fate repression</kwd><kwd>cellular plasticity</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd><kwd>deGradFP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO 844 8/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lohmann</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx) represses alternative gene programs during lineage development by lineage-specific Polycomb protein complex retention at Ubx-targeted chromatin sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular animals owe their complexity to their capacity to produce and maintain different lineages composed of multiple cell types that share virtually the same genomic DNA. Such complexity requires a tight regulation of gene expression to unambiguously specify and constrain the developmental path taken by cells within and between different lineages. Cell fates are controlled by networks of transcription factors (TFs) that act in the context of the genomic chromatin state to activate transcriptional programs realizing the distinct properties of cells of a given lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hobert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). The forced expression of TFs expressed only in one lineage like Myoblast Determination Protein (MyoD), which is sufficient to alter cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tapscott et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weintraub et al., 1989</xref>), showed that lineage-restricted TFs can act as major lineage switches by activating lineage-specific transcriptional programs. However, recent profiling experiments revealed that global gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes are imperfect even in MyoD reprogrammed cells, showing that these highly potent reprogramming TFs cannot completely erase the original cell or lineage fate and unequivocally induce the new one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Manandhar et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, lineage choice does not only involve the activation of one lineage-specific transcriptional program but also the repression of the programs of all alternative lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kutejova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mall et al., 2017</xref>), a regulatory wiring that needs to be faithfully accomplished in all the different lineages. Although lineage-restricted TFs could in principle fulfil this function, it would ask for a highly complex regulatory architecture. On the other hand, TFs expressed in multiple/all lineages with a rather promiscuous binding behaviour would dramatically reduce this complexity and would elegantly explain lineage-specific gene regulation based on the interaction of these broadly expressed TFs with lineage-restricted factors.</p><p>Hox TFs represent an excellent model to address this fundamental question, since they are active in all lineages along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of bilaterian animals. Importantly, the famous and well-known identity switch of whole body parts, the homeotic transformation, which is induced by altered Hox expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lewis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schneuwly et al., 1987</xref>), shows that Hox TFs have comparable functions in all lineages during development and indicates that they control the development of different lineages in a highly specific manner. The latter conclusion is supported by recent experiments showing that mesoderm-derived vascular wall mesenchymal stem cells (VW-MSCs) can be generated in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) simply by inducing the expression of a mixture of <italic>Hox</italic> genes that are selectively expressed in adult VM-MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Steens et al., 2017</xref>). However, while this study showed that <italic>Hox</italic> genes alone are sufficient to induce the generation of one specific cell type of one lineage in vitro, it left the questions open whether this is also the case in vivo, and how Hox TFs unambiguously select among the many possible transcriptional programs only one, which drives a cell or a whole lineage into one specific direction.</p><p>One major bottleneck in this direction is that genome-wide Hox chromatin binding studies have been performed so far mainly in cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zouaz et al., 2017</xref>), specialized epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>), or mixtures of cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shlyueva et al., 2016</xref>), hampering the identification of common and lineage-specific mechanisms employed by Hox TFs in different lineages in vivo. Furthermore, unlike lineage-restricted TFs, which are often tested in vivo using ectopic expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fukushige and Krause, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Patel and Hobert, 2017</xref>), the functional analysis of TFs acting in multiple lineages requires the targeted interference with these factors in individual lineages. With the availability of conditional genome editingÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Port et al., 2014</xref>) and nanobody driven protein degradation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>) this is now possible in an efficient manner and allows to elucidate the mode of action of Hox TFs in individual lineages, which are located in an otherwise unperturbed tissue environment at any stage in development. This is particularly important for multi-lineage TFs like the Hox proteins, which extensively control cell communicationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cunningham and Duester, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>) and thus influence their own action in neighbouring lineages.</p><p>Here, we probe the Hox TF Ubx in the mesodermal and neuronal lineages using sorted nuclei of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and by interfering with Ubx function specifically in the mesoderm lineage that is specified and fully committed to the mesodermal fate. To this end, we generated a GFP-Ubx gene fusion at the endogenous locus using CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous recombination. We show that Ubx is a key regulator of lineage development and diversification, as it controls the mesodermal and neuronal transcriptional programs with high specificity despite interacting with many genes in both lineages. Intriguingly, our study demonstrates that Ubx controls lineage specification and differentiation not primarily by activating lineage-specific gene programs but to a large extent by restricting cellular plasticity within each lineage. In the mesoderm Ubx executes this function by silencing alternative fate genes, and we show that this repression requires the interaction of Ubx with the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) on co-bound chromatin sites. We furthermore find that Ubx stabilizes Pho binding to Ubx targeted genomic regions, and that this interaction is critical for gene repression by controlling the balance of H3K27me3 as well as H3K27ac at these sites. Taken together, our study demonstrates that Hox TFs control not only the segmental identity but also the developmental programs intrinsic to each lineage with high precision, and that one of the prominent functions of this multi-lineage TF family is the repression of alternative lineage programs, which restricts the cellular potential in a lineage-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comprehensive map of transcriptional profiles and Ubx binding in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic mesodermal and neuronal lineages</title><p>To elucidate mechanisms that enable a multi-lineage TF to instruct the development of divergent lineages, we recorded on the tissue level chromatin binding of the broadly expressed Hox protein Ubx in the mesoderm and nervous system and determined the transcriptomes of these two lineages during two stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis.

Robust and reproducible data were obtained for all samples in biological duplicates. In total, transcripts (containingÂ &gt;5 RPKM) corresponding to 5652 coding genes were identified for the early mesodermal, 5716 coding genes for late mesodermal, 6752 coding genes for the early neuronal and 6182 coding genes for the late neuronal nuclei populations, which included genes typical for the lineage type and developmental stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficient analysis revealed that the transcriptome of the mesodermal lineage was clearly distinct from the neuronal one at both time points (rÂ =Â 0.72 for stages<sup>10-13</sup>; rÂ =Â 0.53 for stages<sup>14-17</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). This was also reflected in a high number of genes differentially expressed in the mesodermal as well as the neuronal lineages when comparing identical stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Importantly, GO term classification revealed a significant enrichment of processes typical for the respective lineage (mesoderm both stages: p-value&lt;2.2e-16, neuronal stages<sup>10-13</sup>: p-value&lt;1.26e-6, neuronal stages<sup>14-17</sup>: p-value&lt;5.3e-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). In addition to elucidating differences in tissue profiles, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis also showed that global gene expression in the mesodermal lineage changed substantially over the selected time points (rÂ =Â 0.78 for mesoderm stages<sup>10-13</sup> + stages<sup>14-17</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). Tissue- and stage-dependent differences and similarities were very well reflected in the distances calculated by principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). PCA analysis also showed that in contrast to the mesoderm the neuronal transcriptomes were very similar at both developmental time frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref>), which we assumed to be a consequence of the earlier onset of nervous system differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bate, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartenstein, 1993</xref>).</p><p>We next profiled genome-wide Ubx binding in the same lineages and identical time windows by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) using 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> INTACT-sorted mesodermal and neuronal nuclei and an Ubx specific antibody generated and verified in the lab (see Materials and Methods). The sequencing was performed in biological duplicates and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis revealed a high similarity of the samples (rÂ =Â 0.94â0.96).

However, this analysis also uncovered that Ubx, which is known to have different functions in the developing mesoderm and nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Enriquez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hessinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCormick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Miller et al., 2001</xref>) and which interacted with different genomic regions in the two tissue lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), targeted many genes in both tissue lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). To resolve this discrepancy, we overlapped Ubx binding events and transcriptome profiles. We found that only 27% to 36% of the Ubx chromatin interactions occurred in the vicinity of genes actively transcribed either in the mesodermal or neuronal lineages at the different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), with more than 60% of these interactions occurring at intron, intergenic and distal enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In contrast, a large portion of the Ubx chromatin interactions (64% to 73%) were close to inactive genes in the two lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) While it is well documented that Hox TFs function as activators and repressors depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pinsonneault et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Saleh et al., 2000</xref>), the high number of Ubx chromatin interactions at non-transcribed genes was unexpected. By determining the gene functions associated with Ubx interactions, we found a substantial overrepresentation of GO terms characteristic for the respective lineage among the Ubx targeted and expressed genes (mesoderm: p-value 2.2e-16, neuronal stages<sup>10-13</sup>: p-value 2.2e-16, neuronal stages<sup>14-17</sup>: p-value 1.004e-9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), while Ubx interactions at inactive genes occurred frequently at genes controlling processes active in other lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1B</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2D</xref>).

This analysis uncovered a high correlation between the lineage-specific transcriptional profiles and the genome-wide Ubx interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). For example, many genes expressed in the early mesoderm control stem cell, cell cycle and translation related processes, and Ubx interactions were found enriched in the vicinity of these genes, while Ubx hardly interacted with genes encoding gene functions that were not represented among the active genes, like metabolism, signalling, stimulus and transport/trafficking related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). A similar correlation was found among the inactive genes, as Ubx interactions were again highly enriched at gene classes found to be overrepresented among the non-expressed genes, while Ubx did not interact with underrepresented gene classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This result suggested that Ubx binding controlled global gene expression in the mesoderm, the activation as well as repression, in a comprehensive manner. However, as this GO term enrichment could also be a consequence of the high number of genes bound by Ubx and not of binding preferences, we performed two types of analyses. First, we mapped the Ubx sequencing reads retrieved from stage 10 to 13 mesodermal nuclei to a previous version of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (dm3). This resulted as expected in the identification of substantially fewer binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), however the genes targeted by Ubx had still a similar distribution of GO term enrichments when compared to the transcriptome according to WEADE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). And second, we asked whether this binding behaviour was a general characteristic of TFs or specific for Ubx. Thus, we analysed GO term enrichment of genes bound by two mesoderm-specific TFs, Tinman (Tin), a NK homeodomain TF required for cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodmer et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azpiazu and Frasch, 1993</xref>), and Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2), a MADS-box TF generally controlling muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bour et al., 1995</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ranganayakulu et al., 1998</xref>). We used genome-wide binding data of Tin and Mef2 profiled at similar embryonic stages which were mapped to the dm3 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sandmann et al., 2006</xref>), and which showed that Ubx, Tin and Mef2 bound comparable numbers of chromatin sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). WEADE analysis of genes bound by these two TFs revealed that Tin interactions did not reflect very well the gene classes represented among the active and inactive genes, while Ubx and Mef2 profiles were rather similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Indeed, Tin preferentially interacted with genes controlling stem cell processes irrespective of whether these genes were actively transcribed or silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, these results strengthened our hypothesis that Ubx generally controls mesoderm development like Mef2, while Tin has a more restricted function in this tissue lineage. This is in line with Tinâs published role in the determination and specification of the cardiac, visceral and dorsal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azpiazu and Frasch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klinedinst and Bodmer, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In sum, these results illustrated that the broadly expressed Hox TF Ubx played a prominent role in orchestrating the transcriptional program in the mesodermal (and neuronal) lineages. In addition, our analysis revealed that a substantial fraction of Ubx interactions were found in the vicinity of inactive genes, which encoded many mesoderm-unrelated functions. Thus, we hypothesized that one important function of Ubx in tissue development could be the repression of alternative transcriptional programs, which instruct the development of other lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The generic Hox transcription factor Ubx functions as a major regulator of lineage programs</title><p>Our analysis of Ubx function in the mesodermal and neuronal lineages was so far based on correlating lineage-specific Ubx binding profiles with RNA-seq probed gene expression. In order to elucidate which genes are under direct Ubx control, we profiled the transcriptional output induced in mesodermal cells devoid of Ubx protein, while leaving Ubx levels in all other cell and tissue types unchanged. We focused our analysis on the mesoderm, as its control by various lineage-restricted TFs is well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azpiazu and Frasch, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klinedinst and Bodmer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sandmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sandmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zaffran et al., 2002</xref>). In order to deplete Ubx in the mesoderm, we used the targeted degradation of GFP fusion proteins. To this end, we first generated an endogenously GFP tagged version of the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene using the <underline>C</underline>lustered <underline>R</underline>egularly <underline>I</underline>nterspaced <underline>S</underline>hort <underline>P</underline>alindromic <underline>R</underline>epeats-associated Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genome engineering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>) (see Materials and Methods for details). Intactness of the fusion protein in the homozygous viable GFP-Ubx fly line was verified by rescuing <italic>Ubx</italic> mutants using the <italic>GFP-Ubx</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1HâL</xref>). Co-localization of GFP and Ubx protein expression in GFP-Ubx embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>) confirmed a precise expression control of the fusion protein. In order to degrade the GFP-Ubx fusion protein in a lineage-specific manner, we used the deGradFP system, which harnesses the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to achieve direct depletion of GFP-tagged proteins. We first functionally verified the system by ubiquitously degrading the GFP-Ubx fusion protein using the <italic>armadillo</italic> (<italic>arm</italic>)-GAL4 driver, which resulted in a strong reduction of GFP-Ubx protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1EâG,O</xref>), and in animals resembling the <italic>Ubx</italic> null mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1M,N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lewis, 1978</xref>). In a next step, we applied deGradFP to specifically interfere with Ubx function in the mesoderm using the <italic>Mef2</italic>-GAL4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zars et al., 2000</xref>). This combination substantially decreased GFP-Ubx protein accumulation in the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,G</xref>), and the expression of the direct Ubx target gene <italic>dpp</italic> in the visceral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâJ</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Manak et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). Consequently, we only observed the well-described loss of the third midgut constriction in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), which is caused by the absence of Ubx activity in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienz et al., 1988</xref>), while all non-mesodermal tissues were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâG</xref>). Having confirmed the suitability of the approach, we INTACT-sorted mesodermal nuclei, in which the GFP-Ubx protein had been depleted and profiled their transcriptome using RNA-seq. Due to the activity of the <italic>Mef2</italic>-GAL4 driver starting at embryonic stage 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zars et al., 2000</xref>), which resulted in significant reduction of Ubx protein levels in the mesoderm only at stage 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), we restricted our analysis to the late developmental time window (embryonic stages 14 to 17). RNA-seq experiments where performed in biological triplicates and the two most similar duplicates identified by Person correlation were used for further analysis. Comparison of the Ubx depleted and control mesodermal transcriptomes revealed a differential expression of 2845 genes, with 1393 genes showing increased mRNA accumulation, including <italic>Fasciclin 2</italic> (<italic>Fas2</italic>), <italic>ventral veins lacking</italic> (<italic>vvl</italic>), <italic>Neurotrophin 1</italic> (<italic>NT1</italic>) and <italic>myospheroid</italic> (<italic>mys</italic>), while 1452 genes exhibited reduced expression, including <italic>Î²Tub60D</italic>, <italic>Ankyrin 2</italic> (<italic>Ank2</italic>) and <italic>Notchless</italic> (<italic>Nle</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). PCA analysis confirmed that the mesodermal transcriptomes in the absence (mesoderm<sup>14-17</sup> Ubx<sup>Degrad</sup>) or presence (mesoderm<sup>14-17</sup>) of Ubx were substantially different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). In total, 55% (791/1452) of the genes with reduced and 70% (978/1393) of the genes with increased expression were bound by Ubx in mesodermal nuclei in wild-type embryos, implying that the majority of expression changes were a direct consequence of altered Ubx chromatin interactions. A detailed analysis of biological GO terms showed that down-regulated genes mostly functioned in general cell processes like translation, RNA processing and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>), while up-regulated genes controlled primarily lineage-specific functions like central nervous system, axon and cutical development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). To have a global view of the biological processes directly controlled by Ubx, we compared overrepresentation of higher-order biological GO terms between the Ubx degradation and control transcriptomes sets using the WEADE tool. We observed that processes were not randomly changed in the absence of Ubx but were mostly in agreement with Ubx chromatin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). For example, translation and cell cycle processes, which were enriched among the expressed as well as Ubx bound active genes in the control transcriptome, were now represented among the transcripts with reduced accumulation in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), supporting that these processes were directly activated by Ubx. On the other hand, stimulus and signalling related processes, which were only to a minor extent represented among the genes expressed in the mesoderm, were found enriched among the genes with enhanced activity in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Consistent with a repressive function of Ubx, these processes were overrepresented among the inactive genes bound by Ubx in control mesodermal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42675.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Ubx directly represses alternative fate genes in a lineage-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Lateral view of stage 14 <italic>GFP-Ubx Drosophila</italic> embryos stained for the muscle differentiation marker Mef2 (blue) (<bold>A</bold>), the pan-neuronal marker Elav (blue) (<bold>B</bold>), Ubx (red) and GFP (green).

As this suggested that Ubx carves the developmental path of a cell or tissue lineage by inhibiting other possible developmental routes, we focused our subsequent analysis on the question how Ubx executes this lineage-restricting function. As gene expression critically depends on the epigenetic status of the gene regulatory control regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kingston and Tamkun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2007</xref>), we characterized Ubx chromatin interactions in more detail.

The ChIP-seq for histone marks was performed in biological duplicates.

Ubx interactions with repressive chromatin were predictive of gene activity, as about 70% of these occurred at inactive genes irrespective of the developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which we found again associated with functions unrelated to the mesoderm (neuronal: p-value 7.05e-5â6.59e-6, ectoderm: p-value 4.80e-5â5.21e-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

To this end, we performed ChIP-seq experiments in biological triplicates, the two most similar duplicates were used for further analysis. In total, 1216 H3K27me3 peaks and 1480 H3K27ac peaks located in gene regulatory regions, which corresponded to 2768 genes, changed their chromatin state in the absence of Ubx, as they experienced either a reduction/loss or an increase/gain in tri-methylation/acetylation at lysine 27 of histone 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, 80% of these genomic regions possessed an Ubx binding peak in control mesodermal cells, indicating that Ubx was critically required for establishing or maintaining the majority of these histone marks. Intriguingly, 1058 of these genes were primed for gene expression, as they experienced a loss/reduction of H3K27me3 and/or gain/increase of H3K27ac in their regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and 164 of them were indeed up-regulated in the mesodermal lineage in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with previous results, these 164 genes were highly enriched for processes critically controlling the development of lineages other than the mesoderm (neuronal: p-value&lt;2.2e-16, ectoderm: p-value 1.36e-12, endoderm and gut structures: p-value&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>One result that puzzled us was that the majority of genes primed for activation (894 of 1058) remained silent on the RNA level when Ubx was lineage-specifically degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We found that H3K27ac marks were equally increased at promoters and enhancers of genes unchanged or up-regulated in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, while H3K27me3 marks were significantly decreased at enhancers as well as promoters of up-regulated genes, unchanged genes showed a significant increase in H3K27me3 at their enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As a high proportion of Ubx and H3K27me3 peaks co-occurred at enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), this result revealed that Ubx played a major role in repressing the expression of alternative fate genes by controlling the deposition/maintenance of H3K27me3 marks at enhancers.</p><p>In sum, these results showed that Ubx mediated the repression of genes encoding non-mesodermal functions by controlling the epigenetic status, in particular H3K27me3, at Ubx bound chromatin sites located in enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ubx interacts with Pho at H3K27me3 marked inactive genes encoding alternative fate genes</title><p>To identify factors that together with Ubx could mediate the repression of alternative fate genes thereby restricting lineage identity, we performed a DNA motif search using all Ubx peaks either overlapping with H3K27me3 repressive or H3K27ac active marks. We found in both cases motifs for Ubx, Extradenticle (Exd), a TALE class homeobox TF functioning as Hox cofactor in invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Moens and Selleri, 2006</xref>), and Trithorax-like (Trl), a GAGA factor activating and repressing gene expression by chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kingston and Tamkun, 2014</xref>), among the highest ranking motifs. In contrast, the DNA binding motif for the zinc finger protein Pleiohomeotic (Pho) was specifically enriched only among the co-occurring Ubx and H3K27me3 binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown just recently that in the absence of Pho, which recruits PcGs to PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fritsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kahn et al., 2014</xref>), H3K27me3 marks were reduced in Polycomb regions and redistributed to heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). In combination with our finding that H3K27me3 levels were reduced specifically at up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we hypothesized that Pho could function together with Ubx in the lineage-specific repression of alternative fate genes. Consistent with this idea Pho was found expressed in mesodermal cells also expressing Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-Cââ</xref>).

This result suggested that Ubx and Pho could interact with the same chromatin regions to control gene expression, thus we analysed high-resolution Pho maps retrieved from embryonic (stage 9 to 12) mesodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erceg et al., 2017</xref>).

By analysing the distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac at regulatory regions, we discovered that those chromatin regions associated with inactive genes had a higher coverage of H3K27me3 and lower coverage of H3K27ac at shared Ubx/Pho binding regions, while it was the opposite for active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).

In support of this hypothesis, we found 55% (769/1391) of the genes up-regulated in the absence of Ubx, which were highly enriched for non-mesodermal and stem cell related functions, to be located in the vicinity of Ubx/Pho binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, only a minor fraction (15%) was in the vicinity of chromatin sites targeted by Pho only, and we did not detect any significant enrichment of GO terms among these genes (data not shown). To provide additional evidence for a combined action of Ubx and Pho, we analysed the binding of Pho to Ubx/Pho/H3K27me3 binding regions in the absence of Ubx by performing ChIP experiments on INTACT sorted control and Ubx depleted mesodermal nuclei. Furthermore, we also quantified the levels of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac marks at these loci. We selected five Ubx/Pho/H3K27me3 genomic regions that changed their histone marks towards activation (less H3K27me3 and/or more H3K27ac) when Ubx was depleted in the mesodermal lineage, which resulted in the activation of the associated genes encoding neuronal functions.

In addition, we also chose five loci bound by Pho but not by Ubx, which were associated with genes normally not expressed in the mesoderm and which remained silent in the absence of Ubx, including <italic>folded gastrulation</italic> (<italic>fog</italic>), <italic>Olig family</italic> (<italic>Oli</italic>), <italic>bendless</italic> (<italic>ben</italic>), <italic>myospheroid</italic> (<italic>mys</italic>) and <italic>medial glomeruli</italic> (<italic>meigo</italic>).

In total, 4154 sites experienced a loss/reduction in Pho binding in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), while at 3324 sites Pho binding was gained or increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Intriguingly, 62% (2567/4154) of the regions, which lost Pho binding in the absence of Ubx, were co-bound by Ubx in control nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), revealing a co-dependency of Ubx and Pho binding to shared chromatin sites. Notably, 422 of the 3501 genes associated with Ubx/Pho regions that lost Pho binding were up-regulated in Ubx depleted mesodermal nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which again encoded preferentially proteins controlling alternative fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Thus, we asked whether H3K27me3 and H3K27ac levels were generally altered at Ubx/Pho binding sites when Ubx was depleted in the mesodermal lineage. To this end, we determined H3K27ac and H3K27me3 levels at Ubx/Pho co-bound sites that lost Pho binding when Ubx was degraded. Notably, we did not detect any significant change of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 levels at these sites on the global level, which was also the case for Ubx/Pho co-bound sites that did not experience a change in Pho binding when Ubx was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Here, we provide evidence that multi-lineage TFs of the Hox class stabilize the different lineage choices by restricting cellular plasticity in a lineage specific manner. To this end, we studied the broadly expressed Hox TF Ubx in the mesodermal and neuronal lineages during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development using a comparative genomic approach and an experimental system to deplete Ubx protein exclusively in the embryonic mesodermal lineage. This approach allowed us to dissect the cell-autonomous function of Ubx in a single lineage that was located in an otherwise normal cellular environment at the transcriptome and chromatin level. Using this experimental set-up, we found that Ubx comprehensively orchestrates the transcriptional programs of the mesodermal as well as of the neuronal lineage, as it bound and regulated a substantially fraction of genes specifically expressed in these tissue lineages. Strikingly, this analysis revealed that the majority of Ubx chromatin interactions were located in the vicinity of inactive genes, and lineage-specific interference with Ubx in the mesoderm demonstrated that about 20% of these interactions were important for repressing the close-by genes. Intriguingly, these genes were highly enriched for alternative cell fates, demonstrating that Ubx had indeed a pivotal role in restricting the developmental potential of cell and tissue types in a context-dependent manner.</p><p>One important question arising from this result was why not more of the inactive genes bound by Ubx were de-repressed in the absence of Ubx. There are several explanations for this finding. First, Hox TFs cross-regulate each otherâs expression, a phenomenon described as posterior suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morata and Kerridge, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Struhl, 1982</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>Hox</italic> gene <italic>Antennapedia</italic> (<italic>Antp</italic>), which is normally expressed anterior to Ubx, is ectopically activated when Ubx function is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>), allowing Antp now to partially take over the function of Ubx in this lineage. Second, gene regulation is tightly linked to the chromatin status at promoter and enhancer regions. It had been shown in mammalian cells that the turn-over rates of the histone variant H3.3 at regulatory regions were correlated with specific histone modifications, high turn-over when associated with high levels of active histone modifications, like H3K27ac, while much slower turn-over when associated with higher levels of H3K27me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that the âclearingâ of repressive histone modifications takes much longer in comparison to active ones. Third, H3K27me3 marks serve as epigenetic memory to permanently silence genes in the course of development, and a recent study demonstrated that a resetting of the epigenetic status requires cell division to dilute the H3K27me3 mediated silencing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coleman and Struhl, 2017</xref>). In line with these studies, we found that the reduction of H3K27me3 levels was low in comparison to the increase of H3K27ac levels in Ubx depleted mesodermal nuclei. Thus, a de-repression of genes might require either more time or cell divisions or both. However, after its specification at embryonic stage 12 the mesoderm does not divide anymore, which might prevent an efficient clearing of H3K27me3 marks at Ubx targeted chromatin sites. Fourth, de-repression of genes is not only a consequence of abolishing repression but also of gaining activation, which not only requires a change of the histone environment at control regions but also the expression and action of the proper sets of TFs. Comparing the transcriptomes of the mesodermal and neuronal lineages revealed that only about 5% of the TFs expressed in an alternative lineage, in this case the neuronal one, were expressed in the Ubx depleted mesodermal cells, including vnd, HGTX, ham and Ptx1, which was obviously not sufficient to induce a lineage switch, in particular as the expression of only about 10% of the mesodermal fate related TFs was reduced in their expression. As we find Antp to be ectopically expressed in the mesodermal lineage in the absence of Ubx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we assume Antp to partially take over the lineage-specific function of Ubx. Thus, it will be interesting in future to study mesoderm development in a Hox-free environment and determine the fate of the developing cell lineage.</p><p>Another highly relevant finding of our study is that the Hox TF Ubx lineage-specifically repressed the transcription of alternative fate genes by organizing the epigenetic landscape and that chromatin changes at Ubx sites were dependent on the interaction of Ubx with the Polycomb recruiter Pho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schoenfelder et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, our study revealed that Ubx was crucial for stabilizing binding of the PcG protein Pho to specific chromatin regions. Although it is known that DNA binding TFs other than Pho interact with PREs, for example Grainyhead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kassis and Brown, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">MÃ¼ller and Kassis, 2006</xref>), a TF that has been shown recently to lineage-specifically displace nucleosomes at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>), these studies were mostly performed in vitro and the role of these TFs in Pho chromatin targeting was not addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nishioka et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, we analysed the combinatorial interaction of Ubx and Pho on the chromatin in vivo, in the mesodermal lineage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Importantly, we showed that Pho was no longer able to interact with Ubx bound sites when Ubx protein was depleted in a lineage-specific manner, while Pho-only chromatin interactions were unaffected. As a result, H3K27me3 levels were reduced and H3K27ac levels increased, resulting in the de-repression of genes primarily associated with Ubx-Pho chromatin regions. This result indicated that not only Pho but very likely the whole PcG protein complex was not properly targeted to Ubx chromatin sites, which is in line with our finding that H3K27me3 levels were generally decreased at enhancers of genes de-repressed upon Ubx depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we also found H3K27ac levels increased at Ubx chromatin interactions located in the vicinity of de-repressed genes. Interestingly, PREs frequently co-localize with response elements for Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kingston and Tamkun, 2014</xref>), a large group of proteins first described for their role in transcriptional activation. In this line, we identified not only the binding motif for Pho but also for the GAGA TF Trithorax-like (Trl) enriched among the Ubx bound and H3K27me3 marked chromatin sites, and we found Trl to interact with Ubx <italic>in cellulo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Trl was initially discovered to activate transcription, in particular of the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biggin and Tjian, 1988</xref>), but is also required for transcriptional repression, as it binds PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horard et al., 2000</xref>) and physically associates with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Poux et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, Trl had been suggested recently to function as a pioneer factor in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development by making genomic regions accessible through the deposition of active histone marks. Furthermore, it had been shown that another TrxG protein, the methyltransferase Trithorax (Trx), mediates together with the p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) the deposition of H3K27ac marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tie et al., 2009</xref>), a histone mark that was enriched at promoters and enhancers upon Ubx depletion. Thus, the TrxG complex and CBP could be recruited in the absence of Ubx to activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). GAGA factors like Trl do not only play a role in the activation but is also in the repression of gene expression by interacting with the Polycomb complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mulholland et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study showed that GAGA factors are required for the formation of repressive chromatin loops in Polycomb domains to stabilize gene silencing during early <italic>Drosophila</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ogiyama et al., 2018</xref>). These results could explain one puzzling result of our study, the increase of H3K27me3 marks in the absence of Ubx, which could be due to Trl interacting with these sites when Ubx levels drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), thereby promoting or increasing the formation of repressive chromatin loops. In future, it will be important to study TrxG as well as PcG proteins at Ubx targeted control regions to understand how Hox TFs orchestrate the interplay between transcriptional activation and repression in the course of lineage development when cellular plasticity needs to be restricted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42675.015</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of Ubx and Pho combinatorial action in mesoderm development.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Chromatin regions close to genes encoding different lineage functions are shown in mesodermal (green) and neuronal (purple) wild-type cells before (<bold>A</bold>) and after (<bold>B</bold>) Ubx is expressed.

One explanation is that tissue/lineage restricted factors and their interaction with Hox TFs provide specificity. Interestingly, we find the binding motif for the mesoderm-specific TF Snail (Sna) enriched among the sites, which are bound by Ubx and marked by H3K27me3 in the mesodermal lineage, while in the neuronal lineage the Ventral nervous system defective (Vnd) motif is frequently found in Ubx/H3K27me3 sites. Motifs for tissue-specific TFs are also detected at active sites, as Ubx/H3K27ac regions in the mesoderm have the Slouch (Slou) motif enriched, while in the nervous system it is the motif for Intermediate neuroblasts defective (Ind). Thus, we assume these factors to be critical in determining the lineage-specific output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In future, it will be interesting to study these tissue-restricted interactions and determine their role in the lineage-specific repression and activation of developmental gene programs.</p><p>One peculiar feature of Hox TFs is that they are not only active during the development but their input is continuously required throughout the lifetime of an organism to assess the positional values of cells and to maintain their proper identities and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argiropoulos and Humphries, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">CerdÃ¡-Esteban and Spagnoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leucht et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Philippidou et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings now shed new light on the mechanism ensuring this stability in cellular identity, as they suggest that Hox TFs robustly repress alternative lineage programs (via the interaction with epigenetic factors like Pho) and reliably restrict the developmental potential encoded cells. In the normal context, this is absolutely critical for an organism to function properly, however, in some instances it can be a major hurdle, in particular when cells need or should adopt a new identity, which requires them often to regain plasticity. In organismal life, this happens mostly during dedifferentiation, regeneration and tissue remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Merrell and Stanger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Monier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schaub et al., 2015</xref>). Another situation of cell type conversion is cellular reprogramming, which is extensively studied due to its high potential as therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). But although reprogramming strategies have been improved over time, the direct conversion of one somatic cell type into another one, the so-called transdifferentiation, is still inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Manandhar et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported recently that the induction of the Hox code typical for a differentiated cell type in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), either in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sugimura et al., 2017</xref>) with other factors or even alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Steens et al., 2017</xref>), can convert PSCs into the cell type expressing the Hox code in vivo. This clearly shows that <italic>Hox</italic> genes can effectively induce cell type specific transcriptional programs in multi-potent cells thereby unambiguously inducing their differentiation. This is in line with our findings showing that Hox TFs activate lineage-specific transcriptional profiles with high precision. However, so far it is unclear why the conversion of somatic cells of one type into another one is so difficult. Our data now suggest that one reason for this hurdle could be the Hox encoded restriction of cellular plasticity via the repression of alternative gene programs using Polycomb based epigenetic mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p>For the INTACT method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Steiner et al., 2012</xref>) the following fly lines were used: <italic>twi-INTACT</italic> and <italic>UAS-INTACT</italic> (gift from the Henikoff lab).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bart Deplancke (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, at length, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were enthusiastic about the subject and the approach, and they found the conclusions interesting and noteworthy. But as you can see from the reviews, which are appended in their entirety below, the reviewers also had substantial reservations about technical aspects of data collection and analysis. One simple issue that all the reviewers were concerned about was the lack of replicates for the ChIP experiments (3 replicates are standard), and they agreed that 2 or preferably 3 replicates should be performed and the data re-analyzed. A second general concern was the ChIP-PCR data indicating that Ubx controls H3 K27me3 distributions and Pho binding; in this case the reviewers agreed that the Pho ChIP samples +/- Ubx-deGrad (Figure 6) should be sequenced, to better substantiate your interesting conclusions using whole genome data. (In principle, the H3 K27me3 ChIP samples in Figure 6 should likewise be sequenced, though we leave it up to you to decide how important it is.) Thirdly, we would like to see a few changes to the data analysis, as described in the reviews, to bring into line with standards in the field. Clearly these additional experiments will require some investment, but we feel they are necessary to the bring to paper up to accepted standards in the field. We look forward to seeing your revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The Lohmann lab presents an extremely complex analysis of the role of the Hox transcription factor Ubx in lineage commitment/specification in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In order to remove Ubx from a given lineage only, they used a protein degradation method recently established and an endogenously tagged version of Ubx. The study is elegant in its design, and many of the discussed findings appear to provide interesting insight into the role of Ubx in the mesoderm, and possibly beyond.</p><p>However, for a non-expert in such genome-wide approaches, both the experimental and the analytical part of the work are difficult to analyse and evaluate in detail. In light of this fact, I have to admit that I found the work very interesting, timely and novel, and certainly of excellent quality and relevance to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. Even after having read the paper three times, I have not seen any reason to ask for additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Using the INTACT nuclei isolation method coupled to comprehensive RNA-seq and ChIP-seq assays, Domsch and colleagues found that a Hox class transcription factor (TF) Ubx binds to both active genes and inactive genes linked to either the mesodermal or neuronal lineages. The authors therefore hypothesized that Ubx may function in tissue development as a repressor of alternative transcriptional programs (i.e. programs steering cells toward a distinct differentiation fate). To investigate this postulate, the authors studied the regulatory function of Ubx in different lineages by depleting this TF in a tissue-specific manner. These experiments revealed that a large proportion of alternate fate genes are upregulated once Ubx is removed, in line with their hypothesis. The authors further profiled the H3K27ac and H3K27me3 chromatin landscapes in Ubx-depleted tissues, which revealed that Ubx likely represses alternate fate genes by controlling their epigenomic status, especially K3K27me3 enrichment. Subsequent motif analysis and downstream experiments thereby showed that this repressive chromatin mark may be directed toward these loci through the regulator Pho, which is stabilized by Ubx at these repressed regions.</p><p>Together, this is a very interesting study that should be of broad interest to the gene regulation and developmental biology fields given the formulation of a novel mechanistic model that rationalizes how a broadly expressed TF is able to contribute to cell lineage specification by repressing alternate cell fate genes. The techniques applied, such as tissue-specific nuclei isolation, tissue specific Ubx gene tagging/depletion are elegant and state of the art and the resulting data seems in general solid. There are only a few items that could be clarified better:</p><p>1) The authors used 10 RPKM as their threshold to distinguish active from inactive genes. This is a rather high threshold, and so one is left to wonder what the consequence would be on the downstream analyses/results if the more standard threshold of 1 RPKM would be applied?</p><p>2) The authors show that Ubx binds to a very large number of genes (roughly 10 K based on Figure 2B, and thus &gt;70% of all <italic>Drosophila</italic> (10 K / 14 K) can be considered to be Ubx targets). This raises a couple of questions:</p><p>a) In Figure 2B, the number of Ubx-bound genes in neuronal tissue at stages 14-17 is much lower than for the other three conditions. What could be the underlying reason?</p><p>b) In Figure 2G, the authors show that there is a high correlation in higher order GO terms between the lineage specific transcriptional and Ubx binding profiles. As a control, the authors included the TF Tinman, which revealed a more distinct GO term enrichment profile. However, since Ubx binds to such a large number of genes, is it not entirely expected that the majority of active genes will also be Ubx targets, and thus yield the same GO term enrichment profile? The same holds true for the inactive genes which also fall mostly within the &quot;Ubx target space&quot; and would thus again yield the same profile. That Tin does not yield the same profile is also not surprising given that it binds much fewer genes so the overlap between (in)active genes and Tin gene targets will be much smaller. A better control (if available) would in this regard be a TF that, similar to Ubx, binds to a large number (10 K) of genes. In its current configuration however, this analysis is not very informative. Similar concerns apply to the statements &quot;Strikingly, 85% (1227/1452) of the genes with reduced and 90% (1299/1393) of the genes with increased expression were bound by Ubx in mesodermal nuclei in wild-type embryos, implying that most of the expression changes were a direct consequence of altered Ubx chromatin interactions&quot;. Again, since &gt;70% of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes are Ubx targets, 85-90% is in fact not very striking and could just be a statistical aberration. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>3) The proposed model, while informative, is too simplistic. This is because, in its current form, the model lacks information on what the factors / determinants are that mediate either tissue-specific activation or repression. The identification of these factors is likely beyond the scope of the current study, but perhaps some first layer data analysis on motifs (beyond the listed generic ones) could be performed. In addition, these additional layers need to be incorporated in the model because, as an example, the Ubx-Pho complex is shown to repress neuronal genes in the mesoderm given the enrichment of the Pho motif in these repressed genes. But why then, given that the same motif will obviously be present in the DNA of a neuronal cell, does Pho-Ubx not repress these same genes in a neuronal cell (also since both Pho and Ubx are ubiquitously expressed)? What makes that the Pho motif in a neuronal cell is read differently in a mesodermal cell and vice versa? The same reasoning can be followed for active genes in the respective cell types. At a minimum, such uncertainties should be represented in the model to clearly indicate what type of regulatory information is still missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I have mixed responses to the paper by Domsch et al. On the one hand, the experimental design, to analyze Hox regulatory mechanisms in distinct embryonic tissues, seems at first glance important and exciting, I was less impressed with the analysis than I expected to be. My concerns fall in two categories:</p><p>1) Data generation and analysis.</p><p>For one, although replicates were analyzed for the RNA-seq experiments, it seems that all of the ChIP-seq datasets were only done once, without replicates. Given how noisy these type of data can be (especially when working with a small number of sorted cells and weak ChIP signals as in this case) I think it is imperative to compare at least two experimental replicates and use peak calling algorithms that require two independent datasets to assess statistical relevance. The Venn diagrams in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 for example suggest that there are ~14,000 (!) Ubx peaks in the mesoderm and that more than 7000 of these are mesoderm-specific. These numbers are quite striking but as it stands it is not possible to know how solid they are without replicate datasets and rigorous statistical tests.</p><p>I also wonder about the way the authors subtract input ChIP signals from their experimental IPs, as this is an analysis method that is not typically seen in the literature. I would like to see how noisy the input IPs are -- those tracks should be shown.</p><p>There is little validation of the ChIP peaks. The only known enhancer that was highlighted was one from Dpp.</p><p>The Pho co-IP signal is surprisingly weak given the mechanism of co-recruitment that the authors are proposing.</p><p>GAGA-like motifs are often observed by motif discovery algorithms and I am not convinced they are meaningful here given the lack of solid follow up evidence.</p><p>One potential strength of the paper is the claim that Pho binding and K27me3 depends on Ubx binding. However, this conclusion is based on a small handful of loci analyzed by qPCR and the differences are small. Further, given that the Pc system can have very specific targets, I think that calculating the ratio of K27me3/K27ac can be misleading. Better to treat these marks independently, since when one is lower it isn't necessarily the case that the other will be higher. It is also the case that Pho binding is not equivalent to K27me3; the latter could simply be a consequence of whether the gene is repressed, which may or may not occur in a Pho-dependent manner.</p><p>Many genes lose expression in the Ubx knockdown experiments, suggesting that Ubx also acts as an activator in the mesoderm, but this is not adequately discussed or studied in the paper. It is not clear why the authors choose to focus on the repressed genes.</p><p>2) General comments.</p><p>Ubx, and Hox genes in general, are well studied transcription factors that are known to be important in multiple cell types including mesoderm, the nervous system, and epithelium. So, seeing lots of genes change their expression when a broadly used transcription factor like Ubx is knocked down. It is also not surprising that the genes differ depending on the tissue (thus the GO analyses done in this paper seems rather trivial). What would take the analyses beyond what is known already is to understand how Ubx carries out differential functions in these two (and other) tissues. Presumably this happens in conjunction with tissue specific factors (e.g. twist for the mesoderm). The role of lineage specific factors, however, is not addressed and only marginally mentioned in the paper.</p><p>Terms such as &quot;Cell plasticity&quot; and &quot;lineage restriction&quot; are used rather loosely. The authors show that many up-regulated genes after Ubx knockdown are expressed in other lineages, but this result would have to be the case when a TF that represses genes is removed. There is no hard-evidence of lineage conversion (like loss of mesodermal master-regulatory factors for example), nor is it clear why neuronal (as opposed to endodermal or epithelial genes) genes are the focus here. It seems that the analysis is artificially restricted to repressed neuronal genes, while a more unbiased analysis of the changes that occur would be more valuable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42675.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the reviewers were enthusiastic about the subject and the approach, and they found the conclusions interesting and noteworthy.

This is a rather high threshold, and so one is left to wonder what the consequence would be on the downstream analyses/results if the more standard threshold of 1 RPKM would be applied?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The usage of such a stringent threshold was based on previous studies, which had used similar RPKMs, in particular when studying tissue-specific gene expression (for example Dezso Z, â¦ Nikolskaya, BMC Biology, 2008). In addition, other studies using the INTACT procedure and thus profiling nuclear and not whole cell RNAs used a similar stringent threshold to reduce the false positive recovery rate (for example, Reynoso et al., 2019). We do understand the reviewerâs concerns, thus we have re-analyzed the data using a threshold of &gt;5 RPKM, which is frequently used (Dezso et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2013, reviewed Kryuchkova-Mostacci and Robinson-Rechavi, 2016). As the reviewer will appreciate, this does not change the results and the main take home message of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that Ubx binds to a very large number of genes (roughly 10 K based on Figure 2B, and thus &gt;70% of all Drosophila (10 K / 14 K) can be considered to be Ubx targets). This raises a couple of questions:</p><p>a) In Figure 2B, the number of Ubx-bound genes in neuronal tissue at stages 14-17 is much lower than for the other three conditions. What could be the underlying reason?</p><p>b) In Figure 2G, the authors show that there is a high correlation in higher order GO terms between the lineage specific transcriptional and Ubx binding profiles. As a control, the authors included the TF Tinman, which revealed a more distinct GO term enrichment profile. However, since Ubx binds to such a large number of genes, is it not entirely expected that the majority of active genes will also be Ubx targets, and thus yield the same GO term enrichment profile? The same holds true for the inactive genes which also fall mostly within the &quot;Ubx target space&quot; and would thus again yield the same profile. That Tin does not yield the same profile is also not surprising given that it binds much fewer genes so the overlap between (in)active genes and Tin gene targets will be much smaller. A better control (if available) would in this regard be a TF that, similar to Ubx, binds to a large number (10 K) of genes. In its current configuration however, this analysis is not very informative. Similar concerns apply to the statements &quot;Strikingly, 85% (1227/1452) of the genes with reduced and 90% (1299/1393) of the genes with increased expression were bound by Ubx in mesodermal nuclei in wild-type embryos, implying that most of the expression changes were a direct consequence of altered Ubx chromatin interactions&quot;. Again, since &gt;70% of Drosophila genes are Ubx targets, 85-90% is in fact not very striking and could just be a statistical aberration. This needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer again for this valuable comment. Concerning the first point: We cannot explain why Ubx binds to less chromatin regions in the late neuronal time point, in particular as the quality of the reads is similar to the other stages. However, we assume that this is due to the different biology of the two lineages. In particular, as we already mention in the text, the neuronal lineage is a bit ahead of the mesodermal lineage with regards to developmental processes and initiates differentiation earlier than the mesoderm. This might result in a reduction of Ubx binding in the neuronal lineage.</p><p>The surprising outcome was that Ubx is indeed binding to a lot of sites. This is of course dependent on the TF type, on the way data are analysed, which thresholds are set. As requested by this reviewer before, we reanalyzed the Ubx data sets using a threshold of &gt;5 RPKM (dm6 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome), we then identified matching replicated via person correlation and combined the data sets for further analysis. This already changed the number of genes to which Ubx binds. We obtain now 6417 Ubx bound genes at stages 10-13 and 8256 Ubx bound genes at stages 14-17 in the mesoderm, with 80% of them corresponding to coding genes and 20% to non-coding genes. Thus, in total Ubx binds to 37-46% of the genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (total number of coding genes in the dm6 genome is 13971) using these settings. Using the WEADE tool, we still see the same result, that Ubx binding reflects genome activity, suggesting that Ubx indeed comprehensively controls lineage development.</p><p>We have studied the comparison of Ubx and Tin binding behavior in more detail, as we do agree with the reviewer that the number of bound genes will affect the outcome. For Tin, we had to rely on available mapping data onto the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome dm3, since the files (bed files) available for Tin (Jin et al., 2013) were done using this version. Alignment and peak calling against dm3 results in regions that are named âUâ and âUextraâ, which are normally removed as described in the supplementary of Erceg et al., 2017. This led to a removal of nearly half of the mapped reads. Using dm6 as a reference genome, which we did for the Ubx data, maintains these peaks and results in more binding events. In order to make the Ubx and Tin datasets more comparable, we mapped the Ubx peaks against the dm3 genome, which resulted in the identification of only 1914 genes to which Ubx binds in the early mesoderm. This is now comparable to the binding events of Tin in the mesoderm. We then redid the WEADE analysis and still get a very similar result (which we now present in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). In addition, we did the analysis also with another TF, <italic>Mef2</italic>, which generally controls mesoderm development and not like Tin a sub-aspect (cardiac development). Interestingly, we see that Ubx and Medf2 binding profiles are similar, while Tin binding preferences are more different. This makes in our opinion the main message even stronger, as Ubx binding is more similar to a general factor controlling mesoderm development. Thus, we are convinced that this finding reflects true differences between Ubx, <italic>Mef2</italic> and Tin.</p><p>We do agree with the reviewer, that in the previous version the use of âstrikingâ was not adequate, and we removed it from the text. Using the reanalyzed data, we now see that about 70% of the genes that were up- or down-regulated were bound by Ubx, and thus are very likely direct targets of Ubx. We would however highlight that binding does not necessarily mean a regulatory function, it is possible that Hox proteins bind without any functional consequences, and this could be a substantial fraction of the Hox binding events (see Biggin and McGinnis, 1997).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proposed model, while informative, is too simplistic. This is because, in its current form, the model lacks information on what the factors / determinants are that mediate either tissue-specific activation or repression. The identification of these factors is likely beyond the scope of the current study, but perhaps some first layer data analysis on motifs (beyond the listed generic ones) could be performed. In addition, these additional layers need to be incorporated in the model because, as an example, the Ubx-Pho complex is shown to repress neuronal genes in the mesoderm given the enrichment of the Pho motif in these repressed genes. But why then, given that the same motif will obviously be present in the DNA of a neuronal cell, does Pho-Ubx not repress these same genes in a neuronal cell (also since both Pho and Ubx are ubiquitously expressed)? What makes that the Pho motif in a neuronal cell is read differently in a mesodermal cell and vice versa? The same reasoning can be followed for active genes in the respective cell types. At a minimum, such uncertainties should be represented in the model to clearly indicate what type of regulatory information is still missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that the factors that mediate the tissue-specific activation and repression are very interesting, but are indeed beyond the scope of this paper. We have however performed some preliminary analysis (motif search) and included this in an extended version of the model shown in Figure 8A and B. We have also now dedicated a section to the Discussion part where we explain more in depth how we envision that specificity in tissue-specific target gene regulation by Hox TFs is achieved.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have mixed responses to the paper by Domsch et al. On the one hand, the experimental design, to analyze Hox regulatory mechanisms in distinct embryonic tissues, seems at first glance important and exciting, I was less impressed with the analysis than I expected to be. My concerns fall in two categories:</p><p>1) Data generation and analysis.</p><p>For one, although replicates were analyzed for the RNA-seq experiments, it seems that all of the ChIP-seq datasets were only done once, without replicates. Given how noisy these type of data can be (especially when working with a small number of sorted cells and weak ChIP signals as in this case) I think it is imperative to compare at least two experimental replicates and use peak calling algorithms that require two independent datasets to assess statistical relevance. The Venn diagrams in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 for example suggest that there are ~14,000 (!) Ubx peaks in the mesoderm and that more than 7000 of these are mesoderm-specific. These numbers are quite striking but as it stands it is not possible to know how solid they are without replicate datasets and rigorous statistical tests.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this was written in an unclear manner, but we had done all experiments of course at least in duplicates. To clarify: for the general mapping of tissue specific binding sites of Ubx we performed ChIP and HiSeq on two biological replicated. The experiments of the Ubx degradation (UbxDegrad) were performed in three biological replicates, the control (twi-INTACT; GFP-Ubx, UAS-Nslmb) as well as the experiment (twi-INTACT; <italic>Mef2</italic>&gt;UAS-Nslmb,GFP-Ubx). For the analysis of differential Expression (RNA-Seq, DESeq) and differential Binding (ChIP-seq, DiffBind) the two most similar replicates were identified and analyzed. For the identification of active genes or Ubx bound regions, we identified matching Ubx ChIP-seq replicates via person correlation, combined the data sets for further analysis and have (as requested by reviewer #2) used a less stringent threshold of &gt;5 RPKM threshold for the tissue specific transcriptome data sets (dm6 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome). This changed the number of genes to which Ubx binds. We obtain now 6417 Ubx bound genes at stages 10-13 and 8256 Ubx bound genes at stages 14-17 in the mesoderm, with 80% of them corresponding to coding genes and 20% to non-coding genes. Thus, in total Ubx binds to 37-46% of the genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (total number of coding genes in the dm6 genome is 13971) using these settings. Although this number is now reduced, the overall take home message is the same: Ubx binds a lot of sites, Ubx controls lineage development comprehensively (see comments to reviewer #2), and Ubx controls lineage development by repressing alternative fate genes and by activating lineage specific genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also wonder about the way the authors subtract input ChIP signals from their experimental IPs, as this is an analysis method that is not typically seen in the literature. I would like to see how noisy the input IPs are -- those tracks should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have added the input tracts to one sample (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A). We would however highlight that the subtraction of the Input from the IP is a common method to show the binding peaks and is used by many researcher groups, as it is normalizing the ChIP-seq reads (Erceg et al., 2017; Gaertner et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is little validation of the ChIP peaks. The only known enhancer that was highlighted was one from Dpp.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we now show another example in Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, the <italic>Î²Tub60D</italic> enhancer, this gene is significantly down-regulated upon Ubx degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Pho co-IP signal is surprisingly weak given the mechanism of co-recruitment that the authors are proposing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed whole embryonic Co-IP using the GFP-Ubx line, as a control we used the <italic>w1118</italic> fly line, and we found an interaction of Ubx with Pho in an in vivo context, which to our knowledge has so far not been shown for a Pho-TF interaction. And actually, we do not propose a direct recruitment or co-recruitment but we state that Ubx stabilizes Pho binding to repressed regions. The weak signal suggests that the interaction of Pho with Ubx is rather weak but essential for the maintenance of the repression. We have now stated this even clearer in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>GAGA-like motifs are often observed by motif discovery algorithms and I am not convinced they are meaningful here given the lack of solid follow up evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume a lot of genomic regions to contain the GAGA or GAGA-like motif and we agree that motif search does not that these regions are functional or bound by GAGA. However, we do think that some Ubx bound regions will have GAGA bound, as we could show an interaction between Ubx and GAGA at least in cell culture (Co-IP, now Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One potential strength of the paper is the claim that Pho binding and K27me3 depends on Ubx binding. However, this conclusion is based on a small handful of loci analyzed by qPCR and the differences are small. Further, given that the Pc system can have very specific targets, I think that calculating the ratio of K27me3/K27ac can be misleading. Better to treat these marks independently, since when one is lower it isn't necessarily the case that the other will be higher. It is also the case that Pho binding is not equivalent to K27me3; the latter could simply be a consequence of whether the gene is repressed, which may or may not occur in a Pho-dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and we have redone the analysis using the Pho ChIP-seq dataset we have generated (in control and Ubx degradation backgrounds) to show the global relevance of our finding. In addition, we show K27me3 and K27ac marks independently. This analysis now reveals that a subset of Ubx-Pho bound sites that lose Pho binding in the absence of Ubx have their K27me3 marks significantly reduced, while K27ac marks are increased, demonstrating that at least at a subset of sites Ubx is required for Pho binding and H3K27me3 marks. We have now emphasized this point also stronger in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many genes lose expression in the Ubx knockdown experiments, suggesting that Ubx also acts as an activator in the mesoderm, but this is not adequately discussed or studied in the paper. It is not clear why the authors choose to focus on the repressed genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it has not been explained well enough why we chose to focus on repressed genes, which we have now done in the revised version. We have now dedicated also a paragraph in the Discussion on the activation of lineage-specific genes by Ubx to highlight that Ubx controls lineage development not only by repression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) General comments.</p><p>Ubx, and Hox genes in general, are well studied transcription factors that are known to be important in multiple cell types including mesoderm, the nervous system, and epithelium. So, seeing lots of genes change their expression when a broadly used transcription factor like Ubx is knocked down. It is also not surprising that the genes differ depending on the tissue (thus the GO analyses done in this paper seems rather trivial). What would take the analyses beyond what is known already is to understand how Ubx carries out differential functions in these two (and other) tissues. Presumably this happens in conjunction with tissue specific factors (e.g. twist for the mesoderm). The role of lineage specific factors, however, is not addressed and only marginally mentioned in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to highlight that although it might seem trivial and expected to see a lot of genes changing their expression when Ubx is lost, this is the first time that a Hox TFs, which is active in many different cell types, is studied in individual lineages in vivo. Reviewer #1 and #2 appreciated this aspect a lot, as they thought this is an elegant study. It was in particular this set-up that allowed us to uncover the function of Ubx in repressing alternative fates. We do agree with the reviewer that the next interesting and important question to solve is how Ubx performs this function lineage-specifically, very likely via the interaction with lineage-specific factors. We work on that aspect, but this is beyond the scope of this paper, as this manuscript is already quite complex (stated by reviewer #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Terms such as &quot;Cell plasticity&quot; and &quot;lineage restriction&quot; are used rather loosely. The authors show that many up-regulated genes after Ubx knockdown are expressed in other lineages, but this result would have to be the case when a TF that represses genes is removed. There is no hard-evidence of lineage conversion (like loss of mesodermal master-regulatory factors for example), nor is it clear why neuronal (as opposed to endodermal or epithelial genes) genes are the focus here. It seems that the analysis is artificially restricted to repressed neuronal genes, while a more unbiased analysis of the changes that occur would be more valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We went critically through the manuscript and used the terms âcell plasticityâ and âlineage restrictionâ in a more stringent manner. Concerning the second point, that there is no hard evidence for lineage conversion, we would like to highlight that we never state that the mesodermal lineage changes identity in the absence of Ubx. Actually, we dedicated a whole paragraph in the Discussion why we believe that there is no lineage conversion, one reason being that other Hox TFs (like Antp) are ectopically expressed when Ubx is removed, which are very likely involved in maintaining the expression of mesodermal master-regulators. Thus, it will be important to study lineage development in a Hox free environment. However, this is beyond the scope of the paper. We now state more clearly why we focused on neuronal genes in our GO term analysis. However, we would like to highlight that we show the global significance of the de-repression of different types of alternative fate genes in Figure 3O.</p></body></sub-article></article>
