While PET studies revealed maturation-related changes, maturation of metabolic connectivity of the brain is not yet understood. Here, we show that rat brain metabolism is reconfigured to achieve long-distance connections with higher energy efficiency during maturation. Metabolism increased in anterior cerebrum and decreased in thalamus and cerebellum during maturation. When functional covariance patterns of PET images were examined, metabolic networks including default mode network (DMN) were extracted. Connectivity increased between the anterior and posterior parts of DMN and sensory-motor cortices during maturation. Energy efficiency, a ratio of connectivity strength to metabolism of a region, increased in medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices. Our data revealed that metabolic networks mature to increase metabolic connections and establish its efficiency between large-scale spatial components from childhood to early adulthood. Neurodevelopmental diseases might be understood by abnormal reconfiguration of metabolic connectivity and efficiency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11571.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11571.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11571.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain consumes a great deal of a sugar called glucose, which is delivered to the brain through blood vessels. Active regions of the brain need more glucose, and so the brain has a metabolic network that controls when and where glucose is metabolized. Yet precisely how this metabolic network changes during brain development is not yet understood.</p><p>Choi et al. have now monitored the patterns of glucose metabolism in the brains of awake rats as they matured from 'childhood' to early adulthood. The experiments involved injecting the rats with radioactive glucose, and then using a technique called positron emission tomography (commonly known as 'PET scan') to monitor the metabolism of these radioactive sugar molecules in the animals’ brains.</p><p>Choi et al. showed that the patterns of glucose consumption in the brain shift drastically as the rats mature. Importantly, the findings showed that these shifts in glucose metabolism seem to support the activity of long distance connections that develop as the brain matures. The findings also showed that the increased long distance connections were energy efficient. The results suggest that these metabolic changes are likely a way of maintaining high-energy efficiency that is crucial for the brain to perform normally.</p><p>Finally, in addition to revealing the changes involved in normal brain development, these findings may have implications in neurological and psychiatric disorders in which the brain fails to achieve efficient metabolic networks as it matures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11571.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11571.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>FDG PET</kwd><kwd>metabolic connectivity</kwd><kwd>brain maturation</kwd><kwd>resting-state network</kwd><kwd>adolescent</kwd><kwd>energy efficiency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C0466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dong Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C3344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dong Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C1277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dong Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003625</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI13C1299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dong Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015028926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dong Soo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rat brains mature to increase metabolic connectivity between network components and establish energy efficiency in the midline structures from childhood to early adulthood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front> <body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title> <p>Recent neuroimaging studies unraveled the developmental changes of the adolescent brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blakemore, 2012</xref>). Among those neuroimaging techniques, positron emission tomography (PET) provides quantitative information regarding regional metabolism or synaptic neurochemicals with high sensitivity. As <sup>18</sup>F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is taken up in the brain proportional to cerebral energy consumption and neuronal activity, FDG PET studies have been used to investigate regional energy metabolism during physiologic and pathologic processes. Previous brain developmental studies using FDG PET in humans assumed that the regional increase of metabolism was accompanied by regional increase of neuronal activity during brain maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chugani et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Phelps and Mazziotta, 1985</xref>). Despite these previous data, the developmental changes are not understood in terms of dynamic organization of metabolic networks between brain regions.</p> <p>Since a series of regional brain activity is being coherently organized changing throughout time, sets of specific brain regions are activated or deactivated during resting or various cognitive tasks. These specific regional activity patterns, so-called functional brain networks, are identified by neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deco et al., 2011</xref>). Among several imaging approaches, resting state functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI)-based connectivity analyses revealed maturation of the functional networks during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Supekar et al., 2009</xref>). FDG PET can also reveal functional metabolic network and its maturation, exploiting the coupling between neuronal activity and metabolism. While the fMRI-based functional connectivity measures correlation of fast temporal fluctuations, metabolic connectivity measured by FDG PET reflects a cumulative energy consumption in several minutes and provides relatively stable information regarding steady resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toussaint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yakushev et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, FDG PET measures metabolic activity and connection patterns during awaken states even in animals as in humans, because FDG is taken up in the brain mainly during the period after injection and before the imaging under anesthesia.</p> <p>To organize highly connected functional brain networks, which can be measured by fMRI or FDG PET, the brain needs efficient energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bullmore and Sporns, 2012</xref>). As the high energetic costs are required for brain wiring to construct and maintain hub regions with dense connections, hub regions will show high glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lord et al., 2013</xref>). Brain regions were found to show different regional energy efficiency so that, for instance, subcortical regions consumed relatively lower metabolic energy per connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tomasi et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we can say that metabolism of brain regions could be determined both by the regional complexity of functional networks and their energy efficiency for wiring. Since the developmental changes in functional networks reconfigure the metabolic demands, energy efficiency of the brain networks are going to be changed during maturation.</p> <p>We primarily aimed to find the maturation-related changes in both regional metabolic activity and metabolic connectivity in adolescent period with a longitudinal study in rats. As the animals allow repeated imaging studies, we could study longitudinal maturation of regional metabolism and connectivity in the same animals. As the small animals also have default mode network (DMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>) defined as brain regions activating during resting state and deactivating during attention-demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>), specific network components were extracted in the rat brain from minutes-scale metabolic covariance patterns and independent component analysis (ICA). We hypothesized the metabolic networks are dynamically organized during maturation to achieve connection efficiency. We investigated maturation of large-scale metabolic connectivity and analyzed their energy efficiency for wiring in rat brains.</p></sec> <sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title> <p>Voxelwise comparisons were firstly performed among rats aged 5, 10, and 15 weeks to disclose temporal changes of regional metabolic activity. The comparison using statistical parametric mapping revealed that the metabolism increased in 10-week-old age in bilateral frontal cortices and anterior aspect of striatum compared with 5-week-old age and decreased in bilateral cerebellar cortices, thalamus, parieto-occipital cortices, and retrosplenial cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (representative FDG PET images for each age are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Four particular components, IC1, IC5, IC8, and IC9, were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which anatomically corresponded to previously alleged limbic/anterior DMN (IC1), posterior DMN (IC5), motor (IC8), and somatosensory network (IC9), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>).

We identified the specific pattern of changes in regional metabolism and metabolic connectivity during brain development. In adolescent (10 weeks) and early-adult (15 weeks) period, metabolism increased in the bilateral frontal lobes compared to childhood (5 weeks), whereas metabolism decreased in the posterior cerebrum, thalamus, and cerebellum. Metabolic network components extracted using ICA were default-mode, limbic, motor, and somatosensory ones, which have been regarded as important functional components also in humans. Further connectivity analyses using VOIs put on these components showed connection strength increased particularly in the anterior-posterior connections during maturation. This connection strength increase was accompanied by increased energy efficiency in the midline structures including medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices. Our work suggested large-scale functional networks matured to increase anterior-posterior long-distance connections and achieved energetically efficient wiring in the midline structures during maturation from childhood via adolescence to early adulthood.</p> <p>Voxelwise comparison revealed metabolism increase in bilateral frontal cortices during maturation, prominent during 510 weeks of ages, which complied with previous perfusion studies. A study using <sup>99m</sup>Tc-HMPAO SPECT showed perfusion increase in the neocortex at juvenile to young adult periods in mice, particularly in frontal lobes relative to the cerebellum and subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apostolova et al., 2012</xref>). In humans, perfusion was lower in the neonates’ neocortex while higher in the basal ganglia and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fockele et al., 1990</xref>). Additionally, positive correlation was found between age and frontal lobe perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuji et al., 1999</xref>). FDG PET studies in human showed significantly higher metabolism mostly in anterior cingulate and thalamus before 25-year-old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Bogaert et al., 1998</xref>) and linear metabolism increase from the age of 115 in prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kang et al., 2004</xref>). As a first study in terms of longitudinal age-related brain metabolism in rats, our findings of age-related frontal metabolism increase corresponded to human PET findings as well as perfusion studies in rodents.</p> <p>Analysis of metabolic network are based on the sequential coupling of neuronal activity, brain metabolism, and blood flow, which more closely represent the neuronal networks than blood flow networks. Because metabolic activity measured by FDG uptake reflects the cumulative energy consumption in steady states, while BOLD signal from fMRI reflects fast temporal fluctuation of physiologic factors such as blood flow, blood oxygenation, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, the metabolic network provides distinct information from the functional network on fMRI as well as from the structural network disclosed on diffusion tensor imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wehrl et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, network construction using neuronal activity-coupled metabolism found on FDG PET could take regional metabolic activities into account to disclose energy efficiency rather than only concentrate on the changes of fluctuating neural activities without considering absolute amount of regional perfusion or metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hyder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2002</xref>).</p> <p>Using metabolic network analyses, we could identify networks of rat brains similar to humans using ICA. In human brains, ICA for metabolic networks revealed DMN successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Toussaint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yakushev et al., 2013</xref>). We also found homologous patterns in rats to those of humans. According to the studies comparing the networks acquired from fMRI and PET, each DMN from these modalities shared quite the similar anatomical regions, although distinctive patterns were found on these two modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wehrl et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, our PET-derived IC5 shared the regions of fMRI-derived DMN including retrosplenial cortices and small clusters of bilateral posterior hippocampi. The IC1 shared the regions of anterior part of DMN derived from fMRI, medial frontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that DMN-related regions are deactivated during attention-demanding and working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>), DMN may be constructed during brain maturation in adolescence to learn attention-demanding tasks. Previous human studies on the fMRI-derived functional networks revealed connectivity increase in DMN regions during maturation, particularly between the anterior and posterior midline structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fair et al., 2008</xref>), which might be closely associated with the developmental process of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, fMRI-derived DMN showed two distinctive clusters, temporal-prefrontal and parietal subsystems, which considerably corresponded to our IC1 and IC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). According to our results, the metabolic connections of these two clusters of DMN developed during brain maturation in rats. In spite of homologous network patterns of rat brain, metabolic networks derived from FDG PET were partly different from fMRI-derived networks. A discrepancy in DMN between fMRI and PET was also reported in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2012</xref>). In PET-derived networks in the rat brain, anterior and posterior part of DMN was separately extracted (IC1 and IC5). Furthermore, cingulate cortex was rarely included in IC1 or IC5, which was different from previous fMRI-derived DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sierakowiak et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, a hub region of posterior part of rat DMN was retrosplenial cortex and that of anterior part was medial prefrontal cortex in fMRI study, which corresponded to PET-derived IC5 and IC1, respectively.</p> <p>During connectivity maturation, metabolic connections between component VOIs strengthened, particularly in anterior-posterior long-distance ones. Along with increased long-distance connections, the retrosplenial and medial prefrontal cortices showed efficient energy consumption. This maturation pattern may represent enhancement of efficiency of information flow between network components, which has been suggested in human brain maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stevens et al., 2009</xref>). The strengthened connections between long-distance network components are likely to support dynamically organizing brain networks to achieve efficient connections according to cognitive demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bullmore and Sporns, 2012</xref>). The functional interactions of large-scale brain networks are dynamically evolving, which could be associated with cognitive, behavioral developments during maturation and pathophysiology of brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deco et al., 2011</xref>). In this investigation using metabolic connectivity analysis, we could localize the components, that is, medial prefrontal and retrosplenial areas, showing strengthened connections and at the same time enhanced connection efficiencies.</p> <p>Cognitive developments demand highly connected functional brain networks, particularly in hub regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Micheloyannis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013</xref>). They could accompany high-energy consumption in spite of limited supply of glucose for brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tomasi et al., 2013</xref>). Our results of increased energy efficiency in retrosplenial and medial prefrontal cortex imply long-distance connectivity maturation coincide with the redistribution of energy consumption. High-energy efficiency in hubs was previously reported in adult human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tomasi et al., 2013</xref>), which was recapitulated in our study in rats, and we also found that their high efficiency developed during brain maturation. Comprehensively, large-scale networks are formed during adolescent period accompanied by these networks’ efficient energy consumption for long-distance connectivity. As deficits in these relationships are found in several brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Broyd et al., 2009</xref>), metabolic network analyses might be used to find the relevant functional connectivity abnormalities. Specifically, the hub regions are well known as culprit components for several developmental and degenerative brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fornito et al., 2015</xref>). Our results could explain the underlying biological background of the vulnerability that hub regions might be easily influenced by developmental problems in reconfiguration of metabolic connectivity efficiency.</p> <p>To find the disease-related abnormalities differentiated from normal developmental changes in neurological or psychiatric disorders, we need to characterize first the normal developmental patterns of metabolic networks. Although metabolic networks have advantages to reveal steady-state connectivity in longer term scale than resting fMRI, it is difficult to perform longitudinally repeated PET in the growing normal children. And thus, our findings in rats of maturational changes of metabolic connectivity can be referred to as surrogates, considering the homology between humans and rats in network components disclosed by ICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wehrl et al., 2013</xref>).</p> <p>Although rat brains have similar features of metabolic network to human brains, there are several technical issues of interest. Unlike human studies, rats should be anesthetized during either FDG injection or image acquisition. Since anesthesia could affect brain metabolism, rats were awake after the injection until imaging to minimize the anesthesia effects. The images acquired from small animal PET had the voxel size of 0.3875 mm and physical spatial resolution of PET scanner is more than 1 mm due to positron range and acollinearity. Thus, we were afraid that it might prevent the delineation of network components during ICA. However, despite this limited spatial resolution, the brain regions with specific covariance patterns were identified and further metabolic connectivity analyses were finally feasible to provide characteristic pattern of brain maturation.</p> <sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title> <p>We showed that metabolic activity of rat brain matured to build connectivity between network components accompanied by enhanced energy efficiency from childhood to early adulthood. Metabolism increased during adolescence in frontal cortices compared to childhood in rat brain similarly to that in human brain. Components of metabolic networks were identified, and connectivity analysis showed efficient connection developed between the components particularly pair of VOIs including DMN during adolescent period. Furthermore, the midline structures showed increase in energy efficiency of metabolic connections. This study about metabolic network maturation gave insights into normal brain developments and might elucidate the plausible pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric developmental diseases.</p></sec> </sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title> <sec id="s4-1"><title>FDG PET for animals</title> <p>Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Koatech, Seoul, Korea) were used for FDG PET scans.

All the experimental procedures were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Seoul National University Hospital (IACUC Number 13–0224). FDG PET images were acquired at the age of 5, 10, and 15 weeks. PET scans were performed on a dedicated small animal PET/CT scanner (eXplore VISTA, GE Healthcare, WI). Rats were fasted for at least 8 hr before the start of the study. Rats were anesthetized 2% isoflurane at 1–1.5 L/min oxygen flow for 5–10 min. After an intravenous bolus injection (0.3–0.5 mL/rat) of FDG (100–150 MBq/kg), each rat has 45 min period of FDG uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schiffer et al., 2007</xref>).

For statistical comparison of correlation matrices between these groups of different ages, we performed permutation tests. We tested whether there was significantly different connectivity, represented by Fisher-transformed Z values, between 5 vs 10 weeks and 10 vs 15 weeks of age. At first, PET images of each age group were randomly permuted to make pseudo-random groups reassigned 10,000 times and from each paired group of rats, interregional correlation matrices were calculated.

The studies would not have been possible to conduct in humans. Yet some concerns remain to be addressed.</p><p>Please explain how the large size total VOI (8 mmm radius) affects the spatial certainty for the results.</p><p>While you argue that you are studying the default mode network (DMN), some of the core regions of the DFM, the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, are not included.

Other studies in rats using even larger voxels (0.5 mm-cubed) have defined the cingulate cortex (Sireakowiak et al., PLoS One, 2015). Please explain why you don’t use IC in the DFM when you aim to study that network.</p><p>All of these changes will clarify and improve your manuscript. None of these changes require additional data to be obtained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, FDG-PET was used to define metabolically active networks in the developing rat brain. They examined totally 30 rats at 5, 10 and 15 weeks of age and used independent component analysis to define the nodes in the networks. VOI-based correlation analyses was used to compare the changes of brain metabolic connectivity according to age.</p><p>In 5 week-old rats, energy efficiency was lower in midline structures (medial prefrontal and retrosplenial cortices) than in sensorimotor cortices. At 10 and 15 weeks-of-age, energy efficiency of the midline structures (here defined as components of the default mode network) almost reached those of the sensorimotor cortices. The authors conclude that metabolic activity in the rat brain matured to build connectivity between network components accompanied by enhanced energy efficiency from childhood to early adulthood.</p><p>This study combines FDG PET and ICA to study a new topic. The results are in line with previous fMRI results showing in humans showing that sensorimotor networks develop before default mode network and other higher order networks. The results add new information on the normal brain development of metabolic activity that might have relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders. The studies would not have been possible to conduct in humans, as correctly argued in the manuscript.</p><p>1) I would like the authors to explain how the large size total VOI (8 mmm radius) affects the spatial certainty for the results, when it comes to certain networks.</p><p>2) Along the same line, my major concern is that the authors argue that they study the default mode network, but actually some of the core regions of the default mode network, the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, are not included. The authors state in the Results section that independent component 5 included the &quot;retrosplenial cortex, anatomically adjacent to the posterior cingulate and precuneus in human as cores of DMN&quot;. Other studies in rats using even larger voxels (0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>) have defined the cingulate cortex (Sireakowiak et al., 2015 for example). I would like the authors to explain why they don’t use IC in the DFM when they aim to study that network.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper studies the interesting effect of metabolic information derived from FDG-PET imaging data in rats. Rats (n=30) were followed for 15 weeks and scanned in 5 week intervals. The authors show a reconfiguration of brain networks, derived from static PET imaging data. Metabolic connectivity mapping (Cometomics) is a very new technique, and no firm standards have been established so far. The applied methodology as well as animal number is appropriate. The results, based on ICA and graph based analysis are reasonable. The Discussion is also reasonable and covers many different aspects, albeit it could be more detailed especially regarding the possible origins of metabolic connectivity. In conclusion, this article is a valuable contribution to the field of brain connectivity mapping, especially since it uses metabolic information.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11571.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) I would like the authors to explain how the large size total VOI (8 mmm radius) affects the spatial certainty for the results, when it comes to certain networks.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s comment with regard to the size of VOI. As images were rescaled (10 times) during initial preprocessing step for the further spatial registration process on SPM, the actual size of VOI was 0.8 mm. For rescaling process, only image header information was changed. We corrected some sentences to clarify the real size of VOIs.</p><p>The size was small to represent each network and anatomical region and not to overlap different networks. Furthermore, since initial voxel size was 0.3875 x 0.3875 x 0.775, we selected the spherical VOI with 0.8 mm radius which is larger than an initial voxel. We described this in the manuscript, which now reads:</p><p>“The total 8 VOIs (3 on IC1, 1 on IC5, 2 on IC8 and IC9) were defined as spheres with a radius of 8 mm, centered at each IC (The actual size of a radius was 0.8 mm as voxels were scaled by a factor of 10). The size of VOI was determined considering initial voxel size (0.775 mm) and a representative small cluster of a network not to overlap other networks.&quot; (Materials and methods)</p><p>“Eight volume-of-interests (VOIs) were defined as spheres with a radius of 0.8 mm (actual size), located on each of independent components (IC).” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> legend)</p><p><italic>2) Along the same line, my major concern is that the authors argue that they study the default mode network, but actually some of the core regions of the default mode network, the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, are not included.

I would like the authors to explain why they don’t use IC in the DFM when they aim to study that network.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out an important issue with regard to the default mode network in this study. Some previous studies tried to extract DMN using fMRI in a rodent brain, which extracted midline structures including medial frontal, cingulate, retrosplenial cortex and parts of hippocampus. Sireakowiak et al. (Plos One, 2015) used a seed placed on cingulate to extract DMN which naturally include cingulate cortex. Rat DMN derived from fMRI using ICA (Lu et al., PNAS, 2012) extracted quite similar structures. The ICA derived result revealed that hub regions were retrosplenial cortex (for posterior DMN) and medial prefrontal cortex (for anterior DMN), which corresponded to our ICs. Because of the results of DMN hubs in rats, task-related network patterns have been studied using these two regions (for example, Jennifer Li, et al., J Neurosci., 2015), retrosplenial and medial frontal cortices regarded as cores of DMN. The previous reports implied that these two hub regions in the rodent brain could functionally correspond to hubs of DMN in human brain, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and anterior medial frontal cortex. Therefore, in our study, ICs which include these two anatomical regions were considered for further analysis.</p><p>Although PET-based ICs shared regions with previously reported fMRI-based networks, discrepancy was also found in our study. This discrepancy has been also reported in human. However, physiological background of this discrepancy is still unknown. According to the reviewer’s comment, we discussed these issues seriously in the manuscript, which now reads:</p><p>“Of note, our PET-derived IC5 shared the regions of fMRI-derived DMN including retrosplenial cortices and small clusters of bilateral posterior hippocampi. The IC1 shared the regions of anterior part of DMN derived from fMRI, medial frontal cortices.” (Discussion, fourth paragraph)</p><p>“In spite of homologous network patterns of rat brain, metabolic networks derived from FDG PET were partly different from fMRI-derived networks. […] Nevertheless, a hub region of posterior part of rat DMN was retrosplenial cortex and that of anterior part was medial prefrontal cortex in fMRI study, which corresponded to PET-derived IC5 and IC1, respectively.” (Discussion, same paragraph)</p><p>“IC5 included the retrosplenial cortex, known as a hub of posterior DMN in rats (Lu et al., 2012). It is anatomically adjacent to the posterior cingulate and precuneus in human as cores of DMN (Raichle et al., 2001).” (Results)</p></body></sub-article></article>
