In plants, prominent examples are the receptor kinases FLS2 and BRI1, which activate immunity and steroid-mediated growth, respectively. Intriguingly, despite inducing distinct signalling outputs, both receptors employ common downstream signalling components, which exist in plasma membrane (PM)-localised protein complexes. An important question is thus how these receptor complexes maintain signalling specificity. Live-cell imaging revealed that FLS2 and BRI1 form PM nanoclusters. Using single-particle tracking we could discriminate both cluster populations and we observed spatiotemporal separation between immune and growth signalling platforms. This finding was confirmed by visualising FLS2 and BRI1 within distinct PM nanodomains marked by specific remorin proteins and differential co-localisation with the cytoskeleton. Our results thus suggest that signalling specificity between these pathways may be explained by the spatial separation of FLS2 and BRI1 with their associated signalling components within dedicated PM nanodomains.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25114.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25114.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25114.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Unlike most animals, plants cannot move away if their environment changes for the worse. Instead, a plant must sense these changes and respond appropriately, for example by changing how much it grows. Disease-causing microbes in the immediate environment represent another potential threat to plants. To detect these microbes, plant cells have proteins called “pattern recognition receptors” in their surface membranes that sense certain molecules from the microbes (similar receptors are found in animals too). When a receptor protein recognises one such microbial molecule, it becomes activated and forms a complex with other proteins referred to as co-receptors. The protein complex then sends a signal into the cell to trigger an immune response.</p><p>Plants also use similar receptor proteins to sense their own signalling molecules and regulate their growth and development. These growth-related receptors rely on many of the same co-receptors and signalling components as the immunity-related receptors. This posed the question: how can plant cells use the same proteins to trigger different responses to different signals?</p><p>Bücherl et al. have now used high-resolution microscopy and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> to show that the plant’s immune receptors and growth receptors are found in separate clusters at the plant cell’s surface membrane. These clusters are only a few hundred nanometres wide, and they also contained other signalling components that are needed to quickly relay the signals into the plant cell.</p><p>Bücherl et al. suggest that, by organizing their receptors into these physically distinct clusters, plant cells can use similar proteins to sense different signals and respond in then different ways. This idea will need to be tested in future studies. Further work is also needed to understand how these clusters of signalling proteins are assembled and inserted at specific locations within the surface membrane of a plant cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25114.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25114.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>microdomain</kwd><kwd>receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robatzek</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><name><surname>MacLean</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Zipfel</surname><given-names>Cyril</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zipfel</surname><given-names>Cyril</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universitat Bayern</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarsch</surname><given-names>Iris K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although genetically and biochemically linked, the plant immune and growth receptors FLS2 and BRI1 form dispersed receptor clusters within the plasma membrane that are spatiotemporally separated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular organisms employ cell-surface receptors for surveying the environment and adjusting to changing physiological conditions. In plants, the repertoire of cell surface receptors has been considerably expanded and receptor kinases (RKs) form one of the largest protein families with over 600 members in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter, Arabidopsis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shiu and Bleecker, 2001</xref>). The schematic architecture of plant RKs is similar to that of animal receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); comprising an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane helix, and an intracellular kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shiu and Bleecker, 2001</xref>). Prominent examples of plant RKs are the immune receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gómez-Gómez and Boller, 2000</xref>) and the growth receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clouse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li and Chory, 1997</xref>). FLS2 is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that perceives the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flg22, an immunogenic epitope of bacterial flagellin, to initiate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Felix et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zipfel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chinchilla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). BRI1 binds brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of phytohormones involved in various aspects of plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Singh and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite their different biological functions, FLS2- and BRI1-mediated signalling pathways share several similarities, in particular at or close to the plasma membrane (PM). The PM is the cellular compartment, where both receptors localise to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robatzek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedrichsen et al., 2000</xref>), where they bind their respective ligands flg22 or BRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gómez-Gómez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kinoshita et al., 2005</xref>), and where presumably their main signalling activity is executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Irani et al., 2012</xref>). Although FLS2 and BRI1 are competent for ligand binding via their extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, they rely on SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) co-receptors for signalling initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nam and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gou et al., 2012</xref>), which are also LRR-RKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aan den Toorn et al., 2015</xref>). Structural and biochemical analysis of FLS2- and BRI1-SERK hetero-oligomers revealed that flg22 and BRs act as ‘molecular glues’ that stabilise or induce receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">She et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hothorn et al., 2011</xref>). Ligand binding additionally triggers auto- and trans-phosphorylation events within the receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and, in the case of BRI1, also the release of inhibitory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang and Chory, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jaillais et al., 2011</xref>). After gaining their full kinase activities, FLS2 and BRI1 receptor complexes initiate phosphorylation cascades that culminate in flg22- or BR-responsive transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The relay of phosphorylation signals from the PM to the nucleus involves receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) that can associate to the PM and that are direct substrates of the ligand-binding receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belkhadir and Jaillais, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couto and Zipfel, 2016</xref>). Similar to the SERK co-receptors, the RLCKs BRASSINOSTEROID SIGNALING KINASE 1 (BSK1) and BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) are common signalling components in both pathways. Whereas BSK1 is a positive regulator for both signalling routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shi et al., 2013</xref>), BIK1 is a positive regulator for PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), but a negative regulator for BR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Even though FLS2- and BRI1-mediated signalling pathways have been extensively studied genetically and biochemically, little is known about how FLS2 and BRI1 are organised within the PM and how these two receptors fulfil their sensory activity at the cell periphery. In contrast to the original fluid mosaic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singer and Nicolson, 1972</xref>), which considered the PM as a two-dimensional liquid composed of a lipid bilayer that is interspersed by integral or associated proteins, it is nowadays accepted that the PM is a highly structured and dynamic cellular compartment organised at three hierarchic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kusumi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nicolson, 2014</xref>). The first level of PM organisation is characterised by the interaction of the lipid bilayer with the underlying cortical cytoskeleton, the second level by protein-lipid interactions with the PM, and the third level of PM organisation is the result of protein-protein interactions that lead to formation of PM-associated or -integral homo- and hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kusumi et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>e.g.</italic> FLS2- or BRI1-SERK3/BAK1 complexes. In plants, the cell wall has additional influence on the PM organisation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martinière et al., 2012</xref>). As a consequence, lateral mobility and distribution of lipids and proteins within the PM is highly heterogeneous leading to the formation of dynamic protein clusters and PM sub-compartments with different shapes and sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaqaman and Grinstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Ziomkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). Each compartment or domain provides specific biophysical and biochemical environments for its residents and thus directly influences associated signalling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kusumi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Saka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia-Parajo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tapken and Murphy, 2015</xref>).</p><p>With regard to PM signalling, specialised PM areas often referred to as PM nanodomains have attracted particular attention. For example, EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR (EGFR), a mammalian RTK, forms clusters that co-localise with PM nanodomains, and EGFR cluster formation depends on the integrity of the PM lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). A recent report showed that BRI1 also localises to PM nano- or micro-domains in Arabidopsis roots and that partitioning of BRI1 into different PM microdomains is crucial for BR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the numerous similarities between BRI1 and FLS2 signalling initiation, we were interested in elucidating the localisation patterns of these two LRR-RKs in a comparative fashion within the highly structured PM of plant cells.</p><p>Here, we investigated the steady-state PM organisation of FLS2 and BRI1 receptors using live-cell imaging, single-particle tracking and quantitative co-localisation analysis in the PM of leaf epidermal cells, a cell file, in which both receptors are similarly expressed. Our results showed that FLS2 and BRI1 are heterogeneously distributed and that both receptors form transient receptor clusters. Although the spatial characteristics of FLS2 and BRI1 receptor clusters were similar, we observed differences in their dynamic behaviour with FLS2 clusters being more stable. Moreover, we detected only a limited overlap between the two receptor populations. This finding was confirmed by visualising FLS2 and BRI1 clusters within distinct remorin-labelled PM nanodomains. We additionally investigated the PM localisation patterns of BSK1 and BIK1 in complex with the two ligand-binding LRR-RKs. Imaging of FLS2 and BRI1 signalling complexes revealed a confined PM localisation and cluster formation. Importantly, BIK1 signalling complexes localised differentially, whereby BRI1-BIK1, but not FLS2-BIK1, complexes associated with cortical microtubules. Together, our data suggest that the distinct spatiotemporal localisation of FLS2 and BRI1 within specialised PM nanodomains may contribute to signalling specificity between immune and growth signalling mediated by these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FLS2 and BRI1 form receptor clusters within the PM</title><p>To obtain an overview of the PM distribution of FLS2 and BRI1, we investigated two stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines that express the C-terminally GFP-tagged receptors under their native promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Göhre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geldner et al., 2007</xref>). Live-cell imaging using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that FLS2 and BRI1 were heterogeneously distributed within the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Both receptors formed dispersed punctate structures with increased fluorescence intensities. This local concentration of FLS2 and BRI1 subpopulations within the PM indicates the formation of receptor clusters, a phenomenon known from mammalian transmembrane receptors or helper proteins, such as EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>) or LINKER OF ACTIVATED T CELLS (LAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Su et al., 2016</xref>).

FLS2 and BRI1 clusters often aligned in pearl chain-like structures and interconnected lines with low fluorescence intensities frequently separated by PM areas containing several receptor clusters, in particular for FLS2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>It is known that the cytoskeleton influences the hierarchic PM organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kusumi et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore we visualised FLS2 and BRI1 in the presence of actin and microtubule markers. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, pearl chain-like aligned FLS2 and BRI1 clusters often coincided with the underlying actin cytoskeleton, whereas the interconnected lines with low fluorescence intensities overlapped with cortical microtubule filaments, both in Arabidopsis and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p><p>Next, we quantified the size and density of individual receptor clusters. The mean values (± standard deviation) for FLS2 receptor cluster diameters were 356 ± 49 nm and 387 ± 55 nm in Arabidopsis and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, respectively, compared to 372 ± 38 nm in Arabidopsis and 392 ± 37 nm in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> for BRI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although there was a slight trend towards increased receptor cluster sizes in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, no statistical difference was observed. On average, we observed 2.21 ± 0.33 FLS2 clusters in Arabidopsis and 2.23 ± 0.26 in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> per µm<sup>2</sup>, whereas the densities of BRI1 clusters were 2.02 ± 0.27 and 2.43 ± 0.39 per µm<sup>2</sup> in Arabidopsis and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, based on our confocal micrograph analysis, FLS2 and BRI1 showed similar spatial features. Both LRR-RKs were heterogeneously distributed within the PM and formed receptor clusters of comparable size and density. Only a difference with regard to the exclusion of receptor clusters from PM areas by cortical microtubules was observed, with FLS2 being more strongly affected.</p><p>In addition to confocal microscopy, we applied variable angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM) to further characterise the dynamic behaviour of PM-localised FLS2 and BRI1 receptors. VAEM is a technique related to total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vizcay-Barrena et al., 2011</xref>). In comparison to CLSM, VAEM has the advantages of improved z-resolution and fast image acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vizcay-Barrena et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore VAEM is ideal for studying protein localisation and protein dynamics within or close to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vizcay-Barrena et al., 2011</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, single frame VAEM images resembled our observations made using CLSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). We repeatedly observed dispersed FLS2- and BRI1-GFP clusters in the PM of Arabidopsis or <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells. However, using VAEM we were able to acquire image time series (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). Micrograph analysis using kymograph representations revealed increased stability and reduced mobility for FLS2-GFP compared to BRI1-GFP clusters, both in Arabidopsis and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These observations were confirmed using single-particle tracking. BRI1-GFP showed a trend towards increased lateral cluster displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and FLS2-GFP showed an increased population of long-lived receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Additionally, we noticed that some FLS2 and BRI1 clusters suddenly appeared or disappeared from the PM. These observations most likely reflect constitutive exo- and endocytosis processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25114.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>FLS2 receptor clusters are more stable than BRI1 clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Plasma membrane localisation of FLS2-GFP (<bold>A</bold>) and BRI-GFP (<bold>B</bold>) in epidermal cells of Arabidopsis seedling cotyledons.

Quantitative image analysis and visual image inspection indicated independent cluster populations but similar co-localisation behaviour for BSK1 in complex with FLS2 and BRI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).

We showed that both ligand-binding receptors are heterogeneously distributed due to the formation of transient receptor clusters. We observed that FLS2 and BRI1 clusters undergo different dynamics but that ligand availability reduces lateral cluster mobility in both cases. Moreover, we could visualise receptor clusters for both LRR-RKs within distinct PM nanodomains and differential PM localisation for steady-state FLS2- and BRI1 signalling complexes. Taken together, our findings emphasise a model of signalling pathway-specific pools of downstream components and suggest that spatial separation of immune and growth signalling platforms may contribute to the generation of signalling specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Plants and animals employ cell surface receptors for the perception of various extracellular signals like hormones or PAMPs. In Arabidopsis, the immune receptor FLS2 and the growth receptor BRI1 represent two of the best-studied transmembrane receptors. Genetic and biochemical studies have linked extracellular ligand binding to the generation of specific flg22- or BR-triggered physiological responses. However, little is known about the organisation of these two receptors within the PM, the compartment where both LRR-RKs perceive their ligands and initiate their signalling cascades. Here, we provide evidence that FLS2 and BRI1 are heterogeneously distributed within the PM by formation of distinct PM nanodomain-localised receptor clusters. In addition, we show that the RLCKs BSK1 and BIK1 also form PM clusters, and that FLS2- and BRI1-BIK1 complexes localise differentially.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Somssich et al. (2015)</xref> reported a comparative study that investigated PM-associated signalling principles of plant RKs. Using the flg22- and CLAVATA3 (CLV3)-triggered pathways as examples for plant immune and growth signalling, they addressed the receptor/co-receptor association prior and during signalling initiation. Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Somssich et al. (2015)</xref> revealed that the initiation of FLS2-mediated signalling strictly relies on ligand-induced complex formation between FLS2 and SERKs. In contrast, CLV-mediated signalling was found to depend on preformed receptor/co-receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Somssich et al., 2015</xref>), in line with findings for the BRI1-BAK1 association in Arabidopsis roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bücherl et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the association between receptors and co-receptors, but also BAK1 and its negative regulator BIR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Halter et al., 2014</xref>), occurs in clusters or subdomains of the PM, further emphasising our observations presented here.</p><p>Formation of PM receptor clusters is a well-known phenomenon for mammalian receptors like T-cell receptors (TCRs) or EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dinic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Su et al., 2016</xref>). The RTK EGFR constitutively undergoes clustering and EGFR clusters play important roles in cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clayton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paviolo et al., 2015</xref>). Using super-resolution microscopy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al. (2015)</xref> showed that EGFR clusters localise to PM nanodomains and that cluster formation relies on the integrity of the PM lipidome since sterol depletion of the PM using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) disrupts clustering. Similar observations have recently been made for BRI1 in Arabidopsis roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al. (2015)</xref> observed that BRI1 localises to FLOT1- and clathrin heavy chain (CHC)-labelled PM nanodomains and that partitioning of BRI1 into PM nanodomains as well as the PM lipidome are crucial for BR responses. These findings are in line with our observations for FLS2 and BRI1 in epidermal leaf cells since MβCD treatment also affected FLS2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, both LRR-RKs constitutively formed PM receptor clusters that were influenced by the PM lipid-composition and localised to PM nanodomains labelled by distinct REM protein markers. However, the differential co-localisation to specific PM nanodomains allowed us to discriminate FLS2 and BRI1 receptor clusters, thus indicating their spatial separation within the PM.</p><p>Clustering of PM receptors is thought to provide a mechanism for modulating intermolecular interactions and for fine-tuning signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bray et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abulrob et al., 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsieh et al., 2010</xref> reported that EGFR clustering enhances the recruitment of downstream signalling components. Interestingly, we not only observed cluster formation for FLS2 and BRI1, but also for their downstream signalling components BSK1 and BIK1, as well as for the respective RK-RLCK complexes. We propose that similar mechanisms as described for EGFR may also account for FLS2- and BRI1-mediated signalling, and, furthermore, that clustering of PM proteins is a more general organising principle for plant PM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Demir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In fact, in animal cells, most lipids and proteins are heterogeneously distributed across the PM due to intermolecular interactions that generate inhomogeneities of varying size and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaqaman and Grinstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Saka et al., 2014</xref>). Besides molecular interactions among PM constituents, the cortical cytoskeleton influences the formation and/or stability of PM nanodomains in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Plowman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chichili and Rodgers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jaumouillé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dinic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Szymanski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Su et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, we repeatedly observed close association between FLS2 and BRI1 clusters with actin filaments. Though, it is currently unclear how or whether actin contributes to the formation and/or stability or FLS2 and BRI1 clusters. It was however shown previously that actin-myosin function is required for flg22-induced endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a contribution to PM nanodomain formation, cortical cytoskeleton components also affect lateral mobility of PM proteins in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chichili and Rodgers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaqaman and Grinstein, 2012</xref>). However, in plant cells, it seems that the cell wall is mainly responsible for restricting movements of PM proteins within the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martinière et al., 2012</xref>). Similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martinière et al. (2012)</xref>, we observed very limited dynamics of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters within the PM. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al. (2014)</xref>, which described various different localisation patterns for the REM protein family in plant PMs, revealed that the clusters of these PM-associated proteins also hardly undergo lateral movements. Since REMs bind to the inner leaflet of PMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Konrad et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore cannot directly interact with the extracellular cell wall, a restrictive influence of the cortical cytoskeleton on the lateral PM mobility should not be excluded.</p><p>Our quantification of FLS2 and BRI1 cluster densities and sizes yielded similar values as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al. (2014)</xref> for REM nanodomains. With around two clusters per µm<sup>2</sup>, the detected cluster densities were slightly higher than determined for the REM nanodomain markers, which range from 0.1 to 1 per µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al., 2014</xref>). Although we revealed cluster diameters in the range of approximately 250–500 nm that are again in line with the dimensions of REM PM nanodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al., 2014</xref>), we assume that the actual size of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters is smaller. Similar to our observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Demir et al. (2013)</xref> reported PM nanodomain sizes of ca. 250 nm for the potato REM1.3 when visualized by CLSM. However, subsequent analysis of these protein clusters using the super-resolution imaging method STED (stimulated emission depletion) led to more confined dimensions of around 100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Demir et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Even though the spatial features of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters were comparable and similar to REM proteins, we observed major differences for the dynamics of protein clusters, both among the transmembrane receptors and with regard to REM proteins. In contrast to the high stability of REM nanodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jarsch et al., 2014</xref>), the lifetimes of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters were much shorter and they exhibited a more dynamic behaviour. Furthermore, comparison between FLS2 and BRI1 populations revealed that the PRR clusters were characterized by increased stability under steady-state conditions. The low lateral mobility of the two LRR-RK cluster populations and the observation of subpopulations with higher displacement values are in line with the recent report of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al. (2015)</xref>. They described two subpopulations for BRI1 with low and high lateral mobility, respectively, in the PM of epidermal root cells. Under steady-state conditions, the majority of BRI1 receptors underwent only short-range movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), similar to our results for epidermal leaf cells. In stark contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al. (2015)</xref> are our observations of reduced cluster mobility for FLS2 and BRI1 receptors in the presence of their respective ligands. However, our observations are in line with a previous report about FLS2 in Arabidopsis protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2007</xref>) and with findings for the mammalian PM receptor EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Low-Nam et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, increased receptor confinement in response to ligand binding may be a more general phenomenon for cell surface receptors. A plausible explanation for reduced lateral mobility is the well-established formation or stabilisation of receptor (hetero-)oligomers within the PM for activation of signal transduction as previously reported for FLS2 and BRI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chinchilla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Somssich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bücherl et al., 2013</xref>). The low lateral mobility of PM proteins in general and the additional confinement in response to ligands also suggests a ligand-independent pre-organisation of receptors and/or signalling units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martinière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abulrob et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sandor et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al. (2015)</xref> also showed that BRI1 receptors co-localise with the PM nanodomain marker FLOT1. Since proteomic studies previously revealed that REM1.2 and REM1.3 are phosphorylated and enriched in detergent-resistance membranes in a flg22-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benschop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Keinath et al., 2010</xref>), we used several REM proteins as references for investigating the localisation of FLS2 and BRI1 to PM nanodomains. The identified differential co-localisation of the two transmembrane receptors with four different REM markers clearly demonstrated that both FLS2 and BRI1 clusters reside within PM nanodomains. Combined with our hypothesis of an interplay between receptor clusters and the cortical cytoskeleton, these findings are in agreement with the three-tiered hierarchical PM organization model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kusumi et al. (2011)</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, the visualisation of the two LRR-RKs in different PM nanodomains underlined our results obtained by FLS2-BRI1 co-localisation that indicated a spatial separation for immune and growth receptors in plant PMs in steady-state conditions. The visualisation of FLS2 and BRI1 signalling complexes additionally confirmed these results. In particular, we found that BRI1-BIK1, but not FLS2-BIK1, complexes associated with cortical microtubules. Cortical microtubules are also anchor-points for the cellulose synthase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paredez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, activation of BR signalling has an immediate effect on cell wall morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elgass et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, a link between microtubule-associated BRI1-BIK1 complexes and BR-induced cell wall changes may exist. Interestingly, BIK1 fulfils opposing roles for BR and immune signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas BIK1 is a positive regulator of FLS2-mediated signalling by connecting, for example, ligand perception to ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2014</xref>), BIK1 negatively regulates BRI1-mediated cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Based on our observations, this differential signalling specificity may be encoded in differential protein complex localisation (and composition) at the PM.</p><p>Only 5–10% of BRI1 receptor molecules are actively involved in BR signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van Esse et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, hyper-activation of BRI1 by exogenous application of BRs results in only a partial mobility shift of BRI1, whereas its chemical or genetic inactivation only affects a subpopulation of BRI1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the observation that only a subset of FLS2 receptors are present in steady-state complexes with their downstream substrates BIK1 and BSK1, in what could be defined as pre-formed signalling platforms, correlates with the previous observation that flg22 binding to only a small subset of receptors is required for inducing a saturating response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meindl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest a spatial separation of FLS2 and BRI1 signalling platforms under steady-state conditions. These findings demonstrate the existence of pathway-specific signalling component pools as previously postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Halter et al., 2014</xref>). The establishment of physically separated signalling units is an economically favourable concept for plant cells, since common signalling components can be employed along different and even antagonistic signal transduction routes. We propose that the spatiotemporal separation of FLS2 and BRI1 signalling platforms in steady-state conditions is a means to generate signalling specificity between the two pathways upon ligand perception, in addition to potential differential phosphorylation of common signalling components (<italic>e.g.</italic> SERK3/BAK1, BIK1, and BSK1). Whether differential phosphorylation of common signalling components in fact is a consequence of spatially separated signalling complexes will be investigated in future studies, besides the composition and stoichiometry of distinct PM signalling pools.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt medium containing 1% sucrose and 0.8% agar with a 16 hr photoperiod at 22°C. <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants were soil-grown under a photoperiod of 16 hr and at 22°C.</p><p>We used the previously published Arabidopsis lines Col-0/pFLS2::FLS2-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Göhre et al., 2008</xref>), Col-0/pBRI1::BRI1-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geldner et al., 2007</xref>), and Col-0/p35S::mCherry-TUA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutierrez et al., 2009</xref>).

The final p-values were obtained by multiplying the <italic>t</italic>-test results with a Bonferroni factor of 2. For the comparison of FLS2 and BRI1 two-tailed heteroscedastic <italic>t</italic>-tests were applied. For the comparison of original and rotated images two-tailed homoscedastic t-tests were applied. For time series experiments one-tailed heteroscedastic <italic>t-</italic>tests were applied. The results of t-tests and final p-values were based on the analysis of the corresponding mean values for respective independent biological experiments. The presented mean values are in the units shown in the respective figures. ‘SD’ stands for standard deviation based on the technical replicates. ‘At’ stands for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and ‘Nb’ stands for <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. ‘FLS2/BSK1’, ‘BRI1/BSK1’, ‘FLS2/BIK1’, and ‘BRI1/BIK1’ represent the respective BiFC complexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

However, the referees also raised a number of technical and conceptual concerns about your work that due to their substantial nature prohibit a more positive decision for the moment.

This would have allowed to compare truly non-stimulated BRI1 and FLS2 pathways. Although the referees acknowledge that your work did not attempt to study the fate of individual receptor complexes post stimulation, there was consensus that such data would have substantially increased the impact of your study for the field and beyond. In the light of these concerns, I regret to say that we cannot be more supportive at this point.

However, they share common co-receptor SERKs. In addition, different members of RLCKs function differentially downstream of the RLK complexes. How the signaling specificity is governed at the RLK level is not clear. This work examined how FLS2 and BRI1 distribute on the PM mainly by imaging the GFP or mCherry-tagged proteins without ligand treatments. They concluded that FLS2 and BRI1 are in PM nanoclusters, majority of which are in a spatially not over-lapping manner at the steady state. FLS2, but not BRI1, co-localizes with specific remorin protein-markers for certain nanodomains. FLS2 and BRI1 are associated with the cytoskeleton with FLS2 linked to actin-myosin and BRI1 linked to cortical microtubules.</p><p>This work is interesting and provides some insights into the FLS2 and BRI1 signaling. It is known that upon the ligand perception, FLS2 and BRI1 complex with SERK3 and activate the signaling. However, the majority of work here was done with FLS2 without flg22 treatment and examines the steady state of FLS2. BRI1 localization was done in a similar fashion-without BR treatment. Unlike FLS2 signaling, the endogenous BR signaling is constantly on in the cells (although likely at a low level). It remains unknown how the steady-state FLS2 patterns are related to the ligand-activated clusters and how this change may affect the signaling specificity, the key question that this manuscript is attempting to address. Recent work reported a highly dynamic behavior of FLS2 and BRI1 in particular in response to the cognate ligand perception (Somssich et al., Real-time dynamics of peptide ligand-dependent receptor complex formation in planta. Science Signaling 2015; Wang et al., Spatiotemporal dynamics of the BRI1 receptor and its regulation by membrane microdomains in living Arabidopsis cells. Molecular Plant 2015). The conclusion that FLS2 and BRI1 are largely in spatially separated nanoclusters at the steady state was based on the comparison between FLS2 and BRI1 localization in the absence of ligands in WT plants. The BR signaling is on in the absence of exogenous BR treatment. What they have observed in this experimental setting may contain both steady-state and activated form of BRI1. Additional experiments with BR biosynthetic mutants will be helpful to confirm the conclusion. Comparison the RLK patterns with and without ligands will provide insights into how these patterns contribute the signaling specificity.</p><p>Considering that the nanodomains are usually 10-100 nm in size, the resolutions of current confocal microscopic techniques to differentiate the two objectives are rather limited (CLSM 500~700 nm). Cautious should be taken into account for the spatial separations of clusters. As only 5~10% BRI1 are actively involved in BR signaling (van Esse et al., 2012), the BRI1 patterns are based on the observations from the &quot;majority&quot; of BRI1. At the moment, the knowledge is lacking on where those 5~10% activated portions are. The highly dynamic nature of BRI1 and FLS2 clusters upon the ligand perception will add another layer of complications.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Bücherl et al. report that the immune receptor FLS2 and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 are found in distinct nanodomains of the plasma membrane (PM) that display differences in mobility and association to the cytoskeleton and contain different remorins. The topic is exciting and timely as understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of receptor interactions will be key to understanding how specificity is generated at the PM. Unfortunately this manuscript does not advance our understanding of this topic sufficiently to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and the quality of the data presented raises several points:</p><p>1) Based on the similarity in cluster size observed in stable transgenic Arabidopsis line and after transient expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> all following experiments are performed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> epidermal cells. In remains unclear if the two signalling pathways are operational and if endogenous receptors could interfere with the analysis.</p><p>2) The Pearson correlation coefficients for FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry are moderate at best. Jarsch et al. report values of around 0,7 for individual remorins tagged with GFP and mRFP and values below 0,5 as observed for FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry would be sitting on the fence of random distribution and positive correlation according to Jarsch et al. This could either be a technical issue regarding alignment of the CLSM that can easily be controlled by using multicolour fluorescent beads. Alternatively the low correlation coefficient could indicate that one of the two fusion proteins is non-functional and thus behaves differently. Has functionality of the FLS2-fusions been fully evaluated by mutant complementation? Given that the authors excluded the co-receptor BAK1 form their analysis as it has been shown that functionality of BAK1-GFP is compromised, the authors are obviously aware of the importance of this matter but I could not find convincing evidence for full functionality of FL2-XFP in the published literature.</p><p>3) To go beyond the level of high-resolution descriptive the authors would need to include data supporting that the observed nanoclusters are functionally relevant. What happens to signalling in remorin mutants? Are nanoclusters dependent on the cytoskeleton? How is the co-receptor BAK1 distributed and does absence of BAK1 affect nanocluster formation?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Plant immune and growth receptors share common signaling components but localise to distinct plasma membrane nanodomains&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the generation of multiple tagged-lines that would be required for the multiple co- localization experiments as performed in our study would have been extremely tedious. Importantly, several recent excellent publications in the plant field have used heterologous transient expression of tagged <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> PM proteins to study their dynamic localization pattern using confocal microscopy (<italic>e.g.</italic> Martinière et al., 2012; Jarsch et al., 2014; Chaparro-Garcia et al., 2015; Bozkurt et al., 2015; Somssich et al., 2015; Mbengue et al., 2016). In addition, most, if not all, similar studies in animals (all of them being published in respected high-ranking journals) are also performed upon transient heterologous expression, for similar reasons.</p><p>It is also important to flag that we have provided a comparison of PM localization patterns of FLS2-GFP and BRI1-GFP expressed stably in Arabidopsis under the expression of their native promoter or transiently in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-D</xref>), which revealed that the localization of the respective receptors was similar in both systems. This justified our use of transient expression in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> for further experiments presented in this manuscript. Also, the main aim of our study is to perform a side-by-side comparison of the localization patterns and properties of FLS2 and BRI1 under steady-state conditions; our results provide ample evidence that these are distinct (based also on co-localization with distinct REM markers and downstream RLCKs).</p><p>We nevertheless provide here some preliminary evidence for the co-localisation of BAK1- mCherry with FLS2-GFP and BRI1-GFP, respectively, within PM nanodomains of stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). Moreover, data included in a manuscript submitted elsewhere show BRI1/BAK1 association within such nanodomains (Hutten et al., under revision with PLoS One; co-last authors: Johannes Hohlbein &amp; Jan Willem Borst; co-author: CA Bücherl). Unfortunately, we have been so far not able to address this question for the FLS2/BAK1 combination, due to technical feasibility regarding FLIM in living leaf tissue and our inability to detect red fluorescent when expressing FLS2-RFP in stable transgenic plants.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25114.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Subpopulations of FLS2 and BRI1 co-localise with BAK1 in plasma membrane nanodomains.</title><p>The images show the plasma membrane localisation of FLS2-GFP or BRI1-GFP with BAK1- mCherry.

In order to compare both receptors in an inactive configuration, we now included BRZ treatments for the characterization of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and also for the co-localisation studies between the two receptors (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Similarly, we studied FLS2 and BRI1 cluster behaviour after exogenous application of 24-epi-brassinolide or flg22, respectively (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 &amp; 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>Considering that the nanodomains are usually 10-100 nm in size, the resolutions of current confocal microscopic techniques to differentiate the two objectives are rather limited (CLSM 500~700 nm). Cautious should be taken into account for the spatial separations of clusters.</italic></p><p>We agree that the presented values for FLS2 and BRI1 cluster sizes are most likely overestimations as stated in our discussion. It can be expected that many of the observed receptor clusters are actually below the diffraction limit of roughly 250-300 nm for CLSM and VAEM. To determine the true size of FLS2 and BRI1 clusters, the application of super-resolution methods would be required. Currently, we are not able to apply these methods on our samples. We tried to investigate our samples using SIM (structured illumination microscopy), but unfortunately, it was technically not feasible.</p><p>With regard to the spatial separation of clusters, our inability to differentiate between objects closer than 250-300 nm means that we would actually underestimate the separation of small and nearby clusters. Therefore, this should not interfere with our current conclusions. Though, we hope to be able to revisit these questions with improved technical capabilities in the future.</p><p><italic>As only 5~10% BRI1 are actively involved in BR signaling (van Esse et al., 2012), the BRI1 patterns are based on the observations from the &quot;majority&quot; of BRI1. At the moment, the knowledge is lacking on where those 5~10% activated portions are. The highly dynamic nature of BRI1 and FLS2 clusters upon the ligand perception will add another layer of complications.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, we are currently not able to address this important question, which receptors or receptor complexes among the total population are signalling active – neither for BRI1 nor for FLS2. Ligand perception most likely influences the dynamic behaviour of individual receptors or receptor clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the revised manuscript). However, at the moment the outcomes are still controversial (as discussed in our discussion) and need to be specifically addressed in more details in future studies.</p><p>Regarding ligand perception by FLS2, the report of Somssich et al., 2015 showed that flg22 triggers first the association of FLS2 with BAK1 followed by the aggregation of FLS2/BAK1 complexes. Here, it is important to mention that the FRET approaches applied by Somssich et al., 2015 have a very high spatial resolution in the range of around 10 nm. In contrast, our confocal or VAEM techniques are diffraction-limited approaches, and thus provide only a spatial resolution of around 250-300 nm. Consequently, the temporal dynamics described by Somssich et al., 2015 do not necessarily require high spatial dynamics or long-distance molecular movements within the plasma membrane – they can occur within a single nanodomain harbouring both FLS2 and BAK1 molecules. Such a scenario is in line with our new results of increased receptor confinement after ligand application (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> of the revised manuscript). Additionally, these findings are in agreement with a previous study of FLS2 by Ali et al., 2007 and with findings for EGFR (Low-Nam et al., 2012), which both show that receptor mobility decreases upon ligand perception.</p><p>Regarding ligand perception by BRI1, Wang et al., 2015 indeed reported increased spatial receptor dynamics one hour after BL application in Arabidopsis roots. These results are in stark contrast to our observations and to findings for FLS2 and EGFR stated above. The reference has been included and discussed in our manuscript. Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between the results may be of technical and experimental nature. We limited our observation of receptor clusters to 30 min only (to avoid capturing FLS2 endocytosis, which most likely represents a post-ligand degradation step of the activated receptor), applied different imaging and data analysis settings, and studied the receptors in epidermal leaf cells.</p><p>Taken together, the well-established associations between FLS2, BRI1 and their co-receptors after ligand perception, as well as the findings reported by Somssich et al., 2015 and Ali et al., 2007, are in line with our observations of (at least initially) increased receptor confinement upon ligand binding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>Bücherl et al. report that the immune receptor FLS2 and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 are found in distinct nanodomains of the plasma membrane (PM) that display differences in mobility and association to the cytoskeleton and contain different remorins.

In particular, considering whether the two signalling pathways are operational, we refer to the recent publications of Charparro-Garcia, 2015, Bozkurt et al., 2015; Somssich et al., 2015; and Mbengue et al., 2016.</p><p>Regarding the presence of endogenous receptors on the analysis, we do not think that a withdrawal of endogenous populations would change the conclusions of our observations. Preliminary data indicate no major differences for FLS2-GFP expressed under the FLS2 promoter in either wild-type Col-0 or <italic>fls2</italic> mutant background (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 2</xref>). Though, the presence of endogenous receptors may lead to reduced fluorescence in certain clusters, which would not affect the present conclusions.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25114.024</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>FLS2-GFP forms receptor clusters in <italic>fls2</italic> mutant background.</title><p>The images show the plasma membrane localisation of pFLS2::FLS2-GFP stably transformed in the <italic>fls2</italic> mutant or Columbia wild type background, respectively.

Jarsch et al. report values of around 0,7 for individual remorins tagged with GFP and mRFP and values below 0,5 as observed for FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry would be sitting on the fence of random distribution and positive correlation according to Jarsch et al. This could either be a technical issue regarding alignment of the CLSM that can easily be controlled by using multicolour fluorescent beads.</italic></p><p>We agree with this reviewer that our absolute correlation values are moderate. The discrepancy to the reported values of Jarsch et al., 2014 stems on the one hand from the use of slightly different correlation factors. Jarsch et al., 2014 reported so-called ‘Overlap coefficients’ whereas we use ‘Pearson correlation coefficients’. Overlap coefficients range from 0 to 1 and random or no co-localisation is therefore still represented by positive values – in contrast to Pearson correlation that ranges from -1 to +1. To avoid confusion, we removed the misleading reference from this section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>On the other hand, we investigated different protein populations with different dynamic features. Remorin proteins seem to localise very stably to certain plasma membrane domains – in the range of minutes and above. The investigated FLS2 and BRI1 clusters in our manuscript, however, are in comparison very short-lived. The high temporal dynamics of these receptor clusters reduces the probability to find the two differently tagged receptor populations at the same time at the same spot. Additionally, the number of individual receptors per cluster seems to be rather low; thus, further decreasing the probability of spatio-temporal co-occupancy of specific PM nanodomains.</p><p>Although our Pearson correlation values are low to moderate in absolute numbers, they are still a valuable measure for our comparative approach. For this purpose, we also switched the reference from FLS2-mCherry to BRI1-mRFP for control experiments showing the same outcome.</p><p><italic>Alternatively the low correlation coefficient could indicate that one of the two fusion proteins is non-functional and thus behaves differently. Has functionality of the FLS2-fusions been fully evaluated by mutant complementation?

What happens to signalling in remorin mutants? Are nanoclusters dependent on the cytoskeleton? How is the co-receptor BAK1 distributed and does absence of BAK1 affect nanocluster formation?</italic></p><p>We absolutely agree with this reviewer that the next step is to characterise the functional importance of PM nanodomains. However, this is a whole project by itself, and goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript, whose main aim was to assess the comparative localization patterns of BRI1 (a steroid hormone receptor) and FLS2 (an immune receptor), which Reviewer 1 has already highlighted as being very important and timely.</p><p>The physiological characterisation of <italic>rem</italic> mutants is ongoing. It is however worthwhile to note that no significant phenotype has ever been reported so far for any single <italic>rem</italic> mutant in Arabidopsis, and thus that the generation of multiple mutants may be required. Similarly, studies on the interplay between cytoskeleton and receptor clusters are in progress. Preliminary data indicate that cluster formation is not abolished upon actin depolymerisation, for example; however, the influence on cluster dynamics is still unclear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 3</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25114.025</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Actin depolymerisation does not abolish FLS2 cluster formation.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25114.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25114.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25114-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p>The images show the plasma membrane localisation of pFLS2::FLS2-GFP and p35S::LifeAct- tagRFP after depolymerisation of the actin cytoskeleton by 3.5 h incubation in 30 µM LatriculinB.

You argue that this is due to the low number of receptors per cluster and the dynamic behaviour of the clusters. This is one possible explanation, yet in the absence of a positive control technical reasons cannot be excluded.</italic></p><p>Although the Pearson R correlation coefficients may appear low, our conclusions of co-localisation vs. non-co-localisation are always based on statistically significant differences as illustrated in our graphs and explained in the figure legends.</p><p>Also, on a more technical side, in noisy data, Pearson R correlation coefficients of (+/-) 0.3-0.5 are generally considered to be moderate, rather than small [typically guidelines for this are taken from the work of Jacob Cohen, see chapter 3, Cohen, J. (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences 2nd ed.]. Pearson’s R is different from the typical Spearman’s R in this respect. The data we are looking at is inherently noisy because of low receptor numbers per cluster so a moderate correlation is a good indicator of co-localisation. It is possible to interpret Pearson’s R as the proportion of the variability explained by the variable under test, given the noisy nature of our data then we think that we have accounted for the larger fraction of the variation.</p><p><italic>2) Regarding functionality of FLS2-GFP the authors refer to Mbengue et al., 2016 yet one does not find evidence in there that demonstrates a wt-level flg22 response in the complementation line used.</italic></p><p>While it is correct that we cannot necessarily claim that the FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry fusion proteins used in this study and previous publications are as active as wild-type untagged FLS2, the fact that the FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry undergo flg22-induced endocytosis indicates that they represent biologically-active receptors capable of perceiving the flg22 ligand and to become activated (and then later endocytosed) in response to flg22 perception. Then, as eluded to above, the main conclusions made in our manuscript is that FLS2-GFP and FLS2-mCherry co-localise based on a positive Pearson R correlation coefficient, while the comparison between FLS2-mCherry and BRI1-GFP, for example, yields a Pearson R correlation coefficient close to zero, with the difference between these Pearson R correlation coefficients being statistically significant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
