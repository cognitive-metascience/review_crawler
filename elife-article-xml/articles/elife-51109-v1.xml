The mechanism behind this rapid reprogramming of the host transcriptional environment is largely unknown. We identified ICP4 as responsible for preferential recruitment of the Pol II machinery to the viral genome. ICP4 is a viral nucleoprotein which binds double-stranded DNA. We determined ICP4 discriminately binds the viral genome due to the absence of cellular nucleosomes and high density of cognate binding sites. We posit that ICP4’s ability to recruit not just Pol II, but also more limiting essential components, such as TBP and Mediator, create a competitive transcriptional environment. These distinguishing characteristics ultimately result in a rapid and efficient reprogramming of the host’s transcriptional machinery, which does not occur in the absence of ICP4.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HSV</kwd><kwd>ICP4</kwd><kwd>polII</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI30612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeLuca</surname><given-names>Neal A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AI36251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dremel</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI060525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dremel</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI143179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeLuca</surname><given-names>Neal A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Herpes simplex ICP4 preferentially binds to and delineates the viral genome, ultimately resulting in robust viral transcription at the expense of the host.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like most DNA viruses, the genome of Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwine et al., 1974</xref>). Its approximately 85 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McGeoch et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGeoch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGeoch et al., 1985</xref>) are transcribed in a temporally coordinated sequence, such that their protein products are expressed at the appropriate time in the life cycle of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honess and Roizman, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Honess and Roizman, 1974b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honess and Roizman, 1975</xref>). Immediate early (IE) gene products enable the efficient expression of early (E) and late (L) genes. The protein products of E genes are mostly involved in DNA replication. DNA replication and IE proteins enable the efficient transcription of L genes, which encode the structural components of the virus. DNA replication licenses L promoters, enabling the binding of core Pol II transcription factors, thus activating the initiation of L transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dremel and DeLuca, 2019</xref>). This entire transcriptional cascade is observed within 3 hour (h) post entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dremel and DeLuca, 2019</xref>), culminating in production of the first viral progeny between 4 and 6 h post-infection (hpi). To accomplish this robust and rapidly changing program of transcription, the viral genome must compete with the vastly larger cellular genome for numerous Pol II transcription factors, in addition to mediating the possible constraints of cellular histones.</p><p>A major component of this cascade is the IE protein Infected Cell Polypeptide 4 (ICP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courtney and Benyesh-Melnick, 1974</xref>). ICP4 is essential for viral growth because it promotes efficient transcription of viral E and L genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dixon and Schaffer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preston, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watson and Clements, 1980</xref>). Thus, in the absence of ICP4, E and L proteins are poorly expressed, IE proteins are overproduced, DNA replication does not occur, and there is no detectable viral yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeLuca et al., 1985</xref>). ICP4 was first shown to bind to DNA cellulose made from salmon sperm DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Powell and Purifoy, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faber and Wilcox (1986)</xref> later showed ICP4 has sequence-specific DNA binding activity. ICP4 interacts with a number of cellular general transcription factors (GTFs), predominantly components of TFIID and the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrozza and DeLuca, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lester and DeLuca, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner and DeLuca, 2013</xref>), facilitating their recruitment to the viral genome through its DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lester and DeLuca, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sampath and Deluca, 2008</xref>). ICP4 is synthesized early in infection, binds to the viral genome located at ND10 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everett et al., 2003</xref>), and remains associated with the genome throughout all phases of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>). Therefore, ICP4 has the potential to influence events occurring on the viral genome from a time when genome number is at a minimum, and ICP4 expression is peaking, through a time when genome numbers are greatly elevated by replication.</p><p>Studies have also shown that epigenetic modulation of histones associated with the viral genome early in infection can affect productive viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knipe and Cliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). However, we have shown that the abundance of histones is relatively low or absent, and that ICP4 is one of the most abundant proteins on viral genomes during productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015</xref>). In this study, we set out to determine the relationship between ICP4 and histones binding to the viral and cellular genomes, and the consequences for viral and cellular transcription. We propose that ICP4 is a major component of viral nucleoprotein, which functions in place of traditional cellular chromatin, and allows for the robust recruitment of cellular transcription factors specifically to the viral genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ICP4 binding is altered by viral genome replication</title><p>Given the central role of ICP4 in viral gene transcription at all stages of infection, we were interested in how ICP4 interacts with the virus genome as the number exponentially increases, as a consequence of replication. We infected human fibroblast (MRC5) cells with wild-type HSV-1 (KOS) for two, four, and six hpi and performed ChIP-Seq for ICP4. Each time point represents a different replication state: two hpi (prereplication), four hpi (3–4 genome duplications), six hpi (5–6 genome duplications) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To quantitatively compare samples, we had to account for viral genome replication. Input samples provided the relative number of viral genomes present at each time point. We used this ratio to normalize immunoprecipitated (IP) sample for the amount of factor per genome. Early during infection (two hpi) ICP4 densely coated the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Viral genome replication decreased the amount of ICP4 bound per genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) resulting in a pattern containing sharper peaks. By six hpi ICP4 binding was retained exclusively on strong ICP4 binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Some of the retained binding sites were those previously established as having an inhibitory effect on the gene promoter bound, including ORF P, ICP4, and LAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A closer analysis of ICP4 peaks demonstrated that the location and number of high confidence occupied sites did not alter significantly throughout infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Instead the amount of ICP4 bound between distinct peaks decreased as genome number increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51109.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ICP4 binding at key points in the viral life cycle.</title><p>MRC5 cells were infected with HSV-1 for 2, 4, or 6 h, and ChIP-Seq for ICP4 was performed.

The final sites were consistent between biological replicates. We analyzed 100 bp extensions from the summits of the peaks seen at all three times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) for motif discovery. DTSGKBDTBNHSG was the only motif discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), where D is A, G, T; S is C or G; K is G or T; B is C, G, T; H is A, C, T.

As ICP4 is an essential viral protein, we prepared stocks of n12 in an ICP4 complementing cell line. ICP4 is packaged into the tegument of virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao and Courtney, 1989</xref>), which results in packaging of wild type ICP4 into n12 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2018</xref>). The reads in the ICP4 ChIP of n12 are most likely due to ICP4 packaged in the virion. While the ultimate source of these reads is not clear at present, the amount of binding of ICP4 from the virion to DNA is not sufficient to promote transcription complexes on viral early and late genes.</p><p>Med1 and Med23 bound the viral genome with an almost identical pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating they are parts of the Mediator complex bound early during viral infection. In WT infected cells, the binding of Mediator concentrated near the starts sites of ICP4-induced viral genes. However, the Mediator complex also densely coated the viral genome, resembling the ICP4 binding pattern. This dense coating was completely absent in n12 infection, demonstrating this phenotype is not an artifact of the IP. We suspect this reflects the fact that ICP4 and Mediator interact.</p><p>In the absence of ICP4, the binding of Pol II was reduced the most compared to the other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This magnified difference is likely a result of the cooperative nature of Pol II recruitment requiring multiple protein-protein interactions. In summary ICP4 was required for robust recruitment of all GTF’s tested, cooperatively recruiting Pol II to E and L promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The difference between n12 and WT shows the extent by which ICP4 mediated recruitment and bolstered the frequency of PIC assembly. IE promoters retained robust GTF recruitment via an independent mechanism involving a complex consisting of Oct-1, HCF and VP16 binding to TAATGARAT promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Preston et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stern and Herr, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stern et al., 1989</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genome-bound ICP4 does not affect accessibility</title><p>Part of the mechanism of ICP4 action in the recruitment of GTFs to the genome may involve a role in the exclusion of repressive chromatin. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between presence of ICP4, the abundance of histones, and the accessibility of the genome. We used ChIP-Seq to compare the binding of ICP4, Pol II, and histone H3 in n12 and WT HSV-1 infected human fibroblasts at two hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found in both WT and n12 infection that the number of H3 reads mapped to the viral genome was 100-fold less than ICP4, and the pattern was nearly identical to input reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with R<sup>2</sup> correlations of 0.0004 and 0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This value is consistent with infecting at an MOI of 10 pfu/cell and an approximately particle to pfu ratio of 20–30. We normalized ATAC-Seq traces to adjust for sequencing depth and input genome number. We observed even tagmentation in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) absent the nucleosomal laddering visible on the cellular genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Quantification of ATAC-Seq reads determined that the viral genome in n12 and WT was 2.2 and 2-fold more accessible than the cellular genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As we harvested samples pre-replication, we expect that a significant portion of viral genomes are defective and will not undergo replication. Our ATAC-Seq data is thus an average of tagmentation for defective and active viral genomes. For this reason, we expect our accessibility calculation is an underestimate. We conclude that the viral genome was much more accessible than the cellular genome, and this increased accessibility was not ICP4-dependent. ICP4 binding and GTF recruitment, not viral genome accessibility, was responsible for robust GTF binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ICP4 binds to cellular transcription start sites (TSS) early during infection</title><p>Immunofluorescence (IF) studies of HSV-1 infection depict colocalization of ICP4 with EdC-labeled viral genomes and exclusion from dense areas of cellular chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015</xref>). This phenomenon is so well established that ICP4 is largely used in IF studies as a proxy for HSV-1 genomes. To ascertain if ICP4 also binds to the cellular genome, we aligned our ICP4 ChIP-Seq data from 2, 4, and six hpi to the cellular genome. ICP4 bound to the cellular genome in a manner quite distinctive from the pattern observed on the viral genome. ICP4 only bound in distinct peaks around cellular transcription start sites (TSS) of a subset of cellular genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). These genes grouped ontologically to common housekeeping functions including pathways related to chromatin, transcription, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This binding reduced from 2 to 4 hpi, and became negligible at six hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). At two hpi ICP4 bound to the cellular genome at 5727 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) or 0.002 peaks per kbp, whereas ICP4 bound to the viral genome at 122 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or 0.8 peaks per kbp. Similar we found a much greater density of ICP4 binding motifs present in the viral genome (two motifs/kbp) than the cellular genome (0.02 motifs/kbp). We observed ICP4 binding peaks that did not localize at an ICP4 binding consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) suggesting that ICP4 may associate with the cellular genome by an alternative mechanism. We conclude that ICP4 bound to the cellular genome early during infection, when the relative concentration of ICP4 to viral genomes is still quite high. The amount of ICP4 on the cellular genome quickly dropped off as viral genome number increased and ICP4 preferentially bound to the viral genome.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51109.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ICP4 binds cellular promoters during early infection.</title><p>MRC5 cells were infected with HSV-1 for 2, 4, or 6 h, and ChIP-Seq for ICP4 was performed.

Cellular TSS were stratified using k-means clustering as high and low ICP4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

By comparison only 10% of ICP4 predicted binding motifs were within 1 kb of a promoter.

We observed depletion of Pol II occupancy on cellular mRNA promoters only in WT infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>).

We used a temperature sensitive ICP4 mutant (tsKos), in which growth at nonpermissive temperature (39.6°C) results in loss of ICP4 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dremel and DeLuca, 2019</xref>). We infected fibroblasts with tsKos grown at permissive conditions (P), shifted up from permissive to nonpermissive conditions at four hpi (S), or nonpermissive conditions (N). In this system we can separate the role of ICP4 in Pol II depletion, from ICP4’s requirement in E and L transcription and viral genome replication. Infected cells were harvested at four or six hpi and Pol II ChIP-Seq was performed. We used nonpermissive conditions as a surrogate to mock-infection, as we just established that Pol II depletion does not occur in n12 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). We observed significant depletion of Pol II from cellular promoters in permissive and shifted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Pol II depletion was not directly related to viral genome copy number. tsKos shifted up had the highest number of viral genomes present, but did not reach the same level of cellular Pol II depletion as cells grown at permissive temperature for the same length of time. These data suggest that the viral genome is not solely responsible for preferential recruitment of cellular Pol II. Instead ICP4 bound to the viral genome is required for depletion of Pol II from cellular promoters. These results suggest a model in which genome replication facilitates host Pol II depletion when the relative number of ICP4 to viral genomes is high (2 hpi). As the number of ICP4 bound viral genomes increased, we observed a corresponding decrease in Pol II on host promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>ICP4 as a sink for general transcription factors</title><p>ICP4 is synthesized shortly after the viral genome enters the nucleus and remains associated with the genome through all phases of infection. Our data demonstrated that ICP4 bound promiscuously to the viral genome prior to DNA replication. At this time point, the relative concentration of ICP4 to viral genomes was relatively high which likely promoted multimerization on DNA through ICP4-ICP4 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuddus and DeLuca, 2007</xref>). We observed a similar phenotype for ICP4’s interaction partner, Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lester and DeLuca, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner and DeLuca, 2013</xref>). Components of Mediator bound generally to the viral genome, concentrating near viral TATA boxes. Additional protein-Mediator interactions likely contribute to this distribution. This is a unique recruitment phenotype for Mediator which binds exclusively at cellular TSS via multiple protein-protein interactions. In the absence of ICP4, these interactions were not sufficient to support Mediator binding to the viral genome. With the exception of Mediator recruitment to IE promoters which does not require ICP4 and reflects the activity of VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batterson and Roizman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 1984</xref>). Similarly, we observed a 2 to 10-fold decrease in recruitment of Pol II, TBP, and Sp1 to viral E and L promoters without ICP4. This minimal level of recruitment is insufficient to support transcription, which explains why only IE transcripts are efficiently transcribed in the absence of ICP4.</p><p>ICP4-dependent GTF recruitment was not due to a global accessibility change. In the absence of ICP4 the viral genome remained absent of histones and had little change in tagmentation frequency. This is most likely due to the action of ICP0, which is an IE protein expressed in the absence of ICP4 and has been shown to preclude histones from the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe and Knipe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferenczy and DeLuca, 2009</xref>). We posit that ICP4’s ability to interact and recruit Mediator and TFIID generally to the viral genome creates a local concentration gradient. Ultimately this increases the incidence of Pol II transcription machinery recruitment to the viral genome, which is stabilized by contact with additional protein-DNA, protein-protein interactions. Our observation that ICP4 coats the viral genome, a unique recruitment phenotype for a protein that functions in GTF recruitment likely reflects the architecture of the viral genome. The condensed organization of the HSV genome results in overlap of viral promoters and ORFS, with little to no unused coding space. For these reasons, it may be advantageous for ICP4 to generally and dynamically bind to the viral genome. It is also possible that the relatively high density of ICP4 on the viral genome prior to DNA replication may serve to repress transcription of the true late promoters, which only contain binding sites for the core GTFs. It has been shown that ICP4 binding can impose an increased dependence on DNA replication for expression from relatively simple promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koop et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 1994</xref>). These data demonstrated the critical role ICP4 serves as a general viral transcription factor, essential for activation and continued transcription of E and L genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ICP4 differentiates between the viral and cellular genome</title><p>ICP4 possesses the ability to bind to double stranded DNA independent of sequence, an ability that is facilitated by ICP4 oligomerization on the genome. At early time points, when the relative concentration of ICP4 to the viral genome was high, we observed promiscuous ICP4 binding. This coating phenotype provides an explanation for why no specific binding sites on the genome affect the ability of ICP4 to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coen et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smiley et al., 1992</xref>). Instead the high density of ICP4 binding motifs on the viral genome aggregate to create a global affinity for ICP4.</p><p>Early during infection, we also observed binding of ICP4 to cellular promoters, a novel observation. ICP4 bound promoters of genes which grouped ontologically to common housekeeping functions including pathways related to chromatin, transcription, and metabolism. Furthermore, we found that ICP4 specifically bound where there was an absence of histones, adjacent to euchromatic markers. ICP4 did not alter the chromatic markers of the promoters it bound to, rather ICP4 bound regions which were also accessible in the absence of infection. This likely reflects ICP4’s ability to bind naked double-stranded DNA in a sequence independent manner. This ability is promoted by ICP4 multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuddus and DeLuca, 2007</xref>), which is likely why we see the binding early during infection. The GTF’s present on these cellular promoters, namely TFIID and Mediator complex, may further stabilize ICP4 binding at these promoters via their well-characterized interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrozza and DeLuca, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lester and DeLuca, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagner and DeLuca, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The consequences, if any, of this binding for the transcription of specific cellular genes remains to be determined. The binding of ICP4 to the cellular genome was greatly diminished by four hpi, which corresponded to 3–4 viral genome duplications. At this time point we also observed a decrease in ICP4 coating the viral genome. However, ICP4 still bound abundantly, concentrating adjacent to strong cognate binding sites. This is most likely due to replication of the viral genome producing more ICP4 binding targets. Simple mass action results in binding to predominantly higher affinity sites. We propose that the binding preference of ICP4 for the viral genome is due to the 100-fold higher density of cognate binding sites and absence of cellular histones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ICP4 as both viral transcription factor and chromatin</title><p>HSV-1 productive infection generates 1,000–10,000 viral progeny per infected cell within a 24 h window.

By six hpi viral mRNA’s comprise almost 50% of the total mRNA present in the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dremel and DeLuca, 2019</xref>).

A recent study concluded that viral replication compartments efficiently enrich Pol II into membraneless domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McSwiggen et al., 2019</xref>). Herein we identified the viral factor responsible for coopting the host Pol II machinery.</p><p>McSwiggen et al. proposed this phenomenon was dependent on the absence of nucleosomes which made the viral genome 100-fold more accessible than the cellular genome. While we agree that this accessibility is critical for viral infection, we believe it is essential for ICP4 binding. Similar to cellular chromatin, ICP4 coats the viral genome throughout productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, ICP4 also functions to scaffold Pol II transcription machinery to the viral genome. We demonstrated that Pol II depletion from cellular promoters was dependent on the number of ICP4 bound viral genomes. We propose that one or more components of the PIC, such as the ICP4 binding partners TFIID and Mediator, are limiting and ICP4 recruits these factors to the viral genome. As the number of viral genomes bound by ICP4 increases, the limiting PIC components no longer contacts cellular promoters. Ultimately this results in decreased Pol II occupancy on host promoters, preventing cellular transcription. This mechanism is essential to facilitate the rapidly progressing infection while limiting the extent to which the host can respond to viral challenge.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id

Cells were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation, resuspended in 1.1 mL RIPA buffer [1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1x Roche protease inhibitor cocktail]. Sample was sonicated for 6 intervals of 30 s with a Sonics Vibra-Cell VCX 130 sonicator equipped with a 3 mm microprobe and pelleted at 2000 xg for 15 min. 50 µl was stored as an input control, and the remainder was divided equally to use in immunoprecipitations (IP). 2−4 × 10<sup>7</sup> MRC5 cells were applied per IP. Samples were immunoprecipitated with 25 µg (TBP, Sp1), or 10 µg (Pol II, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, H3) antibody. Antibody was previously bound to 50 µL of Dynabeads M280 sheep anti-mouse IgG beads, or Dynabeads M280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG beads in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1x PBS overnight. DNA samples were bound to the antibody-bead complex overnight rotating.

Approximate fragment size for paired end read data was determined from mapped bam files using CollectInsertSizeMetrics (Broad Institute, Picard). Bam files were visualized using DeepTools bamcoverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) with a bin size of 1 to generate bigwig files. Data was viewed in IGV viewer and exported as EPS files. Cellular bigwig files were normalized for sequencing depth, the y-axes values are mapped reads per billion total reads. Viral bigwig files were further normalized per viral genome copy number, see Table 3C. The y-axes values are mapped reads per billion total reads per viral genome copy number. The normalized bigwig files were averaged between three biological replicates. Heatmaps and gene profiles were generated using MultiBigwigSummary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) on normalized cellular bigwig files to all UCSC annotated mRNAs. Gene profiles and heatmaps were plotted using plotProfile and plotHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>). To calculate the percentage of total DNA corresponding to the virus or host in n12 and WT HSV-1 infection, we utilized ChIP-Seq input reads. We calculated the average percentage of total reads which mapped to either the virus or host in four biological replication ChIP-Seq samples. We used this value to calculate the number of viral genomes contained within each nucleus. This value was used to determine the tagmentation enrichment observed relative to the actual amount of genome content present.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants AI030612 and AI143179 to NAD.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lars Dölken (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes how the HSV-1 protein ICP4 plays a pivotal role in the reprogramming of the cellular Pol II transcription machinery. The authors show that the ICP4 preferentially binds to the viral genome and forms a viral nucleoprotein, which then preferentially recruits Pol II transcription factors to the viral genome, effectively causing the host-shut off. Apparently, ICP4 favorably binds to the incoming naked viral DNA at early times of infection. Overall, the paper describes a novel and important property of ICP4 protein in the life cycle of HSV. However, the reviewers raised a number of questions that should be addressed in the revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In ICP4 null mutants, one can still observe relatively high read coverage for ICP4 binding (e. g. Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and others). How do the authors explain this pattern for ICP4 null mutant, where no ICP4 binding should be observed? If such a coverage represents non-specific background, the authors should explicitly state whether the background reads have been subtracted from the coverage graphs of ICP4 binding in all figures?</p><p>2) The main conclusion of the authors is that ICP4 not only binds a specific motif at viral E promoters early in infection but promiscuously binds the incoming viral DNA. While the quantitative analysis strongly support their hypothesis, other explanations and particularly the implications of their finding should be considered and more thoroughly discussed. Of note, the effect of ICP4 on viral genome accessibility was rather small (2.8- vs. 4-fold). What is the advantage for the virus recruiting ICP4 in a sequence-independent manner to the viral genome? How does this contribute to differences in E and L promoters? The authors should expand their discussion on this.</p><p>3) The authors state that ICP4 binding to the cellular genome is restricted to accessible regions of the cellular genome, namely the promoter regions. However, ICP4 is well known to bind to Mediator, which shows the same distribution pattern as ICP4 on cellular genes early in infection as ICP4. As specific ICP4 binding motifs do not explain the binding of ICP4 to cellular promoter regions, an alternative explanation is that ICP4 is recruited to cellular promoter regions via its interaction with Mediator (and not by its DNA-binding activity). ATAC-seq also reveals sites of the genome which become &quot;accessible&quot; independent of Mediator. The authors should check for co-localisation of ICP4-reads with ATAC-seq peaks outside of promoter regions (with no overlapping Mediator reads).</p><p>4) The antibodies section of the Materials and methods should indicate that the Pol II antibody is specific for phosphorylated Serine 5 residues of the CTD. The use of the 4H8 clone of the Pol II antibody as a readout for total pol II occupancy should generally be avoided. While this clone is commonly used to measure global pol II occupancy, phospho-Serine 5 is enriched compared to total pol II at promoters and splice sites. This bias, if anything, was likely beneficial to the authors as they focus the most on promoters, though it may preclude more in-depth analysis in the future in regards to other steps of transcription or under experimental conditions in which Serine 5 phosphorylation is altered. Thus, it is important for this bias (stated on the manufacturer's website) to be apparent at-a-glance to the reader.</p><p>5) The authors adapted the y-axis scale in a number of figures to provide a better visualization of their data. While this was done well for most figures, some of the scale adjustments make it hard to compare results. For example in Figure 2B, the authors show the occupancy of polII, TBP aso. on two selected virus genes. Unfortunately, the y-axis drastically vary between the panel, making a comparison very difficult (e.g. Sp1 32,312 vs. 11,877). These differences make it also hard to compare the n12 mutant and wild type virus in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. The authors should standardize the y-axis scales to allow the comparison between panels and to avoid miss-interpretations.</p><p>6) Subsection “ICP4 as both viral transcription factor and chromatin”: It is currently unclear whether the recruitment of major IE transcription factors to the incoming viral genomes only occurs in HSV infection or also in other herpesviruses, e.g. CMV infection. Therefore, there is currently no evidence that this explains differences in the kinetics of lytic replication between different herpesviruses. Interestingly, the relative contribution of viral gene expression during the first 2h of MCMV infection is even higher than observed for HSV-1. However, MCMV DNA replication does not start until 12 h p.i. whereas it initiates already at 2 h p.i. in HSV-1 infection. Two hours of interferon treatment are not sufficient to induce a strong protective antiviral state. Therefore, host responses are unlikely to prevent viral DNA replication in MCMV infection from already initiating at 2 h p.i. Combined, this strongly argues against a prominent role of the recruitment of ICP4 to viral genomes in explaining the differences in replication kinetics between different herpesviruses. Considering the conserved IE, E, L gene expression cascade, one might assume that coating of the incoming viral genomes with the major viral transactivator is a conserved feature of herpesviruses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51109.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In ICP4 null mutants, one can still observe relatively high read coverage for ICP4 binding (e. g.

In order to produce stocks of ICP4 null virus, we must grow the virus in complementing cells which produce ICP4. Thus, n12 still has ICP4 packaged into the virions, but does not produce any nascent ICP4 during infection. We cannot say whether the reads we see with ICP4 ChIP-seq of n12 infection are due to incoming tegument ICP4 binding the viral genome, or ICP4 bringing viral genome fragments into the tegument during virion production in the complementing cells. To clarify this fact for the readers we have added the following to the text:</p><p>“There were a relatively small number of reads in the ICP4 ChIP of n12 (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). […] While the ultimate source of these reads is not clear at present, the amount of binding of ICP4 from the virion to DNA is not sufficient to promote transcription complexes on viral early and late genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If such a coverage represents non-specific background, the authors should explicitly state whether the background reads have been subtracted from the coverage graphs of ICP4 binding in all figures?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not subtract input or background reads from any of our ChIP-seq data.

Additionally, we repeated the ATAC-Seq experiment with two additional biological replicates, which confirmed the original data. We have now adjusted Figure 3 to include all the biological replicates. The calculations in Table 3C has been adjusted to include the new data. We now observe that n12 and WT virus have a tagmentation enrichment of 2.2 and 2-fold, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the advantage for the virus recruiting ICP4 in a sequence-independent manner to the viral genome? How does this contribute to differences in E and L promoters? The authors should expand their discussion on this.</p></disp-quote><p>The following has been added:</p><p>“Our observation that ICP4 coats the viral genome, a unique recruitment phenotype for a protein that functions in GTF recruitment likely reflects the architecture of the viral genome. […] It is also possible that the relatively high density of ICP4 on the viral genome prior to DNA replication may serve to repress transcription of the true late promoters, which only contain binding sites for the core GTFs. It has been shown that ICP4 binding can impose an increased dependence on DNA replication for expression from relatively simple promoters (Koop et al., 1993; Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 1994).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that ICP4 binding to the cellular genome is restricted to accessible regions of the cellular genome, namely the promoter regions.

However, this does not detract from ICP4’s ability to directly bind dsDNA which has been well established in vivo and in vitro. We have added the following:</p><p>“Furthermore, we found that ICP4 specifically bound where there was an absence of histones, adjacent to euchromatic markers. […] The GTF’s present on these cellular promoters, namely TFIID and Mediator complex, may further stabilize ICP4 binding at these promoters via their well-characterized interactions (Carrozza and DeLuca, 1996; Lester and Deluca; Wagner and DeLuca, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ATAC-seq also reveals sites of the genome which become &quot;accessible&quot; independent of Mediator.

In Figure 5—figure supplement 2 we show that ICP4 peaks were primarily localized (&gt;80%) within 1 kilobase of mRNA promoters, referenced in the subsection “ICP4 binding is restricted to accessible regions of the cellular genome”. For this reason, we limited our analyses within the paper to promoter regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The antibodies section of the Materials and methods should indicate that the Pol II antibody is specific for phosphorylated Serine 5 residues of the CTD.
