The prevalence of dystonia in the general population has been notoriously difficult to determine precisely, due to different methodologies for case classification, but a recent meta-analysis estimated that primary dystonia occurs at a rate of approximately 16 per 100,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Steeves et al., 2012</xref>). This is likely an underestimate, as cases frequently go undiagnosed and dystonia can also be a secondary symptom in other motor disorders. While dystonia most often occurs sporadically, mutations in several genes have been identified and linked with specific forms of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlesworth et al., 2013</xref>). Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT11) is an inherited form of dystonia caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>SGCE</italic> gene, which encodes the protein epsilon sarcoglycan (ε-SG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimprich et al., 2001</xref>). The vast majority of DYT11 patients with <italic>SGCE</italic> mutations inherit the disorder from the male parent, with markedly reduced penetrance in the offspring of female patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asmus et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimprich et al., 2001</xref>). The disorder is maternally inherited in only 5–10% of cases. This pattern of dominant, primarily paternal inheritance is consistent with imprinting, or epigenetic silencing, of the maternal allele. Indeed, in DNA and RNA samples from human blood <italic>SGCE</italic> is maternally imprinted, but the imprinting pattern in the brain is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grabowski et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>DYT11 is characterized primarily by involuntary jerking of the arms, neck, and trunk (myoclonus) and oftentimes mild to moderate dystonia that worsens with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kyllerman et al., 1990</xref>). Motor symptoms usually appear in childhood or adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nardocci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raymond and Ozelius, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raymond et al., 2008</xref>) and are frequently accompanied by psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and obsessive compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weissbach et al., 2013</xref>). DYT11 is known as alcohol-responsive dystonia given that approximately half of patients with DYT11 report improvement of motor symptoms after consuming alcohol. Strikingly, for these patients, alcohol tends to provide more therapeutic relief than any available pharmacological interventions, which have frequently been ineffective or poorly-tolerated. Unfortunately, the addictive and neurodegenerative consequences of chronic alcohol use preclude its use as a therapeutic option. Although patients generally live an active life of normal span, the motor and psychiatric symptoms of this disorder can cause a great deal of physical and psychosocial distress, significantly impacting the patients’ quality of life.</p><p>A limiting factor in the development of more effective treatment strategies for patients with DYT11 is the lack of understanding of the neural basis of the disorder. While the genetic cause of DYT11 has been known for 10 years, the function of ε-SG protein, particularly in the nervous system, and how loss-of-function of ε-SG leads to motor symptoms remains elusive. This issue is not specific to DYT11, but rather a common problem in understanding genetic dystonias. While mutations in the genes encoding α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycans cause different forms of muscular dystrophies, no signs or symptoms of muscle disease have been detected in DYT11 patients with mutations in <italic>SGCE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hjermind et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, electrophysiological and fMRI studies have cited a subcortical origin of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nitschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roze et al., 2008</xref>). Generally, dystonia has been viewed as a disorder of the basal ganglia. Indeed, in patients with DYT11, changes have been observed in the internal global pallidus (GPi), an output structure of the basal ganglia. In particular, studies have shown that gray matter volume of the GPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beukers et al., 2011</xref>) and firing patterns of individual neurons in the GPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Welter et al., 2015</xref>) correlates with the severity of motor symptoms in patients. Moreover, deep brain stimulation of the GPi is effective for most DYT11 patients, particularly those with <italic>SGCE</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azoulay-Zyss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Pajarín et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kosutzka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rughani and Lozano, 2013</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, recent studies have shown that dystonia is associated with changes in the activity, structure, and connections of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Draganski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dresel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendrix and Vitek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jinnah and Hess, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDoux et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeDoux et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shakkottai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2014</xref>). In DYT11 patients, there is evidence from fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beukers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nitschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Salm et al., 2013</xref>), and PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbon et al., 2013</xref>) for increased cerebellar activity. There are also diffusion tensor imaging data to suggest that changes occur in the white matter tracts that connect the cerebellum to the thalamus and other parts of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Meer et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, studies on the expression of <italic>SGCE</italic> and in the human brain and <italic>Sgce</italic>, the mouse homolog of <italic>SGCE</italic>, in the rodent brain have suggested that a brain-specific isoform, which might be responsible for the purely neurophysiological phenotype of DYT11, is highly expressed in the principle computational and output neurons of the cerebellum, the Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons, respectively, while it is expressed at lower levels in the different nuclei of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yokoi et al., 2005</xref>). Lastly, the amelioration of symptoms after ethanol ingestion reported by a number of patients with DYT11 points to a role for the cerebellum in this disorder, as the cerebellum is exquisitely sensitive to alcohol. Several labs have demonstrated that alcohol modulates Purkinje cell spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rogers et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinclair et al., 1980</xref>), increases inhibitory synaptic transmission in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carta et al., 2004</xref>), and alters synaptic plasticity at synapses onto Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belmeguenai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this study was to establish a mouse model that would enable the investigation of the neural correlates of motor symptoms in DYT11. Previous genetic knockout models have had subtle effects on motor behavior. Mice with a ubiquitous genetic knockout of <italic>Sgce</italic> exhibited full body jerks and had difficulty learning in a balance beam task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoi et al., 2006</xref>). Conditional knockout of <italic>Sgce</italic> in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokoi et al., 2012a</xref>) or specifically in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yokoi et al., 2012b</xref>), the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, produced milder effects. Importantly, none of these mice exhibited dystonia or alcohol-responsiveness, both prominent features of DYT11. Unfortunately, genetic models of hereditary dystonia have often failed to recapitulate many of the key motor symptoms of the disorder. One possibility for this phenomenon is compensation for the gene that has been knocked out during brain development in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fremont and Khodakhah, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, our laboratory has successfully generated symptomatic mouse models of dystonia using an acute knockdown approach to overcome potential developmental compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fremont et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we used short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) to knockdown <italic>Scge</italic> mRNA selectively in the cerebellum or basal ganglia of adult mice. We found that knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> in the cerebellum, but not the basal ganglia, produced overt motor symptoms, including dystonia. Consistent with what is seen in patients, administration of ethanol improved motor symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> knockdown mice but had no effect on motor symptoms of mice with knockdown of the gene that causes primary torsion dystonia (DYT1). We further found that, compared to mice injected with a control shRNA, both Purkinje cells and DCN neurons of the cerebellum fire aberrantly in <italic>Sgce</italic> knockdown mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We hypothesized that developmental compensation for genetic knockout of <italic>Sgce</italic> could account for the mild motor symptoms observed in previous mouse models of DYT11. To address this issue, we employed an acute, shRNA-mediated knockdown strategy to generate a symptomatic mouse model of DYT11. This strategy was successful in two previous studies of rapid onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fremont et al., 2015</xref>) and primary torsion dystonia (DYT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fremont and Khodakhah, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A wealth of evidence suggests that the cerebellum may be particularly important in the pathophysiology of DYT11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beukers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Meer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Salm et al., 2013</xref>). To examine the contribution of the cerebellum to the symptoms observed in DYT11 patients, we injected AAV9 virus encoding shRNA against <italic>Sgce</italic> mRNA and a GFP reporter (AAV-SGCEshRNA-GFP) into the cerebellum of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that injection of AAV-SGCEshRNA-GFP resulted in expression of the construct throughout the cerebellum without causing any gross morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as significant knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> mRNA as determined by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Mann-Whitney Test, WT vs. NT CB: p=0.7922; NT CB vs. <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 1: p=0.0079; NT CB vs. <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2: p=0.0159; N<sub>WT</sub> = 6, N<sub>NT CB</sub> = 5, N<italic><sub>Sgce</sub></italic> <sub>KD CB 1</sub> = 5, N<italic><sub>Sgce</sub></italic> <sub>KD CB 2 </sub>= 4). To control for shRNA-specific effects, a group of mice were injected with shRNA that does not target any gene in the genome (AAV-shNT-GFP, NT CB). To control for off-target effects of the shRNA, we used two sequences of shRNA that target separate regions of <italic>Sgce</italic> (<italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB one and <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2). Mice were injected with either of two shRNA sequences against <italic>Sgce</italic> into the cerebellum. Their behavior in the open field was assessed by four scorers blind to the condition of the animal using a previously published dystonia scale, where a score greater than or equal to two indicates dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fremont et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice had a time-dependent induction of dystonia, indicated by a dystonia score of 2 or above (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 1: N = 39; <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2: N = 40). Abnormal movements and postures were observed throughout the body of the animal, although the most severe dystonic postures were observed in the hind limbs and tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,ii</xref>). In contrast, mice injected with AAV-shNT-GFP did not develop symptoms (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, NT CB: N = 16). The development of dystonic symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice is time-dependent because the transfection of the virus, expression of the shRNA, and knockdown of ε-SG protein increases over time. This provides the unique opportunity for within-animal control to make sure that the surgery itself did not cause motor symptoms. Accordingly, the dystonia scores for <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 1 and <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2 mice for time points of 2 weeks or more after injection were significantly different from the dystonia scores of the same animals at &lt;1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Consistent with these data, the dystonia scores of <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 1 and <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2 mice at &lt;1 week after injection were not significantly different from NT CB mice at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>, p=0.81 and p=0.97, respectively, t-test, Holm-Sidak method).

It is thus possible that, while the extent of <italic>Sgce</italic> knockdown explains some variability observed in the behavioral data, incomplete penetrance of the phenotype may also contribute to the variability of the symptoms observed in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice.</p><p>Upon closer examination of <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, we noticed that in addition to dystonia, these mice exhibited a range of motor symptoms that we had not observed in some of the other mouse models of movement disorders previously characterized in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice had difficulty ambulating normally, showed unsteady or mildly ataxic gate, and exhibited myoclonic-like jerking movements, in addition to overt dystonia. Furthermore, when suspended by the tail, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice would spin vigorously and, often, continuously. In order to capture the range of motor symptoms observed in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice more accurately, we generated two new scales to measure the characteristic symptoms seen in this model. The Disability Scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) took into consideration the frequency of sustained dystonic-like postures and repetitive movements, as well as the level of motor impairment. The Spinning Scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) was generated to measure the frequency and duration of spinning during a tail suspension test, a symptom unique to <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice compared to our other models of dystonia. The average Spinning Score for a subset of <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 1 and <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB 2 was 2.22 ± 0.77 and 2.00 ± 0.88, respectively (Mean ± S.D., N = 13 and 7).

To examine whether alcohol could improve the motor symptoms observed in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, and further validate this new model, we examined the motor behavior of dystonic (dystonia score ≥2) <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice in the open field before and after a subcutaneous injection of ethanol (2 g/kg) or physiological saline. To capture the full range of motor symptoms that ethanol might affect, we scored the motor behavior of these mice on all three scales. Consistent with what has been reported by patients with DYT11, ethanol relieved motor symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice for up to 90 min after injection as measured on both the Disability Scale (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, 1way ANOVA, N = 16) and Spinning Scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, p&lt;0.0001, 1way ANOVA, N = 19).

To determine whether this effect was specific to <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, the effect of alcohol was examined in another symptomatic shRNA-mediated mouse model of primary torsion dystonia (DYT1). Alcohol-responsiveness was not observed in this model of DYT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>), although they exhibit overt dystonia, suggesting that the response to alcohol is specific to ε-SG knockdown (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, 0.2391, 1way ANOVA, N = 5).

While, on average, there was a significant increase in the distance traveled in the open field after EtOH (p=0.0148, 1Way ANOVA), this was driven largely by a small number of mice, and the effect was not statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons (Dunnett's multiple comparisons test, p&gt;0.05 at each time point).

We hypothesized that if irregular activity of the cerebellum contributes to the motor symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, then the output of the cerebellum, the DCN neurons, must be affected.</p><p>To that end, we performed extracellular single unit recordings from DCN neurons in awake, head-restrained <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB or NT CB mice. We found that shRNA knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> mRNA in the cerebellum caused aberrant activity of cerebellar output neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, we found that the firing rate of DCN neurons in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice was reduced (NT CB = 62.9 ± 24.8 spikes/s, n = 9, N = 4 and <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB = 32.2 ± 19.5 spikes/s, n = 32, N = 8, Mean ± S.D.; Welch’s t-test, p=0.0057).

The ISICV, a frequently used measure of the regularity of the firing rate of a cell, is the standard deviation of the ISI divided by the mean ISI and thus dependent on the average firing rate of the cell. <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice had a decreased average firing rate, which would result mathematically in a decreased ISICV if the standard deviation of the ISI was unchanged. The significant increase in the ISI CV in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice demonstrates that despite the decrease in average firing rate, the cells are firing with much greater variability in their ISIs.

To reflect the inheritance pattern observed in humans, mouse models of DYT11 were generated by crossing male heterozygous <italic>Sgce</italic> knockout mice with wild-type females. Ubiquitous genetic knockout of <italic>Sgce</italic> resulted in subtle motor symptoms, including full body jerks and deficits in motor learning in a balance beam task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoi et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, which in most symptomatic cases have less than half of wild-type <italic>Sgce</italic> levels, exhibit jerking movements and dystonic-like motor symptoms that are responsive to ethanol. Our success in generating symptomatic mice using an acute knockdown approach points to possible rodent-specific, developmental compensation for loss of <italic>Sgce</italic> in previous genetic mouse models of DYT11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokoi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yokoi et al., 2012b</xref>). Indeed, a recently-developed genetic model of DYT11 that used gene-trap technology to knock down the main and brain-specific isoforms of <italic>Sgce</italic> observed dystonic-like posturing between postnatal days 14 and 16, an important period of Purkinje cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). These symptoms did not persist into adulthood, however, supporting the hypothesis that developmental compensation may occur in genetic knockout animals. One possible source of compensation is the upregulation of genes with related functions. It has been shown that ε-SG forms complexes with the other members of the sarcoglycan family (α, β, γ,δ, and ζ), and also with members of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC) in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waite et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that upregulation of the other members in this complex during development could compensate for loss of <italic>Sgce</italic> in mice. The shRNA-mediated knockdown approach circumvents possible developmental compensation by knocking down the protein in the adult mouse and may be more effective than previous models of DYT11 for understanding how loss of <italic>Sgce</italic> leads to motor symptoms.</p><p>The model presented here is the first description of a mouse model of DYT11 that recapitulates the salient features of DYT11, namely, jerking, myoclonic-like movements and dystonia that were responsive to alcohol. However, in addition to overt dystonia, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice also had difficulty ambulating normally and showed a mildly ataxic gait. While ataxia is uncommon in DYT11 patients, it has been observed in individuals with SGCE mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drivenes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). It is also worth noting that the most obvious motor symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice were observed in the hind limbs and tails of the animals. While lower limb involvement has been reported in some DYT11 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobylecki et al., 2014</xref>), involvement of the trunk and upper extremities is far more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asmus et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that our method of evaluating symptom severity based on activity in the open field biased us towards highlighting motor dysfunction in the hind limbs and the tail, and limited our ability to detect more severe motor symptoms in the forelimbs and trunk of <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice that can be more carefully scrutinized in a skilled forelimb reaching task. Lastly, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice exhibited spinning when suspended by the tail. While there is no corresponding human symptom, understanding how loss of <italic>Sgce</italic> contributes to this symptom and how alcohol improves it may yield important insights into <italic>Sgce</italic> function.</p><p>The acute knockdown strategy further enables us to examine which parts of the brain are responsible for myoclonus and dystonia in DYT11. Our findings implicate the cerebellum as a central structure contributing to the motor symptoms in this disorder, in agreement with findings in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beukers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nitschke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Meer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Salm et al., 2013</xref>) and consistent with what has been reported in multiple dystonic rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Hess, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeDoux et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeDoux et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neychev et al., 2008</xref>). We found that knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> specifically in the cerebellum led to dystonic-like movements that were responsive to alcohol. This suggests that the motor symptoms are a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction, supported by the aberrant activity recorded from DCN neurons and Purkinje cells, and that alcohol may act through the cerebellum to ameliorate them. We found that both Purkinje cells and DCN neurons exhibited irregular firing rates in vivo, indicated by an increased ISICV. These findings are consistent with our observations in many animal models of movement disorders, including ataxia and dystonia. In general, the more symptomatic the animal, the more irregular the cerebellar activity. In these animals, we found that irregular activity of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons was correlated with the presence of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>), in agreement with what has been reported in other rodent models of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fremont et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Isaksen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LeDoux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeDoux and Lorden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux and Lorden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White and Sillitoe, 2017</xref>). While <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice exhibit dystonia, we did not perform EMG recordings in agonist and antagonist muscles at the time of recording. We were thus unable to determine whether highly irregular firing was time-locked to dystonic episodes. The increased ISI CV in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice thus reflects a combination of acute dystonic, and persistent abnormal motor activity in these animals.</p><p>Cerebellar contribution to DYT11 was examined previously in a Purkinje cell-specific knockout of <italic>Sgce.</italic> In contrast to our findings and what was reported in ubiquitous <italic>Sgce</italic> null mice, the symptoms of Purkinje cell knockout mice were quite mild; they exhibited a small deficit in motor learning but had no robust motor abnormalities or jerking movements, suggesting brain regions other than the cerebellum might contribute to these motor symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokoi et al., 2012a</xref>). However, one major difference between the present work and previous work is that our knockdown is not specific to Purkinje cells. It is possible that <italic>Sgce</italic>, which is expressed in DCN neurons in addition to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ritz et al., 2011</xref>), is important for the function of cerebellar output neurons. This is consistent with our finding that the average firing rate is decreased and the ISICV is increased in DCN neurons in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice. The effect of <italic>Sgce</italic> knockdown in DCN neurons may provide an alternative explanation for the more severe motor phenotype of <italic>Sgce</italic> null mice compared to the Purkinje cell-specific knockout. Further experiments are required to determine whether it is the intrinsic activity of DCN neurons that contributes to motor symptoms, or whether it is their synaptic inputs, including Purkinje cells, which were also affected in our study, that lead to erratic cerebellar output and subsequent motor abnormalities. The symptomatic mouse model produced by acute knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> provides a unique opportunity to address these questions.</p><p>Because so much is known about the microcircuitry of the cerebellum, as well as the channels that contribute to the intrinsic firing rate of cerebellar neurons, understanding how the electrical properties of cerebellar neurons change in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice will provide insight into the function of ε-SG under normal conditions. Understanding how alcohol acts to relieve dystonic symptoms would identify therapeutic targets for DYT11 in the cerebellum and help elucidate the mechanisms by which alcohol influences cerebellar output. A number of potential targets of ethanol in the brain have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narahashi et al., 2001</xref>). One well-described and intensely-debated target of ethanol is the delta subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanchar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallner et al., 2003</xref>), which is responsible for maintaining tonic inhibitory current in cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stell et al., 2003</xref>). Modulation of inhibitory currents by ethanol via extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is a potential mechanism for restoring the firing rate and regularity of cerebellar neurons, thereby relieving dystonia.</p><p>While our findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence in support of a role for the cerebellum in DYT11, our results do not rule out the possibility that other brain regions also contribute to the symptoms observed in these mice. Knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> in the basal ganglia induced subtle motor defects in the mice. Frequently, <italic>Sgce</italic> KD BG mice exhibited increased kinetic behavior specifically in the periphery of the open field chamber. An intriguing possibility is that this behavior is related more to the non-motor symptoms associated with DYT11, including obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety.</p><p>It is now well-established that there are a number of direct connections between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia. Given the extensive connections between these brain regions and the contributions of both structures to motor control, it has been suggested that movement disorders should be considered less as disorders of a particular brain region, and more as disorders of the motor circuit. This is because dysfunction in one node, that is the cerebellum or basal ganglia, can influence the activity of other nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bostan and Strick, 2018</xref>). With that in mind, two things become very clear. First, it is important from a basic science perspective to understand the site of initial dysfunction in the different dystonias in order to truly understand how abnormal movement results from a genetic mutation. In the case of DYT11, our approach suggests that loss-of-function of <italic>Sgce</italic> can lead to irregular activity of the cerebellum, resulting in motor symptoms. Understanding this link between genetic mutation and motor symptoms will yield important information about cerebellar function in health and disease. Second, the result of the interconnectivity of different brain structures is that there are multiple sites for therapeutic intervention. It has been shown that deep brain stimulation of the GPi, as well as the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) can improve symptoms in most DYT11 patients, with or without <italic>SGCE</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azoulay-Zyss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Pajarín et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kosutzka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rocha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rughani and Lozano, 2013</xref>). It is possible that DBS of the GPi or VIM may influence cerebellar-recipient regions of the thalamus, disrupting the irregular output from the cerebellum and, in this way, improving motor symptoms. Indeed, there is considerable overlap of cerebellar and pallidal projections in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hintzen et al., 2018</xref>). Another interesting possibility, consistent with pervious work on the anatomy of cerebellar-basal ganglia connectivity, is that irregular activity of the cerebellum subsequently drives irregular activity in the striatum, leading to motor symptoms in dystonia. DBS of the GPi may relieve dystonic symptoms by disrupting the abnormal output from the basal ganglia, caused in part by cerebellar dysfunction, and thereby restoring some functionality to the system.</p><p>Taken together, our studies show that loss of function of <italic>Sgce</italic> in the cerebellum results in aberrant cerebellar output which in turn causes motor dysfunction, including jerking movements and dystonia, suggesting that the cerebellum may be a major of site of dysfunction in DYT11. The efficacy of ethanol in reducing the severity of the motor symptoms in <italic>Sgce</italic> KD CB mice, as it does in DYT11 patients, further validates the model. Thus, the acute shRNA-mediated knockdown model of DYT11 described here not only provides a platform for further scrutiny of the mechanisms by which loss of ε-SG causes abnormal neuronal activity and motor dysfunction in DYT11, but also provides an opportunity to study how alcohol exerts its beneficial effects and, subsequently, identify alternative therapeutic strategies that mimic the effects of alcohol without its addictive and neurodegenerative consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifier(s)</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Sequenced-based reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>Sgce</italic> KD 1</td><td valign="top">RNAi Consortium (sequence) <break/>Virovek (virus)</td><td valign="top">TRCN0000119308;

Craniotomies approximately 500 µm in diameter were made over the cerebellum for neuronal recordings. Recording sites were covered with a silicone adhesive (KWIK-SIL, WPI). Dental cement was used to construct a well around the recording site in order to hold saline during recording sessions.</p><p>Extracellular electrophysiological recordings were made from well-isolated single units using a tungsten electrode (Thomas Recording, 2–3 MΩ), which was advanced into the cerebellum until either the Purkinje cell layer or the DCN was reached. Purkinje cells were identified by location, firing rate, and the presence of complex spikes. DCN neurons were identified primarily by location and firing rate. Neurophysiological signals were amplified 2000x using a custom built amplifier and digitized at 20 kHz using a National Instruments BNC-2110. Waveforms were sorted offline by principal component analysis (Plexon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) was used to perform all statistical analyses. Data were assessed for normality using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Non-normal data were compared using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Between group analysis was performed using the Holm-Sidak method. Each row was analyzed individually, without assuming a consistent SD. Normally distributed data sets were statistically with a two-tailed, paired Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. Data are reported in text as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise stated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the scorers of the open field videos for all behavioral experiments, as well as our funding source, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the NIH.

Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT11) in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Louis Ptacek as Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Ledoux (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors used an shRNA knockdown approach to generate a phenotypically penetrant mouse model of myoclonus-dystonia (alcohol-responsive dystonia), DYT11. Previous transgenic mouse models did not have dystonic postures typical in this condition. Moreover, the authors show that cerebellar knockdown of the gene produces dystonia, whereas basal ganglia knockdown results in more minor motor deficits. They go on to show that Purkinje cells and Deep Cerebellar Nucleus (DCN) neurons show abnormal rates and patterns of activity in the model. These results are exciting for two reasons. First, they provide a new, phenotypically penetrant mouse model of DYT11, which will permit future physiological, pharmacological and other studies to elucidate both the cellular mechanisms and test potential therapeutics for the disorder. Second, they corroborate this group's prior studies in other forms of dystonia, which suggest that the cerebellum is likely to be a primary site of cellular dysfunction in many forms of dystonia, and that abnormal patterns of Purkinje cell/DCN neuronal activity are a signature of this movement disorder.</p><p>Despite the excitement and potential impact of this study, there are some methodological issues that weaken their findings, and addressing these with some clarifications and minor additional experiments would make the paper a much more robust basis for future studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To strengthen the causal relationship between knockdown of epsilon sarcoglycan, it would be very helpful if the authors plotted individual mice in their cohort, comparing either SGCE protein levels or a surrogate marker, such as GFP expression associated with the shRNA. Some of the mice without symptoms may have had a more limited infection zone within the cerebellum, for example. It appears the individual protein levels are available, given the dots overlaying the Western blot results in Figure 1.</p><p>2) The authors mention that DYT11 is a dominant disorder – does that mean that humans with the disorder only carry one mutant gene? Do humans have about 50% of the protein expression, and haploinsufficiency produces disease symptoms? Or is it a toxic gain of function mutation? This issue merits some discussion in the text, and how their model may or may not replicate the human state in terms of protein.</p><p>3) The hyperactivity phenotype alluded to in the text (for the basal ganglia knockdown mice) is very interesting. Can the authors please include this data (it says &quot;data not shown&quot;). Quantitation of average velocity, rearing, or other hyperactivity phenotypes could be helpful. Video of each session could also be analyzed for time spent in the center versus periphery of the chamber, as this represents a phenotype linked to anxiety manipulations in mice, and could implicate the basal ganglia in the nonmotor aspects of the syndrome (as the authors suggest in the discussion).</p><p>4) The fact that ethanol relieves some of the motor symptoms in the cerebellar knockdown mice is compelling. However, it is not clear on why the dystonia score is noted in the original description of the mice (Figure 1), but the disability score and spinning score are noted in the ethanol experiments (Figure 3). Could the dystonia score also be plotted in Figure 3? I note that Dystonia score is displayed for the experiments using tor1A knockdown mice, so it would be best to include the same outcome measure for SGCE mice. Were saline injections done as controls for the effects of time and injection/handling itself on SGCE knockdown mice in the open field? The inclusion of open field distance or velocity with saline and ethanol would greatly strengthen the conclusions from these experiments.</p><p>5) The single-unit recordings from cerebellar neurons are interesting vis a vis the circuit mechanism of dystonia. Though the animals were head-fixed, were the authors able to note any dystonic posturing during the recordings? And if so, did the firing vary during dystonic episodes? This might help get at whether this is a fixed physiological abnormality and/or there are acute changes in cerebellar firing during dystonic movements. Likewise, did they note relationships between the severity of the motor phenotype in the open field and the degree of physiological abnormality noted during the single-unit recordings?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Acute cerebellar knockdown of <italic>Sgce</italic> reproduces salient features of Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT11) in mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some small remaining issues to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors did a good job of addressing the reviewer comments/requests and explained the limitations when appropriate. While they were not able to do everything requested, they made a good effort and these are not easy studies to perform. I appreciated the additional introduction and discussion which help to motivate their study and also fit their findings into the larger literature regarding this form of dystonia. I also appreciate the additional data they collected or have now included in the figures. I think this manuscript is now appropriate for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, the revised manuscript is much improved. The authors have appropriately addressed my concerns and I have no additional queries.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors used shRNA Ko to generate a mouse model mimicking the human movement disorders in myoclonus dystonia (DYT11). This is a very interesting and exciting paper, with extensive study of the phenotype and the beneficial effect of alcohol. In line with previous results from this team, they demonstrated that the main dysfunction lays in the cerebellum and deep cerebellar nuclei, with abnormal pattern of activity. Their results are in line with the cerebellar dysfunction observed in humans; Overall, this work sheds additional light on the human disorder and will inspire clinical research. A few issues should be addressed as below:</p><p>– As the authors intend to mimic the clinical phenotype of humans, they should be particularly careful in describing the abnormal features observed in mice;</p><p>– The term &quot;tic-like&quot; is inappropriate and should be avoided and the word &quot;jerks &quot; should be preferred, and become more precise with the word 'myoclonus&quot;.

This would be in line with the anatomical connectivity (as reported by P Strick' s group) and would greatly support the beneficial effect of pallidal stimulation.</p><p>– In addition, the authors may or may not discuss the behavioral changes that look alike those reported in the &quot;anxiety&quot; models in mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52101.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To strengthen the causal relationship between knockdown of epsilon sarcoglycan, it would be very helpful if the authors plotted individual mice in their cohort, comparing either SGCE protein levels or a surrogate marker, such as GFP expression associated with the shRNA.

Consistent with previous data in an shRNA-mediated mouse model of DYT1 (Fremont et al., 2017), animals with higher levels of knockdown tended to have more severe symptoms. Despite this trend, it is worth noting that 5/20 Sgce KD CB animals had more than 50% knockdown of Sgce RNA compared to WT, but a dystonia score of less than 2. It is thus possible that incomplete penetrance of the phenotype plays a role in the variability of the symptoms observed in Sgce KD CB mice. It also needs to be acknowledged that there is not always a one to one correlation between RNA levels, and the expression level of a functional protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors mention that DYT11 is a dominant disorder – does that mean that humans with the disorder only carry one mutant gene?

This issue merits some discussion in the text, and how their model may or may not replicate the human state in terms of protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this issue. <italic>SGCE</italic> is maternally imprinted in DNA and RNA samples from human blood, but the imprinting pattern in the human brain is unknown. Consequently, the vast majority of patients inherit the disorder from their father, while the disorder is maternally inherited in approximately 5-10% of cases (Asmus et al., 2002; Grabowski et al., 2003; Muller et al., 2002). In mice, there is no expression of maternally-inherited <italic>Sgce</italic> (Yokoi et al., 2005). To reflect the inheritance pattern observed in humans, mouse models of DYT11 were generated by crossing male heterozygous <italic>Sgce</italic> knockout mice with wild-type females. We appreciate that our model does not reflect the complete loss-of-function of <italic>SGCE</italic> that occurs in humans. However, we believe that the effectiveness of ethanol on the symptoms of these mice, and conversely the lack of an ethanol effect on a model of DYT1 generated using the same approach, supports the utility of our shRNA model of DYT11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The hyperactivity phenotype alluded to in the text (for the basal ganglia knockdown mice) is very interesting. Can the authors please include this data (it says &quot;data not shown&quot;). Quantitation of average velocity, rearing, or other hyperactivity phenotypes could be helpful. Video of each session could also be analyzed for time spent in the center versus periphery of the chamber, as this represents a phenotype linked to anxiety manipulations in mice, and could implicate the basal ganglia in the nonmotor aspects of the syndrome (as the authors suggest in the discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ desire for the behavioral phenotype of sgce KD BG mice to be examined more quantitatively. We analyzed a number of different parameters in these mice, and that data are now included in Figure 2, and its associated supplemental figures. Examination of the movement tracks in the open field revealed the greatest difference between sgce KD BG and NT BG mice. Example tracks, as well as the average, are now included in the manuscript. While the tracks of the animals are clearly different, this qualitative difference does not translate to a statistically significant differences in the average time spent in the center vs. the periphery (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), a parameter suggested by the reviewers for further scrutiny. This could be because this measure may not be an appropriate parameter to quantify the obvious differences in the behavior of these mice. Or, quite possibly, our ability to detect differences in the center vs periphery analysis is likely limited by the relatively small size of the Open Field chamber that we used in our experiments. Lastly, individual mouse to mouse variability may have reduced our statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fact that ethanol relieves some of the motor symptoms in the cerebellar knockdown mice is compelling. However, it is not clear on why the dystonia score is noted in the original description of the mice (Figure 1), but the disability score and spinning score are noted in the ethanol experiments (Figure 3). Could the dystonia score also be plotted in Figure 3? I note that Dystonia score is displayed for the experiments using tor1A knockdown mice, so it would be best to include the same outcome measure for SGCE mice. Were saline injections done as controls for the effects of time and injection/handling itself on SGCE knockdown mice in the open field? The inclusion of open field distance or velocity with saline and ethanol would greatly strengthen the conclusions from these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The Disability and Spinning scores are used because we believe these scales more fully capture the range of symptoms in these mice, compared to say the Dystonia score. Nonetheless, we concur with the request to also examine the Dystonia Score, as well as the open field distance or velocity. To address these comments, the Dystonia Score in response to ethanol injection was analyzed and is now presented in Figure 3. The Dystonia score is significantly reduced in these mice after demonstration of ethanol. Despite significant reductions in the dystonic symptoms, there was no consistent difference in the distance traveled by the mice after ethanol (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We have also included control experiments with mice injected with saline (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). There was no difference in the Dystonia score or distance traveled after injections of saline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The single-unit recordings from cerebellar neurons are interesting vis a vis the circuit mechanism of dystonia.

Likewise, did they note relationships between the severity of the motor phenotype in the open field and the degree of physiological abnormality noted during the single-unit recordings?</p></disp-quote><p>While sgce KD CB mice exhibit dystonia, we did not perform EMG recordings in agonist and antagonist muscles at the time of single unit recording. We were thus unable to determine whether dystonic episodes were time-locked to high frequency burst firing. Despite this ambiguity in the moment-to-moment state of the animal during electrophysiological recordings, the increased ISI CV observed in Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in sgce KD CB mice were calculated over extended periods of time and reflect a combination of transient and persistent abnormal motor activity in these animals.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors used shRNA Ko to generate a mouse model mimicking the human movement disorders in myoclonus dystonia (DYT11).

Walking backwards is something that we have observed in several of our mouse models of both ataxia and dystonia, so we did not initially consider it as a specific sign of a behavioral disorder. With that said, to follow the suggestion made by the reviewer we manually scored “walking backward” in our mice This was very time-consuming and the reason for our slow turnaround of the paper. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, there seemed to be substantial increase in backward walking with sgce KD in the cerebellum. However, walking backwards was most often observed with persistent dystonic postures. Therefore, we feel that it might not be prudent to conclude that increased walking backwards was due to cerebellar effects on anxiety-like behavior and not due to cerebellar effects on movement. As such, we have not included this figure in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Increased frequency of walking backward observed in sgce KD CB mice.</title><p>Mice were recorded for 5 minutes in the open field.

DBS of the GPi may relieve dystonic symptoms by disrupting the abnormal output from the basal ganglia, caused in part by cerebellar dysfunction, and thereby restoring some functionality to the system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In addition, the authors may or may not discuss the behavioral changes that look alike those reported in the &quot;anxiety&quot; models in mice.</p></disp-quote><p>To further address the reviewer’s interest in anxiety-like behaviors, we examined “time spent inactive,” “supported rearing,” and “unsupported rearing.” Our ability to measure “freezing,” as the reviewer recommended, was limited by our tracking software. In an attempt to capture “freezing,” we measured duration of time spent at an &quot;Activity level&quot; below 1.00% of all activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). “Activity Level” measures changes in all the pixels of the video.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cumulative duration of time spent inactive in sgce KD CB and sgce BG mice did not differ from NT CB or NT BG mice, respectively, or WT mice.</title><p>1-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s correction for multiple comparisons: p &gt; 0.05 for WT vs. NT CB, WT vs. NT BG, WT vs. sgce KD CB, WT vs. sgce KD BG, NT CB vs. sgce KD CB, and NT BG vs. sgce KD BG; N, WT = 12; N, NT CB = 14; N, sgce KD CB = 20; N, NT BG = 12; N, sgce KD BG = 19.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52101-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Rearing behavior has also been suggested previously as a way to measure anxiety-like behavior in our mice.

This is likely due to the deficit in movement observed in these mice. In contrast, only unsupported rearing was reduced in sgce KD BG mice. Unsupported rearing is a measure that is sensitive to stress and context{Sturman, 2018 #952}, and a reduction in unsupported rearing, but not supported rearing, in sgce KD BG mice may reflect increased anxiety in these animals (Sturman et al., 2018).</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1)Sturman, O., P.L.
