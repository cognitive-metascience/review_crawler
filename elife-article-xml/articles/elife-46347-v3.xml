Its biological activities require topological entrapment of DNA within a lumen(s) formed by cohesin subunits. The reversible dissociation of cohesin’s Smc3p and Mcd1p subunits is postulated to form a regulated gate that allows DNA entry and exit into the lumen. We assessed gate-independent functions of this interface in yeast using a fusion protein that joins Smc3p to Mcd1p. We show that in vivo all the regulators of cohesin promote DNA binding of cohesin by mechanisms independent of opening this gate. Furthermore, we show that this interface has a gate-independent activity essential for cohesin to bind chromosomes. We propose that this interface regulates DNA entrapment by controlling the opening and closing of one or more distal interfaces formed by cohesin subunits, likely by inducing a conformation change in cohesin. Furthermore, cohesin regulators modulate the interface to control both DNA entrapment and cohesin functions after DNA binding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cohesion</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>DNA binding</kwd><kwd>Smc3</kwd><kwd>Mcd1</kwd><kwd>Scc1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35 GM-118189-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshland</surname><given-names>Douglas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interface formed where Smc3p and Mcd1p bind each other regulates cohesin DNA binding and cohesion by a mechanism independently from its putative role as a DNA exit gate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cohesin is a member of a family of Smc complexes required to higher order chromosome structure and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Cohesin tethers sister chromatids together from S phase though metaphase to ensure proper segregation at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). Cohesin binds chromosomes at multiple sites, termed CARs, to enable tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blat and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Megee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laloraya et al., 2000</xref>). Cohesin is also important for mitotic chromosome condensation and proper gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rollins et al., 2004</xref>). These functions of cohesin may arise from its ability to partition chromosomes into distinct segments that could be packaged into domains of condensation and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eagen, 2018</xref>). Finally, cohesin is loaded at sites of DNA breaks to facilitate both cohesion and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unal et al., 2007</xref>). Understanding how cohesin carries out all these biological functions requires elucidating how cohesin binds to DNA, how binding is maintained and how binding is abrogated.</p><p>Cohesin must stably bind DNA to execute its different functions. In budding yeast, the four evolutionarily conserved subunits of cohesin are Smc1p, Smc3p, Mcd1p/Scc1p and Scc3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Losada et al., 1998</xref>). Biochemical studies indicate that DNA is topologically entrapped within cohesin, and such entrapment can occur within a trimer formed by Smc1p, Smc3p and Mcd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ivanov and Nasmyth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haering et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). The trimer architecture suggests it forms two lumens capable of trapping DNA. A large lumen is formed by dimerization of the Smc1p and Smc3p hinge domains at one end and dimerization of the two head domains at the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A smaller lumen is formed by the binding of the Mcd1p C-terminal domain to the Smc1p head domain, and the binding of the Mcd1 N-terminal helical domain (NHD) to coiled coil residues emerging from the Smc3p head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haering et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). While initial models for topological entrapment favored DNA in the large lumen, studies of cohesin and other related SMC complexes have suggested entrapment by the small lumen as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stigler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46347.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cohesin structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the cohesin complex and Pds5p.

Controlling the opening and closing of these interfaces provides a mechanism for regulators to promote cohesin loading onto DNA, stable binding to DNA, and release from DNA. A dimeric Scc2p/Scc4p complex termed the cohesin loader is required for cohesin to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>). Evidence indicates that DNA enters through opening of the hinge dimer interface and not through interfaces formed by head dimerization or interfaces between Smc3p and Mcd1p or Mcd1p and Smc1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>). However, in vitro biochemical experiments suggested that Scc2/Scc4 may load cohesin onto DNA by the opening of the interface between Smc3p and Mcd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>). In this context, the Smc3p Mcd1p interface is a potential entry gate for topological entrapment.</p><p>Once loaded onto DNA, cohesin can either remain stably bound to it or be released. Toggling between these two states has been postulated to result from the antagonistic activities of the cohesin regulators, Eco1p, Pds5p and Wpl1p acting on or near the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. Eco1p (Ctf7p) mediated acetylation of the Smc3p K112 K113 head domain residues promotes stable cohesin DNA binding and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skibbens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tóth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2018</xref>). Once cohesion is established, Pds5p promotes cohesion maintenance as well as condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stead et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robison et al., 2018</xref>). Wpl1p binds to Pds5p to promote cohesin’s release from DNA and serves to antagonize both cohesion and condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Additional studies of Eco1p, Wpl1p and Pds5p have suggested a molecular basis for their ability to toggle cohesin binding to DNA. The binding of an Mcd1p N-terminal cleavage fragment to Smc3p is destabilized by Wpl1p, but is stabilized by Smc3p acetylation or by mutants that bypass <italic>eco1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). These experiments led to an exit gate model whereby DNA can escape cohesin entrapment by Wpl1p-dependent opening the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. Smc3p acetylation would inhibit Wpl1p, thereby keeping the interface closed and DNA topologically bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the Smc3p Mcd1p interface has been postulated to serve as a regulated DNA exit gate and as well as a regulated entrance gate.</p><p>While compelling in its simplicity, viewing the function of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface and cohesin regulators solely through the lens of a putative DNA gate has been challenged by several observations. First, cohesin is stably bound to DNA when Smc3p K112 K113 acetylation is prevented by mutating the critical lysines (<italic>smc3 K112R K113R)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, acetylation of these residues is not needed to stabilize topological entrapment of DNA in vivo. However, both <italic>smc3 K112R K113R</italic> and <italic>eco1∆ wpl1∆</italic> mutants exhibit a dramatic defect in sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>). These results suggest that acetylation promotes cohesion by an additional step beyond preventing DNA release through an exit gate. Finally, recent experiments suggest that the function of cohesin and other Smc complexes requires a conformational change of the coiled coil, likely driven by the head ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soh et al., 2015</xref>). The binding of Mcd1p to both the head domain of Smc1 and the coiled coil of Smc3 provides a potential mechanism to transduce the ATP state of the head domain to initiate a conformation change of the coiled coils.</p><p>Here, we use a fusion protein of Smc3p and Mcd1p to permanently shut the putative DNA gate as a tool to evaluate gate-independent functions of this interface. We examined whether the fusion could suppress the need for the cohesin loader Scc2p, the Scc3p cohesin subunit, Pds5p and Smc3p K112 K113 acetylation. Our results show that in vivo all these regulators of cohesin promote DNA binding or cohesion by mechanisms independent of opening the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. Furthermore, mutations altering the interface reveal it has a gate-independent activity essential for cohesin to bind DNA in vivo. These observations suggest new models for the Smc3p Mcd1p interface in topological entrapment and as a target of cohesin regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We wanted to assess whether cohesin regulators control cohesin function by modulating the transient opening of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. To do so, we used a previously characterized gene fusion in which the open-reading frame (ORF) of <italic>MCD1</italic> was placed in frame at the end of the ORF for <italic>SMC3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>). The product of this gene fuses the Mcd1p N-terminus to the Smc3p C-terminus so this putative DNA gate cannot open. It supports viability as sole source of both Smc3p and Mcd1p. Consequently, regulators that act solely by stabilizing the exit gate should no longer be needed for cohesin function in fusion bearing strains.</p><p>We used the Smc3p Mcd1p fusion to test gate-dependent functions of three proteins associated with the trimer cohesin, Scc2p and Pds5p regulators as well as the the Scc3p cohesin subunit. Scc3p is required for cohesin binding to DNA, cohesion and condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tóth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>). Since Scc2p, Scc3p and Pds5p are subunits of complexes that bind near the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rowland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>), they are in a position to modulate the Smc3p Mcd1p interface to control its dissociation to allow entry or exit of DNA.</p><p>To assess the importance of the dissociation of Smc3 Mcd1 interface for these three regulatory proteins, we first built haploid strains bearing the fusion gene as the sole source of both Smc3p and Mcd1p function. We then replaced the endogenous <italic>SCC2, SCC3</italic>, <italic>PDS5</italic> genes with conditional alleles containing a C-terminal 3V5 tag and an auxin-inducible degron (AID) called <italic>SCC3-AID</italic>, <italic>SCC2-AID</italic> or <italic>PDS5-AID</italic>. The AID degron enabled the rapid degradation of each of these proteins upon auxin addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eng et al., 2014</xref>). As a control, we placed the same <italic>AID</italic> constructs in an otherwise wild-type haploid strain to compare the effects of their depletion with and without the fusion. For clarity, strains that express the normal configuration of Smc3p and Mcd1p as separate subunits are referred to as normal strains or as having normal cohesin. Strains that have the Smc3p-Mcd1p fusion are referred to as fusion strains or as having fusion cohesin.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fusion strains still require Scc2p, Scc3p and Pds5p for viability and sister chromatid cohesion</title><p>We first assessed whether the fusion bypasses the need for Scc2p, Scc3p and Pds5p for cell viability.

In budding yeast, after replication the sister chromatids are so closely associated they cannot be resolved as individual chromatids by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guacci et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, in the LacO-LacI assay, haploids in mid-M exhibit a single GFP focus, whereas cells that are defective for cohesion have two GFP spots, one from each sister chromatid.</p><p>As expected, mid-M arrested cells with normal cohesin had cohesion so two GFP spots were detected in only 5–10% of cells.

These cells were processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-Mcd1p antibodies (Materials and methods). In wild-type cells, fusion cohesin bound with the same pattern as normal cohesin at a pericentric <italic>CAR</italic> (<italic>CARC1</italic>) and an arm <italic>CAR</italic> (<italic>TRM1</italic>) locus as well as immediately adjacent to <italic>CEN4</italic> and <italic>CEN14</italic>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the minor defect in cohesion observed in the fusion strain was not due to effects on fusion cohesin levels or distribution on chromosomes. For both normal and fusion cohesin, depletion of Scc2p-AID or Scc3p-AID completely abolished cohesin binding at peri-centric <italic>CARC1</italic> and arm CAR <italic>TRM1</italic> and dramatically reduced binding near <italic>CEN4</italic> and <italic>CEN14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The lack of cohesin binding to DNA was not due to loss of either Mcd1p or Smc3p Mcd1p fusion as shown by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, Scc2p and Scc3p are essential for both normal and fusion cohesin to bind chromosomes. The robust fusion cohesin binding to DNA means the Smc3p Mcd1p interface is not the sole an entry gate for DNA. The fact that Scc2p and Scc3p are required for fusion cohesin binding to DNA means they do not function solely to prevent DNA escape through the putative Smc3p Mcd1p ‘exit’ gate.</p><p>We also assessed the effect of Pds5p-AID depletion on cohesin binding in mid-M arrested cells bearing normal cohesin or with fusion cohesin. Pds5p-AID depletion was confirmed by both western blot and loss of Pds5p binding to chromosomes as assayed by ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>). There was a decrease in Mcd1p of normal cohesin and a more modest decrease of fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This result is consistent with Pds5p serving partially to protecting Mcd1p from factors that degrade it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stead et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Ambrosio and Lavoie, 2014</xref>).

Adjacent to <italic>CENs</italic>, normal cohesin binding was unperturbed whereas fusion cohesin binding was reduced ~50%. Thus, the fusion did not suppress the decrease in cohesin binding to DNA caused by Pds5p-AID depletion.

Forty-five percent of the smc3p-RR fusion bearing cells had a cohesion defect, an ~2 fold increase compared to wild-type fusion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This increase suggests that Smc3 head acetylation regulates cohesion by a mechanism other than or in addition to blocking DNA exit through the putative gate. The cohesion defect could also explain the benomyl sensitivity as microtubule destabilization would abrogate early S phase bipolar attachments necessary for proper segregation in cells with severe cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guacci and Koshland, 2012</xref>).

This similarity means the increased cohesion defects in the RR fusion was not due to decreased cohesin binding to DNA.

Mutations in Mcd1p or Smc3p that affect residues in the interface are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arumugam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robison et al., 2018</xref>). One such mutation, <italic>smc3-L1029R</italic> was thought to prevent cohesin binding to DNA because when tagged with GFP, it failed to immunolocalize to the cohesin-rich centromere cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). This mutation also abolished a chemical crosslink normally detected between Smc3p and Mcd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). These results were interpreted to mean that interface mutants eliminated Smc3p Mcd1p association, thereby allowing DNA to escape from cohesin entrapment. However, our results with fusion cohesin show that Pds5p and Scc3p promote DNA binding by mechanisms independent keeping this interface ‘gate’ closed. Their binding proximal to the Smc3p Mcd1p interface raised the alternative possibility that this interface has a gate-independent biochemical property that regulates cohesin binding to DNA.</p><p>To test this possibility, we examined mutations that alter amino acids of the interface from both Mcd1p (<italic>mcd1-L75K</italic> and <italic>mcd1-L89K</italic>) and Smc3p (<italic>smc3-I1026R</italic> and <italic>smc3-L1029R</italic>).

Three possible outcomes are expected from the fusion mutants. If all these mutations abrogate cohesin function solely by preventing closure of a putative Smc3p Mcd1p interface exit gate, then all four mutants should be suppressed by the fusion. Alternatively, if the fusion fails to suppress all these mutants, then these residues must modulate cohesin in a way distinct from keeping a putative exit gate closed. Finally, the fusion could suppress mutants in only Smc3p or only Mcd1p. For example, if Mcd1p residues only promote association with Smc3p, whereas Smc3p residues have a second function, then the fusion would suppress only the <italic>mcd1</italic> mutations.</p><p>Before testing these mutants in the fusion, we further characterized them in normal cohesin to provide a baseline for judging their effects on fusion cohesin.

All four mutant fusion strains had almost no sister chromatid cohesion when depleted for Mcd1p-AID or Smc3p-AID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref>).

The loss of cohesin binding to DNA explains why the interface fusion mutants were inviable and unable to generate cohesion.</p><p>The shared dramatic phenotypes of all four mutant fusions lead to several important conclusions about the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. First, the amino acids of Mcd1p and Smc3p that make up the interface must have essential biochemical activities other than directly maintaining the topological integrity of the cohesin ring at this interface. Second, the fact that mutations in Smc3p Mcd1p interface residues have the same phenotypes suggests that these Smc3p and Mcd1p regions collaborate to perform the same biological function, likely through their interaction. Finally, the absence of DNA binding in the mutant fusions suggests that at least one essential biochemical activity of the interface is to promote DNA entrapment by modulating the opening or stable closing of a distal interface of cohesin. This modulation of a distal interface could be achieved directly through changing cohesin structure or indirectly through a regulator.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Elucidating how cohesin carries out its many biological activities requires understanding how cohesin’s topological entrapment of DNA is established, maintained and released. A reversible dissociation of the interface between Smc3p and Mcd1p has been proposed to be either an entrance gate or an exit gate enabling cohesin to establish or maintain topological DNA entrapment, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we assessed gate-independent functions of this interface in yeast using a fusion protein where Smc3p at its C-terminus was fused to Mcd1p at its N-terminus. Our results reveal surprising phenotypes that provide significant new insights into the mechanism and regulation of topological entrapment.</p><p>We show that fusion cohesin binds DNA with the same distribution and at similar if not higher levels as wild-type cohesin. Furthermore, we corroborate previous finding that fusion cohesin is capable of robust sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom et al., 2018</xref>). These two features coupled with the requirement for topological entrapment to generate cohesion, strongly suggests that DNA efficiently enters cohesin through an interface other than the Smc3p Mcd1p interface to become topologically entrapped.</p><p>We cannot rule out that the Smc3p Mcd1p interface could act as an alternative secondary entrance gate for DNA. However, recent observations show SMC complexes are DNA translocases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). This complicated activity likely requires a spatially constrained sequence of reaction intermediates that would be incompatible with promiscuous mechanisms for DNA binding and entrapment.</p><p>Surprisingly, we also find that fusion cohesin containing mutations in the Smc3p coil or Mcd1p NHD interface completely fails to bind DNA as assayed by ChIP. Therefore, this interface is essential for cohesin to DNA binding even though itself is not a DNA entrance gate. A complete absence of ChIP signal is also seen when cohesin DNA entrapment is abrogated by depleting cohesin subunits or cohesin loader (This study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Çamdere et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, <italic>eco1</italic> mutants destabilize cohesin binding to DNA yet exhibit cohesin ChIP signals equivalent to wild-type, likely because transient cohesin entrapment is preserved by formaldehyde crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lengronne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noble et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the severity of the phenotype of mutations in the Smc3p Mcd1p interface suggest that this interface normally promotes the establishment of DNA entrapment. Since DNA cannot enter through the Smc3p and Mcd1p in fusion cohesin, this interface must promote the establishment of cohesin topological entrapment by allowing DNA to enter cohesin through either Smc1p Mcd1p or hinge dimer interface. We favor the hinge dimer interface because sealing this interface in vivo causes inviability and inhibits cohesin DNA binding, whereas fusing the Smc1p Mcd1p interface had no effect on viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which the Smc3p Mcd1p interface promotes the opening or closing of a distal interface of the cohesin remains to be determined. The interface could promote DNA binding indirectly by recruiting factors like Scc2p or Scc3p, which are essential for cohesin loading onto DNA. However, fusion cohesin and the <italic>smc3-L1029R</italic> fusion mutant bind Scc2p and Scc3p equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>), disfavoring this model.</p><p>Alternatively, we prefer a model in which the Smc3p-Mcd1p interface directly modulates a change in cohesin conformation that promotes topological entrapment. Different conformations of cohesin and other SMC complexes have been observed and to be dependent upon the head ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Based upon these observations, we suggest that the ATPase alters Smc1p interaction with the C terminus of Mcd1p which in turn alters the coiled coil through the interaction of the Mcd1-NHD with the Smc3p coiled coil. The subsequent change in the coiled coil alters a distal interface to stimulate DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). By this model, Scc2p and Scc3p could alter the interface through their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2014</xref>), or through their binding to Mcd1p.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46347.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for how the Smc3p Mcd1p interface regulates the hinge dimer interface to control cohesin DNA binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left side</italic>: cohesin complex in an open ring conformation. <italic>Middle top</italic>: cohesin loader Scc2p/Scc4p binding at the Smc3p Mcd1p interface (not shown) triggers a conformation change that opens the hinge dimer (half-moons) interface, which allows DNA (blue-black helix) to enters cohesin.

Pds5p has both positive and negative functions so it is depicted differently with the green oval showing its positive role in promoting DNA binding and the green arc showing its negative role as it binds Wpl1p. We note that recent in vitro evidence suggests DNA may first interact with cohesin at the Scc3p and Mcd1p region entry into the trimer. This earlier step is not depicted and has no bearing on our model.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46347-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Our analysis of the fusion cohesin in cells defective for Pds5p and Smc3p acetylation also suggest novel functions for the interface in post-DNA binding functions of cohesin. Previously, these factors were suggested to stabilize DNA entrapment by inhibiting exit of DNA through the interface between Smc3p and Mcd1p. This model predicted that the fusion of Smc3p and Mcd1p should suppress Pds5p or acetylation defects. However, we demonstrate here that the Smc3p-Mcd1p fusion fails to suppress any phenotypes of Pds5p depletion, and only partially suppresses the phenotypes of Smc3p lacking K112, K113 acetylation. Thus, these regulators have post-DNA binding functions independent of preventing DNA exit through the Smc3p Mcd1p interface.</p><p>While these post-DNA binding functions of Pds5p and Smc3p acetylation could be totally independent of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface, a more parsimonious model would be that these regulators act through the interface by modulating its ability to alter cohesin conformation. Precedence for the Smc3p Mcd1p interface playing a role in post DNA binding comes from the study of DNA damage induced cohesion in mid-M. In undamaged cells, cohesin loads onto DNA in mid-M but fails to generate cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unal et al., 2007</xref>). However, upon DNA damage, post-translational modifications of the Mcd1-NHD make cohesin that is loaded in mid-M phase become cohesive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, modification of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface can modulate cohesin function after DNA binding in response to DNA damage. This result raises the possibility that the Smc3p Mcd1p interface also modulates post-DNA binding functions of cohesin in general.</p><p>The ability of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface to alter a distal interface required for DNA binding also suggests a potential alternative mechanism of Wpl1p-induced removal of cohesin from DNA. The existing model is based upon the observation that Wpl1p has been shown to destabilize the binding of an N-terminal Mcd1p fragment to cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). This observation has been interpreted as strong evidence that Wpl1p opens the Smc3p Mcd1p interface to allow DNA to escape topological entrapment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). Our data do not exclude this ‘exit gate’ model. However, it is worth noting that structural and crosslinking studies suggests that Pds5p binds both to Mcd1p near the NHD and to Smc3p proximal to interaction with the Mcd1p NHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eng et al., 2014</xref>); Huis in 't <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, Pds5p provides a second link between Mcd1p and Smc3p distinct from the Smc3p Mcd1p interface. Because of this second link, destabilization of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface would not be sufficient to allow DNA escape through this interface. As an alternative model, we suggest Wpl1p-mediated dissociation of the Smc3p Mcd1p interface abrogates DNA entrapment by promoting DNA escape through the same distal interface (likely the hinge) by which DNA enters to establish entrapment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). If so, the phenotype of mutations that compromise the stability of the hinge dimer could be suppressed by removing dimer antagonists like Wpl1p. Indeed, in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the inviability of mutations in the Smc1p or Smc3p hinge can be suppressed by deleting <italic>WPL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu and Yanagida, 2019</xref>). Therefore, the Smc3p Mcd1p interface is not itself an exit gate but rather a Wpl1p-dependent mediator of a distal exit gate.</p><p>In summary, all Smc complexes have a conserved interface analogous to the interface between the N terminus of Mcd1p and the coiled coil of Smc3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris and Löwe, 2016</xref>). Bacterial Smc complex and the yeast condensin can bind and then rapidly translocate along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merkenschlager and Nora, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>). Toggling these two activities will likely require conformational changes in the coiled coils. Given the conservation of Smc interfaces, these conformational changes are likely to be controlled by regulators acting on the interface analogous to the Smc3p Mcd1p interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NCBITaxon:4932</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">Yeast strains</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">qPCR primers</td><td valign="top">DNA primer</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal <break/>Anti-Mcd1p</td><td valign="top">V.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Communication between distinct subunit interfaces of the cohesin complex promotes its topological entrapment of DNA&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Prasad Jallepalli as the Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kerry Bloom (Reviewer #1); Susannah Rankin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an excellent manuscript that tests several key assumptions in the prevailing models about cohesin function. The authors employ a Smc3-Mcd1 fusion to covalently bond the putative DNA gate and proceed to test several models using various mutant combinations that are proposed to regulate the opening and closing of the DNA gate. The findings suggest that the Smc3-Mcd1 interface has important functions that are distinct from gating, and they demonstrate that DNA can enter the cohesin ring even when this interface cannot be opened. Overall the study is well executed and important for the field. The reviewers advise the following essential revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Even though the chromosome localization of the fusion protein is largely normal, the loading dynamics can be very different from the WT. Because this fusion protein cannot be unloaded by Wapl, it has a longer residence time on chromosomes. Defective/slower loading of the fusion may be masked by its inability to be released. Without kinetic data, the authors should interpret their results more cautiously. It remains possible that the Smc3-Scc1N interface is a DNA entry gate. If the gate is sealed by the fusion, an alternative gate is used, but the fusion is loaded less efficiently and with slower kinetics. This possibility needs to be discussed, and the conclusion stated with greater precision (the Smc3-Scc1N interface cannot be the sole, functional entry gate).</p><p>2) While the requirement for the intact Smc3-Scc1N interface is well demonstrated, the mechanism by which this interface exerts its function is not explored. The Discussion and model in Figure 8A are too speculative. This needs to be toned down.</p><p>3) The speculation in Figure 8B contradicts data from multiple labs. The fusion protein is more stable on chromosomes based on FRAP data in yeast. The N-terminal fragment of Scc1 is dissociated from Smc3 in a Wapl-dependent manner both in vitro and in yeast cells. Pds5 binding and Smc3 binding to Scc1N are mutually exclusive. These and other data show that the Smc3-Scc1N interface is the DNA exit gate. It should be removed or at least explained against the backdrop of the aforementioned and conflicting evidence.</p><p>4) The authors should comment on whether the 20-aa linker is expected to reconstitute the Smc3-Mcd1 interface, given its length versus the distance between the corresponding residues in structural models of the native interface.</p><p>5) It would be helpful if the authors commented on whether or not their findings support the alternative &quot;hold and release&quot; model described in Xu et al., 2018.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46347.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Even though the chromosome localization of the fusion protein is largely normal, the loading dynamics can be very different from the WT.

We deemphasize it in the revised Discussion by not describing the model in detail but merely referring to the model figure. The purpose of the model is in part to emphasize the reviewer’s point that the interface could function by multiple mechanism that hopefully will stimulate the reader to test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The speculation in Figure 8B contradicts data from multiple labs.

It should be removed or at least explained against the backdrop of the aforementioned and conflicting evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>None of the data from other labs proves that the Smc3p-Mcd1p interface is the exit gate. We have tried to clarify this point in the Discussion. What has been shown is that destabilization of this interface causes cohesin to dissociate from DNA. These results mean either the interface is the exit gate or a regulator of different interface that is the “real” exit gate. We provide one caveat to the previous interpretation that it is the exit gate. Pds5p by binding to Mcd1p and Smc3p provides a backup to the interface to prevent DNA from exiting even if the interface dissociates. The reviewer cites an observation that suggests that Pds5p binds to the Mcd1p NHD. The crosslinking between Pds5p and Smc3p is not at the interface but rather further along the coiled-coil, therefore this binding would not be mutually exclusive. Second this model has never made sense with the fact that Pds5p promotes DNA binding and cohesion maintenance in vivo as we have shown previously and show again here.</p><p>Another point we do not mention in the manuscript is that the stability of yeast fusion cohesin by FRAP is also consistent with our model. In our model, dissociation of the interface leads to opening of another interface. The interface is more stable in the fusion because Mcd1p and Smc3p are held in close proximity, so they reassociate very quickly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should comment on whether the 20-aa linker is expected to reconstitute the Smc3-Mcd1 interface, given its length versus the distance between the corresponding residues in structural models of the native interface.</p></disp-quote><p>The spacer between Smc3p and Mcd1p is 132bp encoding 44 amino acids (linker + 3TEV sites). It would be worth discussing if the fusion failed to function, but obviously that is not the case. Gruber et al., 2006, made a fusion with an even longer spacer and that still functions. It might be interesting to shorten the spacer to see what happens, but it is irrelevant to the paper and discussion here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful if the authors commented on whether or not their findings support the alternative &quot;hold and release&quot; model described in Xu et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out that omission. We have added comments about the suppressors that Dr. Yanadiga’s lab that support our view that DNA could escape through the hinge dimer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
