progenitor subtypes and folding of the cerebral cortex are characteristic features which appeared during the evolution of the mammalian brain. Here, we show that the expansion of a specific subtype of neural progenitor is crucial for cortical folding. We found that outer radial glial (oRG) cells can be subdivided by HOPX expression in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex of ferrets. Compared with HOPX-negative oRG cells, HOPX-positive oRG cells had high self-renewal activity and were accumulated in prospective gyral regions. Using our in vivo genetic manipulation technique for ferrets, we found that the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells and their self-renewal activity were regulated by sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. Importantly, suppressing Shh signaling reduced HOPX-positive oRG cells and cortical folding, while enhancing it had opposing effects.

The brains of humans, monkeys and ferrets have a folded cerebral cortex (i.e. gyrencephalic cortex), whereas those of rodents often have a smooth cerebral cortex (lissencephalic cortex). Cortical folding is believed to underlie the acquisition of higher brain functions during development and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Llinares-Benadero and Borrell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>). Consistent with this proposition, malformations of cortical folds are often associated with intellectual disabilities, epilepsy and diseases such as schizophrenia and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ross and Walsh, 2001</xref>). Thus, uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the development and malformation of cortical folds has been an important issue. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of cortical folding is still rudimentary.</p><p>An increase in the diversity of neural progenitor subtypes is associated with the appearance of cortical folding during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MolnÃ¡r et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>). The developing cerebral cortex of the lissencephalic mouse brain contains two germinal layers, the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ), which comprise radial glial cells (RG cells, also known as apical progenitors/ventricular RG cells/apical RG cells) and intermediate progenitor (IP) cells, respectively. The SVZ of humans, monkeys and ferrets is radially expanded and further subdivided into the inner SVZ (ISVZ) and the outer SVZ (OSVZ), which contains abundant outer radial glial cells (oRG cells, also known as OSVZ RG cells/basal RG cells/intermediate RG cells/translocating RG cells). Although it has been proposed that the acquisition of cortical folds during evolution resulted from increased numbers and diversity of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dehay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MolnÃ¡r et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rakic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun and Hevner, 2014</xref>), it has been difficult to test this proposal experimentally in vivo. This is at least partially because of a paucity of rapid and efficient genetic manipulation techniques that could be applied to gyrencephalic brains. To overcome these difficulties, we recently developed genetic manipulation techniques for ferrets using in utero electroporation (IUE) and the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shinmyo et al., 2017</xref>). Using these techniques, we showed that reductions in SVZ progenitors resulted in the impairment of cortical folding in the naturally gyrencephalic ferret in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsumoto et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toda et al., 2016</xref>). Although these data indicate the importance of SVZ progenitors for cortical folding, increased SVZ progenitors in the lissencephalic mouse cerebral cortex was not sufficient for inducing de novo formation of cortical folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nonaka-Kinoshita et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the expansion of specific subtypes of SVZ progenitors which are found only in the gyrencephalic brains seemed to be crucial for the formation of cortical folds. However, the subtypes of SVZ progenitors responsible for cortical folding were still unclear.</p><p>Homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX) was recently identified as a marker of oRG cells in the developing human cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). HOPX was also reported to be expressed in oRG cells of other gyrencephalic animals such as monkeys and ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study showed that not all oRG cells express HOPX in the human cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), raising the possibility that oRG cells consist of multiple subtypes of neural progenitors. Here, we show that oRG cells can be divided into two groups: HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative. HOPX-positive oRG cells were preferentially distributed in prospective gyri and exhibited high self-renewal activity. Using our IUE techniques for ferrets, we found that sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling suppressed the differentiation of HOPX-positive oRG cells and, as a result, increased the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells. Furthermore, reducing the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells by suppressing Shh signaling impaired cortical folding, while an increase in HOPX-positive oRG cells induced by the activation of Shh signaling resulted in additional cortical folds. Our results reveal a novel subtype of neural progenitor important for cortical folding in the gyrencephalic mammalian cerebral cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortex have distinct cellular properties</title><p>To investigate the subtypes of neural progenitors in the OSVZ, we performed triple immunostaining for Pax6, Tbr2 and HOPX using the developing ferret cerebral cortex at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

We next examined the detailed distribution patterns of HOPX-positive oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortex. Interestingly, the abundance of HOPX-positive oRG cells in the OSVZ had regional differences along the anteroposterior (AP) axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine whether the abundance of HOPX-positive oRG cells correlated with the positions of prospective gyri and sulci, five regions in the germinal zones were selected along the AP axis in accordance with the positions of prospective gyri (regions #1, #3 and #5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and sulci (region #2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Juan Romero et al., 2015</xref>). We found that HOPX-positive oRG cells were fewer in region #2 than in regions #1, #3 and #5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, the difference in the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells between regions #3 and #2 was much greater than that of Pax6-positive cells between the same regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>), suggesting that HOPX-positive oRG cells, rather than HOPX-negative oRG cells, preferentially accumulate in prospective gyral regions.</p><p>To confirm this idea, we counted the numbers of HOPX-positive oRG cells (Pax6+/Tbr2-/HOPX+), HOPX-negative oRG cells (Pax6+/Tbr2-/HOPX-), IP cells (Tbr2+), Pax6-positive cells and all progenitors (Pax6+ and/or Tbr2+) in regions #3 and #2 of the OSVZ and calculated the ratio of cell number in region #3 to that in region #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Consistently, cell numbers in another prospective gyral region, region #5, were compared with those in region #2, and the ratio of HOPX-positive oRG cells in region #5 to those in region #2 was higher than that for all OSVZ progenitors (HOPX+, 19.9Â Â±Â 7.6; all, 1.5Â Â±Â 0.2; p=0.01; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test), while the ratio for HOPX-negative oRG cells was lower than that for all OSVZ progenitors (HOPX-, 0.34Â Â±Â 0.02; all, 1.5Â Â±Â 0.2; p=0.0005; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that HOPX-positive oRG cells, rather than HOPX-negative oRG cells and IP cells, preferentially accumulate in prospective gyral regions.</p><p>We also compared the proportions of progenitor cell types in the OSVZ between prospective gyri and sulci. The percentages of HOPX-positive oRG cells (HOPX+/Tbr2-/Pax6+) in region #3 and #5 were markedly higher than that in region #2 (region #3, 34.6Â Â±Â 2.7; region #2, 6.1Â Â±Â 2.9; p=0.0002; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (region #5, 34.5Â Â±Â 1.6; region #2, 3.2Â Â±Â 1.7; p=0.00002; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, green).

Thus, these findings provide further evidence that HOPX-positive oRG cells selectively accumulate in prospective gyral regions of the ferret cerebral cortex.</p><p>Our finding that HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells have distinct distribution patterns implied that they also have distinct cellular properties. We therefore examined cell proliferation in these oRG cell types by quadruple immunostaining for HOPX, Tbr2, Pax6 and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67. The percentages of HOPX-positive and -negative oRG cells co-expressing Ki-67 were comparable (HOPX+, 30.3Â Â±Â 4.1; HOPX-, 32.3Â Â±Â 4.6; p=0.34; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), suggesting that the proliferation rate of HOXP-positive oRG cells is similar to that of HOPX-negative oRG cells. We next investigated the percentage of self-renewed oRG cells by injecting 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) at P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sawada, 2019</xref>). EdU staining was performed using sections prepared 28 hr after the injection because oRG cells undergo cell division within 28 hr after entering S phase in the ferret cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turrero GarcÃ­a et al., 2016</xref>). We found that the percentage of HOPX-positive oRG cells co-labeled with EdU was significantly higher than that of HOPX-negative oRG cells (HOPX+, 22.2Â Â±Â 5.5; HOPX-, 12.4Â Â±Â 1.8; p=0.04; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). Furthermore, to examine whether EdU-positive cells are still in the proliferative state, we performed Ki-67 immunohistochemistry using sections prepared 28 hr after EdU injection. The percentage of HOPX-positive oRG cells co-labeled with Ki-67 and EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, arrowhead) was significantly higher than that of HOPX-negative oRG cells co-labeled with Ki-67 and EdU (HOPX+, 7.8Â Â±Â 0.6; HOPX-, 2.8Â Â±Â 2.0; p=0.01; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These results indicate that HOPX-positive oRG cells tend to remain in their progenitor state even after cell division and do not differentiate into the next stage. It seems likely that HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells indeed have distinct cellular properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Shh signaling is activated preferentially in HOPX-positive oRG cells in the OSVZ</title><p>We next investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating the development of HOPX-positive oRG cells.

We prepared protein extracts from cerebral cortices and performed western blotting with anti-Shh antibody. Interestingly, Shh protein levels were much higher in ferrets than in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). To exclude the possibility that this anti-Shh antibody preferentially recognized ferret Shh compared with mouse Shh, we performed western blotting using cerebella of ferrets and mice. Protein levels of Shh in cerebella were similar in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), indicating that both ferret Shh and mouse Shh are recognized with similar affinity by this anti-Shh antibody. Our quantification showed that Shh protein levels in the cerebral cortex of ferrets were significantly higher than those in mice (mouse, 0.10Â Â±Â 0.01; ferret, 0.32Â Â±Â 0.05; p=0.002; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that Shh ligand is more abundant in the cerebral cortex of ferrets than in that of mice. Consistent with this conclusion, <italic>GLI1</italic> mRNA levels in single HOPX-positive cells in the SVZ were significantly higher in ferrets than in mice (mouse, 0.18Â Â±Â 0.05; ferret, 0.39Â Â±Â 0.06; p=0.04; Student's <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). It seems plausible that highly activated Shh signaling in the gyrencephalic mammals underlies the expansion of HOPX-positive oRG cells and the acquisition of cortical folds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that oRG cells can be classified into two groups: HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative. Shh signaling suppressed the differentiation of HOPX-positive oRG cells, and, as a result, increased the number of HOPX-positive oRG cells. Furthermore, reducing HOPX-positive oRG cells by suppressing Shh signaling impaired cortical folding, while increasing HOPX-positive oRG cells by activating Shh signaling led to additional cortical folds. One plausible scenario is that HOPX-positive oRG cells, which are increased by Shh signaling, preferentially produce upper-layer neurons in prospective gyral regions, resulting in the formation of cortical folds in gyrencephalic brains.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Subtypes of oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortex</title><p>Although the expansion of specific subtypes of SVZ progenitors which are found only in the gyrencephalic brains seemed to be crucial for the formation of cortical folds, the subtypes of SVZ progenitors responsible for cortical folding were unclear. In this study, we revealed that HOPX-positive oRG cells predominantly accumulated in prospective gyral regions compared with HOPX-negative oRG cells. HOPX-positive oRG cells had higher Shh signaling activity and lower differentiation rates than HOPX-negative oRG cells. Furthermore, HOPX-positive oRG cells were selectively increased by the activation of Shh signaling. These several lines of evidence support the idea that HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells have distinct cellular properties and that HOPX-positive oRG cells mediate cortical folding. Consistent with this idea, large numbers of HOPX-positive oRG cells were found in the human OSVZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>), while only a small number of HOPX-positive progenitors were found in the mouse germinal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaid et al., 2018</xref>). The expansion of HOPX-positive oRG cells seems to be a key feature of gyrencephalic brains. Future investigation is necessary to examine the differences in cellular morphologies, gene expression and cell lineages of HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells in gyrencephalic mammals.</p><p>In addition to the increased self-renewal of HOPX-positive oRG cells, it seemed possible that the activation of Shh signaling promoted the differentiation of HOPX-negative oRG cells into HOPX-positive oRG cells, resulting in the increase in HOPX-positive oRG cells. However, our data revealed that HOPX-negative oRG cells that started to express <italic>HOPX</italic> mRNA, presumably leading to their differentiation into HOPX-positive oRG cells, were not affected by the activation and inhibition of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Although these results suggest that differentiation of HOPX-negative oRG cells into HOPX-positive oRG cells would be irrelevant to Shh signaling, it would be important to conduct further experiments to confirm whether HOPX-negative oRG cells differentiate into HOPX-positive oRG cells during development and, if it is the case, whether this differentiation is regulated by Shh signaling or not. It would be important to find a ferret HOPX promoter region which specifically induces transgene expression in HOPX-positive oRG cells for these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanisms underlying the differentiation and proliferation of oRG cells</title><p>Our previous study demonstrated that the proliferation of oRG cells was regulated by FGF signaling in vivo. When a dominant-negative form of FGF receptor 3 was introduced into the ferret cerebral cortex by IUE, the proliferation of oRG cells was suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsumoto et al., 2017b</xref>). In contrast, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of oRG cells remained poorly understood. Our findings clearly indicate that Shh signaling suppresses the differentiation of HOPX-positive oRG cells and promotes their self-renewal in the developing ferret cerebral cortex.</p><p>A next intriguing question would be the molecular mechanisms suppressing the differentiation of HOPX-positive oRG cells downstream of Shh signaling. Previously, it was reported that Shh signaling induces the expression of Cdk6 in the developing vertebrate limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGlinn et al., 2005</xref>) and that Cdk6 inhibits the differentiation of myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujimoto et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, Shh signaling could suppress the differentiation of oRG cells through Cdk6. Other in vitro studies demonstrated that inhibition of Notch, integrin and STAT signaling resulted in a reduced number of oRG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>). These molecules could also be located downstream of Shh signaling in vivo. To uncover the entire picture of the mechanisms underlying oRG development, it would be important to investigate the roles of these signaling pathways in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of Shh signaling in cortical folding</title><p>Previous pioneering studies using transgenic mice reported that constitutive activation of Shh signaling in neural progenitors induced cortical folds in the medial regions of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). These transgenic mice, however, did not show obvious cortical folding in most of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, it was unclear whether Shh signaling was really involved in cortical folding in gyrencephalic mammals. Our gain- and loss-of-function in vivo experiments using ferret IUE clearly indicate that Shh signaling plays a crucial role in cortical folding in the ferret cerebral cortex. Although our results suggest that Shh signaling increases the self-renewal of HOPX-positive oRG cells, resulting in the promotion of cortical folding, it remains possible that Shh signaling has some other effects that promote cortical folding. For example, it was previously reported that Shh activity regulates synaptic connections in the mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harwell et al., 2012</xref>). Another recent study suggested that Shh signaling promotes myelination in the developing mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zakaria et al., 2019</xref>). These effects of Shh activity could be also involved in cortical folding in the ferret cerebral cortex.</p><p>A question that would be intriguing to investigate next is what molecular mechanisms underlie the different responses of HOPX-positive, HOPX-negative oRG cells and IP cells to Shh signaling. One possible mechanism would be that the expression levels of the receptor for Shh, its co-receptors and downstream signaling molecules are different among HOPX-positive, HOPX-negative oRG cells and IP cells. For example, it seems plausible that the expression levels of Patched (Ptch), cell-adhesion-molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes (Cdon), bioregional Cdon-binding protein (Boc) and growth arrest-specific 1 (GAS1) are different among HOPX-positive and -negative oRG cells and IP cells. It would be important to examine the detailed expression patterns of these molecules in the developing ferret cerebral cortex.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that Shh ligand is more abundant in the developing cerebral cortex of ferrets than in that of mice. Furthermore, Shh signaling was more strongly activated in ferrets than in mice. In agreement with this finding, a previous study demonstrated that Shh signaling was more highly activated in the human cerebral cortex than in the mouse cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). It is thus conceivable that Shh signaling is commonly activated in the gyrencephalic cerebral cortex of various animal species. It would be therefore intriguing to investigate the mechanisms underlying the increase in Shh ligand in the developing cerebral cortex of gyrencephalic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yabut and Pleasure, 2018</xref>). High Shh signaling activity seems to be one of the important changes in the evolution of the mammalian brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GFP (rat monoclonal)</td><td>Nacalai tesque, Japan</td><td>Cat# 440426;

Serial coronal sections containing the suprasylvian gyrus (SSG) were prepared. Sections were taken every 500 Âµm from the more posterior part of the ansate sulcus. The selected sections containing the SSG were stained with Hoechst 33342, and images of whole sections were acquired using a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence). The averages of the local GS ratios and the local SD ratios were calculated using three sections for each animal, and those of the local GN ratios were calculated using six sections for each animal.</p><p>To calculate the local GN ratio, we counted how many times the complete contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, green line) was detached from the outer contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, red line) of the cerebral cortex (local GN value). To minimize variation of the local GN values depending on the positions of coronal sections in the brain, the local GN value on the electroporated side was divided by that on the contralateral non-electroporated side of the cerebral cortex in the same brain section (local GN ratio).

mechanisms promoting cortical folding in the ferret. The authors show that expression of the HOPX protein distinguishes outer radial glial cells with a high self-renewal activity that are located in prospective gyral regions of the cortex. They further demonstrate that Sonic hedgehog signaling promotes the expansion of the HOPX-positive progenitor population and stimulates cortical folding.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A discrete subtype of neural progenitor crucial for cortical folding in the gyrencephalic mammalian brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Francois Guillemot as Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Frank Jacobs (Reviewer #2); Kinichi Nakashima (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well performed study reporting that in the ferret cortex, outer radial glial progenitors (oRGs) that express the homeobox transcription factor HOPX contribute to gyrification while HOPX-negative oRGs do not contribute. They further demonstrate that HOPX+ oRGs have a high self-renewing activity and that their numbers are increased by Sonic Hedgehog signaling activity. Finally, they provide evidence that Shh is activated at a higher level in the gyrencephalic ferret cortex than in the lissencephalic murine cortex.</p><p>Overall this study provides strong evidence by loss of function analysis in the ferret cortex of a role of Shh in cortical gyrification, and thus provides important support for a model put forward by an earlier study based on a gain of function study in the mouse. The distinction between HOPX+ and HOPX- oRGs is also interesting, although the relationship between the two cell populations needs to be further address as explained below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 and 2: the ferret cortices were analyzed on P1 and it remains unclear whether HOPX-negative cells are a truly separate subtype of oRG cells, or if they merely represent a transient precursor state for HOPX-positive oRG cells, in which case Shh might drive the generation of HOPX+ oRGs from HOPX- cells. A lineage tracing experiment does not seem feasible within the two months period of revision, but the authors should nevertheless address experimentally the possibility that HOPX+ cells originate form HOPX- cells, e.g. by quantifying the two cell populations and their proliferation after 24hr exposure to Shh-N and inhibitor. They should also discuss in the text the possibility that such a lineage relationship exists.</p><p>2) Figure 1C/G: The authors suggest that there is a reduction of HOPX-positive cells in prospective sulci regions outside of the prospective gyri. This dataset is presented as an important support for the paper's main conclusions about the involvement of HOPX-positive cells in cortical folding. To validate the observation, the authors quantify the ratio of HOPX-positive cells (and other types of progenitors) between region #2 and the most distal region #5. The author's hypothesis would be even more strongly supported if the quantitative analysis included the adjacent prospective gyral regions #1 and #3 as cells in these more proximal regions are less likely to differ in regional identity.</p><p>3) Figure 1J and K: the authors write &quot;HOPX-positive oRG cells tend to remain in their progenitor state even after cell division and do not differentiate into the next stage&quot;. However, to support this interpretation, they need to perform immunohistochemistry using anti-Ki67 antibody together with EdU staining 28h after EdU injection to show that many EdU-positive cells are Ki67-positive and are therefore still in proliferative state. Alternatively, they could perform chase labeling with another dT analogue, such as CdU and IdU, 28h after EdU injection and show that many cells are dual positive for the two dT analogues.</p><p>4) Figure 2JK.

A lineage tracing experiment does not seem feasible within the two months period of revision, but the authors should nevertheless address experimentally the possibility that HOPX+ cells originate form HOPX- cells, e.g. by quantifying the two cell populations and their proliferation after 24hr exposure to Shh-N and inhibitor. They should also discuss in the text the possibility that such a lineage relationship exists.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown that mRNA levels of marker proteins increase earlier than their protein levels during transient states such as differentiation (Liu et al., 2016; Berse et al., 2005; Lahav et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014). Therefore, in accordance with the reviewer's comment, we investigated whether the activation of Shh signaling promotes differentiation of HOPX-negative oRG cells into HOPX-positive oRG cells. We newly made an RNA probe for ferret <italic>HOPX</italic>, and by combining in situ hybridization for <italic>HOPX</italic> mRNA with immunostaining for HOPX, Tbr2 and Pax6, we quantified the percentage of HOPX-negative oRG cells that express <italic>HOPX</italic> mRNA. Presumably, these cells had started to express <italic>HOPX</italic> mRNA and would subsequently differentiate into HOPX-positive oRG cells. We found that the percentages of HOPX-negative oRG cells expressing <italic>HOPX</italic> mRNA were almost comparable among HhipÎC22-transfected, Shh-N-transfected and control cortices. Thus, it seems unlikely that Shh signaling promotes the differentiation of HOPX-negative oRG cells into HOPX-positive oRG cells. These results were added as new Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, and were written in the Results section (subsection âShh signaling is essential for producing HOPX-positive oRG cellsâ, last paragraph). In addition, as suggested, we also added a discussion of the potential lineage relationship between HOPX-positive and HOPX-negative progenitors in the Discussion section (subsection âSubtypes of oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortexâ, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1C/G: The authors suggest that there is a reduction of HOPX-positive cells in prospective sulci regions outside of the prospective gyri. This dataset is presented as an important support for the paper's main conclusions about the involvement of HOPX-positive cells in cortical folding. To validate the observation, the authors quantify the ratio of HOPX-positive cells (and other types of progenitors) between region #2 and the most distal region #5. The author's hypothesis would be even more strongly supported if the quantitative analysis included the adjacent prospective gyral regions #1 and #3 as cells in these more proximal regions are less likely to differ in regional identity.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer's comment, we quantified the ratios of the numbers of progenitor cells and the proportions of progenitor cells in adjacent prospective gyral and sulcal regions #2 and #3. Consistent with our original results using region #2 and #5, we found that HOPX-positive oRG cells, rather than HOPX-negative oRG cells and IP cells, preferentially accumulated in the prospective gyral regions. We replaced our original quantification using regions #2 and #5 (original Figure 1F and G) with new quantification using regions #2 and #3 (new Figure 1F and G). Our original quantification was moved to Figure 1âfigure supplement 1. These results were written in the text (subsection âHOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral 112 cortex have distinct cellular propertiesâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1J and K: the authors write &quot;HOPX-positive oRG cells tend to remain in their progenitor state even after cell division and do not differentiate into the next stage&quot;. However, to support this interpretation, they need to perform immunohistochemistry using anti-Ki67 antibody together with EdU staining 28h after EdU injection to show that many EdU-positive cells are Ki67-positive and are therefore still in proliferative state. Alternatively, they could perform chase labeling with another dT analogue, such as CdU and IdU, 28h after EdU injection and show that many cells are dual positive for the two dT analogues.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer's comment, we performed immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and EdU staining 28 hrs after EdU injection. We then quantified the percentage of HOPX-positive oRG cells which were also positive for Ki-67 and EdU, and the percentage of HOPX-negative oRG cells which were also positive for Ki-67 and EdU. Consistent with our idea, we found that the percentage of HOPX-positive oRG cells co-labeled with EdU and Ki-67 was significantly higher than that of HOPX-negative oRG cells co-labeled with EdU and Ki-67, indicating that HOPX-positive oRG cells tend to remain in their proliferative state even after cell division. This result was added as new Figure 1L and M, and was written in the Results section (subsection âHOPX-positive and HOPX-negative oRG cells in the developing ferret cerebral cortex have distinct cellular propertiesâ, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2J, K.

These results are consistent with idea that Shh signaling selectively regulates the self-renewal of HOXP-positive oRG cells in the ferret cerebral cortex.

These results support our idea that HOPX-positive oRG cells are preferentially regulated by Shh signaling. These results were added as new Figures 3D, E and G, and were written in the Results section (subsection âActivation of Shh signaling is sufficient for increasing HOPX-positive oRG cellsâ, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the laminar specificity of the effect of ectopic Shh activation discussed in the subsection âUpper layers of the cerebral cortex are preferentially increased by Shh signalingâ: The authors should clarify whether the timepoint of Shh-N transfection (E33) is not too late to affect cortical layer VI and V neurons.

However, our results showed that the thicknesses of layers 4 and 5 were less affected by electroporation of Shh-N and HhipÎC22 at E33 compared with those of layer 2/3. It therefore seemed unlikely that the preferential changes in layer 2/3 resulted from the distribution of transfected cells. We added new Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, which shows the distribution of GFP-positive cells in the ferret cerebral cortex electroporated at E33 and wrote this information in the text (subsection âShh signaling enhances the self-renewal of HOPX-positive oRG cells and suppresses their differentiationâ, second paragraph; subsection âUpper layers of the cerebral cortex are preferentially increased by Shh signalingâ, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors write &quot;As expected, GLI1 was strongly expressed in the germinal zone of the ferret cerebral cortex (Figure 6A), whereas it was barely expressed in the germinal zone of the mouse cerebral cortex (Figure 6B).&quot; However, since the probes against ferret and mouse Gli mRNA are different, it is not possible to directly compare expression levels of Gli mRNA in the brain section from different species.

Taken together with our results using in situ hybridization, our results indicate that Shh signaling is more active in the cerebral cortex of ferrets than in that of mice.
