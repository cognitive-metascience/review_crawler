associates with PRC2 and mediates its recruitment to chromatin in embryonic stem cells. PHF19 is also overexpressed in many cancers. However, neither PHF19 targets nor misregulated pathways involving PHF19 are known. Here, we investigate the role of PHF19 in prostate cancer cells. We find that PHF19 interacts with PRC2 and binds to PRC2 targets on chromatin. PHF19 target genes are involved in proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Depletion of PHF19 triggers an increase in MTF2/PCL2 chromatin recruitment, with a genome-wide gain in PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 deposition. Transcriptome analysis shows that PHF19 loss promotes deregulation of key genes involved in growth, metastasis, invasion, and of factors that stimulate blood vessels formation. Consistent with this, <italic>PHF19</italic> silencing reduces cell proliferation, while promotes invasive growth and angiogenesis. Our findings reveal a role for PHF19 in controlling the balance between cell proliferation and invasiveness in prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional regulators involved in embryonic development, cell differentiation, and maintenance of cell identity. Deregulation of PcG has been linked to anomalous activation of differentiation pathways, carcinogenesis and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pasini and Di Croce, 2016</xref>). PcG proteins form two major Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC): PRC1, responsible for the deposition of H2AK119ub1, and PRC2, which catalyzes H3K27 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Croce and Helin, 2013</xref>). The PRC2 core, formed by EZH1/2, SUZ12, EED, and RBBP4/7, can interact with additional accessory proteins that modulate its function; these include Polycomb-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vizán et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Polycomb-like</italic> (<italic>Pcl</italic>) gene was originally discovered in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and presented the same mutant phenotypes as the Polycomb genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan, 1982</xref>). Three mammalian paralogs of <italic>Drosophila Pcl</italic>, termed <italic>PHF1/PCL1</italic>, <italic>MTF2/PCL2</italic>, and <italic>PHF19/PCL3</italic>, have been characterized to date, mainly in the context of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sarma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casanova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballaré et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brien et al., 2012</xref>). PHF19 plays a pivotal role in gene silencing through its ability to recognize the epigenetic mark H3K36me3 on active genes <italic>via</italic> its Tudor domain, and mediate PRC2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballaré et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brien et al., 2012</xref>). Similar properties were later reported for the other members of the PCL family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The above-mentioned studies extensively describe these mechanisms for ESCs, in which silencing of lineage-specific genes is essential to maintain pluripotency.</p><p>In humans, <italic>PHF19</italic> encodes a long (PHF19L) and a short (PHF19S) isoform, that are generated by alternative splicing and are both overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boulay et al., 2011</xref>). PHF19 interacts with the tumor suppressor HIC1 and thus mediates PRC2 recruitment to a subset of HIC1 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boulay et al., 2012</xref>). Further, through the induction of PHF19, p-Akt has been reported to promote melanoma progression, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghislin et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, PHF19 can promote proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, glioma, and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2018</xref>) and can induce glioblastoma progression, mediated by β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite these efforts to understand the role of PHF19 in different cancer models, a comprehensive analysis that identifies the genetic targets and pathways controlled by PHF19 has so far not been reported.</p><p>Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), the enzymatic component of PRC2 that methylates of lysine 27 at histone H3, is often overexpressed in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracken, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varambally et al., 2002</xref>). EZH2 overexpression is associated with the acquisition of new PRC2 targets, including tumor suppressors, and with poor outcome in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shin and Kim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, cooperation of EZH2 with the androgen receptor and with DNA methyltransferases can reinforce PRC2 mediated-silencing at target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moison et al., 2014</xref>). Further, an oncogenic function of EZH2 in prostate cancer, independent of its role as a transcriptional repressor, was also reported. This involves the ability of EZH2 to switch from a Polycomb repressor to a co-activator for critical transcription factors including the androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Whether or how PHF19 modulates the function and targets of the EZH2 in prostate cancer remains to be explored.</p><p>In this study, we report a novel role for PHF19 in controlling the balance between growth and invasiveness in prostate cancer. We show that PHF19 interacts with PRC2, and that both co-localize at chromatin. Depletion of PHF19 causes upregulated MTF2/PCL2 expression and increased MTF2 recruitment to chromatin, along with a genome-wide gain in PRC2 occupancy and increased H3K27me3 deposition. This in turn leads to transcriptional deregulation of key genes involved in the control of proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion. Finally, with the loss of PHF19, prostate cancer cells switch to a less proliferative but more aggressive phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PHF19L interacts with the PRC2 complex in prostate cancer cells</title><p>Two isoforms of PHF19 are generated in humans: PHF19L has a Tudor domain, two PHD fingers, an extended homology (EH) domain, and a chromo-like domain, while PHF19S, contains only the N-terminal Tudor and PHD1 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the role of PHF19 in prostate cancer, we first evaluated its expression in two common human prostate cancer cell models, the poorly-differentiated metastatic PC3 and DU145 cell lines, as well as in a normal counterpart, the prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1. PHF19L/S were both expressed in PC3 and DU145 cells, and at higher levels as compared to those in RWPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PHF19L associates with PRC2 in prostate cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of PHF19L and PHF19S and their domains. (<bold>B</bold>) Western blot analysis showing expression of PHF19L, PHF19S, EZH2, and GAPDH in RWPE1, PC3, and DU145 cells. *, non-specific bands (<bold>C</bold>) Summary of the main interactors of PHF19L and PHF19S identified by mass spectrometry (MS).

To this end, PC3 cells stably expressing a FLAG-tagged version of PHF19L or PHF19S, or a FLAG-tagged empty vector (as a control) were generated, and subjected to FLAG affinity purification followed by MS. As previously reported for ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballaré et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brien et al., 2012</xref>), PHF19L mainly interacted with the core subunits of the PRC2 complex. On the other hand, PHF19S did not interact with any PRC2 component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that PHF19L and PHF19S have different functions in prostate cancer. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that only FLAG-PHF19L interacted with EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then validated the interaction of PHF19L with the PRC2 complex at endogenous level. Indeed, PHF19L co-immunoprecipitated with EZH2 and SUZ12 in PC3 and DU145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Depletion of PHF19L with specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) disrupted these interactions but did not affect the stability of the PRC2 complex, as the association between the core subunits EZH2 and SUZ12 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In addition, by using specific knockdowns for each PHF19 isoform, we confirmed that the depletion of one of the isoforms had no impact on the expression of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PHF19L co-localizes with PRC2 on chromatin</title><p>We next investigated the cellular localization of PHF19 in DU145 and PC3 cells.

Moreover, ectopically overexpressed PHF19S in DU145 cells was also only present in the cytoplasm, indicating that the lack of signal of PHF19S on chromatin was not due to technical limitations in detecting low levels of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PHF19L co-localizes with PRC2 complex on chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell fractionation followed by Western blot analysis in DU145 (left) and PC3 (right) cells, showing that PHF19L is mainly present in the chromatin and PHF19S, in the cytoplasm. Total, total cell extract; Cyt, cytoplasm; Nuc, nucleus; NP, nucleoplasm; Chr, chromatin.

Indeed, we observed substantial enrichment in H3K4me1, a histone mark associated to enhancers, in these intergenic peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

DU145 cells lacking PHF19L showed a significantly increased capacity to invade the matrigel as compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Our results showed that the number of tubes and nodes significantly increased when HUVECs were incubated in the presence of conditioned medium from knockdown cells, indicating that PHF19L depletion promoted angiogenesis. Taken together, our results indicated that while PHF19L is required to maintain high proliferation rates in prostate cancer cells, its depletion switches cells to a less proliferative but more aggressive phenotype, thereby promoting cell invasion and angiogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men, and the high mortality rate is mainly due to the development of metastasis. The main therapeutic strategy is based on androgen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jain and Di Croce, 2016</xref>). However, the disease usually progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, a hormone insensitive form with very low survival rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mansinho et al., 2018</xref>). A better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the progression to a metastatic disease is a major challenge in the field and could be critical to developing effective therapies. Here, we provide evidence that PHF19L plays an important role controlling prostate cancer progression, and that its depletion results in transcriptional deregulation of multiple genes that are critical for proliferation and metastasis.</p><p>Our data show that only the long isoform of PHF19 interacts with PRC2 in prostate cancer cells. PHF19S contains the Tudor domain that is implicated in binding to H3K36me3, but it lacks the predicted nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) and the C-terminal region reported to bind to the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballaré et al., 2012</xref>). This can explain both the absence of PHF19S at chromatin and its inability to interact with PRC2. We further report for the first time the genome-wide PHF19 target genes in prostate cancer and show its co-localization with PRC2 and H3K27me3. Additionally, we report that loss of PHF19L triggers a global increase in PRC2 occupancy accompanied by a gain in H3K27me3 deposition, suggesting a different function with respect to what has been reported in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballaré et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brien et al., 2012</xref> ). Although the mechanisms of PRC2 recruitment to specific loci are still a matter of intense study, multiple subunits have been identified that associate to PRC2 and regulate its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Mierlo et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we observed an increase in the MTF2 expression and its binding to chromatin after loss of PHF19L. Both MTF2 and PHF19 can mediate PRC2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perino et al., 2018</xref>), but they bind to PRC2 in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hauri et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that they compete for PRC2 binding. Loss of PHF19L could activate putative compensatory mechanisms that lead to increasing MTF2 levels. MTF2 likely replaces PHF19L in the PRC2 complex, triggering more efficient PRC2 recruitment and/or increasing its residence time. Thus, PHF19L could have a modulatory role, keeping the levels of PRC2 at bay. Changes in the expression of the PCLs in response to different stimuli or during cancer progression could alter the balance between the PRC2 subcomplexes and thus affect PRC2 binding and activity, providing flexibility to the PRC2 function. Moreover, other PRC2-associated factors with unchanged expression levels after PHF19L loss could also undergo specific changes in chromatin occupancy and therefore affect PRC2 binding. Further studies need to be performed to investigate the interplay of the PRC2 associated subunits in the regulation of PRC2 function in prostate cancer.</p><p>PHF19 has been previously reported to be required for cell proliferation in different cellular types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghislin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2018</xref>).

Here, we report that depletion of PHF19L causes upregulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/p21 and downregulation of several genes essential for the control of cell cycle, such as <italic>CCNA2</italic>, <italic>CCNB2</italic>, <italic>CDK4</italic>, <italic>E2F1</italic>, and <italic>AATF</italic>. Consistent with changes in gene expression, we observed strong decreases in cell growth and proliferation after PHF19L depletion in both prostate cancer cell lines.</p><p>Our data show that PHF19L inhibits invasion and angiogenesis in prostate cancer cells. Similar observations have been reported in melanoma cells, in which loss of PHF19L causes them to become more invasive and less proliferative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghislin et al., 2012</xref>). However, contradictory findings have also been reported, showing a positive role of PHF19 promoting migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and glioblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2018</xref>). We found that PHF19L depletion induces upregulation of the HIF-1α, a master regulator of the cellular response to low oxygen, as well as of multiple genes associated with hypoxia. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for tumor progression, as it activates survival mechanisms promoting angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan and Graham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deep and Panigrahi, 2015</xref>). Indeed, by knocking down PHF19L, we observed significant induction of multiple genes known to promote changes in cytoskeleton and adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer (including <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>SOX4</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>PLAU</italic>, <italic>EPCAM</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic>, <italic>LOX</italic>, and <italic>MET</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darash-Yahana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Francis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pulukuri and Rao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banyard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pennacchietti et al., 2003</xref>). We also saw upregulation of several genes that stimulate formation of new vessels and regulate the processes of intravasation and extravasation, such as <italic>VEFGA</italic>, <italic>VEGFC</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic>, and <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan and Graham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vergis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In line with these findings, prostate cancer cells lacking PHF19L displayed significantly increased invasiveness, and conditioned medium from PHF19L knockdown cells promoted angiogenesis in in vitro endothelial tube formation assays.</p><p>Interestingly, PHF19L depletion triggered both up- and downregulation of direct PHF19L target genes. The repressed gene set included mainly genes involved in signaling and tumor progression, such as <italic>IGFBP3</italic>, a metastasis/angiogenesis suppressor in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mehta et al., 2011</xref>). After PHF19L depletion, <italic>IGFBP3</italic> gained MTF2, PRC2 and H3K27me3 in its promoter and was substantially downregulated. On the other hand, the upregulated PHF19L direct targets comprised many hypoxia-responsive genes that can promote invasion and metastasis (e.g. <italic>LOX</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic>, <italic>EGLN3</italic>, and <italic>ADM</italic>), as well as genes that induce EMT (e.g. <italic>BMP4</italic>, <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>WNT7A</italic>, and <italic>SOX9</italic>). It is puzzling why these genes are upregulated, as they also gain PRC2 at their promoters. One possibility would be that EZH2 binds and/or methylates a non-histone protein to promote transcriptional activation. EZH2 was originally identified as the catalytic subunit of PRC2, responsible for tri-methylation of H3K27. However, emerging research have shown non-canonical roles of EZH2, such as methylation of different targets, in both PRC2-dependent and -independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, EZH2 can methylate GATA4, inhibiting its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2012</xref>), STAT3, leading to its transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), and JARID2, triggering activation of PRC2’s enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanulli et al., 2015</xref>). It can also control adhesion and migration of neutrophils and dendritic cells through methylation of a key regulatory protein, Talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunawan et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, EZH2 can interact with transcription factors and act as a co-activator, as has been reported for androgen receptor, β-catenin, ERα, and NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Further mechanistic studies need to be performed to investigate if putative EZH2 substrates can account for the response of this subset of PHF19L targets, which becomes upregulated despite gaining PRC2. Nevertheless, our findings show that upon loss of PHF19L, most of the deregulated genes are not direct targets of PHF19L, meaning that these changes are very likely due to secondary or indirect effects, possibly through the activation of signaling pathways. Notably, we also found binding of PHF19L and PRC2 in intergenic regions (23% PHF19L ChIP-peaks), coincident with the enhancer mark H3K4me1. The presence of PRC2 and H3K27me3 in poised enhancers has been reported, with PRC2 playing a role maintaining contacts between enhancers and target genes, and acting as a facilitator of poised enhancers activity during stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruz-Molina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mas and Di Croce, 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that PHF19L can also bind to enhancer elements together with PRC2 in prostate cancer cells and thus plays a role in distal gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

They were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 1 × L glutamine (Gibco) and 1 × penicilin/streptomycin (Gibco). RWPE1, a normal prostate epithelial cell line, was cultured in keratinocyte serum free medium (K-SFM) supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (BPE) and 5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF). Cells used in this study were authenticated cell lines obtained from ATCC.

For the invasion assays the upper membranes were coated with 100 µl Matrigel (Corning #356230). A total of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> DU145 cells (shCTR or shPHF19) in 400 µl of serum-free medium were seeded on the upper chamber. The lower chambers were filled with 1.4 ml of growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After a 24 hr incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, non-migrated cells were gently removed from the upper side of the membrane using a cotton swab. The inserts were transfer to 70% ethanol for 10 min to allow cell fixation and air-dried for 15 min. The cells were stained with crystal violet 0.2% for 10 min and then with DAPI (1 µg/ml) for nuclei visualization. The migration assay was performed similarly to the invasion assay but without coating the upper membranes with Matrigel. Images of the stained cells were then captured under bright-field microscopy and cells from at least five randomly selected fields were counted for each experiment. Percentage of invasion was calculated as the ratio of cells that passed through the Matrigel-coated membrane divided by cells that migrated through the uncoated membrane ×100.For PC3 cells, FluoroBlok 24-Mutliwell Insert Plates (8 µm pore size, PET membrane, Corning) coated or not with Matrigel, were used.

Briefly, DU145 cells, shCTR and shPHF19L, were seeded and grown to 40% confluence. The growth medium was replaced with serum free DMEM and cells incubated for 24 hr. The conditioned medium (CM) was then harvested. Umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), grown at 70–80% confluency, were serum starved in Medium 200PRF for 3 hr prior to performing the tube formation assay. After serum starvation, cells were collected and resuspended in serum free DMEM at 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. 500 μl of this HUVEC cell suspension were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in 500 μl of CM obtained from shCTR or shPHF19L DU145 cells, and supplemented with FBS to a final concentration of 1%. Cell suspension was plated in a 96-well plate (100 µl/well) pre-coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 hr.

The following day, the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates were prepared by pooling together the plasmids in 0.25 M CaCl2. While vortexing, calcium phosphate-DNA solution was added dropwise to an equal volume of HBS 2× (HEPES-buffered saline solution, pH 7.05: 0.28 NaCl, 0.05 M HEPES, and 1.5 mM Na2HPO4) at RT. After 30 min at RT, the solution was added to the HEK-293T cells for lentivirus production or Phoenix-AMPHO cells for retrovirus production. Cells were incubated 16 hr with the transfection mix, after that the medium was replaced.

The pMSCVpuro-FLAG-PHF19S plasmid was digested with EcoRI to release PHF19S and generate pMSCVpuro-FLAG-empty vector. Retrovirus were produced by transfecting Phoenix cells with 10 μg of pMSCV-puro (or neo)-FLAG (empty/PHF19L/PHF19S) and 5 µg pCMV-VSV-G using the calcium phosphate method. For the infection, 2 ml of the medium containing the viral particles were added to each well in 6-well plate containing target cells, plus Polybrene 5 g/µl. The plates were spun at 1000 × g, 32°C for 90 min. The infected cells were then incubated for 3 hr at 37°C and the medium was replaced. Following a second round of infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. shRNAs specifically targeting PHF19S were designed using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/GH_shRNA.html">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/GH_shRNA.html</ext-link> and cloned into XhoI and EcoRI site of pLMP/MLP-Puro-GFP retroviral vector. Retrovirus were produced by transfecting Phoenix cells with 10 µg pMLP plasmid (MLP or shPHF19S) and 6.6 µg pCMV-VSV-G using the calcium phosphate method.

Cell were then washed twice with ice cold PBS, harvested by gently scrapping on ice, centrifuged at 3,000 × g, 5 min, and cell pellets were frozen at −80°C until use. Chromatin preparation and ChIP experiments were performed with the ChIP-IT High Sensitivity Kit from Active Motif (#53040) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

A second replicate of each sample was sequenced to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. MACS was run individually on each replicate with the default parameters but with the shift-size adjusted to 100 bp to perform the peak calling against the corresponding control sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). DiffBind was initially run over the peaks reported by MACS for each pair of replicates of the same experiment to generate a consensus set of peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>). Next, DiffBind was run again over each pair of replicates of the same experiment - samples and inputs - to find the peaks from the consensus set that were significantly enriched in both replicates in comparison to the corresponding controls (categories = DBA_CONDITION, block = DBA_REPLICATE and method = DBA_DESEQ2_BLOCK). In all cases, DiffBind peaks with P value &lt; 0.05 and FDR &lt; 0.2 were selected for further analysis. The genome distribution of each set of peaks was calculated by counting the number of peaks fitted on each class of region according to RefSeq annotations. Promoter is the region between 2.5 Kbp upstream and 2.5 Kbp downstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Genic regions correspond to the rest of the gene (the part that is not classified as promoter) and the rest of the genome is considered to be intergenic. Peaks that overlapped with more than one genomic feature were proportionally counted the same number of times. Each set of target genes was retrieved by matching the ChIP-seq peaks in the region 2.5 Kbp upstream of the TSS until the end of the transcripts as annotated in RefSeq. The significance of the overlap between two gene sets was computed using the GeneOverlap R package (Fisher’s exact test). Reports of functional enrichments of GO and other genomic libraries were generated using the EnrichR tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>).

To generate the aggregated plots showing the distribution of ChIP‐seq reads along the body of a metagene derived from a target gene set, each gene was converted into a uniform region of 100 positions to count the number of reads along this region, calculating the mean at each point of the resulting metagene profile afterwards. This graphical representation was integrated into the neighboring genomic region, calculated as described above. The aggregated plot showing the average distribution of PHF19L and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq reads for the collection of intergenic PHF19L peaks was generated by counting the number of reads around the summit of each peak and normalizing for the total number of peaks in this set. Boxplots showing the ChIP level distribution for each replicate of a particular ChIP-seq experiment against the control (IgG) on a set of genomic peaks were calculated by determining the maximum value on this region at this sample, which was normalized by the total number of reads. To generate the points in the scatterplots that represent the co-occupancy between PHF19L and EZH2/SUZ12/H3K27me3 at each replicate, the ChIP-seq intensities of each pair of samples shown here were calculated by determining the maximum value of each experiment inside the peaks of the final set of PHF19L peaks.</p><p>Aggregated plots of ChIP-seq shCTR and shPHF19L#4 samples containing spike-in were generated by counting the number of reads mapped in human for each gene and then normalizing these values for the total number of reads mapped on the fruit fly spike-in genome and the number of targets of the gene list, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orlando et al.

Boxplots showing the ChIP level distribution for each replicate of a particular ChIP-seq experiment in shCTR and shPHF19L#4 conditions on a set of genes were calculated by determining the maximum value on the region +/-5 Kbp around the TSS of every gene in both samples. The resulting values of the samples including spike-in were corrected by the number of fly reads mapped of the sequencing experiment. Each point on the scatterplots of ChIP-seq intensities between shCTR and shPHF19L#4 conditions of EZH2/SUZ12/H3K27me3 were calculated by determining the maximum value of the sample inside each peak at each condition. These values were normalized by the corresponding number of fly spike-in reads in the same experiment. DiffBind was run for each pair of shCTR and shPHF19L#4 ChIP-seq replicates of EZH2/SUZ12/H3K27me3/MTF2 to identify the set of peaks that were significantly enriched in one of the conditions against the other (P value &lt; 0.05). The heatmaps displaying the density of ChIPseq reads around the summit of each ChIP-seq peak were generated by counting the number of reads in this region for each individual peak and normalizing this value with the total number of mapped reads of the sample or the spike-in control, if available.

deposition and maintenance of the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark – exists in different configurations, which can be altered in cancer. The authors report here that one PRCS2 co-factor, PHF9, is overexpressed in cellular models of prostate cancer. Surprisingly, upon knockdown of PHF19, PRC2 binding and deposition of H3K27me3 are enhanced, through the compensatory action of MTF2.

Your article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Celine Vallot (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The PRC2 complex – responsible for the deposition and maintenance of the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark – exists in different configurations, which can be altered in cancer. The authors report here that one co-factor of PRC2, PHF9, is overexpressed in cellular models of prostate cancer but only the long isoform of PHF19 (PHF19L) associates with PRC2. Surprisingly, knockdown of PHF19 enhances PRC2 binding and deposition of H3K27me3, which the authors link to compensation by MTF2. This phenomenon seems important for proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. Studying the role of PHF19 in cancer cells is of importance to understand processes of gene misregulation in tumorigenesis. PHF19 had been previously studied in a variety of cancer models but this is the first report in prostate cancer. Most importantly, this study reveals that the balance between PHF19 and MTF2 modulates PRC2 binding and activity on chromatin and gene expression, and this could influence tumorigenesis. However, some conclusions are not sufficiently supported by experiments and statistical tests are too often lacking. Please address the following concerns in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Two important and unanimous critics relate to the overall lack of information about replicates and insufficient statistical assessments.</p><p>Information on replication should be more comprehensive and systematically provided in Figure legends. For example (and not the least important), it is not known as to whether ChIP-seq experiments were performed in replicates or not. The use of spike-in is appreciated, but if there is no biological replicate, this should be acknowledged by the authors as a clear disclaimer in the text. This is particularly important as the conclusion from the ChIP-seq is at the center of the main conclusion of the study and also, because the increase in H3K27me3 (Figure 3A, right) is minor and would only be convincing if observed across replicates. On this point, the authors state that the increase is small albeit &quot;significant&quot;, but no statistical test is presented.</p><p>Indeed, there is generally poor statistical back-up of the results. Some p-values are provided for Figure 4B and Figure 6C, but most of the other comparisons lack statistical testing. For example, in Figure 4D, no statistical testing is done to evaluate the significance of the overlaps. Please provide appropriate statistical tests. Moreover, it is suggested that all p-values should be corrected for multiple testing – Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for example.</p><p>2) About the conclusion that PRC2 binding is increased genome-wide upon shPHF19L: from Figure 3C, it is clear that there is an increase at existing PRC2 peaks. But is there as well an increase in the number of PRC2 peaks? This needs to be analyzed by comparing peak calling in shPHF19L vs shCTRL, as well as a proper differential analysis of ChIP-seq signal in common peaks (using Limma or edgeR for example). This comment is actually valid for all ChIP-seq analyses of the paper.</p><p>3) While a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of PHF19L would be preferable to shRNA approach, at minimum, the authors should include a second shRNA construct. This would ensure that the interesting observations from this manuscript (enhanced PRC2 recruitment and or gene expression changes) are not an artefact of one shRNA knockdown. Targeted approaches (ChIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR) on few loci would be appropriate.</p><p>4) For Figure 2E, plots representing the detail of the data are needed, not average plots only. One could use scatterplots comparing PHF19 enrichment signal (log2 IP/INPUT) versus EZH2 (SUZ12, H3K27me3) enrichment. Such plots would give the reader insight on the co-occupancy of the factors. These plots should be complemented with a correlation score to assess the significance of this co-occupancy for example.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) Are any of these gene expression changes presented in Figure 5 directly related to loss of PHF19 or gain of MTF2/PRC2 binding? It is very important the authors include this data to show whether or not these expression changes are as a direct result of PHF19 knockdown. Rescue experiments would be recommended.</p><p>2) It would be interesting to mine the TCGA database. On top of the present analysis of PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, it may be useful to document that PHF19L/S is also overexpressed in tumor versus normal cells in prostate cancers. Cell lines can sometimes diverge from what happens in tumors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51373.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Two important and unanimous critics relate to the overall lack of information about replicates and insufficient statistical assessments.</p><p>Information on replication should be more comprehensive and systematically provided in Figure legends.

To address this issue, we have performed a new set of ChIP-seq biological replicates for PHF19, H3K27me3, EZH2, SUZ12, and MTF2 in both conditions (shPHF19L and shCTR). Our initial conclusions were fully reproduced by these new ChIP-seq experiments, strengthening our conclusions. Moreover, using replicates allowed us to perform differential peak analysis supported by statistical tests (see next point). Notably, we confirmed a significant increase of H3K27me3 levels and of EZH2, SUZ12 and MTF2 recruitment, following knockdown of PHF19.</p><p>We have included this information on the replicates in the main text as well as in the corresponding figure legends. In several cases, the results using the first replicates are now shown in main figures (corresponding to Figure 2 and Figure 3 in the revised version of our manuscript), and that of the replicates, in the corresponding supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The differential peak analyses using all replicates were also mentioned in the text.</p><p>With respect to changes in H3K27me3, we have now clearly stated (both in the main text and in the figure legends) that H3K27me3 levels increased significantly (with a P-value of ≤ 10<sup>-16</sup>) in both replicates (Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Raw data and processed data for the new set of ChIP-seq experiments have been deposited in our GEO entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, there is generally poor statistical back-up of the results.

We have also specified the test used for each case. In particular, to assess the statistical significance of all overlap between the sets shown in Venn diagrams (such as Figure 4D, mentioned by the reviewers), we tested three different methods: (i) Fisher’s exact test, (ii) a test based on the hypergeometric distribution, and (iii) GeneOverlap R package. As we observed similar results in all cases, we decided to include the P-values calculated using GeneOverlap R package (based in the Fisher's exact test) for all the Venn diagram overlaps included in our work.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of a second ChIP-seq replicate (see response above) allowed us to perform differential peak analysis with the DiffBind R package. Using this algorithm, we have now identified a robust collection of peaks that significantly gain (or lose) ChIP-seq signals between the experimental and control conditions (see below, point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) About the conclusion that PRC2 binding is increased genome-wide upon shPHF19L: from Figure 3C, it is clear that there is an increase at existing PRC2 peaks.

We have included this information in the new Figure 3B (H3K27me3) and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (EZH2 and SUZ12). Moreover, we show that there is a significant increase in ChIP signal in both common and de novo targets (see boxplots below the Venn diagrams, Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We have also included a new Supplementary file 1 with the total number of ChIP peaks and target genes (in control and knockdown conditions), and the corresponding lists of the target genes for each ChIP experiment included in our manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this interesting suggestion about performing differential analysis. As mentioned above, the second set of ChIP-seq experiments allowed us to run the DiffBind R package, and to identify the peaks in which the change of signal was significant between shPHF19L and shCTR conditions. In all cases (PRC2 subunits and H3K27me3), DiffBind reported that the detected differential peaks were associated to a gain of signal in PHF19 knockdown (new Figure 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), with a significant P value and FDR calculated by DiffBind (based on DESeq2 R package, similarly to edgeR).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of PHF19L would be preferable to shRNA approach, at minimum, the authors should include a second shRNA construct.

We performed ChIP-qPCRs and RT-qPCRs on representative genes to validate the main observations of the manuscript. Our initial conclusions were fully reproduced when using this second shRNA. Moreover, we confirmed the specificity of the detected PHF19 ChIP peaks (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and the increased signals of H3K27me3, EZH2 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1), and MTF2 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1) in PHF19-depleted cells. Finally, we have also validated the changes in gene expression following PHF19 knockdown (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For Figure 2E, plots representing the detail of the data are needed, not average plots only.

Importantly, we obtained similar results in our new set of ChIP-seq replicates (shown in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Finally, we complemented our previous “average plots” by showing the distribution of values in a boxplot next to each metaplot (see new Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>1) Are any of these gene expression changes presented in Figure 5 directly related to loss of PHF19 or gain of MTF2/PRC2 binding?

Rescue experiments would be recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>To examine the direct implication of PHF19 in the effects we report here, we performed rescue experiments as requested by the reviewers. For this, we ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged PHF19 in PHF19-depleted or control cells. To knock down PHF19, we used an shRNA targeting the 3’ UTR of the gene (shPHF19L#B), such that only the endogenous <italic>PHF19</italic> was affected. ChIP-qPCR experiments on a set of representative genes demonstrated that MTF2 recruitment displayed the opposite behavior to PHF19: it increased in the absence of PHF19 but decreased to basal levels after PHF19 rescue. Moreover, changes in gene expression observed in the knockdown cells were reversed after overexpression of exogenous PHF19L. Our results clearly indicated that the effects reported herein directly depend on the presence of PHF19L. These results are presented in the new Figures 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be interesting to mine the TCGA database. On top of the present analysis of PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines, it may be useful to document that PHF19L/S is also overexpressed in tumor versus normal cells in prostate cancers. Cell lines can sometimes diverge from what happens in tumors.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have explored several databases (e.g., TCGA and ICGC) to investigate the expression of PHF19 in human prostate tumors. However, the results that were extracted from mining were inconclusive. High variability of PHF19 expression levels was detected between samples, which precludes us from determining any solid difference between normal and cancer prostate tissue. This is likely related to the fact that PHF19 itself, or variations of PRC2 complexes, are involved in many different biological processes, often related to cancer progression (see also PMID:30341152). Indeed, as reported in our manuscript, PHF19L positively regulates cell proliferation, but its downregulation is linked to invasion and angiogenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
