Here we show that Ctf4 tightly dimerizes CMG helicase, with an extensive interface involving Psf2, Cdc45, and Sld5. Interestingly, Ctf4 binds only one Pol α-primase. Thus, Ctf4 may have evolved as a trimer to organize two helicases and one Pol α-primase into a replication factory. In the 2CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–1Pol α-primase factory model, the two CMGs nearly face each other, placing the two lagging strands toward the center and two leading strands out the sides. The single Pol α-primase is centrally located and may prime both sister replisomes. The Ctf4-coupled-sister replisome model is consistent with cellular microscopy studies revealing two sister forks of an origin remain attached and are pushed forward from a protein platform. The replication factory model may facilitate parental nucleosome transfer during replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication factory</kwd><kwd>CMG helicase</kwd><kwd>Ctf4</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>sister replication forks</kwd><kwd>nucleosomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Huilin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Donnell</surname><given-names>Michael E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eukaryotic replisomes are strongly connected together to replicate both sister DNAs produced from a bidirectional origin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Replication of cellular genomes requires numerous proteins that work together in a replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). Replication in eukaryotes utilizes CMG helicase (Cdc45−Mcm2-7−GINS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ilves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 2011</xref>), leading and lagging strand DNA polymerases (Pol) ε and δ, Pol α-primase, PCNA clamps, the RFC clamp loader, and numerous accessory factors of less defined function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgers and Kunkel, 2017</xref>). Replication in eukaryotes is performed in localized foci in nuclei that contain 10–100 replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falaschi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>). Recent super resolution microscopy has resolved these foci into single replicon factories from bidirectional origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saner et al., 2013</xref>). Nuclear foci in the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic>, most often contain only single replicon factories having two replication forks, although some foci consist of more than two replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saner et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular structure of a single core replicon factory unit, consisting of two replication forks is unknown, but several studies demonstrate that sister replication forks remain together during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falaschi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ligasová et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Natsume and Tanaka, 2010</xref>), and that sister double-strand (ds) DNA products are extruded in loops directed away from a replication protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillespie and Blow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Ctf4 (<underline>C</underline>hromosome <underline>T</underline>ransmission <underline>F</underline>idelity 4) is a homo-trimer (Ctf4<sub>3</sub>) that connects Pol α-primase and CMG helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miles and Formosa, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>). Previous EM studies reveal that Ctf4<sub>3</sub>−Pol α-primase resides on the opposite side of CMG from the leading strand DNA polymerase (Pol) ε in an individual replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Ctf4 also transiently binds Dna2, Dpb2, Tof2 and Chl1, and thus Ctf4 is proposed to be a dynamic hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Samora et al., 2016</xref>). Dynamic interaction enables multiple factors binding through time-sharing on Ctf4 and occurs through a conserved <underline>C</underline>tf4-<underline>I</underline>nteraction <underline>P</underline>eptide (CIP) motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilkenny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Samora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). The structures of the C-half of Ctf4 and its human orthologue AND1 reveal a disc-shaped constitutive trimer via the β-propeller domains on the N-terminal face (N-face) with the three C-terminal helical domains interacting with up to three CIP peptides on the C-face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kilkenny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). Ctf4 mutants that disrupt connection to CMG are deficient in transfer of parental nucleosomes to the lagging strand daughter duplex, with implications for a role in epigenetic inheritance during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). In human, AND1 (hCtf4) also binds CMG and is important for replication progression and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Williams and McIntosh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47405.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of individual replisomes and the coupled sister replisomes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Individual replisome: Ctf4<sub>3</sub> connects CMG to Pol α-primase, and Pol ε binds the C-face of CMG. Three unanswered questions are represented by the three question marks: 1. What components in CMG, in addition to the CIP peptide of Sld5, interact with Ctf4<sub>3</sub> to maintain their stable association? 2. How does Pol α-primase interact with Ctf4<sub>3</sub> – on the top N-face or the bottom C-face of the Ctf4 disk? 3. Can a second Pol α-primase also occupy the third CIP-site of Ctf4<sub>3</sub>? (<bold>b</bold>). Factory core model of two replisomes inferred from cryo-EM structures of the current report. Two CMGs bind tightly to two subunits of the Ctf4 trimer by an extensive interface formed with the Psf2 and Cdc45 subunits of CMG. One Pol α-primase occupies the third Ctf4 subunit. The single Pol α-primase connects to the C-face of Ctf4 near the split points of DNA entering the N-faces of the two CMGs. The two leading Pol ε complexes bind the C-face of CMG on the outside perimeter of the factory. See text for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47405-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Earlier structure studies of Ctf4 used subassemblies of CMG and Pol α-primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>), and thus it has not been fully understood how Ctf4 interacts with the holoenzyme forms of CMG and Pol α-primase, and whether Ctf4 might bind two Pol α-primase as proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We sought to address these questions by a combination of biochemistry and cryo-EM and found that one Ctf4<sub>3</sub> binds CMG very tight, not dynamic, and can bind 1, 2, or 3 CMG holoenzymes without steric hinderance at a 120° angle to one another. We also determine a structure of Ctf4<sub>3</sub> bound to Pol α-primase and observe Ctf4<sub>3</sub> binds only one copy of Pol α-primase. We have reconstituted a 2CMG–2Pol ε–1Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–1Pol α-primase complex biochemically and can visualize a 2CMG–1Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–1Pol α-primase complex by EM. Moreover, the CMGs retain helicase activity while multimerized by Ctf4<sub>3</sub>. These findings led us to propose that sister-replisomes are coupled by Ctf4<sub>3</sub> in a ‘replication factory’ of 2CMG–Pol ε–1Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–1Pol α-primase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We further address in the Discussion how various CIP factors may bind the replication factory, how Pol α-primase may be utilized for lagging strand priming of sister replication forks, and implications of a factory for parental nucleosome transfer to daughter duplexes. We note that these in vitro findings require cellular validation, which will be pursued in a separate study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CMG–Ctf4 form a stable complex</title><p>To explore how Ctf4<sub>3</sub> interacts with replisome factors we performed glycerol gradient sedimentation of protein mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This method originally revealed that Pol ε binds CMG, forming a CMG–Pol ε complex that sediments faster than either component alone (compare panels c and h with panel d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langston et al., 2014</xref>). CMG binding to Ctf4<sub>3</sub> was also readily apparent (compare panels c and g with panel e). It was initially surprising that the CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> complex migrated heavier than CMG–Pol ε, even though Ctf4<sub>3</sub> is not quite as large as Pol ε, because studies in the human system indicated there was only room for one CMG on Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with an earlier proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, compare panels d and e).</p><p>To study the CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> complex further we mixed Ctf4<sub>3</sub> and CMG and applied it to a MonoQ ion exchange column; a complex of CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> eluted at &gt; 400 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This result indicated CMG−Ctf4<sub>3</sub> is a stable complex, and is not loose, consistent wth an apparent tighter interaction of GINS complex to Ctf4<sub>3</sub> compared to the CIP peptide of Sld5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). The MonoQ isolated CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> complex was also stable to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We conclude that CMG is tightly bound and highly stable on the Ctf4<sub>3</sub> hub. Density scans of fractions within the SEC elution profile indicated a heterogeneous mixture of CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> complexes, with CMG:Ctf4<sub>3</sub> ratios ranging from 3:1 to 1:1. We therefore examined different fractions by cryo-EM and found that indeed, more than one CMG can bind Ctf4<sub>3</sub>, as described below.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47405.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Multiple CMGs form a stable complex with the Ctf4 trimer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A mixture of CMG and Ctf4<sub>3</sub> were applied to ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column.

The two major interfaces are between the β-propeller region of Ctf4 and both the Cdc45 subunit of CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and the Psf2 subunit in the GINS complex of CMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>); these interfaces were previously uncharacterized. The interactions between Cdc45 and the Ctf4 propeller are largely electrostatic, involving several salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, a loop connecting strands β1 and β2 of Psf2, disordered in the CMG structure in the absence of Ctf4<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>), inserts into two blades of the β-propeller and becomes ordered by forming multiple interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The interface between Psf2 and Ctf4 involves H-bonds between Psf2 residues Arg34 and Lys36 with Ctf4 residues Asn850 and Tyr848, respectively, as well as hydrophobic interaction among Ctf4 residues Phe518, Leu770, and Pro771 and Psf2 residues Ile27, Phe28, and Pro29. As expected, the main Ctf4-contacting regions of Cdc45, Psf2 are well conserved across evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The previously-identified interaction between Ctf4 and the CIP peptide in the Sld5 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>) of the GINS complex is actually a minor interaction site in which the N-terminal residues 3–15 of Sld5 form a short helix that bundles with the helical domain of Ctf4, primarily via a hydrophobic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). An intervening long peptide (aa 16–53) of Sld5 is disordered. This long flexible linker to the CIP peptide of Sld5 may explain why the CIP peptide of Sld5 is not required to observe CMG binding to Ctf4 in cells, predicting a second tethering point between CMG and Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore the Psf2 and Cdc45 extensive interfaces explain the stable association between Ctf4 and CMG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The 2CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> and 3CMG–Ctf4<sub>3</sub> complexes</title><p>Cryo-EM 2D averages of two CMGs bound to Ctf4<sub>3</sub> show the CMGs are held rigidly, consistent with their stable binding to Ctf4<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

But under negative-stain EM conditions, Pol α-primase was sufficiently stabilized on carbon film to yield a bi-lobed shape with the two lobes ~ 120 Å apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This architecture is essentially the same as a previous negative-stain EM study, in which one lobe is assigned to the catalytic NTD of Pol1 (Pol1-NTD) and the other lobe to the CTD of Pol1, plus the B-subunit and the L- and S-subunits of the primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Núñez-Ramírez et al., 2011</xref>).

This model may explain why Ctf4 has evolved to assemble a trimer, not a dimer, in order to tightly coordinate two CMG helicases, leaving one Ctf4 protomer to bind transient CIP factors such as Pol α-primase. Such a structure, operating at a level above the individual replisome, may represent the functional unit of a cellular replicon core factory derived from one bidirectional origin as implicated by cellular and microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saner et al., 2013</xref>).

In an earlier study that contained CMG–Pol ε–Ctf4–Pol α-primase-forked DNA, a density from Pol α-primase was observed at the N-tier of the Mcm ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Given that the p48/p58 primase subunits interact with Mcm3, Mcm4, and Mcm6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">You et al., 2013</xref>), the Pol α-primase density was most likely the primase lobe. Pol1 of Pol α-primase binds directly to Ctf4<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>), and in the present study the Ctf4–Pol α-primase structure is solved in the absence of CMG and DNA. Therefore, it is the Pol1 lobe instead of the primase lobe that is stabilized on Ctf4. Thus, the current study and the earlier study are compatible, but observe different lobes of Pol α-primase. At the time of the earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), the dimeric replisome images were observed but discarded, because we did not know how to interpret those images.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Either one or more Pol α-primases may prime the two lagging strands of the coupled sister forks</title><p>The lagging strands displaced off the N-tier rings of their respective Mcm2-7 hexamers are near the center between the two CMGs. Such lagging strand positioning allows for and raises the possibility that the single Pol α-primase may prime both lagging strands. The catalytic Pol1 NTD of Pol α-primase binds to the bottom C-face of the Ctf4<sub>3</sub> disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The primase lobe is not visible in the 3D map of Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–Pol α-primase of this report, but the Pol1-NTD lobe and primase lobe of the bi-lobed Pol α-primase are known to be separated by a distance of ~ 120 Å and connected via a flexible tether that provides a 70° range of motion between the primase and polymerase lobes, sufficiently long to contact both CMGs in the factory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranovskiy and Tahirov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Núñez-Ramírez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perera et al., 2013</xref>). Because the primase functions upstream of the Pol1 subunit of Pol α, and binds the Mcms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">You et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that the primase lobe extends upwards passing the 45 Å-thick Ctf4<sub>3</sub> disc to reach past the N-face of Ctf4<sub>3</sub>, placing the primase between the two N-tier rings of the helicases where the two lagging strands are first produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8a,b</xref>). Therefore, the primase subunits can come in contact with and thereby prime both lagging strands.</p><p>However, we do not expect that only one Pol α-primase molecule functions for both lagging strands in a replication factory for several reasons. First, Pol α-primase is fully competent to prime the lagging strand in the absence of Ctf4 in vitro using pure proteins, and is dependent on CMG not Ctf4 for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Georgescu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that Ctf4 is not required for replication fork operations per se. Second, the dynamic binding of Pol α-primase to Ctf4 in the dynamic Ctf4 hub view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villa et al., 2016</xref>), especially given the weak binding of the Pol1 CIP peptide, would only enable a single Pol α-primase to stay bound to Ctf4 for a few seconds or less. Therefore, even individual replisomes containing Ctf4 would utilize numerous Pol α-primase binding events over the time needed to repeatedly prime one lagging strand during replisome progression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multiple CIP factors may still access Ctf4 in the replisome factory</title><p>The currently identified CIP factors include Pol α-primase, CMG, Chl1, Dpb2, Tof2, and Dna2; the Pol α-primase, CMG, Dna2, and Chl1 bind the same consensus CIP site of Ctf4, whereas Tof2 and Dpb2 bind a distinct site on Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Samora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of Ctf4<sub>3</sub> to bind several different factors is proposed to depend on time-sharing due to weak CIP peptide binding with rapid on/off rates to Ctf4, similar to PCNA binding factors via a conserved PIP (<underline>P</underline>CNA <underline>I</underline>nteraction <underline>P</underline>eptide) motif, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georgescu et al. (2015a)</xref>. Given the tight interaction of 2 CMGs to Ctf4<sub>3</sub>, we envision three different pathways for CIP proteins to bind Ctf4<sub>3</sub> in a replication factory. The first, and simplest, is that the transient binding of Pol α-primase will often vacate one Ctf4 subunit, making it available for other CIP proteins. Indeed, given Pol α-primase still functions in vitro without Ctf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Georgescu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>), this particular CIP site may often be available for other CIP factors to bind. Second, the Chl1 helicase and Dna2 nuclease are required under particular cellular conditions, during which the replisome may change composition, and this has precedence in the rapid and dynamic rearrangements of proteins in the <italic>E. coli</italic> replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Indiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). Third, the structures of this report show that the CIP peptide of CMG (in Sld5) is located across a wide gap between CMG and Ctf4, and the CIP sequence only contacts Ctf4 at the end of a long flexible linker in Sld5. The K<sub>d</sub> of the Sld5 CIP peptide to Ctf4 is only 5 μM and can even be deleted without preventing CMG–Ctf4 interaction in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2014</xref>). Given the flexible loop that mediates the Sld5 CIP peptide in the CMG–Ctf4 complex, the Sld5 CIP peptide likely retains the rapid k<sub>off</sub> implied by the 5 μM K<sub>d</sub> and thus can be expected to vacate the Ctf4 CIP site frequently (i.e. milliseconds). While speculative, it is also possible the Sld5 CIP peptide within CMG may be regulated by other proteins, or that other CIP factors that have additional contacts to Ctf4 that can outcompete the weakly bound Sld5 CIP peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Independent replisomes and the twin CMG factory model are not mutually exclusive</title><p>The current report demonstrates that two (or three) CMG can bind Ctf4 tightly, that CMGs bound to the Ctf4 trimer retain activity, and that a complex of 2(CMG–Pol ε)–1Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–1Pol α-primase spontaneously assembles in vitro. In vitro single molecule studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> extracts and <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts demonstrate that individual replisomes can move apart in opposite directions from an origin and contain only one CMG apiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duzdevich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>). While these experiments reveal that replisomes can act individually, these experiments utilize DNA tethered at both ends and thus DNA looping needed in our factory model would not be observed. Thus if factories were present, only when they dissociate to form independent forks would replication forks on doubly tethered DNA be visualized. Alternatively, Xenopus egg extracts may be programmed to replicate a bit differently from normal cells. It is worth noting that neither the model of an individual replisome nor the model of a dimeric replisome factory have been proven to exist inside cells. Because the same proteins are present in both models, they may not be mutually exclusive and may both exist in cells. If true, the different models may even fulfill distict functions. Clearly, cellular studies are needed to untangle these scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Implications of a replisome factory on nucleosome distribution.</title><p>During replication the epigenetic marks on nucleosomes are distributed nearly equally to the two daughter duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The general view is that the H3H4 tetramer, which carries the bulk of epigenetic marks, binds DNA tightly and is transferred to nascent DNA independent of H2AH2B dimers that are easily displaced and exchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alabert et al., 2017</xref>). Two binding sites for H3H4 exist in the replisome: The N-terminal region of Mcm2 binds H3H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richet et al., 2015</xref>), and the Dpb3/4 subunits of Pol ε bind H3H4 at the C-face of CMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have found specific roles of these H3H4 sites in transfer of parental histones to daughter DNAs during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evrin et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the N-terminal region of Pol1 (i.e. the DNA Pol of Pol α-primase) binds H2A/H2B, and mutations in either Pol1, Mcm2 or Ctf4 have a negative effect on transfer of parental histone marks to the lagging strand duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evrin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). Hence Mcm2–Ctf4–Pol α forms an ‘axis’ for nucleosome transfer from parental DNA to the lagging daughter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). If only one Pol α-primase exists for two replication forks as in our 2CMG–Ctf4 factory model, during the time for transfer of a parental H3H4 to the lagging strand of one fork, the other fork in the opposite CMG would have progressed the same distance for transfer of another parental H3H4 to the leading strand. In this view, the architecture of our factory model facilitates the observed equal transfer of histones to both leading and lagging strand products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>There is another aspect of the replisome factory architecture that may play a role in the proposed Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol α axis of nucleosome distribution. Two Mcm2’s are needed to bind one H3H4 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richet et al., 2015</xref>). In our structure, Mcm2 is ordered from Pro-201, and there is a 200 residue long peptide that is intrinsically disordered. So the H3H4 binding site (residues 61–130) is within this unstructured peptide. In our factory model, the two Mcm2’s, one from each CMG helicase, may project out a pair of long tentacles (Mcm2 residues 1–200) between the two CMGs, and the two tentacles would conspire to capture one H3H4 to allow the ‘Mcm–Ctf4–Pol α ‘axis’ to participate in equal deposition of parental histone marks on both strands of wt cells, much like the single Pol α-primase in the factory. An alternative to the use of two Mcm2’s is that the H3H4 tetramer could be split so that one H3H4 dimer is bound by one Mcm2 and one Asf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, mass spectrometry studies indicate that the H3H4 tetramer remains intact during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Okazaki fragments are sized relative to the nucleosome repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>). If nucleosome transfer is coordinated with Okazaki fragment synthesis, the parental nucleosome will occupy approximately the same sequence on the nascent DNA as it did on the parental DNA, as observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madamba et al., 2017</xref>). To conclude, the current study is only the beginning of a comprehensive understanding of how replication is organized in the cell. We expect that additional proteins, further layers of organization, and yet to be determined dynamics exist in nuclear replication factories. The replisome architecture and actions in the context of chromatin and epigenetic inheritance are important areas for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Radioactive nucleotides were from Perkin Elmer and unlabeled nucleotides were from GE Health-care.

The initial modeling was followed by further manual adjustments using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), guided by residues with bulky side chains like Arg, Phe, Tyr and Trp. The improved model was then refined in real space against the EM densities using the phenix.real_space_refine module in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). For Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–CMG<sub>2</sub> and Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–CMG<sub>3</sub>, Chimera was used to rigid-body dock two or three copies of CMG and one Ctf4<sub>3</sub> into the corresponding EM map. Due to the low resolution of the latter two maps, the atomic models were not subject to further refinement. Finally, the quality of the refined atomic model of Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–CMG was examined using MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). For modeling of the Ctf4<sub>3</sub>–Polα-primase 3D map, one Ctf4 trimer (PDB 4C8H) and one Polα-primase catalytic NTD (PDB ID 4FYD) were docked as two separate rigid bodies into the 3D map in Chimera. Due to the low resolution of 3D map, the model was neither manually adjusted nor subjected to refinement. Structural figures were prepared in Chimera and Pymol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pymol.org">https://www.pymol.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Glycerol gradient sedimentation</title><p>To examine complex formation, 0.12 nmol of CMG was mixed with 0.12 nmol Ctf4<sub>3</sub>, 0.12 nmol of Pol ε and 0.12 nmol Pol α-primase in 150 μl of 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 2 mM Mg-OAc, 100 mM NaCl (final) for 30 min at 16°C, and the mixture was layered on top of an 11.2 mL 15–35% (vol/vol) glycerol gradient in 20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM NaCl and spun at 4°C for 16 hr in a Sorvall 90SE ultracentrifuge using a T-865 rotor. Five drop fractions were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, and 20 μL samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Similar gradient analyses were performed for sub-mixtures of the proteins. A parallel gradient was also performed using protein standards (BioRad 151–1901) in the same buffer. Gels were scanned and quantitated using Image J software and relative moles of protein in each band were calculated, taking into account their native mw. Only subunits the size of Cdc45 or larger were analyzed, as smaller subunit bands were too light for analysis. The full-length Ctf4<sub>3</sub> was used to enhance its staining capacity, as the small C-half of Ctf4<sub>3</sub> was not well distinguished above background. The full-length Ctf4<sub>3</sub> overlapped with Mcm4 and required taking the overlap into account (see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pull-down assays</title><p>Pull-down assays were performed by mixing 20 pmol of N-terminal labeled streptag-Ctf4 trimer with 60 pmol Pol α-primase (when present) and 60 pmol CMG (when present) at 25°C for 10 min. Then the volume of the protein solution was adjusted to 50 μl with binding buffer (20 mM Tris-Acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM KGlutamate and 50 mM KCl) before being mixed with 50 μL of a 50% suspension of StrepTactin magnetic beads (Qiagen). The protein-bead mixture was incubated in a Thermomixer at 1250 rpm, 4°C for 1 hr. The beads were then collected with a magnetic separator and the supernatant containing unbound proteins was removed. The beads were washed twice with 100 μL binding buffer and bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in 50 μL of the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM biotin at 25°C for 15 min.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.

The structures for Ctf4 occupied by 2 or 3 CMG complexes (at 6Å and 7 Å resolution) are also shown, along with a model Ctf4-Pol-α/primase (obtained at 12 Å resolution) that identifies one lone tethering point between Pol-α and Ctf4. Based on the ability of Ctf4 to bind multiple CMGs and a single Pol-α, a model for how Ctf4 coordinates the action of two helicases and the lagging strand polymerase in a prospective replication factory is proposed. This framework is then used to speculate as to how factories might promote sister chromosome cohesion.</p><p>The strength of this manuscript lies in the structural studies of various Ctf4 complexes. This information is important as it identifies two previously unknown Ctf4 interactions with CMG subunits Cdc45 and Psf2 and substantiates the prediction that multiple CMG assemblies can bind to Ctf4 without clashing. In addition, Ctf4 is found to preferentially bind one DNA Pol-α/primase. Overall, these insights contribute to our general understanding of the architecture of the eukaryotic replisome. This said, there are several extant issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A substantial portion of the paper is dedicated to several elaborate models that are consistent with available data but never explicitly tested, such as the idea that replication factories might have a role in facilitating sister chromatid cohesion. The work would be substantially improved if mutations in the newly discovered Ctf4-CMG interface (or even a Ctf4 deletion, which is viable) could be examined for their ability to disrupt the observation made by Tanaka and colleagues showing that DNA at equal distances from an origin come together at the time of replication. Otherwise discussion topics such as the role of Pol-α-Ctf4-CMG in parental histone re-deposition appear more solidly grounded. Barring the addition of genetic or cell biological studies aimed at testing aspects of the cohesion model, it would be appropriate to focus the discussion on the Ctf4-CMG interaction (i.e., eliminating the speculation about cohesion and Figure 8—figure supplement 2B) and to limit the Discussion to the two-CMG-one Pol-α/primase model.</p><p>2) The manuscript does not take into account that amino acid changes in the CIP motif in Chl1 (a cohesin interactor) give rise to a sister chromatid cohesion phenotype, unlike a mutation in the CIP motif of Sld5. Taken at face value, the evidence indicates that Chl1 interaction with Ctf4, and not two CMGs bridged by Ctf4, is important for sister chromatid cohesion. If genetic or cell biological data are presented to test the proposed cohesion model, these findings will need to be noted.</p><p>3) The Pol-α modeling is based on less solid data than the higher-resolution CMG–Ctf4 interactions. There is some concern as to veracity of the placement the different Pol-α/primase elements with respect to Ctf4 and/or the CMG. Since the location of these regions is an important part of the replication factory model, it is important that more data be shown to boost confidence about their placement. Details of the cryo-EM volume with different views/different thresholds should be shown, as well as the model-to-map Fourier Shell Correlation plot comparing best and second-best docking solution. Was RELION multi-body refinement attempted for this complex? The resolution of the Pol-α lobe might improve using this strategy. Also, panels A and B/C of Figure 6 should be scaled so that the Pol-α NTD has the same size.</p><p>4) In the Sun, 2015, replisome paper (Figure 5E), Pol-α/primase maps to the opposite Ctf4 side compared to that described in the current study. This discrepancy should be addressed more clearly.</p><p>5) The biochemical data in Figures S13, S14, and S15 are somewhat buried, which detracts from the impact of the work. It would be preferable for these panels to be included in the main results in place of the extensive discussion of the model that is there now. Along these lines, is this the first time that the binding of the CMG to Ctf4 is seen to stimulate Pol-α binding (i.e., that their association is cooperative) and vice versa? If so, please note as much, or else cite the appropriate references that the findings confirm. Similarly, is this first time that stoichiometric studies have been performed to show that helicase activity is supported by a dual-CMG/Ctf4 complex? Do the authors think that the difference between 1.7 CMG–Ctf4-3 versus 1 CMG–Ctf4-3 in Figure S15 is a result of cooperative action of the two helicases? If so, how might this cooperativity emerge?</p><p>6) It would seem that only the double CMG–Ctf4-3 works well in the elongation assay (in S15B), which contradicts the idea that one or two CMGs bound to Ctf4 bind and unwind as well as CMG alone (S14). Please describe the tests that were performed to determine whether the time of preincubation was long enough to ensure that only unwinding is being measured in these assays rather than fork binding and unwinding. Based on recent work from the Yardimci lab, it would seem that many previous studies are likely to be measuring binding as well as unwinding (with binding being rate limiting).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ctf4 organizes sister replisomes and Pol α into a replication factory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Do the authors mean &quot;map-to-coordinate correlation curve&quot;?</p><p>It was requested that a map-to-model correlation curve be shown for the best rigid body docking solution and the second-best rigid body docking solution. If the cryo-EM map is sufficiently featured to model one Pol α orientation with confidence, then the FSC for the best solution should show significantly higher correlation than the second-best solution. The authors could also simply quote the average correlation score for the best vs second best docking solution. Please address.</p><p>2) The evidence that the CMG helicase can use ATPγS to unwind DNA is not compelling. The data in Figure 7B appear to use extremely high concentrations of nucleotide (100 and 500 mM) concentrations – are the units actually μM? The ATPγS may be contaminated with ATP (which is commonly the case), and it may be this nucleotide rather than ATPγS that is used by the CMG.</p><p>The more relevant data to this point may be in Figure 7—figure supplement 3, where the experiment is performed at a more realistic concentration of 0.1 mM ATPγS. Here it is suggested that the same amount of unwinding is seen with ATPγS as when ATP is added. There are two issues with these data. First, in the ATPγS data, the overall signal is weak and the detected released DNA is very weak. In contrast, the experiment with ATP shows a much more robust signal. Second, there is no direct comparison with ATP versus ATPγS (as in 7B).

The work would be substantially improved if mutations in the newly discovered Ctf4-CMG interface (or even a Ctf4 deletion, which is viable) could be examined for their ability to disrupt the observation made by Tanaka and colleagues showing that DNA at equal distances from an origin come together at the time of replication. Otherwise discussion topics such as the role of Pol-α-Ctf4-CMG in parental histone re-deposition appear more solidly grounded. Barring the addition of genetic or cell biological studies aimed at testing aspects of the cohesion model, it would be appropriate to focus the discussion on the Ctf4-CMG interaction (i.e., eliminating the speculation about cohesion and Figure 8—figure supplement 2B) and to limit the Discussion to the two-CMG-one Pol-α/primase model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and thank them for this comment. The suggested “Tanaka” microscope experiments were, in fact, already underway +/- a Ctf4 deletion, but it will take time and we plan this to be a follow-up study along with some new EM studies that we plan to perform for this follow-up as well. Hence, we have taken the reviewer’s second suggestion and removed proposals on cohesion, and limited the discussion to the CMG–Ctf4 interaction, the proposed functioning of the 2CMG-1-Pol α/primase model, and speculation about a possible role in parental histone re-deposition on nascent DNA products as the reviewers suggest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript does not take into account that amino acid changes in the CIP motif in Chl1 (a cohesin interactor) give rise to a sister chromatid cohesion phenotype, unlike a mutation in the CIP motif of Sld5. Taken at face value, the evidence indicates that Chl1 interaction with Ctf4, and not two CMGs bridged by Ctf4, is important for sister chromatid cohesion. If genetic or cell biological data are presented to test the proposed cohesion model, these findings will need to be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>As with comment 1, we no longer propose a role of the factory in cohesion, and instead take the reviewer’s suggestion of discussing how the structures observed here may relate to parental nucleosome transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Pol-α modeling is based on less solid data than the higher-resolution CMG–Ctf4 interactions. There is some concern as to veracity of the placement the different Pol-α/primase elements with respect to Ctf4 and/or the CMG. Since the location of these regions is an important part of the replication factory model, it is important that more data be shown to boost confidence about their placement. Details of the cryo-EM volume with different views/different thresholds should be shown, as well as the model-to-map Fourier Shell Correlation plot comparing best and second-best docking solution. Was RELION multi-body refinement attempted for this complex? The resolution of the Pol-α lobe might improve using this strategy. Also, panels A and B/C of Figure 6 should be scaled so that the Pol-α NTD has the same size.</p></disp-quote><p>For the Ctf4-Pol α 3D reconstruction: we have added a Euler angle distribution and the FSC resolution curve to the supplemental figure. We have also added in panel b the surface view in two thresholds – low and high levels. We did not provide a map-to-coordinated correction curve, because we simply used rigid body docking – the original crystal structures were unaltered.</p><p>For the Figure 4 CMG–Ctf4 interface – we have removed the square boxes as requested.</p><p>In Figure 6, we have re-scaled the panel a, such that panels A, B and C are in the same scale now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Sun, 2015, replisome paper (Figure 5E), Pol-α/primase maps to the opposite Ctf4 side compared to that described in the current study. This discrepancy should be addressed more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have clarified that the observation in the two reports are compatible, based on the Pol α-primase bilobed flexible structure, and presence of CMG/DNA in one study and lack of CMG/DNA in the other study. Specifically, Pol α-primase is an elongated particle with a Pol lobe on one end and primase lobe on the other, with up to 70o flexing between them (as cited). The structure of Pol α-primase-Ctf4 in this report does not include CMG or DNA, and thus only observes the direct Pol1-Ctf4 interaction, the primase lobe cannot be seen likely due to the inherent flexibility between Pol1 and primase lobes. In contrast, our previous study included CMG and a forked DNA, along with Ctf4 and Pol α-primase. Given the documented primase- Mcm interaction (as cited) and the presence of forked DNA in the earlier study, the observed density was likely the primase lobe of Pol α-primase. Thus the two studies likely observe different lobes of the flexible Pol α-primase. This is now described and clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The biochemical data in Figures S13, S14, and S15 are somewhat buried, which detracts from the impact of the work. It would be preferable for these panels to be included in the main results in place of the extensive discussion of the model that is there now. Along these lines, is this the first time that the binding of the CMG to Ctf4 is seen to stimulate Pol-α binding (i.e., that their association is cooperative) and vice versa? If so, please note as much, or else cite the appropriate references that the findings confirm. Similarly, is this first time that stoichiometric studies have been performed to show that helicase activity is supported by a dual-CMG/Ctf4 complex? Do the authors think that the difference between 1.7 CMG–Ctf4-3 versus 1 CMG–Ctf4-3 in Figure S15 is a result of cooperative action of the two helicases? If so, how might this cooperativity emerge?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. Yes, this is the first demonstration of cooperativity in binding of Pol α-primase/CMG to Ctf43, and the first time that helicase and replication activity is conducted within the context of a 2 CMG–Ctf4 complex vs a single CMG. We now provide a main text figure (new Figure 7) of this biochemical data, and we performed new helicase and replication assays in triplicate +/- Ctf4 for this figure (panels C,D). The replication data using SEC fractions of pre-formed CMG–Ctf4 complexes used 20nM Ctf4 from each column fraction, and thus different amounts of CMG were present in each reaction resulting in the higher activity of fractions having ratios of 1.7 CMG:1 Ctf4 vs 1.0 CMG:1Ctf4. This figure is retained as a supplement figure and the use of constant 20 nM Ctf4 (and thus different amounts of CMG) is now clarified in text and legend of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have added to this new main text figure our finding that ATPγS supports CMG unwinding (panel b). We tested ATPγS from 3 different manufactures, including Roche, and obtain the same result (in Figure 7, panel B). We discovered this while addressing main point #6, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would seem that only the double CMG–Ctf4-3 works well in the elongation assay (in S15b), which contradicts the idea that one or two CMGs bound to Ctf4 bind and unwind as well as CMG alone (S14). Please describe the tests that were performed to determine whether the time of preincubation was long enough to ensure that only unwinding is being measured in these assays rather than fork binding and unwinding. Based on recent work from the Yardimci lab, it would seem that many previous studies are likely to be measuring binding as well as unwinding (with binding being rate limiting).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and have addressed the first sentence in comment #5. Regarding whether preincubation time was long enough for CMG binding, we initially did not try to separate DNA binding and unwinding. We have changed that, and have performed the requested preincubation experiments using ATPγS, the typical nucleotide analogue the field (and Yardimci) uses for CMG/DNA preincubation for CMG binding DNA prior to adding ATP. We show a study of the preincubation times for helicase and replication assays in supplemental figures, as requested – the conclusion remains the same (i.e. Ctf4 does not increase CMG activity). The two recent Yardimchi reports that the reviewer’s mention use 0.1-0.5 mM ATPγS and preincubate 2h at 37°C, but neither report shows the result of this preincubation, nor do these reports document that this amount of time is required for CMG DNA binding. The one supplemental fluorescent figure suggests a lag of 10 min, and that this is the time of CMG binding. We do not know why 2 hours, 37°C was used as we have not been able to locate the rationale for this in Yardimchi’s reports. However, in doing the requested preincubation experiments, we surprisingly found that ATPγS supports CMG unwinding, and 2h and 30°C gives about 50% unwinding, the maximum observed in the Yardimchi work and our own. Therefore we now document here, for the first time we are aware of, that ATPγS in fact supports CMG unwinding of DNA (we used ATPγS from the same catalogue number and supplier as Yardimchi). We also tried ATPγS from two other companies, with the same result. We also tested 3 different CMG preps with the same result.</p><p>Given the request by reviewers to use similar conditions as Yardimchi, we found that use of 10 min at 0.1 mM ATPγS preincubation is sufficient for binding in helicase assays, and is below the time of observable unwinding, (see supplemental figures to Figure 7). For CMG to bind the long 3’ tail of the replication fork, which is also primed with an oligonucleotide, we needed a 30 min preincubation of CMG with ATPγS (Figure 7—figure supplement 5). The results, after the preincubation, continue to support that two CMGs on a Ctf4 trimer are active, and thus capable of function within a factory.</p><p>We have also retained the original supplemental helicase and replication assays as part b of their respective supplemental figures that document the preincubation time controls. Thus, even when both binding and unwinding/replication are measured, the CMG and CMG multimerized on Ctf4 have similar activity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Primary issues:</p><p>1) In the prior review, it was requested that &quot;Details of the cryo-EM volume with different views/different thresholds should be shown, as well as the model-to-map Fourier Shell Correlation plot comparing best and second-best docking solution.&quot; The reply states that &quot;We did not provide a map-to-coordinated correction curve, because we simply used rigid body docking – the original crystal structures were unaltered.&quot; This reply is unclear. Do the authors mean &quot;map-to-coordinate correlation curve&quot;?</p><p>It was requested that a map-to-model correlation curve be shown for the best rigid body docking solution and the second-best rigid body docking solution. If the cryo-EM map is sufficiently featured to model one Pol α orientation with confidence, then the FSC for the best solution should show significantly higher correlation than the second-best solution. The authors could also simply quote the average correlation score for the best vs second best docking solution. Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the model-to-map correlation curves for Ctf4-CMG dimer, and Ctf4-CMG trimer in their appropriate supplemental figures (ie. Figure 5—figure, supplements 1 and 2). The revised manuscript also includes the map-to-model correlation curves for the best rigid body docking solution and the second-best rigid body docking solution for Pol α with Ctf4 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence that the CMG helicase can use ATPγS to unwind DNA is not compelling. The data in Figure 7B appear to use extremely high concentrations of nucleotide (100 and 500 mM) concentrations – are the units actually μM? The ATPγS may be contaminated with ATP (which is commonly the case), and it may be this nucleotide rather than ATPγS that is used by the CMG.</p><p>The more relevant data to this point may be in Figure 7—figure supplement 3, where the experiment is performed at a more realistic concentration of 0.1 mM ATPγS. Here it is suggested that the same amount of unwinding is seen with ATPγS as when ATP is added. There are two issues with these data. First, in the ATPγS data, the overall signal is weak and the detected released DNA is very weak. In contrast, the experiment with ATP shows a much more robust signal. Second, there is no direct comparison with ATP versus ATPγS (as in 7b). Experiments using equivalent concentrations of ATPγS and ATP at similar (low) concentrations need to be shown to provide a direct comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment – and have dropped the ATPγS unwinding experiments from the revision, as requested by the reviewers. While we now know that CMG (but not Mcm2-7) can, in fact, hydrolyze ATPγS and couple it to unwind DNA (supported by the requested mutation analysis and by other means), we find it is prevented by certain sequences. Hence, we used sequences that are not unwound by CMG with ATPγS to repeat the preincubation, unwinding and replication experiments for this paper (Figure 7 and Figure 7—supplements 3, 4) and omit the earlier ATPγS work from the revised paper.</p><p>As the reviewers intuited, we had mislabeled Figure 7. The amount of ATPγS was μM not millimolar. ATPγS has no contaminating ATP due to the process in which it is synthesized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to (2), an important issue that is not addressed is whether there is a very small amount of a contaminating helicase in the preps that is responsible for the unwinding. Given the very slow different kinetics seen with ATPγS (it takes around 30 minutes and then makes up all of the slower rates observed earlier) and previous data from others (where the hydrolysis rate found for Mcm2-7 with ATPγS was 2% of that seen with ATP), it seems possible that the observed activity derives from a contaminant. A mutant form of the CMG carrying a critical ATPase motif substitution that is necessary for unwinding needs to be tested to demonstrate that unwinding is indeed lost.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have confirmed by several criteria that CMG can utilize ATPγS for unwinding, and has sequence dependency for being able to plow through to the end. This likely underlies the Costa lab 2018 CMG-forked DNA-ATPγS structure without using protein blocks. Hydrolysis by ATPγS is also consistent with CMG reaching the fork, or going beyond it, as we have shown CMG can’t move on ssDNA to reach the fork without hydrolysis (Wasserman et al., 2019; Georgescu et al., 2017).</p><p>Many enzymes that use ATP can also hydrolyze ATPγS (usually slowly), so ability of CMG to hydrolyze ATPγS is not surprising to us, but we have omitted this fact from this paper as it does not logically fit as a part of this study. Interestingly, Dan Herschlag has shown that a RNA helicase uses ATPγS reasonably efficiently, from which he implied that chemistry is not the rate limiting step (PMID 13130132). Also, the Benkovic lab found that Pol I uses dNMPaSPP nearly as well as dNTPs, and also used this observation to imply a slow conformation change is a rate limiting step in Pol I polymerization, and not the chemical step (PMID: 6351905).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the ATPγS data and claims could just be removed, as they are not central to the primary thrust of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the reviewer’s advice and omitted the ATPγS unwinding data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
