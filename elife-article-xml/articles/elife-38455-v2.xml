Loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from various components of the respiratory circuitry (e.g. the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN)) has so far produced at most 50% neonatal lethality. To identify other <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons that contribute to postnatal survival, we examined parabrachial complex neurons derived from the rostral rhombic lip (rRL) and found that they are activated during respiratory chemochallenges. <italic>Atoh1</italic>-deletion from the rRL does not affect survival, but causes apneas and respiratory depression during hypoxia, likely due to loss of projections to the preBötzinger Complex and RTN. <italic>Atoh1</italic> thus promotes the development of the neural circuits governing hypoxic (rRL) and hypercapnic (RTN) chemoresponses, and combined loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from these regions causes fully penetrant neonatal lethality. This work underscores the importance of modulating respiratory rhythms in response to chemosensory information during early postnatal life.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38455.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Breathing seems very simple: humans and other animals do it all the time without even thinking about it. Yet, many different cell types coordinate rhythmic breathing movements. Some cells set the breathing rhythm, motor neurons control the muscles, and other cells sense blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Information about oxygen and carbon dioxide is necessary to trigger faster and deeper breaths when there is too little oxygen, for example, at high altitude. Or when there is too much carbon dioxide, for example, during exercise.</p><p>At birth, most newborns can breathe as fast as needed because key genes oversee the development of all the cells involved in breathing. Learning more about these genes and what they do could lead to better understanding of why some newborns are at risk for sudden infant death or crib death. The Atoh1 gene, for example, helps carbon dioxide-sensing cells called retrotrapezoid neurons develop. Mice born without the Atoh1 gene are unable to breathe normally and die at birth. But when the gene is only deleted from these carbon dioxide-sensing cells in mice, just half of them die. This suggests that Atoh1 in other cells may also be important for breathing.</p><p>Now, Van der Heijden and Zoghbi show that the Atoh1 gene also helps develop another set of cells that are essential for breathing called the parabrachial complex. These cells receive information from oxygen sensors and relay the information to cells that set breathing rhythms. Mice missing parabrachial complex cells do not breathe faster when oxygen levels in the air are low. Mice lacking Atoh1 from both the parabrachial complex cells and the retrotrapezoid cells have breathing problems and die at birth.</p><p>Van der Heijden and Zoghbi show that the Atoh1 gene is essential for two cell types that make mice breathe faster when oxygen or carbon dioxide levels change. Together these two cell types are necessary for survival. The experiments also may provide insights into what goes wrong in babies who experience sudden infant death. Mutations in genes that are important to both cell types increase the risk of these infant deaths. Newborn babies with mutations in such key developmental genes will be at risk when in low oxygen or high carbon dioxide environments because their breathing systems are still maturing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Atoh1</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>respiratory chemoresponses</kwd><kwd>apnea</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>hypercapnia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral fellowship award number 17PRE33660616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Heijden</surname><given-names>Meike E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zoghbi</surname><given-names>Huda Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atoh1 promotes the development of two different neural circuits involved in hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory responses that together are essential for neonatal respiratory drive and survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hard-wired, transcriptionally defined neural circuit development is often complemented by synaptic plasticity that is driven by feedback from experience. Yet circuits giving rise to vital functions, such as respiration, have no time for such trial and error: the animal must be able to maintain its own O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> homeostasis from the moment it is born. This ability likely arises from a detailed genetic blueprint in the hindbrain respiratory circuit. Indeed, mapping the expression domains of key transcription factors in the developing hindbrain reveals a checkerboard pattern, with rostro-caudal and dorso-ventral stripes crisscrossing the entire region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pagliardini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pasqualetti et al., 2007</xref>). The complexity of the circuit and the relative inaccessibility of some its individual components have made it difficult to tease out the specific contributions of various neuronal populations to neonatal survival.</p><p>For example, mice lacking the transcription factor <italic>Atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1)</italic> die at birth of respiratory failure even though they generate some respiratory movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Arie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tupal et al., 2014</xref>). The precise cause of this fully penetrant lethality has eluded a number of studies, which have nonetheless deepened our understanding of <italic>Atoh1</italic>’s contributions to the respiratory circuit. <italic>Atoh1</italic> is expressed in the developing hindbrain along the entire rostro-caudal rhombic lip, where it promotes the development of several nuclei involved in respiratory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Atoh1</italic> is also expressed in postmitotic neurons of two paramotor nuclei: the intertrigeminal region (ITR) and the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>). The chemosensitive RTN sends excitatory projections to the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), which generates inspiratory rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guyenet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</xref>). <italic>Atoh1</italic> loss from the RTN impairs respiratory responses to hypercapnia, but, rather remarkably, causes only partial neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38455.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage parabrachial complex neurons are activated during chemochallenges but are not essential for neonatal survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expression cells in the developing brainstem (E14.5).

Loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> results in loss of proliferating cells in the rhombic lip. Among the rhombic lip derived <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage are three populations of neurons that have been implicated in respiratory control: the parabrachial complex (PBC), the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) and the lateral reticular nucleus (LRt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tupal et al., 2014</xref>). Two paramotor nuclei express <italic>Atoh1</italic> during the postmitotic phase, and its expression is essential for their proper migration and connectivity from the RTN to the preBötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>).</p><p>To date, the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons are the only <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons whose role in respiratory control and neonatal survival was not assessed. We first tested whether <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons might have a role in respiratory chemoresponses. To test this we labeled the <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage with tdTomato using a Cre-dependent reporter allele (<italic>Atoh1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa<sup>lsl-tdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice) and exposed these mice to either room air, hypoxia, or hypercapnia prior to staining for the neural activity marker cFos. We found tdTomato<sup>+</sup>, cFos<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells in the medial and lateral parabrachial region as well as in the Kölliker Fuse after exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnia, but not room air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This confirms that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons are activated by changes in O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> and might play a role in respiratory function.</p><p>There are no previous reports that PBC neurons are intrinsically chemosensitive, so these neurons are likely activated by upstream neurons that are chemosensitive. Previous studies showed that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-null mice lose the substance P receptor NK1R in the PBC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>). We found that indeed all NK1R-expressing PBC neurons were <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also looked whether <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons expressed calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase‐activating polypeptide (PACAP), because these peptides have been implicated in playing a role for hypercapnic and hypoxic responses respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cummings et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yokota et al., 2015</xref>). We found that all counted <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons in the lateral PBC expressed CGRP and that some expressed PACAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons might be important for respiratory responses through signaling with one or both of these neuro peptides.</p><p>Next, we assessed whether these <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons are required for neonatal survival. As PBC neurons develop from the rRL, we deleted <italic>Atoh1</italic> only from this domain using an <italic>Engrailed-1-</italic>driven Cre-line (<italic>En1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>). We crossed <italic>Atoh1<sup>Flox/Flox</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shroyer et al., 2007</xref>) to males heterozygous for <italic>En1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Atoh1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup>, which is a functional <italic>Atoh1</italic>-null allele that can be used to trace <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing neurons throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Arie et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Atoh1<sup>Flox/LacZ</sup>;En1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (hereafter <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO) were born in Mendelian ratios (25/97 surviving pups, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We stained E14.5 embryos with X-gal and confirmed that <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO lost all <italic>Atoh1</italic>-expressing neurons from the rRL, while leaving other <italic>Atoh1-</italic>lineage neurons intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Anatomical analysis of postnatal (P21) animals confirmed that this conditional deletion of <italic>Atoh1</italic> resulted in loss of NK1R-expressing PBC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, despite losing these <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons, these animals survive, showing that <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression in the rRL is not necessary for neonatal survival.</p><p><italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice developed severe ataxia, dystonia and tremor in the second to third week after birth and died shortly after weaning (P22-25), probably because the motor phenotypes impair their ability to get proper amounts of food and water.

In some cases, loss of a particular factor causes respiratory failure that is traceable to a single respiratory nucleus: for example, neonatal death in <italic>Dbx1</italic>-null mice is caused by loss of rhythmogenic preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). The broad expression domains of factors such as <italic>Atoh1, Tlx3</italic> and <italic>Lbx1,</italic> however, have made it difficult to pinpoint their role in a specific nucleus or functional impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pagliardini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shirasawa et al., 2000</xref>). Here we used intersectional genetics to uncover a role for <italic>Atoh1</italic> in the development of chemoresponsive neuronal populations that also express <italic>Engrailed1</italic> and <italic>Phox2b</italic> (the PBC and RTN, respectively). Concomitant loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from these two domains causes fully penetrant neonatal lethality. This study thus answers the decades-old question about the cause of respiratory failure in <italic>Atoh1</italic>-null mice: they die of an inability to modulate respiratory rhythms in response to hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions.</p><p>Several pieces of evidence suggest that the abnormal chemoresponses we observed in the <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice are primarily due to loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage parabrachial neurons. First, even though multiple nuclei develop from the intersectional domain of <italic>Atoh1</italic> and <italic>En1</italic>, the parabrachial neurons were the only <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons that were activated specifically during hypercapnic and hypoxic chemochallenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, silencing the output from the cerebellar cortex does not cause abnormal respiratory chemoresponses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, differences in abnormal chemoresponses between <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice and control littermates are observed long before the cerebellum fully matures or <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage cerebellar granule cells even make their first functional synapses <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">(Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, our results confirm and extend previous work showing that lesioning the parabrachial nucleus impairs respiratory chemoresponses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mizusawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song and Poon, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2009b</xref>) and that the parabrachial nucleus projects to the ventrolateral medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fulwiler and Saper, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holstege, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yokota et al., 2015</xref>). We found rostral <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons projecting to the retrotrapezoid nucleus and preBötC, but we did not observe any projections to motor nuclei or specifically the reported connections with the hypoglossal nucleus. This discrepancy can be because we used genetic tools (<italic>Atoh1</italic>-driven) that only target a subset of PBC neurons. Furthermore, these genetic tools are less prone to potential off target effects caused by needle tracks and local injections. Therefore, we propose that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons are an essential component in the chemosensory pathways that relays information from peripheral, and perhaps central, chemosensors to enhance the firing of central chemosensitive and rhythmogenic neurons within the respiratory network.</p><p>Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage, deep cerebellar nuclei contribute to the observed phenotypes. <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage parabrachial and deep cerebellar neurons are born around the same embryonic day (E9.5-E12.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rose et al., 2009a</xref>) and since we do not know what factors determine their differentiation, there are no developmental or genetic tools to target the deep cerebellar nuclei without affecting the parabrachial nucleus. Viral approaches do not work, either, as we discovered: deep cerebellar neurons send collateral projections throughout the cerebellum and the brainstem, so viral injections infect <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage deep cerebellar neurons regardless of the injection site. Nevertheless, the primary source of input to the deep cerebellar nuclei are the Purkinje cells, and silencing these cells did not recapitulate or alter respiratory chemoresponses. This latter finding, together with our data showing absence of chemoresponses in deep cerebellar neurons, make them unlikely to be essential for respiratory chemoresponses.</p><p>Likewise, <italic>Atoh1</italic> loss from the intertrigeminal region had little effect on respiratory chemoresponses. In agreement with earlier studies from our lab, we found that intertrigeminal neurons depend on <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression for normal migration, which resulted in increased number of apneas and a shallower breaths. Previous studies suggested a role for intertrigeminal neurons in the attenuation of sleep and reflex apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radulovacki et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2004</xref>). We indeed saw an increase in sigh-induced apneas but we saw an increase in the number of spontaneous apneas in only two out of thirteen <italic>Atoh1::HoxA2</italic>-CKO mice, suggesting that the previously reported apneas were not likely caused by a central mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Despite the changes in respiratory control in room air, we did not observe any abnormal respiratory chemoresponses in <italic>Atoh1::HoxA2</italic>-CKO mice. These results support the hypothesis that the respiratory phenotype of mice that lack <italic>Atoh1</italic> in both ITR and RTN (the <italic>Atoh1::Phox2b</italic>-CKO mice) results from abnormal RTN development.</p><p>The current work provides evidence that there are two <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage nuclei that rely on <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression for their function in respiratory chemoreflexes: the PBC and RTN. Removal of <italic>Atoh1</italic> from both of these nuclei recapitulated the fully penetrant neonatal lethality of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-null mice, which we hypothesize is caused by combined loss of CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked glutamatergic signaling (RTN) and hypoxia-induced activation of PBC neurons. Previous studies in neonatal models have shown that arterial CO<sub>2</sub> unloading removes respiratory drive and results in sustained apnea, in accordance with the notion that CO<sub>2</sub> sensing is essential for neonatal breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nattie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Praud et al., 1997</xref>). We suspect that, when directly or indirectly activated during respiratory chemochallenges, <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons increase glutamatergic input to the preBötzinger complex, which is thought to form the central respiratory pattern generator. Since neither <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice nor <italic>Atoh1::Phox2b</italic>-CKO mice show complete lethality nor complete loss of respiratory chemoresponses, it is likely that these two pathways of chemosensation (PBC and RTN-mediated) are partially redundant, as would make sense for any circuit that controls a process as fundamental to survival as breathing. Indeed, en bloc recordings from <italic>Atoh1</italic>-null mice reveal that slow respiratory frequency can be fully restored by application of a glutamate reuptake inhibitor and partially restored by substance P application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2009b</xref>). Our results are also in agreement with previous recordings in wild-type brainstems, where loss of input from the pons and RTN to the ventrolateral medulla results in a transition from a tri-phasic to a slow gasp-like, mono-phasic rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rubin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). The present study provides further evidence that pontine PBC and RTN neurons are essential for the respiratory versatility observed in vivo. Despite the normal development of preBötzinger neurons that are sufficient for in situ respiratory rhythms, excitatory projections from <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons are necessary for normal breathing in vivo.</p><p>Caffeine treatment, along with glutamate and substance P, can stimulate endogenous, slow respiratory rhythms in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruangkittisakul et al., 2010</xref>); this is thought to be the mechanism by which caffeine reduces apneas of prematurity in newborn infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aranda et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Natarajan et al., 2007</xref>). Caffeine drives this excitation mainly by acting as an antagonist to the A1 adenosine receptor that inhibits respiratory frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koos et al., 2001</xref>). Decreased inhibition might compensate for the loss of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent glutamatergic drive in <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice, thereby rescuing the apnea. Caffeine treatment did not, however, improve the respiratory chemoresponses in <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice, suggesting that increased ventilation during chemochallenge relies on more precise signaling of distinct neurons in the circuitry. This is in agreement with the observation that some, but not all, <italic>Atoh1</italic>-dependent parabrachial neurons are activated during chemochallenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To our surprise, caffeine treatment actually decreased respiratory output in control animals, which might be caused by inhibition of A2 adenosine receptors that increase respiratory frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koos and Chau, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koos et al., 2001</xref>). Future studies with specific adenosine agonists and antagonists are needed to elucidate the specific effects of long-term caffeine treatment on respiratory control in neonatal mice.</p><p>The breathing abnormalities of <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice resemble those seen in premature infants: increased apneas and sighs, abnormal rhythms, attenuated responses to hypercapnia, and, perhaps most surprisingly, respiratory suppression in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu-Shaweesh, 2004</xref>). These also mimic respiratory responses to hypoxia that occur in utero, when the oxygenation of fetal blood is regulated by the mother. During development, exposure to low O<sub>2</sub> suppresses fetal movements, including breathing movements, likely to limit oxygen demand in relatively anaerobic environments. Several reports have suggested that pontine nuclei play a role in this respiratory suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gluckman and Johnston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haddad and Mellins, 1984</xref>) and in the postnatal maturation of hypoxic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bissonnette and Knopp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waters and Gozal, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, it was not known precisely which neurons were important for adaptation to hypoxia.

Mice older than one week were perfused with 4% PFA, after which brains were dissected and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C. Embryonic and P0 brains were directly dissected from pups and dropped fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C. After fixation brains were cryopreserved in 30% sucrose solution in PBS until sunk and frozen in OCT. Frozen sections were cut at 40 µm and kept at 4°C in the dark until used for immunostaining. For immunolabeling sections were first blocked in 5% normal donkey serum, 0.5% Triton-X in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Next, sections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4°C in blocking solution, followed by three washes and secondary labeling for at least two hours at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled using DAPI (1:10,000) and slides were mounted in DAPI-free mounting solution (Vectashield). The following antibodies and their dilutions were used: rabbit anti-cFos (1:5000, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-NK1R (1:2000, Advanced Targeting Systems), mouse anti-Synapsin (1:1000, Synaptic Systems), goat anti-TPH2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-TH (1:200, ImmunoStar), and goat anti-ChAT (1:200, EMD Millipore).

Freely moving mice were placed in whole-body plethysmography chambers (Buxco) through which fresh air was pumped at a basal flow rate of 0.5 L/min. Next, animals were exposed to either room air, hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>), or hypercapnia (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>) for 1 hr.

To test respiratory parameters, weaning age mice (P19-21) were placed in the plethysmography chambers and habituated for at least one hour prior to the experiment. After this habituation period, we recorded twenty minutes of room air breathing to determine the baseline. Next, we exposed animals to nine minutes in either hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>) or hypercapnia (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>). After this chemochallenge, we recorded breathing behavior for another fifteen-minute recovery period in room air. To determine changes in breathing behavior in response to the chemochallenge, we normalized all breathing parameters to baseline values using the following formula: normalized y(t)=y(x)/(average(y(x<sub>baseline</sub>)), where y is the average value of a parameter during any given minute (x) and baseline is minutes one to twenty.</p><p>We used Phonemah three software (DSI) to identify breath waveforms and used custom-written MATLAB (Mathworks) code to derive inspiratory time, expiratory time, and tidal volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Breaths with an inspiration time shorter than 0.03 s or an expiration time longer than 10 s were excluded. Minute long segments in which the average breathing frequency (breaths/min) was higher than 500 were excluded from our analysis to prevent confounds from sniffing or exploring. Tidal volume was adjusted for body temperature as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ray et al., 2011</xref>). Apneas were defined as breaths longer than 0.5 s and at least twice the length of the average of the six surrounding breaths (three previous and three following). Apneas were divided in spontaneous apneas and apneas that were preceded by a sigh (or a sigh in the previous breath). Sighs were defined as breaths with an inspiratory tidal volume 2.5 as big and an inspiratory time 1.25 as long as the previous five breaths. Inter Breath Interval (IBI) irregularity was defined as: IBI irregularity = abs (breath length(n + 1)-breath length(n))/breath length(n). Minute ventilation was defined as the total amount of air breathed per minute (breathing frequency * tidal volume).

Specialized, small pup plethysmography chambers (DSI) were connected to a FinePointe Whole Body Plethysmography Unit with gas switch capability (DSI). The unit provided the pup plethysmograph chambers with a constant 1 L/min airflow and amplified breathing waveforms. P7 (day of birth is P0) animals were placed in the plethysmography chambers and could acclimate for 10 min, followed by 5 min of room air recording and a 5 min gas-challenge (hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>) or hypercapnia (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>, balance N<sub>2</sub>)).</p><p>FinePointe software was used to define breaths and calculate basic breathing parameters. Breaths were defined as followed: (1) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) must be before peak expiratory flow (PEF); (2) expiration or inspiration is less than a couple samples; (3) Rpef, EF50, and Tr can be computed; (4) conditioning coefficient can be computed; (5) MinimumBoxFlowThreshold is larger than 0.005; (6) Start of expiration can be identified on the AC flow waveform. Breaths were rejected if T<sub>V</sub> was smaller than 0.005 ml or larger than 1.0 ml; if T<sub>I</sub> was larger than 0.02 s or twice as large as T<sub>E</sub>; or if inspiratory volume was not within 50% to 150% of the couple expiratory volume. For each minute of breathing recording a rejection index (RINX) was calculated as the percentage of the trace from which individual breaths were defined (length breathing trace used for analysis/one minute * 100%). For our final analysis, we included only those minutes for which the RINX was less than 40%. All animals from which we recorded fewer than three reliable minutes of respiratory rhythms in both room air and during chemochallenge (RINX &lt;40%) were excluded from our analysis. The percentage of animals of each genotype included in the final analysis were similar (23 control mice out of 33 (70%); 12 <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice out of 16 (75%); Chi-Square = 0.133, p=0.7149). RINX of included animals was also similar between genotypes (control mice: 18%; <italic>Atoh1::En1</italic>-CKO mice: 19.8%; t-test, p=0.614). From the included minutes the following parameters were derived: inhalation time, exhalation time, breathing frequency, tidal volume, and minute ventilation.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Jan-Marino Ramirez as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel K Mulkey (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Meike van der Heijden and Huda Zoghbi significantly contributes to our understanding of the role of the parabrachial complex. The parabrachial complex (PBC) is a sensory integration center at the interface between forebrain structures and the brainstem that has long been implicated in respiratory control including serving as a chemotransduction relay station. But, the problem is that this area is very heterogeneous, and most what we know about this area is based on somewhat outdated studies involving often crude lesioning and non-specific electrical or chemical stimulations. This study by van der Heijden and Zoghbi overcomes these limitations by showing <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons in the PBC contribute to central and peripheral chemoreflexes and together with <italic>Atoh1</italic> neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus are essential for survival. The reviewers were very impressed by this study: The experiments are well designed, controlled and the conclusions are generally well founded.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Apneas associated with sighs are mechanistically different from spontaneous apneic events. Indeed, the authors find in different mutants differential effects on the number of sighs versus apneas. Thus, we suggest that central apneas and apneas associated with sighs should be tabulated separately.</p><p>2) The authors should justify why they define apnea as breaths lasting &gt; 0.5s, specially since the apnea on Figure 2A is not that different from baseline. It seems like apneas should be defined for each genotype based on inter-breath interval. While clinicians often use a certain interval without a breath, traditionally, apneas in mice are defined by the prolonged expiratory time relative to baseline (e.g. 4 times the eupneic expiratory time). We don't ask the authors to reanalyze their data, but this should be clarified and discussed.</p><p>3) Of interest are also the downward deflections in the plethysmograph recording (see e.g. Figures 2A, 4A): Were these expiratory efforts that are uncoupled with inspiration? This is just a comment and we don't ask the authors to analyze these downward deflections. But, we are curious to know whether expiration was abnormal in these mice.</p><p>4) The authors note that some genotypes show more irregular breathing compared to control. However, it is not clear to me whether this is a bad thing. For example, high heart rate variability is considered more stable, whereas less variability is associated with ensuing heart problems. If the same is true for respiratory control then further explanation is needed.</p><p>5) Baseline respiratory frequencies are relatively high compared to most mouse strains (PMID: 7977867). Also, the Materials and methods states that frequencies &gt;500 are excluded; however, we would be concerned about anything &gt;250 bpm, because the animals might have been stressed. Can the authors try some controls with extra-long acclimation periods, perhaps in an isolated room and cover the plethysmography chamber to prevent visual distractions? If frequencies are still high, then it would be more convincing that the frequencies that they observed were indeed baseline frequencies. The authors could also consider performing Poincaré analysis of respiratory variability as described (PMID: 26068853) to support the possibility that experiments were performed on quiescent mice.</p><p>6) Caffeine treatment normalized apneas and irregular breathing in <italic>Atoh1<sup>En1</sup></italic><sup>-<italic>CKO</italic></sup> mice but did is also improve life span? This would strengthen the link between irregular breathing and mortality.</p><p>7) The differential effects of caffeine on control and <italic>Atoh1<sup>En1-CKO</sup></italic> suggest differential roles of adenosine signaling. That would be very interesting particularly since adenosine is thought to contribute to respiratory roll-off during hypoxia. In any case, caffeine has been shown to increase baseline breathing and chemoreception in several animals including humans (PMID: 18703176) so we agree with the authors that it is very surprising caffeine decreased respiratory output in control mice: This unusual response could be due to the high baseline frequency. There are certainly also other explanations: caffeine also inhibits A2 receptors, which are excitatory so perhaps this is an A2 dependent effect? The authors should discuss these possibilities. Of course, the authors could also try selective A1 and A2 blockers to test this possibility, but we feel that this would exceed the scope of the present study.</p><p>8) We would appreciate if the authors would also discuss whether they propose that PBC neurons are primary chemosensory neurons or a requisite component of the pathway.</p><p>9) Previous evidence showed that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive PBC neurons are glutamatergic and express calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (PMID: 29103805; PMID: 25424719).

We have run our analysis again and this time we defined apneas are breaths lasting 0.5s and at least 2 times the length of the closest 6 breaths (3 previous breaths and 3 following breaths) (see also essential revision 2). This definition of apnea was used in many previous published papers (PMID: 28831138; PMID: 28392070; PMID: 27194336; PMID: 22653057). We defined apneas associated with sighs as apneas where that breath also met the criteria of a sigh or that were preceded by a sigh or if the prior breath was a sigh. Spontaneous apneas were those not associated with a sigh. We updated Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 6 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should justify why they define apnea as breaths lasting &gt; 0.5s, specially since the apnea on Figure 2A is not that different from baseline.

If the same is true for respiratory control then further explanation is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Irregular breathing is often observed in neonates (PMID: 15050210), patients with Cheynes-Stokes breathing (PMID: 4571351), Rett syndrome patients (PMID: 9452925), and a mouse model for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (PMID: 18198276). High number of apneas can cause a higher interbreath interval irregularity, because the apnea is often at least twice as long as the breath preceding and following the apnea. However, irregularity scores are more sensitive than any kind of automated apnea counter, because it also takes in account breaths that just fail to make a cut-off for the apnea definition but are still remarkably longer than the prior breath. For examples of such breaths, see outlier points in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, particularly in the plot for Trace #340. Abnormalities in chemosensation can cause irregular breathing because of a delayed respiratory response to fluctuating O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels (PMID: 4571351). The irregularity score is thus another measure of in vivo respiratory control that can point to abnormalities in central respiratory control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Baseline respiratory frequencies are relatively high compared to most mouse strains (PMID: 7977867).

We found only highly variable breathing in the conditional knockout mice, likely due to the high occurrence of apneas, most other points fell along the diagonal line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We also generated a cumulative frequency distribution curve, that shows untreated mice breathe at the same frequencies, whereas the CKO mice treated with caffeine breathe faster (left shifted curve) and control mice treated with caffeine breathe slower (right shifted curve). Slower breathing can be perceived as calmer or more acclimated mice. However, the CKO and control mice were always tested at the same time, in cohorts of at least 8 mice, yet the caffeine effect was in the opposing direction for these mice. These data, therefore, represent the same results as what was found in Figure 2— supplement 1, and we decided to show it to reviewers but not to incorporate it in the paper.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38455.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Caffeine had opposing effects on respiratory frequency distributions in <italic>Atoh1<sup>En1-CKO</sup></italic>mice and control littermates.</title><p>(A-D) Poincaré plots of breathing frequency of subsequent breaths plotted as the inter breath interval against subsequent breaths (n vs. n+1).

We have performed similar experiments in mature/adult mice and we found that these mice have a substantially smaller respiratory rate after the acclimation period used for this study (~200 breaths/minute). Furthermore, after acclimating mice for about 30 minutes they appeared quiescent and often asleep, suggesting that this relatively high baseline-breathing rate is a representation of age rather than stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Caffeine treatment normalized apneas and irregular breathing in Atoh1<sup>En1-CKO</sup> mice but did is also improve life span? This would strengthen the link between irregular breathing and mortality.</p></disp-quote><p>Caffeine treatment did not normalize lifespan. Because cerebellar neurons are lacking in these mice, we believe the lifespan is reduced because of impaired coordination and compromised access to food and water. This is stated more clearly now in the text as follows:</p><p><italic>“Atoh1<sup>En1-CKO</sup></italic>mice developed severe ataxia, dystonia and tremor in the second to third week after birth and died shortly after weaning (P22-25), likely, because the motor phenotypes impairs food and water intake.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The differential effects of caffeine on control and Atoh1<sup>En1-CKO</sup> suggest differential roles of adenosine signaling.

We now discuss the difference between A1 and A2 signaling as follows:</p><p>“Caffeine treatment, along with glutamate and substance P, can stimulate endogenously slow respiratory rhythms in rats (Ruangkittisakul et al., 2010); this is thought to be the mechanism by which caffeine reduces apneas of prematurity in newborn infants (Aranda et al., 1977; Natarajan et al., 2007). […] Future studies with specific adenosine agonist and antagonist are needed to elucidate the specific effects of long-term caffeine treatment on respiratory control in neonatal mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) We would appreciate if the authors would also discuss whether they propose that PBC neurons are primary chemosensory neurons or a requisite component of the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that PBC neurons are a requisite component of the pathway. We have clarified this in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Therefore, we propose that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons are an essential component in the chemosensory pathways that relays information from peripheral, and perhaps central, chemosensors to enhance the firing of central chemosensitive and rhythmogenic neurons within the respiratory network.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Previous evidence showed that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive PBC neurons are glutamatergic and express calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) (PMID: 29103805; PMID: 25424719). While we don't ask for additional experiments, it would be helpful to know if these markers overlap with Atoh1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment. We have now included a figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) that shows the overlap of <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons with the substance P receptor NK1R and neuropeptides CGRP and PACAP, that have been implicated in the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory response, respectively. We have discussed this in the text as follows:</p><p>“There are no previous reports that PBC neurons are intrinsically chemosensitive, so these neurons are likely activated by upstream neurons that are chemosensitive. […] Together, these results suggest that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage neurons might be important for respiratory responses through signaling with one or both of these neuro peptides.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) A proposed role of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive PBC neurons is maintenance of airway patency and there is evidence suggesting subsets of PBC neurons project to respiratory motor neurons (PMID: 25424719). However, results presented here (Figure 5) do not support this possibility. These differences should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the findings that PBC neurons might project to respiratory motor neurons. We think that the difference between our findings and the findings of previous studies are caused by the difference in neurons targeted (only <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage vs. the whole PBC population) and because of the projection mapping technique (anterograde mapping based on genetics vs. retrograde mapping based on local injections of Cholera toxin subunit B). We addressed this in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Lastly, our results confirm and extend previous work showing that lesioning the parabrachial nucleus impairs respiratory chemoresponses (Mizusawa et al., 1995; Song and Poon, 2008; 2009) and that the parabrachial nucleus projects to the ventrolateral medulla (Fulwiler and Saper, 1984; Holstege, 1988; Yokota et al., 2015). […] Therefore, we propose that <italic>Atoh1</italic>-lineage PBC neurons are an essential component in the chemosensory pathways that relays information from peripheral, and perhaps central, chemosensors to enhance the firing of central chemosensitive and rhythmogenic neurons within the respiratory network.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The 100% neonatal death in Atoh1 null mice is very interesting. Did the authors observe whether the mice took a breath? Did they turn blue? Clarifying this would be very important for follow up studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this clarification in the text as follows:</p><p>“We have not caught any of these animals alive. Several <italic>Atoh1<sup>dCKO</sup></italic> mice were found dead in the cage on the day of birth. These animals had turned blue and there was no visible milk spot, suggesting that they died of respiratory failure before drinking any milk.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
