The transparency of the mammalian eye provides a noninvasive view of the microvessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system. Despite its clarity, imperfections in the optics of the eye blur microscopic retinal capillaries, and single blood cells flowing within. This limits early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. To break this barrier, we use 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow, in one of the most widely used research animals: the C57BL/6J mouse. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude (0.0002–1.55 µL min<sup>–1</sup>) across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters (3.2–45.8 µm), without requiring surgery or contrast dye. Here, we describe the ultrafast imaging, analysis pipeline and automated measurement of millions of blood cell speeds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45077.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The magical twinkling of the night sky is actually the result of imperfections in Earth's atmosphere. Turbulence in the air distorts the light as it passes through, causing it to bend, which blurs the image. To get a clear picture of distant objects, astronomers use a technique called 'adaptive optics'. Deformable mirrors, controlled by computers, bend the light back to correct the distortion. Now, biologists are borrowing the same technique to take a closer look at the blood vessels of the brain.</p><p>At the moment, functional MRI is one of the most popular imaging techniques for measuring blood flow in the brain. But it can only achieve a resolution of around 1 millimetre, and the tiniest capillaries measure less than a hundredth of a millimetre across. These tiny vessels can be examined surgically, or by injecting dyes into the bloodstream, but these techniques carry a risk. As a result, scientists can only use them in experimental animals.</p><p>One solution is to look at the vessel network in the back of the eye. The retina is part of the brain and, because the eye is transparent, its blood supply is much easier to see. But imperfections in the eye bend light and blur images of the cells, just like the Earth's atmosphere blurs images of the stars. This is where adaptive optics comes in. Using this technique, it becomes possible to see single red blood cells. Combining adaptive optics with high-speed video could allow us to track cells through the whole network of blood vessels in the eye. At the moment, blood flow measurement techniques either focus on the very big vessels, or the very small ones; they cannot get a complete picture of the whole interconnected system.</p><p>Now, Joseph et al. have combined adaptive optics, ultrafast imaging, and a new algorithm to view the whole blood vessel network in the eye of a mouse. The new method can automatically measure single blood cells, even when they are moving at their highest possible speed. It can capture the full range of retinal vessels, from the smallest capillaries to the largest arteries and veins. And, by tracking millions of cells at a time, it can reveal how the pressure wave of the blood changes with each beat of the heart.</p><p>The slightest disruption in blood flow to the brain can cause irreversible damage. So, measuring blood flow is crucial to understanding what happens when things go wrong. This new method is not invasive and uses safe levels of near-infrared light which the retina cannot see, making it safe to use in humans. Joseph et al. have already started their first studies in humans, and the baseline data they have obtained for healthy mice also provides a starting point for comparison with mice with genetic mutations or disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive optics</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>blood

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal neurons have exceptionally high metabolic activity and demand timely and adequate nutrition and waste removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pournaras et al., 2008</xref>). Serving this need, the retinal circulation supplies the bulk of the inner retina with a stratified network of vessels, while the choroidal circulation supplies the photoreceptors. Anatomically, the inner retina is typically fed by a single central retinal artery while return is mediated by the central retinal vein in the holangiotic retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michaelson, 1954</xref>). However, functional characterization of perfusion has been more difficult, especially in the smaller vessels where imaging single blood cells without using invasive foreign dyes requires exquisite spatiotemporal resolution and contrast. Understanding perfusion kinetics at this scale is critical to understanding the entire connected network, especially since blood flow dynamics are tightly linked to physiologically relevant neural loads (neural-glial-vascular coupling). Moreover, studying blood flow at this scale is important to characterize conditions of health and disease which place important constraints on single file blood flow where nutrient delivery and waste product removal take place. In the retina, as in the brain, there is a known linkage between stoppage of blood perfusion and death of neurons. These are manifest not only by transient blockages as seen in branch retinal vein occlusion and central retinal artery occlusion, but also in more insidious diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pournaras et al., 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, the detection of retinal vascular disease in the clinic often comes too late, when either the patient reports vision loss or when structural changes to the vasculature become severe enough to be visualized by clinical ophthalmoscopes. Making matters worse, many vascular diseases of the eye are believed to manifest first in capillaries, which generally evade detailed study due to their microscopic size, thus making early detection in the clinic difficult. Retinal capillaries with single file flow are small, with lumen diameter ranging from 3 to 7 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>). This poses a challenge for conventional imaging systems, such as scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), which do not correct for the aberrations of the eye, and have an optical resolution of 10–13 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhi et al., 2012</xref>). Imaging techniques that can visualize the larger vessels (~10–200 µm) are still faced with the problem that single blood cells (~6–8 µm) are densely packed and exhibit non-parabolic velocity profiles, making an accurate assessment of mean velocity and flow difficult without empirical knowledge of the profile shape. Detecting subtle functional changes to flow becomes exceedingly difficult as the ratio of vessel lumen to RBC diameter decreases, because of the particulate nature of blood flow. Due to the above challenges, a device that can noninvasively study single-cell blood flow dynamics in the full range of retinal vessel sizes in the living body has not yet been demonstrated, in either the mouse or human.</p><p>Studies in larger retinal vessels using Doppler strategies have provided one solution to report bulk velocity. These techniques, like bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry, Fourier domain Doppler optical coherence tomography and others, give objective and label free measurements of blood velocity in large and medium-sized retinal vessels in humans (size definitions in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feke et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riva et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Based on certain assumptions, the Doppler shift can indicate the speed of optical scatterers. However, applying the Doppler approach to small vessels is challenging as there are far fewer blood cells at the capillary level, thereby reducing the Doppler signature. Additionally, left uncorrected, the smallest measurement beam that can be formed is limited by the imperfect optics of the eye (~10–13 µm spot size). This limits the readout of vessels to a comparable size. Such techniques also suffer the consequence of contamination of adjacent vessel signal which may be of opposite direction or speed. Axial contributions from deeper vessels may also contaminate single vessel measurement as retinal vessels above and below the interrogation beam can introduce non-specific signals. Doppler OCT has mitigated this issue to some extent; however, signal-to-noise and lateral resolution still limit the signal readout of absolute velocity or flow to only the large retinal vessels in mice, and large and medium-sized vessels in humans. Towards achieving capillary resolution, OCT angiography (OCTA) has recently revolutionized measures of perfused vs. non-perfused capillaries. However, it does not quantitate blood flow or velocity. Conditions of hyper- and hypo-perfusion are not reported and thus early and subtle functional changes in blood flow may be overlooked and only later structural vessel occlusions visualized in disease.</p><p>In recent years, adaptive optics (AO) ophthalmoscopy has enabled reporting of single blood cell speed in capillaries in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bedggood and Metha, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Roorda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin and Roorda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam and Roorda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tam et al., 2011b</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>), and medium-sized vessels in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>). This has been possible as AO measures and corrects for high order aberrations of the eye, achieving ~1–2 µm lateral resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roorda and Duncan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roorda et al., 2002</xref>). Recent advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guevara-Torres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scoles et al., 2014</xref>) in developing phase contrast approaches has enabled visualization of translucent cell properties, like blood cell rheology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>) and blood vessel wall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sulai et al., 2014</xref>), without the aid of invasive foreign dyes or particles. Recently, we combined this approach with extremely fast camera speeds to resolve densely packed RBCs in single file flow in capillaries (3.2–6.5 µm size) and reported single-blood-cell flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>) without using exogenous contrast agents.</p><p>While the above studies employing adaptive optics have enabled noninvasive measurement of single-cell velocity, measurement of blood flow in the full range of vessel sizes of the mammalian retinal circulation is yet to be achieved. This has partly been a problem of scale as automation is needed to perform quantitative measurements in larger vessels containing hundreds of thousands of blood cells flowing per second. In this study, we provide such a computational approach, thus improving upon seminal adaptive optics strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tam et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>) which used manual velocity determinations, which could take hours to days of analysis time by a human operator. Lengthy analysis times also preclude the use of such techniques in a clinical setting. In this study, we use the living mouse to benchmark the automation of blood velocity data. The mouse is the most widely used laboratory animal, yet there is a paucity of studies providing measures of retinal blood flow in the same. This gap need be addressed as the mouse has been and continues to be used to model human retinal physiology, including blood flow. The challenge of imaging mouse retinal blood flow is attributed to the difficulties of imaging its rather small eye, with even the largest vessels being only a quarter the size of the largest human retinal vessel. Furthermore, as we detail later in this paper, there is wide discrepancy in the normative values of retinal blood flow reported in the few mouse studies that exist. Given the importance of the laboratory mouse, with its completely sequenced genome and many models of disease, characterization of normative blood flow in the complete vascular tree of the healthy C57BL/6J mouse will propagate future research in a vast number of mouse models of retinal disease and systemic vascular disease. Development on quantification of mouse blood flow approaches will be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation.</p><p>In this study, we innovate imaging strategies as well as deploy custom algorithms to image single blood cells noninvasively in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation (lumen diameters: 3.2–45.8 µm); without requiring exogenous contrast agents to facilitate measurement. Measured flow rate per vessel ranged four orders of magnitude (0.0002–1.55 µL min<sup>–1</sup>) across the complete retinal vascular tree, from the largest vessel near the optic disk to the smallest capillary. In addition to aiding basic science investigation, the noninvasive approach provides a comprehensive array of bioreporters of microvascular perfusion, including: cell velocity, lumen diameter, flow rate, single-cell flux in capillaries, pulsatile and cross-sectional flow, and indices of intrinsic temporal and spatial modulations in flow. To our knowledge, we provide the first measurement of cross-sectional blood-cell velocity profile and the first absolute measurement of pulsatile blood-cell velocity in the mouse retina. We also provide the first measures of mean (and pulsatile) velocity and flow rate in medium and small vessels (capillaries) of the mouse retina. We found that there is a heterogenous distribution of velocity, flux and other hemodynamic parameters in vessels of varying generation/size, showing that diameter alone is a poor predictor of microcirculation hemodynamics in the central nervous system. Through the innovations presented in this work, imaging the complete and intact perfusion system of the mammalian retina bridges an important gap in studying perfusion dynamics in deep microvascular beds within the living body. Due to the central nervous system origin of the retina, this method provides a powerful way to noninvasively study microvascular integrity and kinetics in a portion of the living brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Performance, visualization, confirmation and limits of single blood cell velocity determination</title><p>Single blood cells were directly imaged using the confocal mode of AOSLO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). 2D raster video captured at 25 frames per second revealed movement of a dense array of tightly packed RBCs traveling in vessels without requiring contrast agents (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Sequentially capturing 1D line-scans across the same vessel produced a space-time image of moving blood cells with a line resolution of 15 kHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Single cells produce an increase in backscatter providing positive contrast streaks which represent the displacement over time of each cell. Based on the shallowest angle of beam intersection, the maximum velocity that could be measured using this technique was 1275 mm s<sup>–1</sup>, which far exceeds the possible velocities of blood cells in the retinal circulation. Given the liberal range of angles we searched, the velocity bandwidth of the measurements ranged from 0.03 to 1275 mm s<sup>–1</sup>. The Radon transform was able to measure the slope of blood cell streaks within a dense array of overlapping regions of interest (ROIs) in a space-time image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). ROIs with dominant streak orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) produced strong peaks in the Radon sinugram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The angle corresponding to the maximum Radon standard deviation gave the velocity of the cells in the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation. (1)</xref>. As empirical proof of detection accuracy, the measured slope was superimposed on data from a single ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). While this step is not required, it provided augmented visual feedback to the user which assists in velocity determination and provides a visual confirmation step. The context of velocity as a color code could be understood from naïve users and experts alike. From our data, we observed velocities of up to ~100 mm s<sup>–1</sup> which represents the upper limit of blood velocity in the eye corresponding to center-line flow of the largest vessels. The lowest velocity was bounded by the motion correction algorithm which adjusted for small eye motion artifacts. Without motion correction, the lowest velocity observed was 0 mm s<sup>–1</sup> (corresponding to stuck or stationary blood cells). Quality of data was often improved when static features such as the vessel wall and other retinal tissue were removed through a running background subtraction of 10 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which improved signal detection of blood cells. Even with this motion registration step, the lower velocity bound was still &lt;0.03 mm s <sup>–1</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45077.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Noninvasive imaging of single blood cells and their velocity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2D scan pattern of an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) that produces a conventional Cartesian or XY image, shown in B.

(<bold>D</bold>) Successive 1D scans are stacked horizontally to produce a space-time or XT image, a small snapshot of which is shown. The white streaks are single blood cells in motion, imaged label–free. The slope of these streaks gives the velocity of the cells along the 1D (fast) scan direction. Correcting for the angle of intersection between the 1D scan and the vessel gives the absolute velocity of the individual blood cells (equation in bottom right is <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> in text). Visual inspection of the slopes shows that there are fast moving blood cells at the center of the blood column, and slower cells at the edge. ‘Stationary’ objects, like the nerve fiber bundles, vessel wall or other retinal tissues, manifest as near horizontal features, with near-zero velocity (removed in post-processing by background subtraction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Generally, arterioles had a steep leading edge of the velocity waveform whereas venules had a dampened waveform, due to vascular compliance and network hemodynamics upstream and downstream the imaged vessel. Waveforms were analyzed by identifying the peak and trough of the velocity time course corresponding roughly to the systolic and diastolic component of the pressure wave. These control points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) served as a phase reference to produce an ‘average cardiac cycle’ for each vessel, corresponding to 10 s of data. The average pulsatile waveform showed a high degree of repeatability. This is shown by way of example in the small error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> which represents n = 35 cycles averaged in a single arteriole. Using vascular indices described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ5 equ6">Equations 4–6</xref> above, we found that in an arteriole and venule of the same vessel generation, the arteriole had a much higher pulsatility index (PI) consistent with physiology of the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, PI = 0.67 for 25.3 µm arteriole vs PI = 0.18 for 33.5 µm venule).

The motion contrast generated by RBCs revealed a lumen width of 24.8 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The simultaneously acquired fluorescein image confirmed a similar lumen diameter of 25.6 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). The multi-modal images, captured simultaneously, show only a small difference in diameter measurement of +3.1%. These small discrepancies are likely real as there is an expected larger diameter measured from plasma fluorescence, spanning the entire lumen, whereas RBCs are absent near the vessel wall due to the known cell-free zone and glycocalyx. Moreover, differences at this scale are small compared to the optical resolution limit of the AOSLO system (~1 µm lateral resolution). Simultaneous label-free split detection and fluorescein imaging confirm that the label-free approach is a valid marker for vessel lumen width, which is important for clinical imaging as it does not require injected dye. Across all 123 vessels imaged, measured lumen diameter ranged from 3.2 to 45.8 µm, representing the entire range of vessel sizes in the mouse retina. For the 33 arterioles and venules, lumen diameter ranged 8.6–45.8 µm.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45077.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Label-free lumen diameter measurement of microvessel matches conventional fluorescein measurement of the same (both modalities simultaneously collected).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average intensity image of an arteriole using label-free split detection modality.

This shows vascular signatures that would be missed by studying only mean velocity or flow, and without temporally gating the measurement with the cardiac cycle. In a different comparison, A1 and A2 have very similar lumen diameters, in apparent contradiction to that predicted by Murray’s Law for diameters of parent-daughter vessels. However, a closer inspection shows that flow conservation is not violated: A2 has a lower mean velocity and therefore lower mean flow, necessitated by the two small vessels branching out between A1 and A2.

Lengthy analysis times preclude the use of such techniques in a clinical setting. In this study, we report single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels in the living mouse retina. This was enabled by AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to noninvasively image blood cells without foreign contrast agents. Pairing this novel imaging paradigm with an automated analysis workflow enabled high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second.

Pulsatile flow was measured across all retinal vessel sizes, from capillaries to arterioles and venules. This counters the conventional wisdom that capillaries lack pulsatile flow. Quantification of vascular indices like those of pulsatility and profile bluntness across cardiac phases showed utility of measuring subtle temporal and spatial fluctuations of flow, and not just the mean flow, to identify functional signatures that may be disrupted in disease.</p><p>The mouse model, with a completely sequenced genome, has become a widely used tool in medical research in the last two decades.

id="s3-2"><title>Velocity measurement algorithm and its key assumptions</title><p>The custom Radon transform algorithm enabled precise, automated and objective measurements of absolute blood cell velocity from space-time images, including subtle spatio-temporal modulations in velocity which may be missed by subjective evaluation with the unaided human eye. To augment such modulations, that reveal vascular physiology, the algorithm displayed a colored overlay of measured cell slopes, enabling visual comparison to actual slope orientations, and providing visual feedback on measured velocities using a color scale. The small size and dense sampling of the analysis ROIs ensured single-cell measurement of blood velocity, and its subtle modulations due to cardiac pressure wave and cross-sectional flow profile. The non-linear mapping of search angles and velocity ensured that only physiologically relevant angles were searched by the algorithm, reducing computation time while not sacrificing on measurement precision. Thus, while slow moving blood cells were coarsely sampled, fast moving blood cells were sampled finely enough to not miss subtle fluctuations in velocity. Each analysis ROI contains some axial contributions from slower moving blood cells above and below the interrogation beam, as previous studies in humans using similar adaptive optics scanning techniques have rightly identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>). This was mitigated in our study due to two reasons: First, the ~2x NA of the mouse eye gives a ~4x improvement in axial resolution compared to the human eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geng, 2011</xref>). Second, and more importantly, in a given ROI, the velocity reported by our Radon transform analysis is dominated by features with the highest contrast, i.e. the cells at the focal plane. The focal plane bisected the vessel at its widest point.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Utility of measuring particulate flow</title><p>Why measure blood flow at a single-cell level? Measuring flow in vessels whose size is of the order of the size of a red blood cell necessitates measuring cellular scale or particulate flow. The average undeformed size of an RBC is around 6.7 µm in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gulliver, 1875</xref>) and around 8.0 µm in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jay, 1975</xref>), and retinal vessel lumen sizes vary from ~3–46 µm in mice (this study) and ~4–200 µm in humans. In vessels this small, the flow dynamics deviate from simple Newtonian or Poiseuille flow. Our direct cell-by-cell measurement of particulate blood flow opens new possibilities to study flow dynamics in the full range of retinal vessels sizes, enabling detailed study of laminar flow in the larger vessels and the complex nature of non-Newtonian and single blood cell rheology at the level of small capillaries. At the capillary level, this direct measurement is critical as simple diameter-resistance models poorly represent the particulate nature of single-cell blood flow. At this level, the vessels lumen is often the size, if not smaller than the undeformed red blood cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Skalak and Branemark, 1969</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the bio-rheological shear that is observed at this level, measurement of blood flow in vessels of only slightly larger diameter also necessitates consideration of the biphasic nature of blood flow composed of cell and plasma flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Secomb, 2017</xref>). A well-known aspect of such consideration is the aggregation of blood cells in the central portion of the vessel lumen, with a thin cell-free plasma layer next to the vessel walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fåhraeus, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fåhræus and Lindqvist, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hochmuth et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sutera and Skalak, 1993</xref>), first reported by Poiseuille in 1835. The width of the cell-free layer can lie anywhere between 0.4 to 2.1 µm in glass capillaries of size 4.5–9.7 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hochmuth et al., 1970</xref>), depending on blood velocity and not taking into account the 0.4–1.0 µm thickness of the glycocalyx in real capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pries et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vink and Duling, 1996</xref>). In larger vessels of the microcirculation, the layer can be between 0.9 and 5.4 µm in 10–40 µm vessels, depending on hematocrit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fedosov et al., 2010</xref>). The existence of the cell-free layer leads to a non-zero velocity of blood cells closest to the vessel wall, with the plasma velocity presumably sharply decreasing to zero at the vessel wall to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition of fluid flow. One consequence of these effects is a blunted cell velocity profile, considerably deviated from the prediction of a parabolic profile from Poiseuille flow.</p><p>To put the above in the context of our measurements because our measurements are focal and represent single-cell velocity across the vessel cross-section, fewer assumptions are needed to accurately model flow. Examples of this are seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> which removes the assumption of parabolic flow and reports more precise, blunted, plug flow. This is an important distinction of measures of whole blood flow (containing plasma) vs blood cell velocity which is particulate in nature. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, an error of –39% would occur if mean flow was incorrectly calculated by measuring only centerline velocity and assuming parabolic flow. Direct measurement of flow profiles in vessels only a few times wider than an RBC also opens the possibility of measuring shear rate, which is proportional to the ratio of mean velocity and diameter, and wall shear-stress (WSS) which is proportional to the slope of the fluid velocity profile at the vessel wall (or in the cell-free layer, if the slope is constant within the layer). WSS is an indicator of vessel wall health and vascular remodeling/angiogenesis. In disease, disruptions in blood flow and WSS lead to microaneurysms in diabetes and plaque formation in atherosclerosis.</p><p>We measured particulate flow in the retinal vascular tree in two modalities. In vessels with &gt;7 µm diameter, we measured velocity and flow with oblique scanning. In vessels with single file flow (capillaries with &lt;7 µm diameter), we measured flux, velocity and flow, with orthogonal scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to flow rate (µL min<sup>–1</sup>), flux (cells s<sup>–1</sup>) gives a more complete description of nutrient delivery at the level of capillaries, which have heterogenous local hematocrit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cross-sectional blood-cell velocity profile measured for first time in mouse retina</title><p>By measuring particulate flow, we quantified hemodynamic metrics never before measured in the mouse. Mouse retinal vessels are small- the inner diameter of even the largest of them is only about a quarter of that of the largest human retinal vessels. To our knowledge, blood-cell velocity profiles have never been measured in the mouse retina, in any vessel size, because of limitations of imaging resolution. For the same reason, it has always been difficult to quantitatively measure such a profile in small retinal microvessels, in any species. Investigators have used adaptive optics to report velocity profile as a function of cardiac phase in vessels as small as a 72 µm artery in the human retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>). We report the first measurement of velocity profile as a function of cardiac phase in a mammalian retinal vessel as small as 25 µm. This is important since such functional changes become harder to detect as the ratio of vessel lumen to RBC diameter decreases. Furthermore, while the definition of a profile becomes less clear as the vessel diameter approaches that of blood cells, we measured decreased velocity at the edge compared to the vessel center in a vessel as small as 10.2 µm. Measured profiles, even in the largest mouse retinal vessels, were blunted and not parabolic, consistent with a thin cell-depleted layer and the Fåhræus and Fåhræus-Lindqvist effects in the microcirculation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Pulsatile blood-cell flow measured for first time in mouse retinal arterioles and venules</title><p>Beyond spatial dynamics (velocity profile), we measured temporal dynamics in small vessels of the retinal microcirculation. Pulsatility indices in the microcirculation can be biomarkers of diseases like atherosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. Multiple investigators have measured pulsatile flow in the human retinal microcirculation using adaptive optics, including pulsatile leukocyte velocity in human capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin and Roorda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tam et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tam et al., 2011b</xref>), pulsatile erythrocyte velocity in human capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Castro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), and pulsatile erythrocyte velocity in medium-sized human arterioles/venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhong et al., 2011</xref>). Our previous report of pulsatile erythrocyte flux in a 3.6 µm mouse capillary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>) was the first measurement of pulsatile cell flow in a mouse retinal vessel. In the current study, we report pulsatile cell velocity in medium and large mouse retinal vessels for the first time, with much reduced pulsatility index measured in venules, thus connecting the dots and demonstrating direct measurement of pulsatile flow in the complete retinal vascular tree. The lack of observed pulsatile flow in venules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feke et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riva et al., 1985</xref>) and capillaries could be explained by limitations of previous approaches that lacked sensitivity to subtle velocity fluctuations in small vessels. Measurement of pulsatility biomarkers using our approach enables early detection of functional changes in these tiny vessels in microvascular diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Beyond total retinal blood flow - studying complete range of vessel sizes</title><p>In the mouse, the total retinal blood flow (that is, the total supply to the inner retina, obtained by summing the mean flows from all primary arterioles or venules) has been a popular biomarker for evaluating the healthy and diseased retina (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While the total blood supply to the retina is one biomarker of vascular health, changes happening in lower vascular branches in disease may be missed. This particularly becomes a problem when early pathological changes in smaller vessels do not result in changes in bulk flow rate in larger parent vessels, due to either vessel anastomosis or individual changes cancelling out.</p><p>In an interconnected vascular network, a disruption in flow at any point can affect other parts of the network. This basic feature of a flow network is at the root of the difficulty in studying many vascular diseases of the eye. Disruptions in flow at different locations on the vascular tree can have a spectrum of severity and impact on the health of the retina. For example, a disruption at the small capillary level can cause a redistribution of local blood flow. At low severity levels, capillaries adjacent to the affected capillary may be able to share some the increased workload. Such local disruptions at the microvascular level have even been reported in the healthy retina with no known disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schallek et al., 2013b</xref>). As the severity and frequency of such local disruptions increase in disease, a tipping point may be reached when neighboring capillaries can no longer accommodate the extra workload they receive from decreased or no perfusion in affected capillaries. This can lead to a cascade of events where larger vessels that feed and drain these small capillaries begin to have abnormal perfusion and subsequently, structural changes. Such a sequence of events is one hypothesis of the mechanism of progression of diabetic retinopathy. Vascular diseases of the eye can also begin at the level of large arterioles and venules, like in branch retinal vein occlusion, where watershed areas of a large venule are adversely affected. Disruptions at different hierarchies in the retinal vascular system can also have a large temporal bandwidth. Stopped or reduced perfusion in large vessels can have a relatively quick (seconds to minutes) impact on smaller vessels and tissue in the watershed area of the affected vessel. On the other hand, disrupted perfusion at the level of small capillaries can have a slow but severe influence (hours to years) on the rest of the retinal tissue, as is believed to be the case in diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Our approach addresses some of these challenges by using the same imaging instrument to get measures of absolute single–cell blood flow in the smallest to largest retinal vessels in the living retina. This was made possible by using a high bandwidth measurement technique (measurable particle velocities: 0.03 to 1275 mm s<sup>–1</sup>). Imaging techniques with a temporal resolution of even a few hundred frames per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>) are insufficient to track velocity in medium and large retinal vessels. We provide the first normative database of mean velocity and flow rate in vessels other than first generation vessels in the mouse. Investigation of both mean flow rate and spatio-temporal dynamics in multiple vessels generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 and 10</xref>) sets the stage for longitudinal study of the progression of ‘slow’ diseases like diabetes across the complete retinal vascular tree.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Discrepancy in mouse literature in velocity and diameter measurements in first-generation vessels</title><p>The flow through a vessel varies as the square of the inner lumen diameter (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref>), underlining the need for careful measurement of the vessel lumen diameter to get accurate values of flow rate. While investigating the mouse literature for normative values of diameter, velocity and flow in retinal vessels, we found, first, that there is a paucity of such studies. To the best of our knowledge, we have counted all of 15 journal papers which measure retinal blood velocity and/or flow in the living mouse eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muir et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wright and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yadav and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zawadzki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhi et al., 2012</xref>). As stated earlier, all these studies measure velocity/flow only in the primary (first generation) vessels emerging from the optic disk. Studies with objectively reportable values are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (except for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watts et al., 2013</xref>). A graphical summary, classified by imaging technique, is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. In our literature survey, some important points were observed. There is disagreement across previous studies in the values of measured dimeter, velocity and flow of first-generation vessels in the mouse retina. In particular, about half of the studies, which use intravital microscopy, report vessels diameters that are ~2 times greater, mean velocities that are ~2 times greater and mean flow rates that are ~8 times greater than that of all other techniques, including our own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Our values of mean diameter of primary vessels matches that of the <italic>in vivo</italic> slit lamp biomicroscope study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2016</xref>) and is within the range reported by <italic>ex vivo</italic> scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ninomiya and Inomata, 2006</xref>). Our values of mean flow rate matches that reported by en face Doppler OCT/OMAG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhi et al., 2012</xref>). Comparing cited values for the total blood flow rate to the retina shows the island of values formed by all studies in the range of 1.56–3.99 µL min<sup>–1</sup>, in contrast to the range of 25.08–31.80 µL min<sup>–1</sup> reported by intravital microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Early signs of these inconsistencies in the mouse literature was first reported in 2014 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernabeu et al. (2014)</xref> (in a table in their publication). We do not know exactly why such inconsistency exists. While the mouse strain, age and gender differences across studies could contribute to variability, it is unlikely to be the only cause of the large differences in measured values. Using incorrect image magnification on the mouse retina is one possible source of the disparity in measured diameters. Secondly, for mean velocities in primary vessels, intravital microscopy studies used fluorescent microspheres or labelled RBCs, with 10–30 measurements from sparse fluorescent streaks pooled to average out effects of pulsatile and cross-sectional profile variability. The sparse and too few measurements have the potential to under or overestimate the true mean velocity, by either being biased toward particular cardiac phases, or if the incompressible microspheres travel in preferred radial locations in the vessel lumen. Additionally, imaging techniques with insufficient axial resolution can misrepresent diameter, velocity, and flow due to contamination of signal from deeper vessels of the stratified retinal vascular layers. In our study, with ~1 µm <italic>in vivo</italic> lateral resolution and ~10 µm axial resolution, sub-micron correction of eye motion blur, and sampling of all cardiac phases with extremely fast (15 kHz) scanning, we were able to report true mean velocities in these microvessels.

Near the optic nerve head, vessels which are not parallel to the imaging plane can cause errors in flow measurement. This concern is mitigated by restricting our imaging to retinal locations &gt; 170 µm (&gt;5° field of view) from the center of the optic disk. First to n<sup>th</sup> generation vessels are largely in plane at these locations. For any remaining non-parallelism at these retinal eccentricities, we provide the following error quantification. For a diving vessel which forms angle γ with the focal plane, there will be an underestimation of velocity, by a factor of |1 – cos(γ)|. This error is small for small values of angle γ. For example, for γ = 5°, measured velocity will be underestimated by 0.38% of the actual value. For reference, the error is &lt;1% for angles (γ) up to 8.1°. Because the architecture of retinal vessels is predominantly planar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paques et al., 2003</xref>), we believe that our technique is well suited to study the complete retinal network, with a potentially lower measurement error.</p><p>A limitation of our study is the requirement to sequentially track flow in each vessel. While the maximum field of view of our system of 5° enables tracking flow in up to two first-generation vessels simultaneously, and up to five capillaries on the other end of the size spectrum, we tracked flow on a vessel by vessel basis in this study to maximize the pixel density and measurement SNR on each vessel. A remaining challenge of our study is the current inability to track velocity in all first-generation vessels around the optic disk, because of the requirement of an optimal (~5–45°) angle between the vessel and the 1D scanning beam. While a partial solution for this was implemented by having an additional rotational degree of freedom on the mouse stage, which enable rotating the mouse head and thus the view of the retina by ±30°, vessels which were near orthogonal to the scanning beam still remained challenging to image. Future work will look at optically rotating the beam so that all vessels around the optic disk can be measured to give a more precise value of total blood flow. We refrained from using the theoretical Poiseuille flow relationships (flow ∝ diameter<sup>3</sup> or flow ∝ diameter<sup>4</sup>) to predict flow based on lumen diameter of the first-generation vessels in which velocity could not be measured. Our data shows that for the most populous vessels of the mammalian eye, which are tens of microns wide or less, diameter alone is not an accurate predictor of flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we have demonstrated that eye motion minimally impacts our blood velocity measurements in the anesthetized mouse. However, rapid and saccadic eye motion in both the awake behaving mouse and the human being will pose a challenge to our line-scan technique. Such a challenge can be mitigated by restricting the analysis window to epics of relatively low eye motion (gating out saccades/blinks). Only a few seconds of such line-scan data is needed from each vessel to get a reliable measurement of an array of hemodynamic biomarkers. Even 2–4 s of contiguous data will cover multiple cardiac cycles in the human, and our automated algorithm will be able to report velocities from hundreds of thousands of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p>This study has shown that we can noninvasively study an array of functional biomarkers in mouse retinal blood vessels of size 3–46 µm, without using exogenous fluorophores.

The brain is optically inaccessible with high resolution, especially for studying flow in microscopic vessels. Functional imaging of the brain can today only be done with a resolution of a few millimeters, like in fMRI and other techniques, by reporting bulk changes in blood flow as an indirect measure of neuronal activity. The transparency of the eye and it being a part of the CNS makes it a good location to study the behavior of blood flow in a neuronal tissue with high metabolic demand. The optical opacity of the brain and scattering in its tissue requires investigation of its microvasculature to need thinned-skull preparations and fluorescent labeling of either plasma or RBCs for measurement of both velocity and lumen diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drew et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleinfeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaffer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shih et al., 2012</xref>). It is also worth mentioning important studies in the rat retina which have achieved measurement of blood flow in a large spectrum of vessel sizes/orders, using fluorescently labeled red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kornfield and Newman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornfield and Newman, 2015</xref>). While all the above techniques have made important advances in our understanding of microcirculation in neural tissues, the use of exogenous blood contrast agents raises the concern of maintenance of natural blood perfusion, especially at the capillary level. Furthermore, such invasive techniques cannot be applied to humans. We have shown recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>) that with label-free adaptive optics imaging, improved contrast of single blood cells can be achieved in the retina, compared to contrast of dye labeling techniques, especially in high flow conditions. Our method of noninvasively studying the retina may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the CNS.</p><p>The eye may also serve as a window to systemic microvascular health. Vascular diseases like diabetes, atherosclerosis and hypertension are known to impact the microscopic vessels of the body. These tiny vessels often elude <italic>in vivo</italic> study because of their small size, especially in optically inaccessible areas of the body like the heart, kidneys and other internal organs. Our current study of microvessels in the eye opens the door to indirectly studying systemic microvascular disease by peering into the eye.

At two of the pupil planes in this relay system, a slow 25 Hz galvometric scanner (VM2500+, General Scanning, GSI Group Corp., Massachusetts, USA) and a fast 15 kHz resonant scanner (SC30: 15K, Electro--Optical Products Corp., Glendale, New York, USA) scanned the illumination point spread function (PSF) in orthogonal directions, forming an <italic>en face</italic> rectangular imaging raster on the retinal image plane. The field of view in the two orthogonal directions could be independently changed to vary between 0.5 and 6.2 degrees, and all images were digitized into 640 × 480 pixels with 8–bit grayscale depth. A third pupil plane consisted of a large-stroke high-speed deformable mirror (DM97-15, ALPAO, Montbonnot-Saint-Martin, France) which corrected for low and high order monochromatic aberrations of the eye in real time, measured by a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor. The deformable mirror also provided programmable defocus control which enabled focusing the imaging beam on a vascular layer of interest in the retina without using additional optics. The light reflected from the retina followed a similar path as the light into it, and in the detection arm was spectrally split into a near infrared and visible channel to be finally imaged onto photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) (H7422–40 and H7422–50, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka-Ken, Japan) through confocal pinholes (size given below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> lateral and axial resolution</title><p>The confocality of our imaging system provided tight axial sectioning of the retina by rejecting out of focus light, enabling tight focusing on only the retinal vascular layer of interest (superficial, intermediate or deep) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schallek et al., 2013a</xref>).

Adapting their measured results by linearly scaling for our imaging wavelengths, the measured <italic>in vivo</italic> lateral resolution of our system is 1.2 µm (for 796 nm reflectance imaging) and 0.77 µm (for 520 nm fluorescence emission), giving near diffraction limited imaging <italic>in vivo</italic>. The measured axial resolution is 16.1 µm (for 796 nm reflectance imaging) and 10.5 µm (for 520 nm fluorescence emission). A pinhole of size 2.1 and 4.9 Airy disk diameters in the infrared and visible channels optimized the trade-off between light collected and axial sectioning achieved. The optical point spread function (PSF) size is smaller than the 6.7 µm average size of an undeformed mouse RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gulliver, 1875</xref>). Combined, these imaging capabilities enabled single blood cell resolution as they flowed in both tight and sparsely packed formations inside microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>). All flowing cells were imaged noninvasively with near infrared backscatter, without the need for foreign dye injections. Furthermore, this detailed resolution enabled sub-micrometer precision when measuring the lumen diameters of retinal vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Types of blood vessels studied</title><p>In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied. Of these, 18 were primary vessels emerging from optic disk (1<sup>st</sup> generation vessels), 15 were vessels spanning generations of 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> branch order in the retina and 90 were single file flow capillaries. A lumen diameter less than 7 µm was used to categorize a vessel as a capillary, as vessels with lumen diameter below the 6.7 µm undeformed size of a mouse RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gulliver, 1875</xref>) are expected to have single-file flow and facilitate cell deformation that is characteristic of capillary exchange vessels. Using this criterion, lumen diameters of capillaries ranged from 3.2 to 6.5 µm. Of the vessels <underline>&gt;</underline> 7 µm, 25 were arterioles and eight were venules. Arterioles and venules were identified by inspecting their space-time images to determine direction of flow to or away from the optic disk, as described in detail later. Their lumen diameters ranged from 8.6 to 45.8 µm. Taken together, the range of vessel diameters spanned 3.2–45.8 µm, comprising the smallest to largest vessels in the mouse retinal circulation. Capillaries studied belonged to one of three retinal vascular layers. Arterioles and venules studied were predominantly restricted to the superficial vascular layer. In arterioles and venules, lumen diameter, pulsatile velocity and flow were measured using oblique angle scanning (described below). In capillaries, average cell velocity and average flow rate was measured using orthogonal scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and described later), supplementing the lumen diameter and cell flux reported in single-file-flow capillaries in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For the mouse, we define ‘large’ vessels as first generation vessels near the optic disk, that is vessels that have not yet branched in the retinal plane (diameters: 45.8 to 20.1 µm). We define ‘medium-sized’ vessels as vessels from second generation and higher, which do not contain single-file-flow (diameters: 20.1 to 7 µm). Small vessels are defined as vessels which have single-file-flow, that is capillaries (diameters: 7 to 3 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>). The average undeformed size of a mouse RBC (6.7 µm) is used as a bio-inspired threshold to identify single-file-flow vessels from others. Conceptually, the above definitions also hold true for the human retina, though the largest human retinal vessels are about four times larger than the largest mouse retinal vessels, to accommodate perfusion for a much greater retinal area. By these definitions, seminal laser Doppler and Doppler OCT studies have measured mean velocity down to ‘medium-sized’ vessels in the human retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riva et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>2D raster imaging for vessel geometry</title><p>AOSLO retinal imaging was performed using near infrared illumination (796∆17 nm, 200–500 µW at cornea) and detection of backscattered/reflected light.

The largest retinal vessels, however, dive into the optic disk. Therefore, when imaging primary arterioles and venules emerging from the optic disk, imaging location was between ~170 and 300 µm from the center of the optic disk.

Briefly, the slow galvometric scanner was stopped at a position such that only the fast one-dimensional (1D) scan imaged the vessel at 15 kHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This 1D scan was placed oblique to the vessel of interest, to determine single-cell velocity in the smallest to largest arterioles and venules in the mouse retina. The mouse head was rotated such that the 1D line passed beyond edge to edge of the obliquely oriented vessel, and such that the angle of intersection between 1D scan and vessel axis was between 6 and 43° (angle ϕ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). This angle was positioned manually by the experimental operator and was quantitatively confirmed in post processing using a custom angle determination algorithm based on the Radon transform (strategy discussed in detail below). The plane of focus was kept at the same focus as the 2D scan. The 1D field of view was positioned to traverse the entire luminal diameter whereby least two-thirds of the imaging field covered the vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The 1D line ranged from 1.2 to 6.2 ° of visual angle (corresponding to 40.8–210.8 µm on the retina). To determine conversion of pixels to physical retinal coordinates, we used a Ronchi ruling with known grating period and a conversion of 34 µm per degree field of view in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmucker and Schaeffel, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>De-warping, correction of eye motion and background removal in retinal images</title><p>Both 1D and 2D data were non-linearly distorted in the fast scan direction due to the sinusoidal nature of the 15 kHz resonant scanner. Video frames were de-warped (or de-sinusoided) in real time using previously published technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). 2D retinal motion was corrected in post-processing using image cross-correlation. Such an approach has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubra and Harvey, 2010</xref>). The registered video stack was averaged, giving a high signal-to-noise 2D raster image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only motion in the direction of the fast scanner could be corrected in 1D images as there was no structural information in the orthogonal dimension. In each line-scan sequence lasting 1–10 s, the space-time image was parsed into single time strips ~ 40 ms each. Eye motion in the anesthetized mouse has been previously confirmed to be small in this time regime, relative to blood cell motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>). A reference strip was manually selected based on vessel centration and lack of motion. For continuous eye motion detection, normalized cross correlation was performed between a reference strip and overalpping target strips, each 40 ms wide, separated by one pixel each (66 µs). The positional shift of each continuous 40 ms time epoch provided a registration signal in the fast scan axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Static features such as the vascular wall are manifest as ‘horizontal’ lines in space-time images which represent zero velocity. To remove this signal which could confound blood cell analysis, an intensity moving average of the space-time image was computed in the time dimension with a large time window of ~10 ms. This strategy is a high-pass temporal filter, where velocities slower than 0.03 mm s <sup>–1</sup> are removed via running background subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Velocity measurement from 1D line-scan data (oblique scanning)</title><p>1D scanning data was recorded for 1–10 s per vessel to capture multiple cardiac cycles.

To compare those measurements with flow rate (µL min<sup>–1</sup>) measurements of larger vessels in this current study, we measured the average cell velocity from 1 s long space-time images of 90 capillaries captured with split detection phase contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). To determine cell velocity, cell locations were marked and were phase registered to produce an ‘average cell’. The temporal width of this average cell was used to report average capillary velocity using the equation reported by us previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guevara-Torres et al., 2016</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ8"><label>(8)</label><mml:math id="m8"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where ∆t is the temporal width of the average cell, and d is the average length of RBCs along the direction of flow.

To confirm the label free measurement represented the true lumen diameter of the arterioles and venules, diameter was also measured simultaneously using conventional fluorescein contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>,~50 µW of 488 nm excitation, 520∆35 nm emission). For diameter measurement, the vessel axis orientation was determined using the Radon transform. Multiple 5 µm strips orthogonal to the length of the vessel were analyzed for diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). For arterioles and venules, the average diameter was reported from 2 to 31 five-micron strips along the length of the vessel. Lumen diameter measured distance between vascular walls in split detection images, corresponding to half-height points in the split-detection intensity image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Independently, the standard deviation (SD) image that computes pixel variance over time revealed the erythrocyte column by way of motion contrast. Lumen edges were measured as the inner boundary of the motion contrast image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). For lumen measures using sodium fluorescein, lumen edges were identified as the half-height points, using the peak intensity of the profile as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p>The three reviews are included in this letter as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. In particular, reviewer #2 raises important questions about the validation of the automated algorithm. We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a range of suggestions for improving the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have used AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to image blood cells in the full range of blood vessels in the eyes of anesthetized mice. Automated analysis enabled measurement of thousands of blood cells per second. The study is important because it provides the measurements in a normal mouse for future comparison with measurements in mice with retinal diseases. I do not have the expertise to validate all the methods, equations, and calculations used to generate the data- hopefully you have selected other reviewers equipped to do so. Assuming that validation occurs, the potential value of the normative database and the comparison with future measurements in diseased eyes is large and worthy of publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors present an impressive system for measuring hemodynamics across a range of blood vessel sizes in the living mouse eye. This study combines approaches from technical instrumentation, computer algorithm development with application to mouse and vascular biology. This type of approach is likely to be influential in the field of retinal imaging.</p><p>The AOSLO system seems to have been previously developed and there is limited improvement on the technical instrument. The novelty of the work stems from development of automated computer algorithms and in the novel dataset of mouse hemodynamics that was generated. To this end the primary concern is that the automated algorithm was not fully or properly validated, so it is difficult for the reader to assess how accurate the algorithm truly is. There should be some comparison to ground truth or other systematic careful validation to show that the automated results are sound.

Currently, the study design is difficult to follow as it seems to be a blend of cross sectional and longitudinal imaging (or if not it is very ambiguous). This should be clarified through the use of supplementary tables. Given that this data was collected over a period of 3 years (2014-2017), there needs to be supplementary tables that clearly lay out the number and type of mouse used for each analysis as it is very difficult to assess how many mice were used in each section of the paper.</p><p>In the introduction, the authors should more clearly motivate why an in vivo mouse system needs to be developed as it seems that similar techniques could or have already been developed for the human eye, so that it seems backwards to go from human back to mouse.</p><p>Generally, a description of limitations should be more clearly emphasized. A key item missing is a quantitative assessment of error and sources of error including what, if any, the effect of vessels not staying in the same focal plane might have. Near the optic nerve head, the vessels dive down through the retinal layers and this could have an effect on speed measurements. Carefully quantifying the expected error and propagating it through the measurements would be helpful as part of the validation process that is missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The retinal microcirculation provides a unique possibility to observe the microcirculation noninvasively in animals and humans. Such observation is performed through the lens of the eye, which has imperfect optical properties, limiting the resolution that can be achieved. In this work, the authors show how the use of adaptive optics, a technique pioneered in for use in astronomy, can lead to imaging of red blood cell motion in vessels from the primary vessels at the optic disk down to the level of capillaries. This is a significant technical advance, with potentially high impact on the studies of retinal microcirculation for research and clinical applications. Although the emphasis is on the method, the quantitation of mouse retinal hemodynamic parameters presented here provides baseline data that will be useful for future work. The presentation of the work is clear and thorough (if perhaps a little verbose at times).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45077.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have used AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to image blood cells in the full range of blood vessels in the eyes of anesthetized mice.

An artificial dataset could also be used in which the authors simulate velocities and velocity changes from empirical data and establish that their algorithm can properly detect these changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We largely agree with reviewer #2 that a complete validation would provide indisputable evidence of the algorithm accuracy. While we address precision, accuracy is a challenging problem that requires a “ground truth” data set. There are substantial challenges with this request, nevertheless, we provide the following response:</p><p>1) A true “ground truth” data set showing biological single cell velocity does not exist for the living eye. Moreover, we feel that our approach is a major step forward in accomplishing this goal. No such biological dataset with validated velocities exist to our knowledge.</p><p>2) Despite lack of biological ground truth, we provide a mathematically complete set of equations (Equations 1-9) with corresponding instruction of how those equations are used to measure velocity. In this way, a mathematically inclined researcher can directly apply our strategy to test validity of these approaches. In the spirit of <italic>eLife</italic> communication, we provide a complete work flow and also provide fully documented source code for all our calculations. All assumptions and variables are declared in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) While “ground truth” datasets do not exist, we do go through sufficient length to compare our velocity measures against an exhaustive list of other imaging modalities that report flow and velocity in the mouse. Table 1 of our paper shows a survey of the studies that use intravital microscopy, Doppler OCT and OMAG OCT to determine blood flow in the mouse (Figure 11). In absence of ground truth (which notably was also lacking in all of the aforementioned studies), we find that our solution converges on similar measures of blood velocity and total vessel flow providing an additive reassurance that the approach is sound. Additionally, our <italic>in vivo</italic> blood vessel diameters (necessary to compute flow) are confirmed with a number of previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in the mouse. There is one notable discrepancy in diameter reporting in the literature, and thus we confirmed our measure with the histological gold-standard of scanning electron microscopy. We discuss in our manuscript the similarities (and also discrepancies) of our values against a fairly complete survey of relevant previous literature in the mouse retinal circulation.</p><p>After consideration of the above, we recognize that arguments 1-3 are somewhat passive to the specific request of ground truth. We have addressed this question of ground truth head-on in a tandem manuscript that is being submitted to Journal of Computational Neuroscience. In this tandem publication, we produce a data phantom that simulates single blood cells moving in a vessel. In this case, the true velocity of single particles is known and can be systematically varied to test algorithm performance at varying speeds. In brief, our Radon algorithm recovers the velocity with high degree of accuracy against the known and masked phantom values (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9991).</p><p>We hope that reviewer #2 and the editors will agree that this analysis is best suited for a separate publication as Materials and methods, Results, Discussion and interpretation would add to an already long 40-page manuscript under consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. In our opinion, inclusion of this detailed analysis clutters our current manuscript and detracts from the central purpose of sharing this novel (and complete) framework with our peers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overall organization of the article be improved so that the most relevant results are presented first followed by Discussion and Materials and methods at the end of the paper.

We include additional descriptions of the errors, assumptions and limitations of the approach, which are consolidated in one section in the revised article (reproduced below). In addition to the text provided, we directly address that the retinal circulation in the mouse, outside of the optic disk, is largely in plane with the en face imaging plane (Paques et al., 2003) (unlike the neocortex, where vessels are highly non-planar). Therefore, the error associated is expected to be small, especially when compared to the physics of how a Doppler signal is generated. For example, laser and ultrasound Doppler measure the axial component of velocity, and the en face plane of a majority of retinal vessels provides a relatively weak Doppler signature.</p><p>Upon this helpful suggestion, we quantify the error and discuss in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Our technique measures the component of blood velocity parallel to the en face imaging plane. […] Because the architecture of retinal vessels is predominantly planar (Paques et al., 2003), we believe that our technique is well suited to study the complete retinal network, with a potentially lower measurement error.”</p><p>We contrast this to the error in some Doppler techniques, where the measurement signal arises from the diving/rising component of velocity (which is orthogonal to the velocity component measured in our technique). Therefore, the measurement error is equal to |1 – sin(γ)| for techniques which measure the out-of-plane velocity component. For this reason, many such techniques are most accurate at positions where vessels are not en face, often closer to the optic disk, where the diving/rising angle (γ) is as high as possible.</p><p>Additionally, further discussion is provided in the subsection “Velocity measurement algorithm and its key assumptions”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
