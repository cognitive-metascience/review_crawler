Most terpenoid natural products are known from plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), but bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickschat, 2016</xref>) and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt-Dannert, 2015</xref>) are also rich sources. Recently we have shown that dictyostelid social amoebae, a class of eukaryotic soil microorganisms, also have the genetic capacity to produce monoterpenes (C<sub>10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C<sub>15</sub>) and diterpenes (C<sub>20</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Dictyostelid social amoebae have a unique life cycle, consisting of both unicellular and multicellular phases. When their bacterial food supply becomes scarce, amoebae start to aggregate, going through clearly-defined morphological changes to eventually form fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kessin, 2001</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and <italic>D. purpureum</italic> are among the most extensively investigated species of dictyostelid social amoebae. Our recent studies illustrated that the multicellular stages of the life cycle of both <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>D. purpureum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) are characterized by the emission of a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds that is dominated by sesquiterpenes. While some terpenoids are produced by both species, most appear to be species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The biological function of these terpenoids is completely unknown.</p><p>The <italic>D. discoideum</italic> genome contains nine full-length genes (<italic>DdTPS1-9</italic>) encoding terpene synthases, the pivotal enzymes that create the terpenoid carbon skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christianson, 2017</xref>). All nine genes are expressed during the multicellular stage, suggesting a role for volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in fruiting body development. Indeed, biochemical characterization of the encoded proteins DdTPS1-9 revealed terpene synthase activity for all tested enzymes. The sesquiterpene products of DdTPS1-4, DdTPS6, DdTPS7 and DdTPS9, as well as the diterpene product of DdTPS5, could be detected in the volatile bouquet of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> during multicellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rabe et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rinkel et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>D. discoideum</italic> also released the monoterpene linalool that was produced by several recombinant terpene synthases including DdTPS2, DdTPS3 and DdTPS9, suggesting that at least one of these enzymes functions as a monoterpene synthase in vivo. In brief, the in vitro products of all DdTPSs except DdTPS8 could be detected in the volatile bouquet of <italic>D. discoideum</italic>.</p><p>DdTPS8 has sesquiterpene synthase activity, but does not produce mono- or diterpenes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>DdTPS8</italic> exhibits the second highest level of expression among all nine <italic>DdTPS</italic> genes during development, so it was surprising to see that the major sesquiterpene product of <italic>DdTPS8</italic> was not detected in the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that the product of DdTPS8 serves as a substrate for other enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s (CYPs). CYPs are heme-containing proteins that catalyze a wide variety of oxidative reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coon, 2005</xref>), often on terpenoid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamberger and Bak, 2013</xref>). In this context it is interesting to note that the profile of volatiles emitted by <italic>D. discoideum</italic> contains a number of unknown compounds that are candidates for derivatives of the DdTPS8 product. Here we present conclusive evidence that the DdTPS8 sesquiterpene product is modified by a CYP that is physically clustered with DdTPS8 on chromosome six and produces a novel trisnorsesquiterpene named as discodiene. A <italic>DdTPS8</italic>-knockout mutant of <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, which failed to produce discodiene, showed slower progression in development than the wild type strain. This raises interesting questions about the specific biological role of discodiene as one constituent of a bouquet of volatiles produced by <italic>D. discoideum</italic> during its development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The product of DdTPS8 is the new sesquiterpene alcohol discoidol</title><p>DdTPS8 had been shown to have sesquiterpene synthase activity in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), but the structure of its product was not identified.

Their conversion by the discoidol synthase resulted in enantioselectively deuterated discoidol with known absolute configuration at the deuterated carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The absolute configuration of discoidol was then deduced by assignment of the relative orientation of the two hydrogen atoms at C2 by NOESY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The additional <sup>13</sup>C-NMR label at this carbon was used for a highly efficient analysis by HSQC spectroscopy, giving an intensive cross-peak for the attached hydrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A protonation-induced second cyclization results in cation 1, that upon a 1,2-hydride shift to cation 2, 1,2-methyl group migration to cation three and deprotonation reacts to form discoidol. This mechanism was experimentally supported by a series of incubation experiments using isotopically labeled substrates. The reprotonation of hedycaryol was demonstrated by incubation of (6-<sup>13</sup>C)FDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rabe et al., 2015</xref>) with discoidol synthase in a deuterium oxide enriched buffer, resulting in a triplet in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of the product cation 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that indicated a direct <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>2</sup>H connection.

The 1,2-hydride shift from cation 1 to cation two was followed with (3-<sup>13</sup>C,2-<sup>2</sup>H)FDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klapschinski et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in a triplet for C4 of discoidol that demonstrated a direct <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>2</sup>H bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, the stereochemical fate of the terminal geminal methyl groups of FDP was followed with (12-<sup>13</sup>C)FDP and (13-<sup>13</sup>C)FDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rabe et al., 2015</xref>), showing a stereospecific incorporation of labeling into discoidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A <italic>DdTPS8</italic> knockout mutant of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> lacks discoidol and a putative discoidol metabolite</title><p>The absence of the DdTPS8 product discoidol in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> culture coupled with the high level of expression of the corresponding gene, suggested that discoidol is produced but further modified in vivo. If this hypothesis holds true, the disruption of discoidol biosynthesis would abolish the biosynthesis of the modified product as well. Therefore, we analyzed a <italic>D. discoideum</italic> mutant in which <italic>DdTPS8</italic> was disrupted by an insertion of a blasticidin resistance cassette between nucleotides 544 and 545 of the <italic>DdTPS8</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which was verified by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, the fragment ion at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 59 observed in the mass spectrum of discoidol (indicative of its 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group) was missing, suggesting that the degradation may have affected this portion of the molecule. There are two plausible hypotheses for the reaction catalyzed by CYP521A1 that would be consistent with the observed mass spectrum of the trisnorsesquiterpene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reactive iron-oxo species of the cytochrome P450 could initiate the degradation reaction by hydrogen abstraction from the carbon originating from C-9 of FPP with formation of a stabilized allyl radical or from C-1 of FDP leading to a less stable radical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The radical intermediate then can react in the oxygen rebound by the cleavage of acetone and formation of water, resulting in different C = C double bond positions in the C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>18</sub> product. To confirm the loss of the 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group and to distinguish between the alternative products, an incubation experiment with (11-<sup>13</sup>C,1,1-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>)FDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rinkel et al., 2016</xref>) was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This substrate was converted into (11-<sup>13</sup>C,6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>)−<bold>1</bold> by the discoidol synthase and degraded by CYP521A1 into a product with a mass spectrum showing the loss of the <sup>13</sup>C label from the 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but retaining both deuterium atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result is consistent with the mechanism that leads to a product with a conjugated double bond system, but not with the mechanism that would result in a product with the non-conjugated double bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The tentatively identified compound is a new natural product for which we propose the name discodiene. A full structure elucidation of discodiene by NMR spectroscopy was not possible, because of the poor conversion of discoidol by CYP521A1.

Comparing their morphologies, the mutant and the wild type developed well on black filters for the first few hours and there were no differences between them. However, a difference was observed after 16 hr of starvation: the multicellular development of the mutant was delayed compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At this time point, the wild type cells formed fingers, whereas the mutant was mainly at the tipped aggregate stage. At 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the wild type began to transition from fingers into so-called ‘Mexican hats’, so a mix of the two stages was observed, while the mutant was delayed at the finger stage. It is also worthwhile noting that the mutant fingers were slightly elongated and narrower compared to the wild type. At 24 hr, the wild type began entering the culmination stage, which involves complex cell movements to form a ball of spores carried on top of a cellular stalk. However, the mutant was still mostly at the finger stage with some Mexican hats visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We also present evidence that the biosynthesis of discodiene has an effect on multicellular development of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The successful determination of CYP521A1 as discodiene synthase relied on a number of lines of evidence. First, it was clear that the sesquiterpene product of DdTPS8, discoidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), does not accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and thus must be further modified after formation. Second, chemical profiling of the <italic>DdTPS8</italic> knockout mutant of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> in comparison to the wild type suggested that discoidol is converted into a degradation product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Third, coexpression analysis and colocalization in the genome implicated <italic>CYP521A1</italic> as the top candidate that acts downstream of <italic>DdTPS8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Fourth, enzyme assays confirmed that cytochrome CYP521A1 converts discoidol into a trisnorsesquiterpene that was tentatively identified by an isotopic labeling strategy as discodiene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the same compound that is produced by the wild type <italic>D. discoideum</italic> but not the DdTPS8 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>DdTPS8 is a microbial terpene synthase that shares many mechanistic features of other typical plant terpene synthases, such as a protonation-induced cyclization of a neutral intermediate, a 1,2-hydride shift and a methyl group migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degenhardt et al., 2009</xref>). DdTPS8 catalyzes the formation of a new sesquiterpene alcohol, discoidol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is interesting to note that the most closely related terpene synthase in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, DdTPS4, also forms a sesquiterpene alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). However, the product of DdTPS4, (<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol, is an acyclic compound in contrast to the cyclic product of DdTPS8. Based on evolutionary relatedness, the encoding genes can be inferred to have arisen from a gene duplication event. It will be interesting to determine the mechanism underlying the functional divergence of DdTPS4 and DdTPS8 in forming acyclic and cyclic sesquiterpene alcohols, respectively. It is also interesting to note that a stereoisomer of discoidol known as jinkoh-eremol has been previously isolated from an agarwood (<italic>Aquilaria</italic> sp.), a eudicotyledon flowering plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakanishi et al., 1983</xref>). Since the biosynthesis of jinkoh-eremol in agarwood is most likely catalyzed by typical plant terpene synthases, which are only distantly related to the microbial type terpene synthases that include <italic>D. discoideum</italic> TPSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 2016</xref>), convergent evolution has occurred in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and plants for the biosynthesis of similar terpenes. Such convergence has been previously reported, as in the recent discovery that the fungal diterpene phomopsene is the product of a bacterial terpene synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lauterbach et al., 2018</xref>). However, bacterial terpene synthases are frequently observed to make the opposite enantiomers of terpenes found in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rabe et al., 2016a</xref>), which clearly points to different evolutionary origins in these cases.</p><p>Discodiene, the degradation product of discoidol, is a novel trisnorsesquiterpene natural product. Another important member of this group is geosmin, a particularly widespread compound in soil microorganisms that exhibits the smell of earth. While it was initially speculated that geosmin may be formed by oxidation of a terpene synthase product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spiteller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cane and Watt, 2003</xref>), it became later evident from feeding experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickschat et al., 2005</xref>) and characterization of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>) that a bifunctional terpene synthase catalyzes the formation of this compound involving initial cyclization to an enantiomer of hedycaryol followed by a second cyclization and oxidative cleavage of a 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl unit. Trisnorsesquiterpenes with loss of the same 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl unit as in discodiene have been reported from the myxobacterium <italic>Chondromyces crocatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>) and from streptomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Citron et al., 2012</xref>), but the enzymology and mechanism of their formation are unclear. Oxidative dealkylations such as the reaction catalyzed by CYP521A1 converting discoidol into discodiene are known from a few other cytochrome P450s, including angelicin synthase (CYP71AJ4) from <italic>Ammi majus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larbat et al., 2009</xref>), secologanin synthase (CYP72A1) from <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irmler et al., 2000</xref>), DMNT/TMTT synthase (CYP82G1) from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), and the degradation of (+)-marmesin to psoralene by the psoralene synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanjek et al., 1999</xref>). All these enzymes are derived from plants, belonging to different CYP families. The fact that <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and plants belong to different kingdoms suggests convergent evolution of CYPs for catalyzing oxidative cleavage reactions.</p><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> morphogenesis is a tightly regulated developmental process that begins with the aggregation of individual cells into a mound of approximately 50,000 cells and ends with the formation of a fruiting body that consists of spores and a stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kessin, 2001</xref>). The culmination stage, which is marked by the onset of stalk formation, occurs at the end of development, between 16 and 24 hr after the process begins. The <italic>DdTPS8</italic> knockout mutant exhibited delayed development at the culmination stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), around the same time that <italic>DdTPS8</italic> and <italic>CYP521A1</italic> exhibited their maximal level of expression, suggesting a potential role of discodiene in regulating <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development. A number of metabolites have been demonstrated to regulate <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development, such as the polyketides DIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thompson and Kay, 2000</xref>) and 4-methyl-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anjard et al., 2011</xref>), gamma-aminobutyric acid, the nucleotide cyclic diguanylate, the cytokinin discadenine and an unidentified steroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loomis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schaap, 2016</xref>). One major difference between discodiene and these metabolites is that discodiene is a volatile. Since disrupting <italic>DdTPS8</italic> did not fully block the development of <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, discodiene might be merely a component of the volatile bouquet needed for development. It is also possible that discodiene may not control developmental programs directly, but rather influence them indirectly by acting as an ‘aggregation/culmination pheromone’ as already speculated for volatile terpenoids in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The organization of terpenes synthase genes and <italic>CYP</italic> genes involved in the same biochemical pathway as metabolic gene clusters has been documented in a growing number of cases including bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nett et al., 2017</xref>), fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quin et al., 2014</xref>), and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutanaev et al., 2015</xref>).

With only 9 <italic>TPS</italic> genes in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, it is unlikely that the clustering of with <italic>CYP</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) is accidental. It is equally intriguing to observe that <italic>D. purpureum</italic> contains two <italic>TPS-CYP</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). With the evolutionary relationship of <italic>TPS</italic> genes from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and <italic>D. purpureum</italic> recently determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), we are able to examine the relatedness of these <italic>TPS-CYP</italic> gene clusters. The ortholog of <italic>DdTPS8</italic> in <italic>D. purpureum</italic> is <italic>DpTPS6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), which is not clustered with any <italic>CYP</italic> gene. Moreover, <italic>D. purpureum</italic> lacks an ortholog of <italic>CYP521A1</italic>, implying that the <italic>D. purpureum</italic> may not produce discodiene, consist with the volatile profiling of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>DdTPS2-CYP519C1</italic> and <italic>DpTPS2-CYP919E1_Dp</italic> appear to be species-specific. In contrast, <italic>DdTPS3-CYP515A1</italic> and <italic>DpTPS5-CYP515A1_Dp</italic> are an orthologous pair based on the orthology of the respective <italic>TPS</italic> genes (<italic>DdTPS3</italic> and <italic>DpTPS5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>CYP</italic> genes (<italic>CYP515A1</italic> and <italic>CYP515A1-Dp</italic> are in the same subfamily). Taken together, these <italic>TPS-CYP</italic> clusters suggest the biosynthesis of both shared as well as species-specific terpenoids in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and <italic>D. purpureum</italic>.</p><p>Besides terpenoids, dictyostelid social amoebae produces many other types of natural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnett and Stallforth, 2018</xref>), including polyketides. Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are pivotal enzymes for polyketide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khosla, 2009</xref>) and the production of some polyketides involves CYPs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedewitz et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>D. discoideum</italic> genome contains 40 <italic>PKS</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zucko et al., 2007</xref>). With the demonstration of the <italic>DdTPS8-CYP521A1</italic> cluster catalyzing consecutive reactions to produce a novel natural product, the potential for generating chemical diversity of natural products in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> using the building blocks derived from 9 TPSs, 41 CYPs and 40 PKSs is enormous, which can be envisioned to be a fruitful future research direction. It would be interesting to know what functions these natural products have, especially in chemical communications between the organism and its environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and mutant analysis</title><p>The wild type AX4 strain of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (DBS0237637) was obtained from the Dictybase Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dictybase.org/">http://dictybase.org/</ext-link>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Terpene Synthase-Cytochrome P450 Cluster in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Produces a Novel Norsesquiterpene and Regulates Development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. One of the reviewers, René Feyereisen, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Chen and colleagues makes key advances in understanding the role of low molecular weight signals in the biology of Dictyostelium. The study demonstrates that this amoeba produces terpenes, at least one of which is converted into a novel terpenoid via a cytochrome P450 and suggests that it may influence the timing of multicellular development. These results provide the first biochemical characterization of a terpene synthase – P450 cluster in amoebas.</p><p>We agreed that the data are important and deserve publication. However, we are not convinced of the biological relevance of the developmental effect attributed to discodiene, given the small effect size of the DdTPR8 mutant. Moreover, you obtained your mutant via random insertion and you did not attempt to rule out that the phenotype was only pleiotropic (e.g. via complementing the mutant with the wild-type gene and test whether this restores normal development by generating a second knock-out by homologous recombination). This part of your manuscript should therefore be significantly reduced and toned down to be acceptable to <italic>eLife</italic>. Finally, we also think that there might be alternative scenarios for the role and formation of discodiene worthwhile discussing. That is why we ask you for the following:</p><p>1) The effect of discodiene on the development of the amoeba must be substantiated by demonstrating that it is not only pleiotropic. If not, it can only be cursorily mentioned. In that case &quot;and regulates multicellular development&quot; should be removed from the Title.</p><p>2) The effects of loss of DdTPS8 gene function on development are rather minor (so assuming they are not pleiotropic). A few hours difference in developmental progression also easily occurs on a day to day base for wild-type Dictyostelium. Therefore, you should clearly acknowledge that the biological significance of this individual terpene may be rather small. However, we suggest you to also mention that discodiene might be merely a component of a (terpene) bouquet needed for development and that knocking out just one may not be enough to fully block whatever role these volatiles may play in Dictyostelium development (or other aspects of their life history). Finally, you should acknowledge that discodiene may not control developmental programs directly (if at all) but may influence these indirectly by acting as facilitator, or &quot;aggregation pheromone&quot;.</p><p>3) While we judge that the role of discodiene in development is overstated (see 1 and 2), we also feel that the novelty of a functional biosynthetic cluster of terpene synthase – P450 in this organism (including the uncommon reaction catalyzed by the P450) is understated. Dictyostelium has 40 PKS, 41 P450 and 9 TPS genes: the potential for generating chemical diversity in &quot;synthetic biology&quot; using these building blocks is therefore enormous, and because this is not a plant, a fungus or a bacterium, diversity can be assumed (and indeed, discodiene is itself a previously unreported (nor)sesquiterpene). We believe that there is sufficient reason to emphasize the novelty from the perspective of the fields of natural products – chemical ecology much more while being much more cautious about its role in developmental programs.</p><p>4) There was much discussion about the robustness of the data in Figure 6, because it was not immediately clear that these experiments had actually been repeated three times. This is too much hidden in the Materials and methods section. Mention and discuss the reproducibility of these results explicitly (and also mention this in the figure legend).</p><p>5) In the first paragraph it is stated that apart from cAMP no low molecular weight signaling molecules have been reported to be active in Dictyostelium development. This is incorrect. There are at least two polyketides, DIF-1 (Thompson and Kay, 2000) and MBPD, with essential developmental roles. Other low molecular weight compounds required for stalk and spore differentiation are GABA, the nucleotide c-di-GMP, the cytokinin discadenine and un unidentified steroid (see the Loomis, 2014 and Schaap, 2016 reviews). This must be mentioned to place the discodiene story in the right context.</p><p>6) We propose an alternative mechanism for the carbon-carbon scission yielding acetone and discoidiene i.e. P450 abstraction of the C8 α hydrogen, leading to a discoidol C8 radical that would rearrange by scission of the adjacent isopropanol group to a radical. This isopropanol radical would react in the classical oxygen rebound with the [Fe-OH]3+, and loss of water to acetone. This may be more likely that the abstraction of the hydroxyl hydrogen and regioselective rearrangement of the radical following carbon-carbon cleavage. The alternative mechanism would be consistent with the retention of deuterium and would replace a relatively difficult selective rebound on the hypothetical C7 radical (with removal of a C8 but not C6 hydrogen), by a probably favored rebound on the isopropanol radical. Such an alternative mechanism has been proposed for the analogous reactions of CYP71AJ1 and CYP71AJ4, with modeling of CYP71AJ1 with marmesin (Larbat et al., 2007) specifically showing the optimal positioning of the carbon α to the isopropyl group (i.e. C8 of discoidol). Similarly, in the CYP82G1 model, the C5 carbon of the nerolidol and geranyllinalool substrates (equivalent to C8 of discoidol) is ideally positioned for hydrogen abstraction, whereas the C3 hydroxyl group is predicted to hydrogen bond with an active site threonine. If an analogous substrate positioning and hydrogen bonding could be shown in CYP521A1, then this would favor oxygen rebound on the isopropanol radical.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44352.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The effect of discodiene on the development of the amoeba must be substantiated by demonstrating that it is not only pleiotropic.

It is also possible that discodiene may not control developmental programs directly, but rather influence them indirectly by acting as an &quot;aggregation/cultimation pheromone&quot; as already speculated for volatile terpenoids in D. discoideum (Chen et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While we judge that the role of discodiene in development is overstated (see 1 and 2), we also feel that the novelty of a functional biosynthetic cluster of terpene synthase – P450 in this organism (including the uncommon reaction catalyzed by the P450) is understated.

Instead, we added the expanded information about other low molecular weight metabolites with defined roles in development to the Discussion section when discussing the biological role of discodiene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) We propose an alternative mechanism for the carbon-carbon scission yielding acetone and discoidiene i.e. P450 abstraction of the C8 α hydrogen, leading to a discoidol C8 radical that would rearrange by scission of the adjacent isopropanol group to a radical. This isopropanol radical would react in the classical oxygen rebound with the [Fe-OH]3+, and loss of water to acetone.

Now we agree that it is a more possible reaction mechanism. This mechanism is now added to our revised manuscript as a part of Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and properly discussed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
