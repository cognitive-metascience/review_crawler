pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40541.001</object-id><p>To understand brain circuits it is necessary both to record and manipulate their activity. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique. To date, investigations report short-lived neuromodulatory effects, but to deliver on its full potential for research and therapy, ultrasound protocols are required that induce longer-lasting ‘offline’ changes. Here, we present a TUS protocol that modulates brain activation in macaques for more than one hour after 40 s of stimulation, while circumventing auditory confounds. Normally activity in brain areas reflects activity in interconnected regions but TUS caused stimulated areas to interact more selectively with the rest of the brain. In a within-subject design, we observe regionally specific TUS effects for two medial frontal brain regions – supplementary motor area and frontal polar cortex. Independently of these site-specific effects, TUS also induced signal changes in the meningeal compartment. TUS effects were temporary and not associated with microstructural changes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40541.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ultrasound is well known for making visible what is hidden, for example, when giving parents a glimpse of their child before birth. But researchers are now using these high-frequency sound waves – beyond the range of human hearing – for a wholly different purpose: to manipulate the activity of the brain. Conventional brain stimulation techniques use electric currents or magnetic fields to alter brain activity. These techniques, however, have limitations. They can only reach the surface of the brain and are not particularly precise. By contrast, beams of ultrasound can be focused at a millimetre scale, even deep within the brain. Ultrasound thus has the potential to provide new insights into how the brain works.</p><p>Most studies of ultrasound stimulation have looked at what happens to the brain during the stimulation itself. But could ultrasound also induce longer-lasting changes in brain activity? Changes that persist after the stimulation has ended would be valuable for research. They would also make it more likely that we could use ultrasound to treat brain disorders by changing brain activity.</p><p>Verhagen, Gallea et al. used a brain scanner to measure brain activity in macaque monkeys after ultrasound stimulation. The results showed that 40 seconds of repetitive ultrasound changed brain activity for up to two hours. Ultrasound caused the stimulated brain area to interact more selectively with the rest of the brain. Notably, only the stimulated area changed its activity in this way. This helps rule out the possibility that the changes reflect non-specific effects. If the monkeys had been able to hear the ultrasound, for example, it would have changed the activity of the parts of the brain related to hearing. Most important of all, the changes were reversible and did not harm the brain.</p><p>The results of Verhagen, Gallea et al. show that repetitive ultrasound can induce long-lasting alterations in brain activity. It can target areas deep within the brain, including those that are out of reach with other techniques. If this procedure also shows longer-lasting effects in people, it could yield valuable insights into the links between brain and behaviour. It could also help us develop new treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial

circuits a two-pronged approach, entailing both recording and manipulating brain activity, is essential. In recent years, there has been extensive progress in this field, which was in part made possible by the availability of new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bestmann and Walsh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). While techniques for transiently manipulating activity in rodents, such as microstimulation, optogenetics, and chemogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sternson and Roth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanduffel, 2016</xref>), are increasingly accessible and applied, techniques for manipulating activity in the primate brain are less widely available and remain accessible to comparatively few researchers in a limited number of research centres worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galvan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanduffel, 2016</xref>). A prominent limitation for many brain stimulation tools for research and therapeutic interventions is the duration of the induced neuromodulatory effects, often not outlasting the stimulation by more than a few seconds or minutes.</p><p>Here we report on a particular protocol of low intensity pulsed transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) that we show induces a sustained period of neuromodulation in primates without inducing structural damage. The TUS approach in general is a relatively new one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dallapiazza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tufail et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tyler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Younan et al., 2013</xref>) and like transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayan et al., 2013</xref>) and transcranial electric stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>) it can be applied in the absence of a craniotomy. In vitro recordings have identified several mechanisms by which ultrasound stimulation could affect neurons. It has been proposed that the sound pressure wave exerts a mechanical effect on neuronal activity through ion channel gating and changes to the membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackmore et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kubanek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubanek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prieto et al., 2013</xref>). While the precise mechanism is being determined, early applications, including the current results, suggest TUS may be suitable as a tool for focal manipulation of activity in many brain areas in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fomenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Legon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Munoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Naor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tufail et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tyler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>). In the macaque, its application over the frontal eye field (FEF) affects the same aspects of oculomotor behaviour that are compromised by FEF lesion, whilst leaving intact those aspects of oculomotor behaviour that are unaffected by FEF lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deffieux et al., 2013</xref>). Pioneering work in humans has focused on modulating and eliciting evoked responses by focused ultrasound in both cortical and subcortical sensorimotor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Legon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legon et al., 2014</xref>). To date ultrasonic applications are primarily focused on direct ‘online’ effects. Nonetheless, some studies have observed neuromodulatory effects outlasting the sonication by several minutes before returning to baseline, with more pronounced effects for protocols delivered at higher intensities (I<sub>sppa</sub> &gt;5 W/cm2) and higher duty cycles (&gt;5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>). For example, following ultrasound protocols with a relatively high rate of acoustic energy deposition, characterized by pulses tens of milliseconds long, repeated at 10 Hz, the neuromodulatory effects outlast the sonication period: for up to 10 min following 43.7 ms long 1.14MHz pulses repeated at 10 Hz for 40 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dallapiazza et al., 2018</xref>), or for up to 20 min following 30 ms long 350 kHz pulses repeated at 10 Hz for 40 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahnine et al., 2018</xref>). We have built on such protocols when designing the current experiment.</p><p>Recent work has highlighted the possibility that in rodents some TUS protocols can evoke a startle response when the stimulation is modulated at audible frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, this auditory effect is limited to the stimulation period and dissipates within 75 ms to 4 s. This work has also emphasized that in more deeply anaesthetized animals, when the intrinsic neural activity of a system is suppressed, some TUS protocols might fail to evoke action potentials at the site of stimulation. This suggests TUS’ actions might be primarily neuromodulatory in nature and/or that they are most prominently observable when they interact with ongoing physiological activity. However, as has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Airan and Butts Pauly, 2018</xref>) the impact that any stimulation protocol might have, will be a function of the animal model being used and the precise details of the ultrasound frequencies, pulse shape, protocol, and ongoing brain activity. With the offline protocol and anaesthesia regime we used we control for such potential artefacts and show that TUS has an effect that cannot be attributed to them.</p><p>Here we focused on the effects of TUS outlasting the stimulation period, investigating the impact of 40 s trains of TUS on measurements of neural activity in three macaque monkeys provided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) up to 2 hr after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top panel). FMRI is one of the most widely used methods for estimating neural activity. Despite limitations in its spatial and temporal resolution, fMRI remains important because it is non-invasive and can often be used to provide information about activity throughout the whole brain. Rather than providing a direct measure of neural activity, however, it provides an estimate of how activity changes in tandem with sensory, cognitive, or motor events or with activity in another brain region. Typically, fMRI-measured activity in any given brain area is a function of activity in other brain areas, especially those with which it is closely interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). Although many brain areas may share any given individual connection (for example both areas A and B may project to C), the overall pattern of connections of each area is unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Passingham et al., 2002</xref>); as such, the overall pattern of connections therefore constitutes a ‘connectional fingerprint’. As a result it is possible to use fMRI measurements of correlations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal across brain regions to estimate the connectivity fingerprints of a given brain area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, bottom right panel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caspari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghahremani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mars et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). This implies that activity in any given brain area is a function of the activity in the areas with which it is interconnected.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40541.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the experimental design, time-line, pre-processing pipeline, and analysis strategy.</title><p>Top panel: The same three macaque monkeys (MK1, MK2, MK3) participated in experiments 1 and 2, and a control experiment conducted in the absence of TUS. Three other monkeys (MK4, MK5, MK6) participated in experiment 3. In all experiments anaesthesia was induced ~1.45 hr before the TUS intervention or no-TUS control. In experiment 1 the 40 s TUS protocol was delivered over the supplementary motor area (SMA), while in experiments 2 and 3, the protocol was targeted at frontal polar cortex (FPC). In all sessions, three consecutive runs of resting fMRI (26 min per run) were acquired starting ~40 min after the TUS or control protocol. Bottom left panel: Data from the resting fMRI runs were pre-processed following a standardized pipeline to address artefacts, improve image quality and signal-to-noise ratio, and prepare for connectivity analyses. By default, non-neuronal confounds were removed from the timeseries, but to allow an analysis of the effect of TUS on non-neuronal signal the data was also processed in parallel in a second pipeline, distinct from the default by omitting the non-neuronal confound regression procedure. Bottom right panel: The effect of TUS on the coupling patterns of the stimulated regions were quantified as ‘connectional fingerprints’ employing pre-defined targets (here illustrated for the SMA in the control state). These fingerprint analyses allowed us to test for the presence and duration of TUS effects in the stimulated areas (SMA after SMA TUS; FPC after FPC TUS), and in control areas, including non-stimulated areas (FPC after SMA TUS; SMA after FPC TUS) and the auditory cortex. Whole brain connectivity maps supported exploratory analyses and an assessment of the impact of TUS on non-neuronal signal (here illustrated for SMA in the control state).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40541-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We exploited this feature of activity to examine the impact of TUS application to two brain regions in the frontal cortex: supplementary motor area (SMA; experiment 1) and frontal polar cortex (FPC; experiments 2 and 3). Simulations showed we were able to selectively target these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see <italic>Acoustic and thermal modelling</italic> for more details). These regions have distinct anatomical and functional connections; SMA is most strongly coupled with the sensorimotor system, while the FPC interacts primarily with the prefrontal cortex and only interacts indirectly with the sensorimotor system via SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrides and Pandya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>). This allows us to test the spatial and connectional specificity of TUS effects. In the control state, each area’s activity is normally a function of the activity in the areas that constitute its connectional fingerprint. If this pattern is altered by TUS in a manner that is dependent on the location of the stimulation, then this will constitute evidence that TUS exerts a spatially selective effect on neural activity. In a within-subject design, the same three animals participated in experiments 1 and 2, and a control experiment conducted in the absence of TUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As such, fMRI was acquired in three conditions for all animals: following SMA TUS, following FPC TUS, and in a control state. In turn, each of the MRI sessions consisted of three consecutive runs.

In each area, a region’s activity pattern after TUS application was more a function of its own activity and that of strongly connected regions, but less a function of activity in more remote and weakly interconnected areas. Independent of these specific grey matter signal changes, TUS also interacted with non-neuronal structures, as evidenced by more widespread signal changes observed in the meningeal compartment (including cerebral spinal fluid and vasculature). Finally, in experiment four we demonstrate that TUS application had no observable impact on cortical microstructure apparent on histological examination. In summary, TUS over dorsomedial frontal cortex causes spatially specific sharpening of the stimulated region’s connectivity profile with high efficacy and reproducibility, independent of non-neuronal signal changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1, TUS modulation of SMA connectivity</title><p>Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation of SMA induced spatially specific changes to the connectivity profile of SMA. At rest, in the control state, SMA’s activity is coupled with activity throughout sensorimotor regions in frontal and parietal cortex, inferior parietal, prefrontal, and parts of cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

In summary, the most important finding was of a protracted period of connectivity change after TUS. While we are cautious about overinterpreting precise timing differences between long-range connectivity reductions and local connectivity increments, we note that the observed pattern could signify distinct time courses for TUS-induced long-term depression and long-term potentiation. However, the observed pattern is also consistent with the notion that early disruption of long-range input to a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) leaves relatively more signal variance in this network to be explained by remaining local input, driving the observation of subsequent within-network coupling increments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

This particular result may have occurred because, as already noted, FPC has no direct monosynaptic connections with these sensorimotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrides and Pandya, 2007</xref>) and so its functional coupling with these areas is likely to be mediated by areas such as SMA and the areas that surround it such as the pre-supplementary motor area and the cingulate motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1994</xref>). In fact, these circumscribed exceptions may well confirm the rule that a region’s connectivity pattern is only affected by stimulation of the region itself. Namely, SMA TUS only affects FPC coupling with SMA itself and the regions which are coupled with FPC only through SMA. In conclusion, the effects of TUS in different frontal regions were clearly dissociable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Experiment 3, replication of TUS effects on FPC connectivity</title><p>We investigated the reproducibility of TUS effects by examining the impact of TUS to FPC in three additional individuals in a biological replication experiment (experiment 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). TUS had the same effects as seen in experiment 2: a site-specific sharpening of the stimulated region’s connectional profile. While experiments 1 and 2 followed a within-subject design, for experiment three we conducted a between-subject analysis where the subjects in the two experiments differed in age. We are therefore careful not to draw too strong conclusions on any main effect of subject group but focus on the interaction of the TUS effect with the fingerprint shape. Notwithstanding, when reviewing the simple effects driving the well-matched interaction, we note that the observed sharpening was less prominently related to activity coupling decreases in experiment 3 than in experiment 2. Putatively, parameters of the general anaesthesia could impact on the effect of TUS. However, subjects used in experiment 2 and 3 did not differ regarding depth of anaesthesia or duration between sedation and fMRI data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effects of TUS on activation in the stimulated regions and on the auditory system</title><p>It has recently been suggested that certain TUS protocols might have a limited efficacy in evoking spiking activity at the stimulation site, but rather exert their influence on the brain through the auditory system, not unlike an auditory startle response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Although these online observations in rodents should perhaps not be extrapolated far outside the tested conditions (for example to our measurements taken tens of minutes after the stimulation ended), these observations do argue in favour of performing controlled experiments that address and exclude such confounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Airan and Butts Pauly, 2018</xref>). Here we consider, first, why neural effects of TUS might be evident in the current study when they were not clear previously. Second, we consider whether neural effects may be due to an auditory artefact.</p><p>First, it is possible that the efficacy of TUS is a function of both the specifics of the stimulation protocol and of ongoing neural activity. A neuromodulatory technique may fail to elicit spiking activity in deeply anaesthetized rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). However, in this study we specifically test whether it simply modulates ongoing activity, while adopting lighter anaesthesia levels. Importantly, it is known that whole-brain functional connectivity, as measured with the BOLD signal, is preserved at these levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mars et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vincent et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the experiments were conducted in a primate model as opposed to a rodent model; the importance of species-specific effects in TUS models are currently unknown. Under these distinct conditions, we observed that TUS modulated the activity coupling of each stimulated area in a regionally specific manner.</p><p>Nevertheless, following these investigations of the effect of TUS on whole-brain connectivity patterns of the stimulated regions, we carried out a second line of investigation and examined the effect of TUS on the signal in the stimulated regions themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). While BOLD fMRI cannot provide an absolute measure of neural activity, we can characterize how homogeneous the activation signal is within the stimulated region, as quantified by the coupling strength of the signal at each point in the stimulated region of interest to all other points in that region. This analysis revealed that TUS induced more spatially homogenous activation within the stimulated area, but not in the non-stimulated region (interaction of TUS x connectivity seed: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,8)</sub>=1571.2, p=1.8044e-10, <italic>d</italic> = 11.4426, CI=[1.2733 1.1333]). This effect on spatial homogeneity of the signal was not accompanied by changes to the temporal variance of the BOLD signal fluctuations in the stimulated or other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, the standard deviation of the BOLD signal fluctuations over time were strikingly similar between the two stimulation sites (SMA and FPC, highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and across the different experimental conditions (control, SMA TUS, and FPC TUS). This suggests that TUS leaves intact basic haemodynamics and neurophysiology and instead has a circumscribed and specific impact on the coupling of the stimulated region with the rest of the brain.</p><p>Third, the presence of auditory and somatosensory confounds is likely to be a function of the specifics of the TUS protocol. In sonication protocols the ultrasound wave is often pulse modulated at ~1 kHz, well within the audible range of many rodents and primates. At these modulation frequencies auditory stimulation is perhaps not unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). This is something that we have avoided in our work with macaques: we pulse modulated the 250 kHz ultrasound wave at 10 Hz: as such we ensured that the frequency of both the ultrasound wave and its modulating envelope are well outside of the macaque hearing range. Moreover, here we adopted an offline experimental design where any potential audible stimulation associated with the TUS application was limited to the 40 s sonication period, while the neural activation measures were initiated tens of minutes later. Furthermore, the specificity of our results strengthens the suggestion that it might not be possible to explain away the current findings as the result of an auditory artefact having occurred up to two hours earlier.</p><p>Nevertheless, we also carried out a fourth line of inquiry and examined the activation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and its relationship with activity in the rest of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g–i</xref>). The effects of TUS on SMA and FPC coupling patterns, as quantified in their connectional fingerprints, could not be explained by a potential impact of TUS on A1 activity coupling. In fact, TUS did not affect A1 activity coupling with SMA fingerprint targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>; non-parametric permutation tests, SMA TUS: p=0.8234, FPC TUS p=0.3452), nor its coupling with FPC fingerprint targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>; non-parametric permutation tests, SMA TUS: p=0.5411, FPC TUS p=0.2667). Moreover, neither SMA nor FPC changed its coupling with A1 as a function of TUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>; main effect of TUS: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,8)</sub>=0.015445, p=0.90416, <italic>d</italic> = 0.03583, CI=[−0.41483 0.46209]; interaction of TUS x connectivity seed: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,8)</sub>=0.18284, p=0.68022, <italic>d</italic> = 0.1234, CI=[−0.25058 0.36466]).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Non-neuronal signal changes</title><p>The ability of ultrasound to reversibly interact with biological tissue is not limited to grey matter. We were aware that our ultrasonic beam, placed over the central midline to target SMA or FPC in both hemispheres simultaneously, was also likely to reach the meningeal compartment in the interhemispheric fissure. In fMRI analyses this region is sometimes referred to as ‘cerebral spinal fluid’, although in reality it contains the cortical membranes (dura, arachnoid, and pia mater), some cerebral spinal fluid, and important vascular structures, such as the superior sagittal sinus. Ultrasound protocols designed to induce vasodilation or to temporally open the blood-brain-barrier are conventionally markedly distinct from those employed here, for example using higher intensities or supplemented with intravenously injected microbubbles. Nonetheless, we set out to test the influence of ultrasound on what we shall continue to refer to as the ‘meningeal’ signal and the grey matter signal. To do this it was obviously necessary to take a somewhat unconventional rs-fMRI analysis approach that did not remove the meningeal signal that is typically regarded as a confound.</p><p>A principal component analysis of the signal in the meningeal and grey matter compartments revealed the main components in either compartment explained significantly more variance following TUS compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; main effect of TUS: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,9)</sub>=30.6, p=0.00036, <italic>d</italic> = 0.67031, CI=[2.1916 5.3343]; in grey matter: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,4)</sub>=10.743, p=0.0306, <italic>d</italic> = 1.3381, CI=[0.47735 5.7655]; in meningeal compartment: <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,4)</sub>=16.263, p=0.0157, <italic>d</italic> = 1.6464, CI=[1.3379 7.2512]). The fact that this effect is present in both compartments could reflect the tight vascular coupling between grey matter and meningeal signal or be driven by partial-voluming effects (these are more pronounced when the size of the brain is relatively small, as for monkey fMRI). This observation suggests that after TUS the BOLD signal became more homogenous. In a seed-based connectivity analysis, as performed here, this would be reflected in a stronger contribution of global signal coupling. However, the impact of TUS presented above does not seem to exhibit this effect, as illustrated by the specificity of the TUS effects for SMA and FPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and further underpinned by the absence of TUS effects in regions remote from the stimulation sites (for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,d</xref> illustrates the case of the posterior parietal operculum, POp). Importantly, these coupling estimates are obtained when following the conventional rs-fMRI analysis approach to account for global signal confounds by removing WM and meningeal signal contributions before estimating grey matter coupling indices.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40541.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Non-neuronal signal changes driving widespread coupling.</title><p>In fully processed fMRI data, unconfounded by global nuisance sources, effects of TUS were not immediately apparent outside the stimulated areas.

Accordingly, we have repeated the seed-based connectivity analyses after accounting for global signal confounds based on the white matter compartment alone, excluding the meningeal compartment. In these data, global signal contributions were indeed preserved as evidenced by anatomically implausible global connectivity patterns present in the control state (compare panels a and b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, e.g. the prefrontal cortex, encircled). As such, this procedure allowed us to interrogate the global effects of TUS over dorsomedial frontal regions on BOLD signal (see Materials and Methods for full details). Following this procedure, we observed that SMA stimulation appeared to induce widespread increases in signal coupling compared to the control state. This effect was not limited to the stimulation site but also present in remote regions (e.g. when seeded in POp, compare panels b and e in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This effect can be quantified by considering the strength of local connections for every point in the cortex. It is then apparent that the changes induced by stimulation are global in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). In general, when not fully accounting for global confounds, a region’s connectivity profile after TUS could be predicted by considering its profile in the control state and adding a spatially flat constant. This suggests an additive non-neuronal source, captured by signal components in the meningeal compartment, may explain the presence and enhancement of global signal observed following TUS over SMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f,</xref> e.g. primary sensorimotor cortex). These effects of TUS on widespread coupling mediated by meningeal signal persisted over time for more than 1 hr after stimulation had ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>).</p><p>Similar effects of TUS on meningeal signal were also observed after FPC TUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that in unconfounded fMRI data FPC TUS did not have a strong impact outside the stimulated region (illustrated for POp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, in fMRI data confounded by meningeal-driven global nuisance, FPC stimulation led to widespread enhanced signal coupling compared to the control state. This effect of FPC TUS was replicated in a new set of animals in experiment 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the effect was perhaps not as strong as that seen after SMA TUS, this finding again suggests that TUS over the medial meningeal compartment may produce widespread changes that are non-neuronal in origin. Differences in morphology of the sagittal sinus along the rostro-caudal axis might explain this weakened global effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Experiment 4, meso- and micro-structural analyses</title><p>Some higher intensity ultrasound stimulation protocols, distinct from those used here, have been shown to induce thermal lesions or haemorrhage following cavitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elias et al., 2013</xref>).

We focused our investigation on modulations of brain connectivity, following the notion that each brain area’s unique contribution to cognition and behaviour is shaped by how activity in each area is a function of a unique fingerprint of interconnected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Passingham et al., 2002</xref>). We found that each area’s connectional fingerprint was significantly changed by TUS, but only when it was applied to that area itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The changes observed might be summarized as more uniform activation in the stimulated region combined with a sharpening of the normal coupling pattern that each area has even at rest. Activity coupling with strongly interconnected areas, which are often nearby, was increased but activity coupling with less strongly connected regions was reduced. Such changes in connectional fingerprints might constitute the mechanism by which TUS is able to induce regionally specific patterns of behavioural change when applied in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deffieux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>). The pattern of inputs each area receives from other areas and the influence it wields over other areas are a major determinant of its function and here we have shown that this pattern is altered by TUS. TUS may therefore provide a relatively straightforward method for sustained but reversible manipulation of specific components of neural circuits in the primate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wattiez et al., 2017</xref>). This may be important for investigating primate brain areas when homologues in non-primate species, such as rodents, are non-existent or disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Preuss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wise, 2008</xref>). This work paves the way for the development and use of offline TUS protocols in primates, including humans, both as a research tool and as potential clinical intervention.</p><p>In experiments 1 and 2, adopting a within-subject design with three animals, we found that TUS application produced different effects when applied to different brain regions: the SMA, a part of motor association cortex, and FPC a part of granular prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). However, in each case the TUS effects were prominent within the connectional fingerprint of the area stimulated. The connectional fingerprints of SMA and FPC are distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>). The effects of TUS are thus regionally specific.</p><p>Our results confirm that TUS can be used as a neuromodulatory technique that allows one to non-surgically target cortical and subcortical brain areas with superior spatial specificity and depth of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folloni et al., 2019</xref>) compared to other transcranial stimulation approaches (e.g. TMS and TCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bestmann and Walsh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). While successes have been achieved with some invasive techniques, such as electrical microstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vanduffel, 2016</xref>), it is not easy to use them to disrupt activity in all areas especially when they are not somatotopically mapped. Recently it has been reported that some online TUS protocols in rodents induce neural changes as an indirect consequence of the auditory stimulation they entail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). The spatially specific effects that we observed after TUS cannot, however, be attributed to any common auditory impact that occurs at the time of stimulation. Moreover, in order to avoid both the confounding effect associated with the sound of TUS and interference of the ultrasonic wave field with fMRI measurement, we opted for an ‘offline’ stimulation protocol. Stimulation was a 40 s train that ended at least 20 min before the fMRI data acquisition period. The sustained nature of the train and other features of the stimulation pulses may make the protocol used here more effective for neuromodulation, while ensuring the thermal modulation of the cortex remains limited (&lt;1°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Such limited thermal changes are not associated with neuromodulatory effects observed more than 30 min after the stimulation: the thermal rise is short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dallapiazza et al., 2018</xref>), not accompanied by tissue damage and below the thermal effects observed with some protocols in rodents (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Constans et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In experiment 3 we found that TUS had reproducible effects. When TUS was applied to FPC in three other individuals, it induced spatially specific effects similar to those seen in experiment 2.</p><p>The effects of the non-invasive 40 s stimulation protocol used here are sustained and lasted over much of the two-hour period we investigated. These effects are more extended than those produced by other techniques commonly used for offline disruption of cortical activity such as TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Shea et al., 2007</xref>). Care should therefore be taken in using the technique in human cognitive neuroscience experiments; TUS effects may continue beyond the short periods that participants typically spend within the laboratory. It may therefore be important to carefully characterize the time course of TUS effects in animal models before their use with human participants. Some caution might also be warranted in relation to the potential of ultrasound to cause microstructural damage, especially when stimulating at higher intensities, longer durations, or for more repetitions. While our structural MRI and histological analyses did not reveal any evidence of damage and were comparable to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dallapiazza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>), it would be of interest in the future to include additional histological indices of apoptotic or inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tufail et al., 2010</xref>) to further assess the safety of TUS. Similarly, the thermal modelling approach we adopted here was designed to estimate an informed upper-bound on potential thermal effects, but when further developing this protocol additional simulation validations – for example based on phantom measurements – might be informative.</p><p>In addition to the spatially specific effects of TUS we also observed changes in the BOLD signal originating from the meningeal compartment that were not specific to the area stimulated. Although similar effects were seen each time either the SMA or FPC was stimulated, the effect was generally more pronounced after SMA stimulation than after FPC stimulation. Our preliminary results from TUS of other brain areas suggest that these spatially non-specific effects may be even smaller when TUS is applied elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folloni et al., 2019</xref>). While the precise origin of the non-specific effects was difficult to determine it is possible that they may result from a direct vascular effect of TUS; the sagittal sinus is directly above the midline frontal regions that we targeted and is included in the meningeal compartment during MRI analysis protocols. The presence of such non-specific effects again underlines the need for care in translating the technique to humans; especially when the targeted region is near venous sinuses or cerebral arteries. In addition, they underline the need for comparing the behavioural effects of TUS not just with a non-stimulation sham condition but with TUS application to another control brain region. The absence of marked histological changes in experiment 4, however, provides one important safety benchmark and confirms previous histological results in lagomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Combining TUS and fMRI is a promising approach to overcome the restrictions of each of the individual techniques. Here we have shown that TUS has a detectable offline and sustained impact on the distinctive network of connectivity associated with the stimulated brain region – the connectional fingerprint. A brain region’s interactions with other regions – its unique connectional fingerprint or specific pattern of inputs and outputs – are an important determinant of its functional role. The current results are therefore consistent with TUS application exerting regionally specific effects on behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deffieux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that fMRI allows the effects of TUS to be studied with a high spatial resolution suggests the TUS-fMRI combination has the potential to become a powerful neuroscientific tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subject details</title><p>For this study, six healthy male macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, NCBITaxon:9544) were stimulated with transcranial focused ultrasound and scanned to acquire resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) and anatomical MR images.

The same three animals participated in experiment 2 [FPC TUS] (at time of scan: 6.1 years, 11.8 kg), and the control condition (at time of scan: 5.5 years, 10.2 kg). Three different animals participated in experiment 3 [FPC TUS validation] (all males, mean age and weight at time of scan: 10.3 years, 13 kg). In addition to this set of animals, six animals were included in the histology analysis (experiment 4): three control animals who did not receive TUS (two females; mean age and weight at time of perfusion: 9.3 years, 9.1 kg) and three pre-SMA TUS animals post stimulation (all males; mean age and weight at time of perfusion: 8.4 years, 13.1 kg).</p><p>All procedures were conducted under licenses from the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office in accordance with The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

The resonance frequency of the ultrasonic wave was set at 250 kHz with 30 ms bursts of ultrasound generated every 100 ms, controlled through a digital function generator (Handyscope HS5, TiePie engineering, Sneek, The Netherlands). The stimulation lasted for 40 s. A 75-Watt amplifier (75A250A, Amplifier Research, Souderton, PA) was used to deliver the required power to the transducer. A TiePie probe (Handyscope HS5, TiePie engineering, Sneek, The Netherlands) connected to an oscilloscope was used to monitor the voltage delivered. The recorded peak-to-peak voltage was kept constant throughout the stimulation. Voltage values per session ranged from 130 to 142 V, corresponding to 1.17 to 1.35 MPa as measured in water with an in house heterodyne interferometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constans et al., 2017</xref>). Based on numerical simulations (see <italic>Acoustic and thermal modelling</italic> below for more details), the maximum peak pressure (P<sub>max</sub>) and I<sub>sppa</sub> at the acoustic focus point were estimated to be 0.88 MPa and 24.1 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for the SMA target, and 1.01 MPa and 31.7 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for the FPC target (I<sub>spta</sub>: 7.2 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and 9.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup> for SMA and FPC, respectively). Each of the areas targeted in experiments 1–4 lie close to the midline. Therefore, we applied a single train over the midline stimulating the target region in both hemispheres simultaneously.</p><p>In order to direct TUS to the target region, we guided the stimulation using a frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation system (Rogue Research, Montreal, CA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_009539">SCR_009539</ext-link>) set up for each animal individually by registering a T1-weighted MR image to the animal’s head. Positions of both the ultrasound transducer and the head of the animal were tracked continuously with infrared reflectors to inform online and accurate positioning of the transducer over the targeted brain region: SMA in experiment 1, (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) X, Y, and Z coordinates in mm [0.1 2 19]); FPC in experiment 2 [0.6 24 10]; FPC in experiment 3 [-0.7 24 11]; pre-SMA in experiment 4 [0.2 11 17]. The ultrasound transducer/coupling cone montage was placed directly onto previously shaved skin prepared with conductive gel (SignaGel Electrode; Parker Laboratories Inc.) to ensure ultrasonic coupling between the transducer and the animal's scalp. In the non-stimulation condition (control), all procedures (anaesthesia, pre-scan preparation, fMRI scan acquisition and timing), with the exception of actual TUS, matched the TUS sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acoustic and thermal modelling</title><p>The acoustic wave propagation of our focused ultrasound protocol (at 130 V peak-to-peak voltage) was simulated using a k-space pseudospectral method-based solver, k-Wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 2007</xref>) to obtain estimates for the pressure amplitude, peak intensity, spatial distribution, and thermal impact at steady state. 3D maps of the skull were extracted from a monkey CT scan (Kyoto University online database, ID 1478, 0.26 mm isotropic resolution).

EPI timeseries were motion corrected using MCFLIRT. Given that the animals were anaesthetized and their heads were held in a steady position, any apparent image motion, if present at all, is caused by changes to the B0 field and temperature, rather than by head motion. Accordingly, the parameter estimates from MCFLIRT can be considered to be ‘B0-confound parameters’ instead. Each timeseries was checked rigorously for spikes and other artefacts, both visually and using automated algorithms; where applicable slices with spikes were linearly interpolated based on temporally neighbouring slices. Brain extraction, bias-correction, and registration was achieved for the functional EPI datasets in an iterative manner, similar to the pre-processing of the structural images with the only difference that the mean of each functional dataset was registered to its corresponding T1w image using rigid-body boundary-based registration (FLIRT). EPI signal noise was reduced both in the frequency and temporal domain. The functional timeseries were high-pass filtered with a frequency cut-off at 2000 s. Temporally cyclical noise, for example originating from the respiration apparatus, was removed using band-stop filters set dynamically to noise peaks in the frequency domain of the first three principal components of the timeseries.</p><p>To account for remaining global signal confounds we considered the signal timeseries in white matter (WM) and meningeal compartments. Specifically, the WM + meningeal confound timeseries was described by the mean time course and the first five subsequent principal components of the combined WM and meningeal compartment (considering only voxels with a high posterior probability of belonging to the WM or meningeal compartment, obtained in the T1w image using FAST). The principal components of the WM + meningeal signal were estimated using a singular value decomposition approach. The B0 confound parameter estimates obtained from MCFLIRT were expanded as a second degree Volterra series to capture both linear and non-linear B0 effects. Together the WM + meningeal and expanded B0 confound parameters were regressed out of the BOLD signal for each voxel.</p><p>In a separate analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), to assess the contribution of the meningeal compartment signal we repeated the identical procedure as above, with the only difference that the mean and principal components were extracted from signal in the WM compartment alone, excluding the meningeal compartment.</p><p>Following this confound cleaning step, the timeseries were low-pass filtered with a cut-off at 10 s. The cleaned and filtered signal was projected from the conventional volumetric representation (2 mm voxels) to the F99 cortical surface (~1.4 mm spaced vertices), while maintaining the subcortical volumetric structures. The data were spatially smoothed using a 3 mm FWHM gaussian kernel, while considering the folding of the cortex and the anatomical boundaries of the subcortical structures. Lastly, the data timeseries were demeaned to prepare for functional connectivity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Macaque rs-fMRI analyses</title><p>To represent subject effects, the timeseries from the three runs were concatenated to create a single timeseries of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>800</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2385</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> volumes per animal per intervention (control, SMA TUS, FPC TUS). To represent group effects the run-concatenated timeseries of all animals were combined using a group-PCA approach resulting in a series of 200 volumes representing the principal components (Smith et al., 2014).</p><p>We report on the whole-brain functional coupling of the stimulation sites in the control state and after TUS, adopting a seed-based correlation analysis approach. Effects of TUS are quantified based on a limited set of regions, a ‘fingerprint’, whose strength of interconnection with macaque SMA or FPC is known from anatomical tracing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates and Goldman-Rakic, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dum and Strick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrides and Pandya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strick et al., 1998</xref>) and from studies of fMRI activity coupling under anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>). For example, SMA is strongly interconnected with core nodes in the sensorimotor network, including M1, SPL, and MCC. The unique profile of interconnections characterizing a functional area is defined by a pattern of both strong and limited interconnections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Passingham et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, we selected a set of regions based on either distinctively strong or distinctively limited interconnection and fMRI coupling with SMA or FPC. In fact, as a result of the complementary patterns of connections defining SMA and FPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petrides and Pandya, 2007</xref>), areas that were included based on their known strong connection and coupling with FPC (9m, 9-46d, PCC, IPLc, midSTS) were also included because of their known limited connections and coupling with SMA. Furthermore, to characterize the effect of TUS targeted at FPC on adjacent prefrontal cortex, we also included additional ventromedial and orbital prefrontal regions with which FPC shared less strong connections. To ensure a balanced distribution of fingerprint targets across the brain and to ensure that both SMA and FPC fingerprints were comprised of the same number of regions we consider areas 11m and aSTG in the SMA fingerprint, both regions with which the SMA is weakly interconnected. Lastly, to test for specificity of the TUS effects, we included SMA as a target for the FPC fingerprint and FPC as a target for the SMA fingerprint.</p><p>To construct regions-of-interest (ROI) for SMA and FPC, circles of 4 mm radius were drawn on the cortical surface around the point closest to the average stimulation coordinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), in both the left and the right hemisphere. The same procedure was used to define other bilateral cortical regions of interest, based on literature coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mars et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>), to serve as seeds for connectivity analyses (A1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g–i</xref>; POp, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) or targets for the fingerprint analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Apart from the stimulation sites and primary auditory cortex, all ROIs were selected based on their known anatomical connectivity, of relevance because they are known to be distinctively strongly or distinctively weakly connected with the stimulation sites.</p><p>Coupling between the activity of each region of interest and the rest of the brain was estimated by calculating the correlation coefficient between each point in the ROI and all other data points (Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>: inverse hyperbolic tangent of Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>, bounded at [−2 2]). The resulting ‘connectivity-maps’ were averaged across all vertices/voxels in the ROI, and subsequently averaged across hemispheres. Accordingly, the final maps represent the average coupling of a bilateral ROI with the rest of the brain. The fingerprints are obtained by extracting the average coupling with each target ROI and averaging across the two hemispheres.</p><p>The strength of self-connections within SMA and FPC ROIs was estimated in the same way as the coupling of either SMA or FPC with any remote ROI was determined. Namely, for each point in the ROI the Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>-transformed correlation between this point’s timeseries and that of each of the other points in the ROI was calculated. Subsequently, for each point the resultant <italic>z</italic>-values were averaged, describing local coupling at that point, and averaged across the whole ROI to obtain a single estimate of self-coupling per ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>To assess the contribution of the meningeal compartment signal, we quantified the effect of TUS for each point on the cortical surface in data that was not corrected for the meningeal signal (see <italic>Macaque rs-fMRI pre-processing</italic>). For each point, we calculated it’s coupling with the rest of the brain, sorted all Fisher’s <italic>z</italic>-values in ascending order, and extracted the <italic>z</italic>-value at the 98<sup>th</sup>-percentile. <italic>Z</italic>-values at this level describe relatively strong coupling with the seed point and are often observed in the vicinity of the seed region or other strongly connected regions (depicted in bright yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), ensuring that irrelevant connections are ignored. As such, this simple statistic is well-suited to capture any main effects of TUS on coupling strength, including those observed when comparing panels (b) and (e) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This statistic allows us to quantify the effect of TUS in a single value for each point on the cortical surface, and to directly contrast the values obtained in the control state with those obtained after TUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f,i</xref>).</p><p>We described the signal variance in the GM and meningeal compartments, or more specifically, the variance explained by the first five principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> panel c), using the same approach that was used to decompose signal in WM or WM + meningeal compartments in the EPI timeseries cleaning step, as described above. We defined the explained variance as the sum of the first five eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the compartment signals divided by the sum of all eigenvalues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>All suitable animals available at the time of experimentation took part in this study. Accordingly, there was no pre-selection nor restriction for group allocation. No data was excluded for analysis. Sample sizes could not be predetermined statistically in the absence of a prior literature reporting relevant expected effect sizes; instead we adopted sample sizes similar to those reported in previous publications detailing (interventional) macaque fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>). Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. We used a group PCA approach to define the centre of group rs-fMRI effects (see <italic>Macaque rs-fMRI analyses</italic>). For all other effects the centre of the group is defined as the mean of the individual subject effects.</p><p>To report on the full extent of the TUS effects and the simple effects that drive any observed differences we reproduce the whole-brain functional connectivity maps unthresholded for the control, SMA TUS, and FPC TUS conditions separately. In order to make a statistical comparison of the functional coupling of the SMA and FPC in the control and TUS conditions it is problematic to compare coupling at each and every other point in the brain because there is a risk of false positive effects if multiple comparisons are made. Given the limited sample sizes possible with non-human primate experiments, however, there is a risk of false negative results if stringent correction for multiple comparisons is undertaken at the whole-brain level. Indeed, here we avoid these pitfalls and make inference on a single statistic that combines information from a planned limited set of regions defined by coordinates from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mars et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sallet et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, rather than examining activity coupling between the seed area and each of the fingerprint ROIs in turn and risking potential false positive results, we compared the overall pattern of coupling using the method devised by Mars and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mars et al., 2016</xref>); non-parametric permutation tests were performed on cosine similarity metrics summarizing pairs of fingerprints (SMA TUS versus control and FPC TUS versus control). Each connectional fingerprint can be represented as a multidimensional vector, with the number of dimensions corresponding to the number of target ROIs in the fingerprint. The cosine similarity metric quantifies the angle between two of such multi-dimensional vectors. As such, it takes into account the shape of the fingerprint irrespective of its mean amplitude and results in a single metric per pair of fingerprints, negating the necessity for correcting for multiple comparisons across fingerprint targets. To assess the likelihood of observing this cosine similarity metric under the null-hypothesis of no difference between conditions, it needs to be compared against a distribution of metrics obtained from a random sample. To avoid non-compliance to the requirements for a conventional parametric approach (e.g. independence of sampling and adherence to a Gaussian normal distribution) we applied a non-parametric permutation approach, in which the parent distribution is empirically drawn by repeatedly (randomly) shuffling the group-membership of data points and re-calculating the metric based on the shuffled labelling (e.g. data points acquired in the control state might be randomly assigned to the intervention condition, and vice versa). In this way the empirical distribution under the null-hypothesis does not rely on assumptions about the shape of the distribution but will acknowledge dependencies between target ROIs in the fingerprint; as such this approach will avoid inflation of type I error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). The relatively small number of TUS sites, animals, and fMRI runs allowed us to exhaustively test all possible permutations (24309) to obtain the true probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.</p><p>All other statistical inferences were drawn in the context of generalized linear mixed-effects (GLME) models that considered the intercept and factorial design (including interactions where appropriate) as fixed effects and the intercept and slope grouped per animal as random effects with possible correlation between them (as implemented in MATLAB, Mathworks, Natick, USA). The models were assumed to adhere to a normal distribution of the data (not formally tested) and were fitted using Maximum-Pseudo-Likelihood estimation methods where the covariance of the random effects was approximated using Cholesky parameterization. Statistical significance was set at α = 0.05, two-tailed, and estimated using conventional analyses of variance (ANOVA). For all parametric tests we report the test statistic (<italic>F</italic>), probability estimate (<italic>p</italic>), effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>), and the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI). For all plots, the central tendency across individual animals is derived directly from the group-PCA approach(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2014</xref>) or described as the mean across all animals (n = 3). Dispersion is described as the standard-error of the mean (SE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>In experiment 4, prior to histological examination, animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentorbarbitone and perfused with 90% saline and 10% formalin.

Differences between stimulated and non-stimulated animals would seem to reveal variability comprising both the effect of TUS as well as any across-individual differences. The concern is that the latter can be substantial. Related, in the case of the TUS conditions, fMRI data collection began only after completion of the TUS train.</p><p>Specifically, our concern arises from the description of the procedures, stating that 'three animals participated in experiments 1 and 2, including the control condition (all males, mean age and weight at time of scan: control, 5.5 years, 10.2 kg; SMA TUS, 5.6 years, 10.7 kg; FPC TUS, 6.1 years, 11.8 kg).' This implies that each animal took part in one condition. Yet it is also stated that the same animals 'took part in experiments 1 and 2', and 'The same three animals participated in experiments 1 and 2, and a control experiment conducted in the absence of TUS.' At the same time, it is stated that 'while experiments 1 and 2 followed a within-subject design, for experiment 3 we conducted a between-subject analysis where the subjects in the two experiments differed in age.' – this would imply that in E1 and E2 a within-subject comparison was done (though it was not clear whether the control comparison was within or between animals). If you could provide a clearer description of the exact procedures and comparisons, this would greatly help with the discussion.</p><p>Therefore, to which degree could the results arise from significant across-individual differences (as opposed to TUS + across-subject variability)? One observation that may point to this being at least a possibility is that the connectivity of the stimulated animals does not seem to be converging to that of the non-stimulated animals even after 1.5 hours.</p><p>It would seem that a within-subject comparison of the functional connectivity before, during (if possible) and after TUS is necessary. This procedure could then be repeated for non-stimulated animals to control for the effect of time on connectivity, i.e. compare pre-TUS FC maps for each animal and then post-TUS or post control period maps, for the two target sites. This would address whether the effects that were observed were significantly larger than those that would be expected from inter-animal differences.</p><p>However, we are aware that repeating the study in full with a within-subject design might be unfeasible, and would therefore discuss a realistic way forward given everyone agreed about the relevance of your work and its likely impact. We would not necessarily expect another large dataset, and a small set of animals may be able to provide reassurance regarding the point above.</p><p>And there may also be other ways to address the concerns. Would a 'normative' dataset, to which your group might have access to, provide an alternative route, e.g. resting state datasets from other monkey MRI projects? We discussed whether comparison of your animals with such a dataset potentially address the concerns, e.g. by showing how each animal differs from such a normative dataset?

The study appears to be carefully conducted and it reveals some important aspects of FUS. First it shows that FUS increases local functional connectivity and mainly decreases distant functional connectivity. Second it demonstrates that the effects last for at least 2 hours. Overall the effects appear to quite small but they seem to be consistent across animals (Fg. 3c).

This is the first study reported in NHP that shows the presence of long-term, neuromodulatory effects conferred by tFUS. In addition, the study found that the effects are entirely independent from the confounding effects from potential acoustic startle response (ARS), which is allegedly believed to be a part of the ultrasound-mediated brain stimulation (at least in rodent studies). Due to these two major findings, along with very robust and rigorous methods used in this study (including the PCA analysis regarding the signals originating from the meningeal compartment), the data and their interpretation are convincing. Publication of this report would be timely for scientific community and will provide new perspectives regarding the acoustic neuromodulation.

Inclusion of (1) fMRI-tFUS study(ies) among humans and (2) recent findings regarding the presence of long-term neuromodulatory effects of tFUS on rodents (a simple Pubmed search will do) is advised for general audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper the authors investigate a relatively new form of neuromodulation using ultrasound (Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation or TUS). TUS was applied over the supplementary motor area (SMA) and frontal polar cortex (FPC) in primates, and resting-state functional connectivity was assessed at least 20 minutes following the stimulation. Control animals were scanned but without first receiving TUS. The authors argue that the &quot;connectivity fingerprint&quot;, a measure of the connection strength between the stimulated area (SMA or FPC) and other brain regions was altered by TUS. In particular, they argue that regions with which the seed connects to strongly have their connections increased, while regions weakly connected are further weakened. They perform a replication study and also argue for changes in the meningeal (CSF) compartments of the brain.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Inadequacy of control condition. In my view, the paper suffers from a suboptimally chosen control. Namely, the authors compare the brain connectivity of the stimulated animals with the brain connectivity of other non-stimulated animals. This selection means that inter-individual variability in the connectivity is not controlled for and has the potential to confound the findings. Given two animals A and B, animal A receives stimulation and animal B does not. Comparing A and B on any outcome measure leads to total variability comprising both the effect of TUS as well as any across-individual differences (sorry if I am stating what is obvious, I just want to be clear). The nature of functional connectivity and its shaping by experience could seemingly lead to significant across-individual differences which have not been examined. The authors have not provided data arguing that the observed differences (i.e., from TUS + across-subject variability) are significantly larger than those from across-individual variability alone. One observation that emphasizes this concern is that the connectivity of the stimulated animals does not seem to be converging to that of the non-stimulated animals even after 1.5 hours (see Figure 3F, where the difference between red and blue over M1-SPL-MCC is actually larger than at 1 hour).</p><p>Lack of rigour in statistical procedures. There is a significant absence of necessary detail regarding how exactly the fingerprints of stimulated animals were compared to non-stimulated animals (i.e., how statistical significance of the fingerprints was computed). The Materials and methods section refers to a paper (Mars et al., 2016), which refers to another paper (Nichols and Holmes, 2007) on the important issue of how the permutations were performed. Another issue is the apparent lack of correction for multiple comparisons, even though it seems that multiple tests were conducted. The sizes of the correlation vectors being compared are not provided either in the text or figure captions. I also have concerns about how the areas that comprise the fingerprint of a given region were selected, and how this selection influences the results of the statistical tests.</p><p>Magnitude of the effect on connectivity fingerprint does not appear to be very large. I list this as a major concern because <italic>eLife</italic> aims to publish research of the &quot;highest scientific standards and importance.&quot; Combined with the issues described above, it is my opinion that, taken as a whole, the data is not convincing enough to justify the authors' conclusions that TUS altered functional connectivity in the macaque brain following stimulation.</p><p>I believe that a more suitable approach would have been to compare functional connectivity before, during (if possible) and after TUS within an animal. This procedure would then be repeated for non-stimulated animals to control for the effect of time on connectivity. It would also have been more convincing to observe effects when comparing the entire functional connectivity matrices (instead of just the pruned fingerprints, especially since little information was provided as to how the pruning was achieved).</p><p>In summary, I commend the authors for undertaking what were clearly technically challenging and involved experiments. They have also done a good job in communicating the results and preparing nice figures. While I believe that TUS has promise as a technique for a neuromodulation, I do not feel that the data presented here are strong enough to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I am sorry that I cannot be more positive in my review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40541.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ plan to address the revisions.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments:</p><p>If our understanding is correct, then the main concern relates to the experimental design and disambiguating the effect of TUS with inter-animal differences in functional connectivity.</p><p>The comparison of brain connectivity of the stimulated animals with the brain connectivity of other non-stimulated animals raises concern about the contribution of inter-individual variability in the connectivity as a potential confound to the findings.

We truly appreciate the opportunity to respond to one of the main comments before a binding recommendation can be made.</p><p>We understand that a critical sentence concerning this comment is our statement that: &quot;three animals participated in experiments 1 and 2, including the control condition”. We understand that our phrasing might have given the impression that each animal participated in only one condition. In fact, each of the three animals participated in all three of the conditions. If we name the three animals A, B, and C, we could state: “Three animals (A, B, and C) participated in experiment 1. The same three animals (A, B, and C) participated in experiment 2. Lastly, the same three animals (A, B, and C) were scanned following the control conditions against which the results of experiment 1 and 2 are compared. Accordingly, experiments 1 and 2 are within-subject designs with n=3.”</p><p>One suggestion arising from the reviews would be to acquire data before and after TUS. In fact, that is exactly what we have done. We first acquired the control condition, after which the animals underwent TUS over SMA (experiment 1), followed by TUS over FPC at least one week later (experiment 2). This also entails that while the effects of TUS did not converge back to baseline within 2 hours, they were not permanent either, as evidenced by the fact that effects observed immediately following TUS over SMA did not carry over to the next session.</p><p>In summary, this means that individual differences cannot be mediating apparent effects of interest. For example on the in Figure 2, we compare the effect, on SMA, of TUS to SMA or the control site FPC. The data come from the same individuals but only the stimulated area exhibits the effect of interest. On the right side of Figure 2, however, everything is swapped round and now the only effect of interest is from the FPC when FPC is stimulated. Figure 3 is organized to a similar principle.</p><p>Further evidence that effects are not due to individual differences comes from experiment 3) in which we show that we can reproduce the same FPC effects in a second group of animals (let’s call these animals D, E, and F).</p><p>In the same light, it was suggested to acquire data not only before and after TUS, as we have done, but perhaps also during TUS, if possible. This is indeed technically feasible. However, placing the TUS transducer and coupling cone close to the head and stimulating while inside the scanner bore introduces MR artefacts. There is also a possibility that the TUS protocol induces audible skull resonance at frequencies caused by low-frequency modulations of the ultrasonic sound wave. To exclude these artefacts completely, we have opted for an offline approach.</p><p>For completeness, we would like to highlight that our validation experiment (experiment 3, with TUS over FPC), is indeed a between-subject comparison: three new animals (D, E, and F) underwent TUS over FPC and their results are compared to the control condition of animals A, B, and C. In essence, here the control condition of animals A, B, and C acts as a normative dataset against which D, E, and F are compared.</p><p>To conclude, we apologise for any misunderstanding that our wording might have caused. However, we would like to highlight that we have in fact performed a full within-subject comparison, as suggested by the reviews, and that inter-animal differences could therefore not have contributed to the TUS-induced differences that we observed.</p><p>[Editors’ notes: the authors’ response after being formally invited to submit a revised submission follows.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thanks for the quick reply, which has greatly clarified things.

To re-iterate, for the main analyses in this study we employed a within-subject design whereby all three animals participated in all conditions.

For example, the Materials and methods section merely refers to a paper (Mars et al., 2016), which refers to another paper (Nichols and Holmes, 2007) on the important issue of how the permutations were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have attempted to make our analysis approach clearer and we have given particular emphasis to the statistical inference drawn on the connectional fingerprints.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“Importantly, rather than examining activity coupling between the seed area and each of the fingerprint ROIs in turn and risking potential false positive results, we compared the overall pattern of coupling using the method devised by Mars and colleagues (Mars et al., 2016); non-parametric permutation tests were performed on cosine similarity metrics summarizing pairs of fingerprints (SMA TUS versus control and FPC TUS versus control). […] The relatively small number of TUS sites, animals, and fMRI runs allowed us to exhaustively test all possible permutations (24309) to obtain the true probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.”</p><p>In addition, we have clarified the origin of the ROIs used and the rationale for selecting them. The revised text reads as follows:</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“We report on the whole-brain functional coupling of the stimulation sites in the control state and after TUS, adopting a seed-based correlation analysis approach. […] Lastly, to test for specificity of the TUS effects, we included SMA as a target for the FPC fingerprint and FPC as a target for the SMA fingerprint.”</p><p>To construct regions-of-interest (ROI) for SMA and FPC circles of 4 mm radius were drawn on the cortical surface around the point closest to the average stimulation coordinate (Figure 2), in both the left and the right hemisphere. The same procedure was used to define other bilateral cortical regions of interest, based on literature coordinates (Mars et al., 2011; Neubert et al., 2015, 2014; Sallet et al., 2013), to serve as seeds for connectivity analyses (A1, Figure 4G-I; POp, Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) or targets for the fingerprint analyses (Figure 4). Apart from the stimulation sites and primary auditory cortex, all ROIs were selected based on their known anatomical connectivity, of relevance because they are known to be distinctively strongly or distinctively weakly connected with the stimulation sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For some analyses multiple tests were conducted. What procedures for corrections for multiple comparisons were in place throughout?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we put additional emphasis on the manner in which our statistical approach avoids the potential pitfalls associated with making multiple comparisons. The revised text reads as follows:</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“To report on the full extent of the TUS effects and the simple effects that drive any observed differences we reproduce the whole-brain functional connectivity maps unthresholded for the control, SMA TUS, and FPC TUS conditions separately. […]Importantly, rather than examining activity coupling between the seed area and each of the fingerprint ROIs in turn and risking potential false positive results, we compared the overall pattern of coupling using the method devised by Mars and colleagues (Mars et al., 2016); non-parametric permutation tests were performed on cosine similarity metrics summarizing pairs of fingerprints (SMA TUS versus control and FPC TUS versus control).”</p><p>Again we note, as we have noted above, how the precise nature of the approach used precludes multiple comparisons. The cosine metric provides a single index summarizing each fingerprint. Comparisons between fingerprints are not based on multiple comparisons of each point on each fingerprint but instead by a single comparison between the cosine metrics. We note the relevant section of the manuscript again below:</p><p>“Importantly, rather than examining activity coupling between the seed area and each of the fingerprint ROIs in turn and risking potential false positive results, we compared the overall pattern of coupling using the method devised by Mars and colleagues (Mars et al., 2016); non-parametric permutation tests were performed on cosine similarity metrics summarizing pairs of fingerprints (SMA TUS versus control and FPC TUS versus control). Each connectional fingerprint can be represented as a multidimensional vector, with the number of dimensions corresponding to the number of target ROIs in the fingerprint. The cosine similarity metric quantifies the angle between two of such multi-dimensional vectors. As such, it takes into account the shape of the fingerprint irrespective of its mean amplitude and results in a single metric per pair of fingerprints, negating the necessity for correcting for multiple comparisons across fingerprint targets.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sizes of the correlation vectors being compared do not seem to be provided either in the text or figure captions, but would be useful to see.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we now specify the exact length of the fMRI timeseries (correlation vectors) in volumes.</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>“To represent subject effects, the timeseries from the three runs were concatenated to create a single timeseries of 3×800-5=2385 volumes per animal per intervention (control, SMA TUS, FPC TUS).

To rule out the possibility that differences between FPC and SMA are simply related to SNR differences, could you should show temporal SNR maps and quantify these differences, if any?</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal signal-to-noise of the BOLD signal measured from a given brain area could impact the estimated coupling strength (Pearson’s r) of that area with other brain regions. This is an undesirable and common confound in functional connectivity analyses. Nonetheless, main differences in tSNR, either between brain areas or between control and TUS, cannot straightforwardly drive the TUS effects observed in our study. Namely, the observed effects are not only specific to the stimulation condition (control vs. TUS), but also to the site (SMA or FPC). As such, any potential effect on tSNR would have to exhibit an interaction effect of TUS and site. For example, we don’t just compare the impact of SMA TUS on SMA’s connectivity with FPC TUS’s impact on FPC’s connectivity; we also compare SMA TUS’s impact on SMA connectivity with FPC TUS’s impact on SMA connectivity and examine SMA connectivity at baseline. In the case of FPC, we compare FPC TUS’s impact on FPC connectivity with SMA TUS’s impact on FPC connectivity and FPC connectivity at baseline.</p><p>Moreover, even in the hypothetical case that such an interaction were present, this would result in global change of the correlation values estimated for each stimulation site. It would not be able to explain how after TUS the coupling of a seed region might be enhanced with some areas but disrupted with others.</p><p>Accordingly, to exclude the possibility of a three-way interaction of stimulation condition x site x other-brain-areas we quantified the temporal variability of the BOLD signal at every point in the brain, including the SMA and FPC, in all three TUS conditions (control, SMA, FPC). Please note that the mean offset of the signal is largely uninformative in BOLD fMRI and detrimental for correlational analyses. We have therefore quantified the temporal standard deviation of the signal instead. This reveals a pattern of variation across the brain that reflects basic properties of the data acquisition and signal (e.g. proximity to the RF receive coils) but importantly this pattern is not modulated by TUS and is not meaningfully different between SMA and FPC regions.</p><p>We have included these new analyses in the revised manuscript in the Results section and as a figure supplement:</p><p>Results</p><p>“While BOLD fMRI cannot provide an absolute measure of neural activity, we can characterize how homogeneous the activation signal is within the stimulated region, as quantified by the coupling strength of the signal at each point in the stimulated region of interest to all other points in that region. […]This suggests that TUS leaves intact basic haemodynamics and neurophysiology and instead has a circumscribed and specific impact on the coupling of the stimulated region with the rest of the brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is virtually impossible to appreciate the differences in the FC maps in Figure 2. The addition of difference maps might help here (e.g. TUA over SMA minus control).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have now included an additional figure (Figure 5) showing the difference maps for SMA TUS minus control and for FPC TUS minus control. In this figure we have also drawn our ROIs as used in the fingerprint analyses. This figure shows the direction and extent of the TUS induced changes to whole-brain coupling and highlights that the effects were neither limited to nor maximal in the ROIs selected for the fingerprint analyses.</p><p>The revised text reads as follows:</p><p>Results</p><p>“Following ultrasound stimulation, SMA changed its coupling with the sensorimotor system, anterior and posterior cingulate, anterior temporal, inferior parietal, and prefrontal cortex (Figure 3B).

However, an additional rationale for the choice of parameter (or brief summary of the literature) will be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The sonication protocol we employed in this study was based on a preliminary work on sustained ultrasonic neuromodulation (Ahnine et al., 2018). This protocol was similar to the protocol used by Dallapiazza and colleagues when observing short-lived offline effects following ultrasound targeted at swine thalamus (Dallapiazza et al., 2017). This protocol is characterised by a repetitive structure with a relatively high rate of acoustic energy deposition. Previous work has suggested that ultrasound protocols with a higher acoustic intensity (Isppa &gt; 5 W/cm2) and a higher duty cycle (&gt; 5%) might be most likely to elicit neuromodulation outlasting the sonication period (Kim et al., 2015; Yoo et al., 2011). We have taken this into consideration when choosing our parameters, while aiming to maintain safe stimulation intensities that do not lead to excessive thermal modulation or microstructural changes.</p><p>We have now included these considerations in the revised text:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>“To date ultrasonic applications are primarily focused on direct ‘online’ effects.

Although additional experiments are not necessary, realistic estimation of temperature rise using phantoms would be desirable. If access to such data exist we would encourage you to include these.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study the thermal modelling serves to provide an informed estimate whether the employed sonication protocol might have caused thermal damage and whether thermal effects could potentially underlie the observed neuromodulatory effects. We feel that for these purposes a rigorous and perhaps somewhat conservative approach might be most appropriate. While at the time of the study we did not have access to realistic phantoms of macaque heads we agree that this would be a worthwhile endeavour to further characterise the current protocol.</p><p>We have revised the text as follows:</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“Similarly, the thermal modelling approach we adopted here was designed to estimate an informed upper-bound on potential thermal effects, but when further developing this protocol additional simulation validations – for example based on phantom measurements – might be informative.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the histological analysis, a rather limited staining approach is used (i.e. Cresyl Violet and H&amp;E) to evaluate the sonicated brain tissue.

At the very least, please reflect on these limitations in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Our histological analyses were based on previous publications that employed NISSL H&amp;E staining to identify microhaemorrhages following either high-intensity or repetitive low-intensity ultrasound stimulation (Dallapiazza et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016b). By conducting a similar analysis, we were able to show that no similar tissue damage was associated with our 40s stimulation protocol. To further characterize potential confounding effects, we inspected T1w images for possible sign of oedema. T1w images were collected immediately after the 3 runs of resting-state data used for the main analysis of this paper. We did not observe any sign of oedema 2h post-stimulation.</p><p>Finally, we agree with the reviewer that future histological analyses will need to be conducted to further characterized the impact of TUS on the brain (see for example Tufail et al., 2010).</p><p>We have amended the revised text as follows:</p><p>Results</p><p>“Experiment 4, meso- and micro-structural analyses</p><p>Some higher intensity ultrasound stimulation protocols, distinct from those used here, have been shown to induce thermal lesions or haemorrhage following cavitation (Elias et al., 2013).

In another way, one could argue that it would be consistent to adopt the ‘TUS’ acronym we have used in previous publications employing the same technique.</p><p>We have expressed a preference for the ‘TUS’ acronym, here and previously in our work. Namely, this acronym avoids any redundant or implicit aspects of the technique: virtually all reversible ultrasound stimulation protocols to date use focused, pulsed, low-intensity, low-frequency ultrasound. At the same time, this acronym maintains its reference to the core features: it passes through the skull (signifying it is targeted at the brain and is therefore minimally invasive), it utilises ultrasound to deliver energy, and it is a form of stimulation (rather than imaging). In this way the acronym ‘TUS’ also provides an easily recognizable complement to other non-invasive brain stimulation approaches: TMS, TCS, and TES.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inclusion of some relevant published work may be helpful, at your discretion: (1) fMRI-tFUS human study(ies) and (2) recent findings regarding the presence of long-term neuromodulatory effects of tFUS in rodents.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have tried to give a more thorough overview of the relevant literature.

This procedure would then be repeated for non-stimulated animals to control for the effect of time on connectivity.

This constitutes an even more powerful experimental design than the one proposed by the reviewer. Indeed, a comparison between animals of a change in functional connectivity over time, contrasting TUS animals with control animals, would require one to test a mixed-level interaction effect with somewhat reduced statistical power. Similarly, a statistical comparison of whole-brain functional connectivity would likely suffer from either a distractingly high false-positive rate, or, when stringently correcting for multiple comparisons, from a detrimentally high false-negative rate. The fingerprint analysis is designed specifically to avoid these pitfalls, allowing one to leverage a-priori knowledge of neuroanatomy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
