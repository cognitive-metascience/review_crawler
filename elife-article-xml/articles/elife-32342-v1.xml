We thank Dr. Caiyun Fang and Dr. Haojie Lu for providing the Pan Anti-palmitoylation Antibody to us.”</p><p>In the fifth paragraph of the Introduction, the text “Moreover, palmitoylation is intimately involved in signaling networks by interacting with various protein molecules such as insulin in the control of phenotypic and functional changes of endothelial cells (Fang et al., 2014)”has been replaced with “Moreover, palmitoylation is intimately involved in signaling networks by interacting with various protein molecules such as insulin in the control of phenotypic and functional changes of endothelial cells (Wei et al., 2014)”.</p><p>We apologize for any confusion that may have occurred.</p><p>The article has been corrected accordingly.</p></body></article>
