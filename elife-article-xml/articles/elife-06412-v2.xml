Though corelease of glutamate or GABA with acetylcholine has been reported within the cholinergic system, the full extent is unknown. To explore synaptic signaling of cholinergic forebrain neurons, we activated <italic>choline acetyltransferase</italic> expressing neurons using channelrhodopsin while recording post-synaptic currents (PSCs) in layer 1 interneurons. Surprisingly, we observed PSCs mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in addition to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Based on PSC latency and pharmacological sensitivity, our results suggest monosynaptic release of both GABA and ACh. Anatomical analysis showed that forebrain cholinergic neurons express the GABA synthetic enzyme <italic>Gad2</italic> and the vesicular GABA transporter (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>). We confirmed the direct release of GABA by knocking out <italic>Slc32a1</italic> from cholinergic neurons. Our results identify GABA as an overlooked fast neurotransmitter utilized throughout the forebrain cholinergic system.

When an electrical signal arrives at the presynaptic cell, it triggers the release of molecules called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These molecules then bind to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic cell, starting a chain of events that leads to the regeneration of the electrical signal in the second cell.</p><p>Broadly speaking, neurotransmitters are either excitatory, which means that they increase the electrical activity of the postsynaptic neurons, or they are inhibitory, meaning that they reduce postsynaptic activity. Initially, it was thought that neurons release only one type of neurotransmitter, but it is now known that this is not always the case. Many neurons within the spinal cord, for example, release two different inhibitory neurotransmitters, GABA and glycine, while some neurons in the midbrain release GABA and an excitatory neurotransmitter called glutamate.</p><p>Saunders, Granger, and Sabatini now provide the first direct evidence that cholinergic neurons in different regions of the forebrain also release two neurotransmitters. Collectively known as the ‘forebrain cholinergic system’, these cells are best known for producing the excitatory transmitter acetylcholine. However, Saunders et al. now show that this system also produces an enzyme that manufactures GABA, as well as a protein that pumps GABA into structures called vesicles, which are then released into the synapse.</p><p>Although this is not concrete evidence for the release of GABA, Saunders et al. also show—with a technique called optogenetics, which involves the use of light to control neuronal activity—that some of the neurons in this system can trigger inhibitory responses in postsynaptic cells. Moreover, these responses can be blocked using drugs that occupy GABA receptors, or by using genetic techniques to delete the GABA-pumping protein from cholinergic neurons.</p><p>Taken together, the results of these experiments strongly suggest that the cholinergic neurons throughout the forebrain—unlike, for example, the cholinergic neurons in the midbrain, the region of the brain that controls movement—possess the molecular machinery needed to produce and release GABA, in addition to acetylcholine. Given that the cholinergic system has a key role in cognition and is particularly susceptible to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, the ability of these neurons to release GABA release could have widespread implications for the study and understanding of brain function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06412.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06412.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter corelease</kwd><kwd>cholinergic system</kwd><kwd>neuromodulator</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#NS072030</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons of the cholinergic system, which release the excitatory neurotransmitter acetycholine throughout the cortex, also release the inhibitory transmitter GABA, with potential implications for cognitive function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For many years, neurons were thought to release only a single fast neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strata and Harvey, 1999</xref>). This assumption led to classifying neuronal subtypes based on released neurotransmitter, a convention which helped predict a neuron's circuit function. However, many neuronal subtypes that release multiple fast neurotransmitters have now been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>). In some cases, the coreleased neurotransmitters have similar post-synaptic effects, such as inhibition mediated by GABA and glycine from spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>). In other instances, the effects of the two neurotransmitters may be different and synergistic. For example, coreleased GABA and glutamate are thought to control the balance of excitation and inhibition in the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>). In neuromodulatory systems, synaptic release of fast neurotransmitters along with slow neuromodulators has emerged as a common theme. In addition to the impact of dopamine, stimulation of dopaminergic terminals from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra compacta activates glutamate-mediated excitatory currents in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tecuapetla et al., 2010</xref>) and GABA-mediated inhibitory currents in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2014</xref>). Likewise, serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe can trigger glutamate-mediated currents in post-synaptic neurons of the ventral tegmentum and nucleus accumbens which contributes to the signaling of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several cholinergic neuron populations also release multiple neurotransmitters. Retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) differentially release GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) based on the pattern of light stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). In the central brain, selective activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons results in cholinergic and glutamatergic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gras et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Higley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the cholinergic projection from habenula excites interpeduncular neurons through glutamate and ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ren et al., 2011</xref>). Some evidence suggests that the basal forebrain cholinergic (BFC) system, which provides the major source of ACh to cortex, may corelease GABA. The dorsal-most BFC neurons, which belong to the globus pallidus externus (GP), express molecular markers for GABA synthesis and vesicular packaging and trigger GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor currents in GP and cortex when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tkatch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore asked whether GABA corelease was a general feature of forebrain cholinergic neurons.</p><p>To address this question, we selectively activated cholinergic fibers in the cortex, with the goal of identifying synaptic events triggered by endogenous release from forebrain cholinergic neurons. Recording from layer 1 interneurons, we observed not only the expected excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) mediated by nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), but an unexpected inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. IPSCs insensitive to nAChR antagonists had onset latencies slightly faster than the nicotinic EPSCs (nEPSCs), and could be directly evoked under pharmacological conditions in which action potentials were blocked, suggesting cholinergic neurons were directly releasing GABA in addition to ACh. Indeed, we found that cholinergic neurons throughout the forebrain commonly coexpressed the GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65 (<italic>Gad2</italic>), and the vesicular GABA transporter (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>), indicating that these neurons possess the necessary cell machinery for GABA transmission. Finally, we show that conditional deletion of <italic>Slc32a1</italic> selectively in cholinergic neurons eliminates monosynaptic IPSCs while leaving nEPSCs intact, confirming the direct release of GABA from cholinergic terminals. These experiments suggest a previously overlooked capability of the cholinergic system to use GABA in synaptic signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To explore the effects that cholinergic neurons have on cortical circuitry, we used double transgenic mice to optogenetically activate neurons that express endogenous <italic>choline acetyltransferase</italic> (<italic>Chat</italic>).

Layer 1 is strongly innervated by ChAT<sup>+</sup> cells of the basal forebrain across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mesulam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mechawar et al., 2000</xref>) including in <italic>Chat</italic> <sup>i-Cre</sup>; <italic>Rosa26 </italic><sup>lsl-ChR2-EYFP</sup> mice, where ChR2-EYFP is expressed in a dense plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). As expected, in a subset of interneurons (n = 41 of 58 cells from 9 mice), we observed robust excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at −70 mV in response to brief pulses of blue light (2–7 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). These EPSCs were not blocked by NBQX and CPP, ruling out a glutamatergic source, but were blocked by the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) antagonists DHβE, MLA, and MEC, confirming their cholinergic identity (nEPSCs). nEPSCs displayed a typical biphasic response, with a fast component, likely mediated by synaptic receptors containing the low-affinity α7 nAChR subunit, and a slow component, likely mediated by non-synaptic receptors expressing the high-affinity non-α7 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the expected nEPSCs recorded at −70 mV, we also observed barrages of outward inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at 0 mV, indicative of signaling through GABA receptors (n = 28 of 58 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>center</italic>). One possible explanation for these IPSCs could be ACh-mediated feed-forward activation of local interneurons, resulting in disynaptic release of GABA. Indeed, when nAChR antagonists were applied, the delayed outward IPSCs disappeared. However, in a subset of recorded cells IPSCs remained (n = 9 of 58 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), suggesting that these PSCs were not dependent on nAChR signaling.</p><p>To test if nAChR-resistant IPSCs are caused by direct release of GABA from cholinergic fibers, we bath applied the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist TTX, which blocked light-evoked IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). In the presence of TTX, IPSCs could be rescued by enhancing ChR2-mediated depolarization with the voltage-gated potassium channel blocker 4AP. Rescued IPSCs were subsequently blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 (n = 5 cells from 4 mice). Moreover, nAChR-resistant ‘direct’ IPSCs had faster average onsets than both nEPSCs and nAChR-sensitive ‘indirect’ IPSCs (nEPSCs, 4.0 ± 0.2 ms, n = 41 cells; direct IPSCs, 2.5 ± 0.2, n = 9 cells; indirect IPSCs, 11.8 ± 2.3, n = 19 cells from 9 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest direct IPSCs are independent of nAChR signaling and mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, consistent with monosynaptic release of GABA by cholinergic neurons. In support of this possibility, gene expression analyses have suggested some populations of <italic>Chat</italic><sup>+</sup> subcortical neurons contain the synthetic machinery for GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kosaka et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tkatch et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>GABA corelease has been observed in other neuromodulatory systems, namely from dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). In those neurons, GABA is co-packaged with dopamine into vesicles by the transporter VMAT2 (<italic>Slc18a2</italic>), instead of by the typical vesicular transporter for GABA (VGAT, encoded by <italic>Slc32a1</italic>), which is necessary for packaging in most GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wojcik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>). To assess whether cholinergic neurons could use VGAT to package GABA into vesicles, we tested for <italic>Slc32a1</italic>/ChAT co-expression throughout the brain, including in cortex, GP, NB, diagonal band of broca (DBB)/medial septum (MS), and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). We labeled cells expressing endogenous <italic>Slc32a1</italic> using double-transgenic mice that link Cre recombinase expression to the <italic>Slc32a1</italic> locus (<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>i-Cre</sup>) and carry a zsGreen Cre reporter allele (<italic>Rosa26 </italic><sup>lsl-zsGreen</sup>). Subsequent ChAT immunolabeling on sagittal and coronal sections from <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>i-Cre</sup>; <italic>Rosa26 </italic><sup>lsl-zsGreen</sup> mice was used to examine coexpression. Since zsGreen accumulates in somata and does not diffuse throughout the cytoplasm, this strategy allowed the clear identification of ChAT<sup>+</sup> soma free from background fluorescence caused by Cre<sup>+</sup> axons and dendrites.

To determine if GABA release is indeed monosynaptic, we took advantage of the observation that cholinergic neurons express <italic>Slc32a1</italic>. If GABA is released directly from cholinergic neurons, then conditional knock-out of <italic>Slc32a1</italic> selectively in these cells should abolish GABA release. We therefore bred triple transgenic mice which carried conditional (floxed) <italic>Slc32a1</italic> alleles in addition to <italic>Chat </italic><sup>i-Cre</sup> and <italic>Rosa26 </italic><sup>lsl-ChR2-EYFP</sup>.

In response to optogenetic stimulation of neurons expressing endogenous <italic>Chat</italic>, we observed PSCs mediated by both nAChRs and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in layer 1 interneurons. A subset of the evoked IPSCs appeared to be monosynaptic, based on latency and pharmacological analyses. In support of their GABAergic nature, the ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons which innervate cortex—local interneurons and subcortical projections arising from the GP/NB—express <italic>Gad2</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, the canonical molecular machinery for GABA synthesis and vesicular packaging. Indeed, conditional knock-out of <italic>Slc32a1</italic> selectively in cholinergic neurons eliminates light-evoked monosynaptic IPSCs. These genetic results confirm that cholinergic neurons release GABA directly. Cholinergic GABA release is likely to be a feature of most, but not all, central cholinergic neurons: the ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons of the MS and DBB—which innervate the hippocampus—also express <italic>Gad2</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, whereas those of the midbrain PPN do not.</p><p>The mode of neurotransmitter corelease can vary across neuron classes. In some instances, both neurotransmitters are released from the same synaptic vesicles. This is the case for GABA/glutamate corelease onto neurons of the lateral habenula, where individual miniature EPSCs can be observed with dual GABA/glutamate components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>). Copackaging in individual vesicles is also the case when the same vesicular transporter loads both neurotransmitters. For example, GABA is packaged in dopaminergic neurons by VMAT2, which also packages dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, both GABA and glycine packaging in spinal interneurons rely on VGAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wojcik et al., 2006</xref>). However, corelease from separate pools of synaptic vesicles also occurs. In retinal SACs, release of GABA and ACh can be functionally separated through patterned light stimulation or pharmacology. In <italic>Chat</italic><sup>+</sup> GP axons in cortex, GABA and ACh appear to be released from distinct vesicular pools which can be located within the same or neighboring pre-synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). Though the precise mechanism by which each forebrain cholinergic population coreleases GABA and ACh remain unclear and further experiments are merited to explore how GABA/ACh cotransmission is regulated, the differences in the proportion of layer 1 interneurons showing ACh and GABA responses suggest some form of segregated release.</p><p>The cholinergic system's function in promoting attention, alertness, and learning has classically been attributed to acetylcholine and its action as a diffuse volume transmitter, affecting cortical activity at relatively slow time scales. This model is supported by anatomical evidence showing widespread distribution of cholinergic fibers through all cortical layers with significant separation between the sites of release and ACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Descarries and Mechawar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mechawar et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, many in vitro pharmacological experiments have shown that ACh receptors can shape the signaling of other neurotransmitter systems, by altering properties of presynaptic release, synaptic plasticity, or the intrinsic excitability of targeted neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>). However, more recent work has focused on the participation of ACh in rapid, wired neurotransmission, acting at tightly apposed synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sarter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Poorthuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sarter et al., 2014</xref>). Behaviorally relevant sensory cues can cause a fast, time-locked spike in ACh concentration, suggesting that ACh may mediate detection of that cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, fast onset currents mediated by nAChRs can be recorded in cortical interneurons following optogenetic activation of cholinergic fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arroyo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>). Our finding that cholinergic neurons also elicit fast-onset synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> responses lends further support to the notion that the cholinergic system can rapidly affect cortical computations by acting at classical synapses.</p><p>GABA corelease from cholinergic forebrain neurons may affect cortical function in several ways. First, at the circuit level, GABA release could act in a manner that reinforces the emerging concept that the cholinergic system disinhibits cortical firing. ACh release from basal forebrain neurons excites layer 1 and VIP<sup>+</sup> interneurons, which in turn inhibit local interneurons that target principle neurons of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Depending on the timing and targeted cell types, GABA corelease could conceivably enhance this effect by inhibiting local interneurons, thereby promoting cortical activity. Second, nAChRs can regulate both pre and post-synaptic GABAergic signaling. For example, in hippocampal interneurons, post-synaptic nAChRs are present in inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fabian-Fine et al., 2001</xref>) and when activated, reduce GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSCs in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PKC-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wanaverbecq et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang and Berg, 2007</xref>). Thus coreleased ACh and GABA could interact to modulate local synaptic signaling. Lastly, experiments poisoning or stimulating the basal forebrain cholinergic system have demonstrated that activity within this projection is necessary and sufficient for plasticity in sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weinberger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramanathan et al., 2009</xref>). While ACh alone can induce functional changes in cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Metherate and Weinberger, 1990</xref>), GABA may also contribute to synaptic rewiring in vivo. Addressing these questions experimentally will benefit from future work to clarify the basic synaptic anatomy and biochemical regulation of ACh/GABA corelease. Given the presence of GABA signaling machinery throughout the distinct forebrain cholinergic systems, corelease likely has a significant and fundamental effect on brain activity and cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Cre recombinase was targeted to specific cell types using knock-in mice to drive Cre expression under endogenous gene-specific regulatory elements using an internal ribosome entry site.

We too were surprised by the GABA corelease from cholinergic neurons and agree that this phenomenon will force a reconsideration of cholinergic modulation of forebrain structures.</p><p>Our paper in press at Nature is a detailed anatomical and functional description of a subcortical projection system to cortex. We discovered that the globus pallidus externus (GPe) sends a direct projection to cortex, thus altering the classical model of the basal ganglia. This projection is carried by two cell types, one of which is ChAT<sup>+</sup> neurons of the GPe, which we demonstrate express <italic>Gad2</italic> and <italic>Vgat</italic> and release GABA in addition to ACh.

We have expanded the discussion of this point in the manuscript.</p><p>In a subset of experiments, we tried stronger single-pulse or pulse-trains of ChR2 activation, but these alternative stimulations did not reveal GABAergic currents. Of course we cannot rule out the possibility that our somatic recordings were not able to resolve small IPSCs or heavily filtered IPSCs resulting from the activation of synapses on distal dendrites.</p><p>Our guess is that there is high specificity of the cortical targets of GABA release from Chat<sup>+</sup> neurons. Several possibilities could explain target specificity of GABA/ACh currents. If GABA and ACh are co-packaged the same vesicles, the recorded post-synaptic neuron could express either GABA<sub>A</sub>R or nAChR. Alternatively, differential GABA/ACh corelease could be achieved presynaptically either by: 1) different types of neurons within the cholinergic system (for example local ChAT<sup>+</sup> interneuron vs. subcortical projections), or 2) through independent release sites from single axons. Precedence in the literature exists for the latter possibility, as ACh and GABA may be independently released from starburst amacrine cells of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al. 2010</xref>. Neuron 68: 1159-72. doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.031).</p><p>There could be additional regulation of release by activity, neuromodulators or behavioral state, including post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Vgat</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic> mRNAs. Establishing the mechanisms of corelease is a priority of ongoing experiments in the lab.</p><p><italic>2) What have the authors examined with respect to the identity of the L1 neurons that receive and don't receive GABAergic input? Are they indistinguishable in terms of firing properties, morphology etc.? Again, even negative information would be useful</italic>.</p><p>We have not examined the identity of L1 neurons that receive or do not receive GABA currents in detail. In many of our recordings, we capture the morphology of the neurons with 2P stacks. At the level of dendritic anatomy, there are not any striking differences, though we have not attempted a quantitative comparison of morphological properties. Biocytin-based morphological reconstructions would be necessary to test for differences in axonal anatomy, like the distinct flavors of L1 neurons that innervate the same or different cortical columns (Jiang et al. 2012. Nat Neuro. doi: 10.1038/nn.3305).</p><p>Our goal was to use the L1 neurons as a read out for both GABA and ACh mediated post-synaptic currents. Therefore we performed all of our analyses in voltage clamp with a Cs-based, low Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solution, discriminating currents by holding potential and pharmacology. We felt that these recording conditions offered the highest sensitivity, as necessary to detect potentially small EPSCs/IPSCs. However, these recording conditions precluded us from looking at differences in active membrane properties. We are now embarking on a large effort to discover the rules for selectivity of GABA and ACh neurotransmission using a large panel of GFP marker lines and post-hoc analysis. We expect this effort will take a long time to complete.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The authors examine the putative corelease properties of cholinergic synapses in the cortex using a combination of transgenic and optogenetic approaches.

We agree that GABA corelease from ChAT<sup>+</sup> cells of the forebrain forces an important reconsideration for how the cholinergic system regulates excitability and activity in neural circuits. We also agree that the study presented here is an initial description of the ACh/GABA corelease phenomenon; future work needs to be done to understand the functional impact of GABA release throughout the many cortical and subcortical cell types and networks which receive ACh/GABA synapses.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) It appears that nAChR-resistant IPSCs are observed only in a subpopulation (approximately 15%) of recorded cells (as described in the Results section).

However, in our optogenetics experiments with the conditional <italic>Vgat</italic> allele, we focused on screening for direct GABA/ACh currents. Direct, monosynaptic currents were reliably evoked and quantified from ∼ 10 acquisitions. However the small number of acquisitions used for the conditional <italic>Vgat</italic> experiments were not conducive to detecting and quantifying indirect IPSCs, which are more unreliable and have less consistent onset times.</p><p>Nonetheless, we prepared a direct current onset latency figure for the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1A</xref>). Since we did not detect any direct GABAergic IPSCs in the <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> condition, there is no latency data.

What would be the explanation of this result</italic>?</p><p>The kinetics of nEPSCs can vary widely due to different contributions of fast and slow components. The fast component is thought to be due to nAChRs containing α7-subunits and activated by point-to-point synaptic transmission. The slow component is thought to be due to non-α7 subunit containing nAChRs and volume transmission. In L1 interneurons, which have served as a model system for working out some of the properties of ionotropic ACh transmission, nEPSCs are quite variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al. 2012</xref>.

The slightly prolonged fast component of <italic>Vgat</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> is present in the normalized average nEPSC waveform (shown with sem, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1B</xref>). However, given the diversity in kinetics in both conditions, we are not able to determine if this difference is systematic or due sampling bias from small numbers. Many more recordings would be required to define systematic changes in nEPSC kinetics.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The authors report the corelease of GABA and ACh onto cortical layer 1 interneurons.

We also appreciate the sentiment that resolving the mechanisms of corelease for multiple cell types within the cholinergic system should be reserved for future work.
