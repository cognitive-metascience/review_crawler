muscle growth and repair. The non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) is an important transducer of growth factor and cytokine signals. Here we combined complex genetic analyses, biochemical studies and pharmacological interference to demonstrate a central role of Ptpn11 in postnatal myogenesis of mice. Loss of Ptpn11 drove muscle stem cells out of the proliferative and into a resting state during muscle growth. This Ptpn11 function was observed in postnatal but not fetal myogenic stem cells. Furthermore, muscle repair was severely perturbed when Ptpn11 was ablated in stem cells due to a deficit in stem cell proliferation and survival. Our data demonstrate a molecular difference in the control of cell cycle withdrawal in fetal and postnatal myogenic stem cells, and assign to Ptpn11 signaling a key function in satellite cell activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Shp2</kwd><kwd>Ptpn11</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle repair</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle growth</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griger</surname><given-names>Joscha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KFO192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spuler</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name><name><surname>Birchmeier</surname><given-names>Carmen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The stem cells of the postnatal muscle allow postnatal muscle growth and repair and withdraw from the cell cycle when the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2) is inhibited or mutated in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vertebrate skeletal muscle arises during embryonic, fetal, and adult stages. During embryonic development, a pool of Pax7+ progenitor cells is established that provides a cellular source for myogenesis during subsequent life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gros et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassar-Duchossoy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Relaix et al., 2005</xref>). The Pax7+ cells give rise to primary fibers in embryos, permit growth of muscle mass during fetal and postnatal muscle development as well as repair of injured muscle in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). Previous work identified distinguishing features of Pax7+ cells at different developmental stages based on characteristics like cell size, shape, response to extrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cossu et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cusella-De Angelis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biressi et al., 2007</xref>), molecular signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biressi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pallafacchina et al., 2010</xref>), dependence on β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutcheson et al., 2009</xref>), Nuclear Factor I/X (Nfix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Messina et al., 2010</xref>), transcriptional co-activator Hmga2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>), and position in the satellite cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>). In accordance with the original definition, we refer here to cells wedged between the myofiber membrane and the extracellular matrix as satellite cells and identify them by their anatomical position and Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mauro, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seale et al., 2000</xref>). Embryonic, fetal and postnatal Pax7+ cells proliferate, but most reach quiescence when muscle fibers cease to grow by accretion of nuclei (around P21 in mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2010</xref>). However, even in the muscle of adult sedentary mice, a small proportion of satellite cells remains in the cell cycle and continues to contribute to fibers, although to a low extent that is variable between muscles and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Reversible quiescence is believed to be a fundamental characteristic of adult satellite cells. Quiescence of adult stem cells allows their long-term survival and protects them from proliferative damage caused by mutations due to erroneous DNA replication, and from cellular senescence. Transcriptional profiling has shown that quiescent stem cells express low levels of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>). The tumor suppressor Rb has an important role in regulating quiescence and its ablation results in a vast increase of muscle stem cells and an accelerated cell cycle re-entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hosoyama et al., 2011</xref>). Maintenance of satellite cell quiescence also depends on signaling and is thus actively maintained. Genetic ablation of <italic>Rbpj</italic> encoding the transcription factor mediating canonical Notch signals results in a depletion of the quiescent satellite cell pool due to spontaneous activation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mourikis et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, ablation of <italic>Sprouty 1</italic>, an inhibitor of FGF signaling, results in a mild elevation of the proportion of satellite cells that remain in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, control of protein translation and phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α is essential for quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms that allow satellite cells to enter quiescence in postnatal development are less well characterized but known to depend on Hey1 and Heyl, which might act downstream of Notch signals, as well as on the cell cycle inhibitor p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ptpn11 (Shp2) is a tyrosine phosphatase that is an essential and positive mediator of signals provided by many receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dance et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neel et al., 2003</xref>). Functions of Ptpn11 downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors are highly conserved in evolution and can be observed in invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perkins et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 1993</xref>). Ptpn11 frequently acts through regulation of Ras/Mapk/Erk1/2. In many cases, Ptpn11 is required to sustain but not to initiate Erk1/2 activity, indicating that it mainly modulates feed-back regulation of the Ras/Mapk/Erk1/2 branch of the signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dance et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neel et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, Ptpn11 was implicated in PI3K, Jak/Stat, Mapk/p38, NF-κB and NFAT signaling in a cell type- and receptor-specific manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of myogenesis, Ptpn11 acts during migration of embryonic progenitor cells from somites into the limbs where it mediates signals provided by Met and its adaptor molecule Gab1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaeper et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Ptpn11 was assigned a role in hypertrophy as a regulator of NFAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fornaro et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into signaling mechanisms that control quiescence, activation and proliferation of myogenic cells, we ablated <italic>Ptpn11</italic> in myogenic progenitor and satellite cells in late embryonic development and the adult. We found that Ptpn11 is dispensable for proliferation in fetal, but not postnatal myogenesis. In particular, satellite cells in the early postnatal period or after regeneration rapidly proliferate. However, when Ptpn11 is absent or inhibited, satellite cells withdraw from the cell cycle and enter a resting state. In culture, satellite cells are not correctly activated when <italic>Ptpn11</italic> is mutated. In particular, <italic>Ptpn11</italic> mutant cells in such cultures upregulate MyoD and therefore appear to enter an activated state, but their proliferation is impaired and they quickly withdraw from the cell cycle. Finally, in the acutely injured muscle, loss of Ptpn11 also impairs survival of satellite cells. Our data demonstrate that ablation or inhibition of Ptpn11 promotes satellite cell quiescence and provides evidence for an unexpected molecular difference in regulation of proliferation in fetal and postnatal myogenic progenitors cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ptpn11 controls myogenic stem cell proliferation in postnatal mice</title><p>We used a <italic>Pax7<sup>Cre</sup></italic> allele to introduce conditional <italic>Ptpn11</italic> mutations in the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2009</xref>).

Compared to control mice, the numbers of nuclei per fiber were reduced at P7 and P14 but little affected at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In accordance, the diameter of muscle fibers was unchanged at P0 (average fiber diameter 7.9 ± 0.5 μm and 7.9 ± 0.2 μm in control and coPtpn11 mutants, respectively) but significantly reduced at P7 (15.5 ± 0.1 μm and 12.5 ± 0.3 μm in control and coPtpn11 mutants, respectively) and P14 (18.2 ± 0.1 μm and 14.3 ± 0.3 μm in control and coPtpn11 mutants, respectively; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In addition, the animals developed kyphosis by P14 and therefore subsequent analyses were limited to P7 or earlier developmental stages. To define the cellular basis of the observed deficit in muscle growth, we compared the number of Pax7-positive stem cells in late fetal and postnatal muscle of control and coPtpn11 animals by immunohistology. We observed no significant difference at E16 but at subsequent stages the number of Pax7+ cells declined drastically in coPtpn11 mice, which was confirmed by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>).

BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression in Pax7+ cells were similar in control and coPtpn11 mice at E16.5, but at subsequent stages the numbers were severely reduced in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>). Ki67 is expressed in proliferating cells in all stages of the cell cycle but not found in resting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000</xref>). The downregulation of Ki67 observed here indicates that the muscle stem cells withdraw from the cell cycle prematurely. No change in apoptosis rates was observed by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>).</p><p><italic>Pax7<sup>Cre</sup></italic> introduces mutations into myogenic progenitors and their descendants. Thus, stem cells as well as fiber nuclei lack Ptpn11 in the mutant mice. To assess whether proliferation was impaired in a cell-autonomous manner, myogenic progenitors from coPtpn11 and control mice were isolated, cultured and proliferation was assessed. BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression were compromised in cultured coPtpn11 mutant progenitors isolated from P0 but not from E14.5 mice, and an intermediary effect was observed in E15.5 progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>). We conclude that loss of Ptpn11 impairs proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner. This Ptpn11 function is observed in stem cells of the postnatal but not fetal muscle.</p><p>We also tested the effect of pharmacological inhibition of Ptpn11 in the early postnatal muscle (GS493; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grosskopf et al., 2015</xref>). When mice were treated for two days with the inhibitor, the number of Pax7+ cells that co-expressed Ki67 or incorporated BrdU was severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–l</xref>). Similar to the conditional mutant mice, no change in apoptosis rates was observed by TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f,g</xref>). We conclude that in the absence of Ptpn11, early postnatal stem cells prematurely withdraw from the cell cycle.</p><p>We analyzed differentiation in stem cells in which Ptpn11 was ablated or inhibited. Similar proportions of freshly FACS-isolated stem cells were Pax7- and MyoG-positive, regardless whether cells from control and coPtpn11 mutants or from control and GS493-treated mice were compared, indicating that their differentiation propensity was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). Furthermore, FACS-isolated coPtpn11 mutant cells displayed no obvious fusion deficit when cultured in differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus, postnatal stem cells that lack Ptpn11 activity are impaired in proliferation but neither their differentiation capacity nor the probability of their differentiation are altered. Together the data indicate that the pool of Pax7+ cells is not replenished by proliferation. Furthermore, MyoG expression indicates that a similar proportion of control and coPtpn11 myogenic cells differentiate continuously, leading thus to a pronounced decrease in the number of Pax7+ cells over time.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21552.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Loss of Ptpn11 does not affect myogenic differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cytospins of freshly isolated muscle stem cells from control and coPtpn11 mice (P0); cells were immunostained for Pax7 (red) and MyoG (green), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).

The majority of Pax7+ cells in the adult animal are quiescent, but a subpopulation was reported to be in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). In accordance, we observed that Ki67 was expressed in a sub-population of Pax7+ cells in muscle of control sedentary mice, and noted a significantly lowered number of Ki67+Pax7+ cells in TxcoPtpn11 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>). We conclude that ablation of <italic>Ptpn11</italic> drives the subpopulation of satellite cells that retain cell cycle activity into quiescence, and also interferes with long term maintenance of satellite cells. Cell cycle activity might thus play a role in long term maintenance of satellite cells, but the exceedingly slow loss makes it difficult to exclude other mechanisms like cell death or differentiation.</p><p>Satellite cells provide the source of stem cells for muscle regeneration, and we tested regeneration in TxcoPtpn11 mutants. A muscle injury was induced 7–10 days after tamoxifen treatment, i.e. at a time point when satellite cell numbers were unaffected by the mutation. Histological analyses indicated that regeneration of the muscle was severely impaired in TxcoPtpn11 mutants, and only few regenerated fibers with small diameter were discernable seven days after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–c</xref>). Instead, fibrotic tissue and fat deposits had accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Furthermore, seven days after injury increased numbers of C/EBPα+ adipocytes were observed in the damaged tissue of TxcoPtpn11 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</xref>). Previous observations by others demonstrated accumulation of fat and fibrotic tissue when muscle regeneration is severely impaired which was assigned to differentiation of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>), and we suggest that such a mechanism is responsible for the adipogenesis in our model. In the newly regenerated muscle seven days after injury, satellite cell numbers are increased compared to resting muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ogawa et al., 2015</xref>). In accordance, we observed many Pax7+Vcam1+ cells in newly regenerated muscle of control mice, but in TxcoPtpn11 mice the Pax7+Vcam1+ satellite cells were rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e,f</xref>). Thus, satellite cells require Ptpn11 to regenerate muscle tissue and to replenish the satellite cell pool.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21552.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Ptpn11 is essential for skeletal muscle repair.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Outline of the regeneration experiment.

At 2.5 days after injury, the number of satellite cells was strongly reduced in TxcoPtpn11 mutant mice compared to control animals, and seven days after injury the number of satellite cells detected was even lower and had reached levels that were below the numbers present in uninjured muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e,f</xref>). As assessed by TUNEL staining, apoptosis levels were increased 2.5 days after injury in TxcoPtpn11 mutants, indicating that during this acute phase satellite cells are lost due to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). Next we tested whether satellite cells were proliferating in TxcoPtpn11 mutants, and concentrated on an early time point after injury because sufficient numbers of satellite cells for such an analyses were still detectable. This showed that many satellite cells were Ki67+, but very few were positive for the M phase marker phospho-Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>h,i). We conclude that in vivo Ptpn11 mutant satellite cell enter an early activation stage, but are unable to proliferate, similarly to the changes observed in floating fiber culture. Furthermore, in a short time window after muscle injury, satellite cells are lost due to apoptosis.</p><p>We next asked whether Ptpn11 controls the re-entry of satellite cells into quiescence after regeneration. Because of the very low number of satellite cells in TxcoPtpn11 mutants after muscle regeneration, we used short-term pharmacological inhibition and treated control mice with GS493 seven days after injury. GS493 severely reduced the proportion of Pax7+ cells that remained in the cell cycle and reduced the number of Pax7+ cells present in the newly regenerated muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–e</xref>). In this late phase of the regeneration process, GS493 neither induced increased apoptosis nor did it change the proportion of cells expressing MyoG, or C/EBPα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f,g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a–e</xref>).

We demonstrate here that Ptpn11 plays a central role in myogenesis. Loss of Ptpn11 drives satellite cells in postnatal myogenesis into a resting state. This results in blunted muscle growth and kyphosis. It is interesting to note that patients with hypomorph mutations in <italic>Ptpn11</italic> (Leopard or Noonan syndrome) also display kyphosis, and functional muscle deficits might contribute to the appearance of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">NIH-GARD, 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2016b</xref>). In addition, we noted that muscle regeneration was impaired, which was assigned to a proliferation deficit and an impaired survival of satellite cells in the initial phase after injury. We combined complex genetic analyses, biochemical studies and pharmacological interference to show that Ptpn11 mainly acts by controlling sustained Mapk/Erk1/2 activity in myogenesis. Our findings identify the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 as a central regulator of satellite cell activity during postnatal muscle growth and regeneration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ptpn11 as regulator of Mapk/Erk1/2 activity in myogenesis</title><p>We show that Ptpn11 controls proliferation of postnatal but not fetal myogenic progenitor cells. Thus, despite the fact that postnatal and fetal progenitors express Ptpn11, they differentially depend on Ptpn11 for proliferation. This difference of Ptpn11 functions can be observed not only in vivo but also when the cells were isolated and cultured. Thus, the mechanistic differences in the control of proliferation go beyond a switch in signals that embryonic and fetal progenitors might encounter in vivo. Embryonic, fetal and postnatal myogenic cells were previously shown to differ in cellular properties, gene expression and response to signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biressi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassar-Duchossoy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Our data indicate that a major switch exists in the signaling that controls proliferation during myogenesis.</p><p>Using pharmacological inhibition, we show that Ptpn11 regulates the activity of Erk1/2 but not other tested signaling molecules in C2C12 cells. In particular, sustained Erk1/2 activity was blunted, but Erk1/2 short-term activation was unchanged. This downregulated Erk1/2 activity was also observed in stem cells that lack <italic>Ptpn11</italic>. Erk1/2 inhibition was previously described to interfere with proliferation in fetal and adult myogenic cells and, conversely, increasing Mapk/Erk1/2 activity by ablation of <italic>Sprouty1/2</italic>, enhances proliferation at both stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michailovici et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagha et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Mapk/Erk1/2 but not Ptpn11 functions are stage-independent.</p><p>We show that the numbers of muscle stem cells decreased in the postnatal but not the fetal muscle when <italic>Ptpn11</italic> is mutated, and we assigned this to a pronounced proliferation deficit. Thus, the pool of Pax7+ cells is not replenished by proliferation. Furthermore, a proportion of the Pax7+ cells continuously differentiates and expresses MyoD/MyoG, and therefore the number of Pax7+ cells decreases over time. The level of MyoD/MyoG expression and the proportions of MyoG+ cells are however comparable to control mice, and therefore we do not refer to this as ‘premature’ differentiation.</p><p>Subsequent to the decrease in muscle stem cells, growth of the overall postnatal muscle and fiber diameter was also blunted in coPtpn11 mutant mice, which was accompanied by a major deficit in the accretion of nuclei to fibers. Growth of muscle and fiber diameter also depends on accretion of nuclei, and we therefore suggest that the impairment is, to a large part, due to the observed stem cell deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 2010</xref>). Mutation of <italic>Ptpn11</italic> in the muscle fiber results in a late-onset atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fornaro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Princen et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that atrophy might contribute to the deficit in muscle growth since most nuclei in the postnatal muscle fibers are expected to lack Ptpn11 in our model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Satellite cell activation and muscle repair</title><p>Protein translation is repressed in quiescent satellite cells due to phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). This repression is relieved when satellite cells get activated, and the appearance of MyoD protein is a hallmark of this. We used myofiber culture to assess the initial stages of satellite cell activation in vitro, and observed that MyoD appears when Ptpn11 is lacking. In contrast, the normal rise in pErk1/2 protein observed in activated satellite cells was blunted. The appearance of MyoD indicates that Ptpn11 signaling is dispensable for the entry into an early activation stage.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that Ki67 expression is initiated in <italic>Ptpn11</italic> mutant satellite cells in myofiber cultures, indicating that satellite cells are able to enter the cell cycle. However, Ki67 protein levels are lowered and expression is not maintained. In accordance, the size of clones observed indicates that only few cells are able to divide, and instead the cells quickly re-enter a resting state. Our genome wide expression analysis indicates that markers for various stages of the cell cycle were downregulated in <italic>Ptpn11</italic> mutant satellite cells (G<sub>1</sub>/S, S, S/G<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>/M, M). It is interesting to note that the proliferation deficit can be rescued by a mild activation of the Mapk/Erk1/2 pathway, indicating that it is caused by impaired Mapk/Erk1/2 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ptpn11 and satellite cell quiescence</title><p>We demonstrate here that ablation as well as short-term pharmacological inhibition of Ptpn11 in vivo drives Pax7+ cells into a resting state, and this is observed in postnatal development and at late stages of muscle regeneration. Myogenic cells enter quiescence either as Pax7+ progenitor/satellite cells, a process that is reversible, or during terminal differentiation when they express MyoG, which is irreversible. Our data indicate that the cell cycle exit of satellite cells in early postnatal or regenerating muscle after Ptpn11 inhibition/ablation is not accompanied by changes in the expression of differentiation markers in vivo. Thus, Pax7+ cells (re-)entered quiescence prematurely in postnatal development and muscle repair. We did, however, note that <italic>Ptpn11</italic> mutation enhanced differentiation in satellite cells on cultured myofibers. Thus, in regards to the effect on differentiation, differences can be observed in vivo and in vitro. A possible explanation for the diverging differentiation propensity is that satellite cells encounter distinct sets of growth factors in the in vivo environment and in culture.</p><p>We show here that Ptpn11 controls entry into quiescence of emerging satellite cells in postnatal development. Our data indicate that downregulation of sustained pErk activity suffices to drive these stem cells out of the cell cycle. In addition to Ptpn11, the well-known target genes of Notch signaling, <italic>Hey/Heyl</italic>, control entry into quiescence, and sex hormones were recently noted to upregulate Notch signaling components and withdrawal of the cell cycle at puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that Ptpn11/Mapk/Erk1/2 and Notch signaling strengths are modulated in the postnatal muscle and that these signaling systems interact to control entry into quiescence in emerging postnatal satellite cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The generation of <italic>Ptpn11<sup>tm1.1Wbm</sup></italic> (called <italic>Ptpn11<sup>flox</sup>)</italic>, <italic>Pax7<sup>tm1(cre)Mrc</sup></italic> (called <italic>Pax7<sup>Cre</sup></italic>), <italic>Pax7<sup>tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Fan</sup></italic> (called <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic>), <italic>Gt(Rosa)26Sor<sup>tm8(Map2k1*,EGFP)Rsky</sup></italic> (called <italic>Map2k1<sup>DD</sup>)</italic> and <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(EYFP)Cos</sup></italic> (called <italic>Rosa<sup>eYFP</sup></italic>) strains were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lepper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Srinivasan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: So-ichiro Fukada (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper shows the essential role of Shp2, a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase, in muscle stem cells during postnatal development and adult muscle regeneration The authors also show that Shp2 is required for the sustained activation of Mapk/Erk1/2 in myogenic cells. Their results are complemented by additional mouse models and pharmacological approaches to modulate MAPK (ERK) signalling. These are novel and interesting results, however a number of points need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Most importantly the authors need to clarify why quiescent satellite cells are reduced in the mutant and why there is a proliferation defect. As the experiments are done, it may well be that satellite cells do not even get activated efficiently. In addition, with the data presented, an apoptosis phenotype cannot be ruled out.</p><p>More detailed comments are as follows:</p><p>1) Apoptosis:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, a</xref> reduction in the number of satellite cells lacking Shp2 is shown at P0 and P7. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, the same number of Tunel+ cells per mm2 is quantified. Wouldn't this mean that there is a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the KO mice? In addition, in this panel: Tunel+ cells do not necessarily indicate satellite cells. Are these cells Pax7+? Even if the mouse is a conditional mutant for satellite cells, other cell types could be altered (apoptotic) by the reduction of satellite cell number in conditions of muscle injury.</p><p>Similarly, a comparison of the reduction of satellite cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and the quantification of Tunel+ satellite cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> needs to be recalculated, and the influence (or not) of apoptosis re-evaluated.</p><p>2) Activation – Proliferation:</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, satellite cells lacking Shp2 do not form colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The authors indicate that they do not incorporate BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref>). There are also less Ki67+ satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). This leads to the conclusion that Shp2-null satellite cells have a proliferation defect.</p><p>Two comments to this issue:</p><p>If the satellite cells do not proliferate (they do not form colonies, or colonies only have 1 cell -see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), then it is not really clear that the cells do not incorporate BrdU. Actually, the few satellite cells remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) could all be incorporating BrdU. Can the authors improve these data?</p><p>In addition, the staining of Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) is not nuclear. Thus, are the satellite cells entering the cell cycle at all in the absence of Shp2? It may well be that they cannot reach the division point. Therefore, the conclusion that the satellite cells null for Shp2 cannot proliferate well, and they return to quiescence is a bit tight. The cells might not ever leave the quiescent state, or get activated. This set of experiments needs to be better sustained experimentally to support the conclusions, as they seem a bit contradictory.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: Shp2 plays a role in muscle hypertrophy. Therefore, is there any possibility that the loss of Shp2 in myofibers directly influences their size? Since the authors indicated the decreased myonuclei number in coShp2 mice, the loss of the satellite cell pool appears to have an impact on the decreased size of myofibers. If Shp2 has a direct effect on myofiber, the authors should discuss the dependency of Shp2 in embryonic or postnatal myofibers. As well as satellite cells, the dependency of Shp2 might be different between embryonic and postnatal myofibers.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Can the authors postulate on the origin of adipogenesis in the absence of Shp2 in satellite cells? What is the phenotype in the MEK1DD mutant mice?</p><p>If the defect of the satellite cell is activation- or cell-cycle-related, the time-points of analysis after muscle injury of 7 and 10 days are not adequate. The 7-10 time point are valid for analysis of regenerating muscle fibres, not for the prior satellite cell activation/proliferative status. 1 to 3-4 days post injury should be analysed to support the satellite cell conclusions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>; Data clearly show the decreased number of muscle stem cells. There are three ways to explain the loss of the muscle stem cell pool; a) Cell death including apoptosis, b) Premature differentiation, c) Conversion of muscle stem cells to non-myogenic cells. However, those mechanisms do not apply to this case. The authors should discuss how the number of muscle stem cells is regulated when Shp2 is conditionally abrogated in adult muscle stem cells.</p><p>In addition, the result of decreased number of satellite cells in TxcoShp2 is interesting. Why was the number of more quiescent satellite cells reduced? Did most of the satellite cells divide at least one time during 90 days? In this case, do the remaining satellite cells in TxcoShp2 have any relevance with the LRC (label retaining cells) described in Chakkalakal et al. Nature 2012? Furthermore, is the slow-dividing event essential for maintenance of the muscle satellite cell pool?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: After GS493 treatment: is there an adipogenic phenotype in the muscle?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: If satellite cells lacking Shp2 cannot proliferate (the cells show blunted clonogenic potential in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), how did the authors reach to get so many myoblasts to perform the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> – differentiation assays?

In addition, with the data presented, an apoptosis phenotype cannot be ruled out.</italic> </p><p>We observe a loss of satellite cells in the adult resting muscle that occurs exceedingly slow, as well as a fast one during injury/regeneration and in the early postnatal period. We re-investigated carefully different possible mechanisms, apoptosis, autophagy and (trans-)differentiation. We discuss each mechanism separately to address the major comment (mechanisms in the adult phase); we include in this discussion also specific comments of the reviewers that relate to this.</p><p>Sort summary and conclusion of our experiments:</p><p>The major phenotype that we observe is the withdrawal from the cell cycle/impaired proliferation. Thus, the pool of Pax7+ cells is not replenished by proliferation. Furthermore, a proportion of the Pax7+ cells continuously differentiates and expresses MyoD/MyoG, and therefore the number of Pax7+ cells decreases over time. The level of MyoD /MyoG expression and the proportions of MyoG+ cells are however comparable in control mice, and therefore we do not refer to this as ‘premature’ differentiation. It is possible that in the adult uninjured muscle a similar mechanism is at work. However, the loss of cells is slow (0.04 satellite cells/100 fibers/day) and small changes might thus account for it. Possibly, the low cell cycle activity is needed for maintenance of the satellite cell pool, but because of small numbers we cannot exclude other mechanisms. This is now commented on in the revised manuscript (subsection “Ptpn11 controls proliferation of adult satellite cells and muscle repair”, third paragraph).</p><p>In the acutely injured muscle of TxcoShp2 mice, we see in addition to the proliferation deficit an increased apoptosis at early time points after injury. This is the only condition where we observed apoptosis. These experiments were suggested by the reviewer, are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H</xref> of the revised manuscript, and are now mentioned in Abstract, Materials and methods, and Discussion.</p><p><italic>More detailed comments are as follows:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Apoptosis:</italic> </p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2, a</xref> reduction in the number of satellite cells lacking Shp2 is shown at P0 and P7.

Wouldn't this mean that there is a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the KO mice? In addition, in this panel: Tunel+ cells do not necessarily indicate satellite cells. Are these cells Pax7+? Even if the mouse is a conditional mutant for satellite cells, other cell types could be altered (apoptotic) by the reduction of satellite cell number in conditions of muscle injury.</italic> </p><p>1a) Apoptosis in the early postnatal period.</p><p>Quantification of TUNEL+ cells is shown in the revised manuscript as (i) percentage of Pax7+ cells that are TUNEL+; (ii) TUNEL+ cells/mm2 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). In addition, TUNEL staining was performed in the postnatal muscle after 2 day treatment with the GS493 inhibitor and quantified as TUNEL+ Pax7+/Pax7+ cells and as TUNEL+ cells/mm2 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). We observed in none of these assays a substantial increase in apoptotic cells. Compared to the adult situation, the loss of satellite cells in the postnatal period is fast (i.e. estimated loss of around 4 cells/100 myofibers/day between E16 and P7). We are therefore confident that we can exclude apoptosis as the mechanism responsible for the disappearance of Pax7+ cells in the early postnatal period.</p><p>b) Apoptosis in the adult resting muscle.</p><p>We observe a slow loss of satellite cells in the resting muscle of the adult after Shp2 mutation, i.e. a loss of about 70% of the cells over a 90 day period (loss of 0.04 satellite cells/100 fibers/day). Apoptosis appears not to account for this, since neither TUNEL staining nor a caspase activity assay done by FACS revealed changes in apoptosis (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>).</p><p>c) Apoptosis during the acute/inflammatory phase of injury.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we analyzed apoptosis during early time points after injury, which revealed 2.5 days after injury an increased number of apoptotic cells (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H</xref>).</p><p>d) Apoptosis during the late phase or regeneration.</p><p><italic>Similarly, a comparison of the reduction of satellite cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and the quantification of Tunel+ satellite cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> needs to be recalculated, and the influence (or not) of apoptosis re-evaluated.</italic> </p><p>To assess the function of Shp2 in the late phase of regeneration, we used short-term treatment using the GS493 inhibitor. Quantification of TUNEL+ cells is shown in the revised manuscript as (i) percentage of Pax7+ cells that are TUNEL+; (ii) TUNEL+ cells/mm2 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy/senescence</p><p>We observe no evidence for autophagy as assessed by analysis of transcriptionally regulated genes in autophagy (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Furthermore, p16 and p53 up-regulation indicative of senescence was not observed (revised manuscript; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>Differentiation/Transdifferentiation</p><p>A change in the propensity of myogenic differentiation would be accompanied by upregulated MyoD or MyoG (either protein or transcript level). We do not observe this in vivo. Transcripts of MyoD/MyoG were analyzed in coShp2 mutant satellite cells at P0 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), MyoG protein and differentiation capacity at P0 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, D</xref>), proportion of MyoG+ cells after GS493 treatment at P8 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), MyoD/MyoG transcripts in satellite cells of adult resting muscle (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), or proportion of MyoG+ cells in late injury after GS493 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F, G</xref>). These analyses have all been done multiple times and there is no doubt about their outcome. We therefore exclude ‘premature’ differentiation.</p><p>We detect no evidence for trans-differentiation in the postnatal or adult satellite cells at P0 (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>; revised manuscript Figure Dd; revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, in regeneration experiments, we observe adipogenesis in the muscle (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Previous observations suggest that adipogenesis is a general outcome when muscle cannot be regenerated e.g. in mouse models that lack satellite cells or delay formation of new myofibers, (see for instance Sambasivan, Development. 2011 138(17):3647-56; Lepper, Development. 2011 138(17):3639-46; Uezumi, Nat Cell Biol. 2010 12(2):143-52.). This was previously assigned to differentiation of FAPs. We therefore propose that adipogenesis is caused by indirect mechanisms which is now mentioned on in the revised manuscript (subsection “Ptpn11 controls proliferation of adult satellite cells and muscle repair”, third paragraph.</p><p><italic>2) Activation – Proliferation:</italic> </p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, satellite cells lacking Shp2 do not form colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The authors indicate that they do not incorporate BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref>).

This leads to the conclusion that Shp2-null satellite cells have a proliferation defect.</italic> </p><p>Signs of activation of normal satellite cells in floating fiber culture are the appearance of MyoD, pErk1/2 and Ki67. In Shp2 mutant cells we observe in &gt;90% of the satellite cells MyoD appearance, and a blunted pErk1/2 upregulation. Furthermore, Ki67 and incorporation of BrdU are observed in a subpopulation. The numbers indicate that this subpopulation (around 50%) undergoes one round of division during 3 days of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Two comments to this issue:</italic> </p><p><italic>If the satellite cells do not proliferate (they do not form colonies, or colonies only have 1 cell -see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), then it is not really clear that the cells do not incorporate BrdU.

Thus, are the satellite cells entering the cell cycle at all in the absence of Shp2? It may well be that they cannot reach the division point.</italic> </p><p>The picture displaying Ki67 staining was exchanged. Our data indicate that a subpopulation of Shp2 mutant cells expresses nuclear Ki67 at 48hrs, but levels are lower than in control cells (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, quantified in B). At 72hrs the fraction of Ki67+ cells is even smaller. Array analyses and PCR done on the postnatal satellite cells indicated that markers of various stages of the cell cycle are downregulated (G1/S-specific cyclin-E2; G1/S, S and M-specific Ranbp1; S, G2 and M phase specific Prc1; G2/M-phase specific cdk1; M-phase-specific cyclin B1 and Nusap1). This is now mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “Ptpn11 controls myogenic stem cell proliferation in postnatal mice” and in the subsection “Ptpn11 and satellite cell quiescence” of the revised manuscript, and supported by a cell cycle analysis (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C-E</xref>).</p><p><italic>Therefore, the conclusion that the satellite cells null for Shp2 cannot proliferate well, and they return to quiescence is a bit tight. The cells might not ever leave the quiescent state, or get activated.</italic> </p><p>Since &gt;90% of the satellite cells turn on MyoD in floating fiber cultures, they are entering an early stage of activation. A subpopulation initiates Ki67 expression, but they proliferate inefficiently and quickly downregulate cell cycle markers (Ki67). We independently analyze satellite activation after injury in vivo using Ki67 and pHH3 as markers for cell cycle entry and M-phase, respectively. This demonstrated that most satellite cells 2.5 days after muscle injury enter the cell cycle (Ki67 in around 70% of the cells), but few enter M-phase (pHH3 is low; revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, J</xref>). Thus, satellite cells are activated in vivo but they do not proliferate efficiently. We conclude from these series of experiments that satellite cells are transiently activated in vivo and in vitro.</p><p><italic>This set of experiments needs to be better sustained experimentally to support the conclusions, as they seem a bit contradictory.</italic> </p><p>Signs of activation of normal satellite cells in floating fiber culture are the appearance of MyoD, pErk1/2 and Ki67.

As well as satellite cells, the dependency of Shp2 might be different between embryonic and postnatal myofibers.</italic> </p><p>Others analyzed Shp2 function in the adult muscle, and observed a late onset atrophy after loss of Shp2 (11 week old mice: Fornaro, J Cell Biol. 2006 175(1):87-97). We observe a change in fiber diameter after stem cells and myonuclei numbers are reduced. We thus conclude that the atrophy is due to a deficit in the accretion of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer raises the possibility that the loss of Shp2 has distinct consequences on postnatal and embryonic fibers. The cre line used (Pax7<sup>Cre</sup>) starts to recombine around E12 in muscle progenitors. Syncytial fibers contain thus probably a (small) proportion of unrecombined nuclei. Therefore, a strong statement on a stage-specific role of Shp2 in atrophy is not possible.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Can the authors postulate on the origin of adipogenesis in the absence of Shp2 in satellite cells?</italic> </p><p>Adipogenesis is typically observed when muscle regeneration fails. Thus, we assign the pronounced adipogenesis as secondary to the failed muscle regeneration, possibly to a differentiation of FAPs as described by others (see for instance Sambasivan, Development. 2011 138(17):3647-56; Lepper, Development. 2011 138(17):3639-46; Uezumi, Nat Cell Biol. 2010 12(2):143-52.). This is mentioned in the third paragraph of the subsection “Ptpn11 controls proliferation of adult satellite cells and muscle repair”.</p><p><italic>What is the phenotype in the MEK1DD mutant mice?</italic> Our preliminary data indicate that 10 days after tamoxifen (i.e. induction of MEK1DD expression) satellite cell numbers were unchanged and not activated (no significant difference in the proportion of Ki67+ cells as in control animals). We tested regeneration in two animals (7 days after regeneration), and observed increased Pax7+ cells/mm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, similar to the in vitro situations these cells do not efficiently differentiate in vivo.</p><p><italic>If the defect of the satellite cell is activation- or cell-cycle-related, the time-points of analysis after muscle injury of 7 and 10 days are not adequate. The 7-10 time point are valid for analysis of regenerating muscle fibres, not for the prior satellite cell activation/proliferative status. 1 to 3-4 days post injury should be analysed to support the satellite cell conclusions.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we analyzed early stages of regeneration. This revealed an activation of satellite cells (appearance of Ki67 expression), a deficit in M-phase entry (strongly reduced pHH3 compared to controls), and a loss of satellite cells due to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-J</xref>). After short-term pharmacological inhibition at late stages of regeneration, premature withdrawal of the cell cycle was the only observable phenotype (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>; Data clearly show the decreased number of muscle stem cells. There are three ways to explain the loss of the muscle stem cell pool; a) Cell death including apoptosis, b) Premature differentiation, c) Conversion of muscle stem cells to non-myogenic cells. However, those mechanisms do not apply to this case. The authors should discuss how the number of muscle stem cells is regulated when Shp2 is conditionally abrogated in adult muscle stem cells.</italic> </p><p>The rate of satellite cells loss is small in the non-injured muscle when we compare Pax7cre and Pax7creShp2flox/flox mice after tamoxifen: about 70% of the cells disappear have disappeared after a 3-month period, i.e. 0.04 satellite cells/100 fibers/day. We find no evidence for cell death (TUNEL staining, caspase activity assay using FACS), no evidence for autophagy or senescence (upregulated expression of autophagy- or senescence-related genes, qPCR), no evidence for ‘premature differentiation’, i.e. upregulation of MyoD or MyoG (qPCR). Relatively small amounts of MyoD/MyoG transcripts are present in control and mutants. We hypothesize that this reflects a slow turnover/differentiation i.e. the fact that satellite cells contribute to fibers even in adult sedentary muscle (Pawlikowski, 2015 Skelet Muscle, 5:42; Keefe, 2015 Nat Commun. 6:7087). We do not find evidence for trans-differentiation into adipocytes or endothelia (qPCR). The data raise the possibility that low cell cycle activity plays a role in satellite cell maintenance. However, the very small rate of cell disappearance (i.e. loss of 0.04 satellite cells/100 fibers/day) makes it difficult to exclude alternative mechanisms. The data addressing this are shown in the revised manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and commented on in the revised manuscript (subsection “Ptpn11 controls proliferation of adult satellite cells and muscle repair”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>In addition, the result of decreased number of satellite cells in TxcoShp2 is interesting.

In addition, cells were plated at high density and low serum (5% horse serum) to ensure fast differentiation (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, the proliferation assay was performed at 3-fold lower density and in proliferation medium (15% fetal calf serum). This is now described in detail in Materials and methods (subsection “Cell and myofiber culture”).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>: Can the authors test whether satellite cells lacking Shp2 are indeed negative for Ki67 and that they do not proliferate?</italic></p><p>We tested this in postnatal and adult muscle using Ki67 immunohistology, qPCR, Ki67 and MCM2 transcripts/protein, analysis of other cell cycle markers and BrdU incorporation, in vitro, in vivo using mutants and pharmacological inhibition (revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2 —figure supplement 2A, C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B-E</xref>). The data are unambiguous- satellite cells lacking Shp2 in early postnatal or adult uninjured muscle are mostly negative for Ki67; when activated they express Ki67 for a short period and do not efficiently proliferate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
