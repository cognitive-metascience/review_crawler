numerous important biological processes including inflammation and cell death, and drives inflammatory diseases. TNF secretion requires TACE (also called ADAM17), which cleaves TNF from its transmembrane tether. The trafficking of TACE to the cell surface, and stimulation of its proteolytic activity, depends on membrane proteins, called iRhoms. To delineate how the TNF/TACE/iRhom axis is regulated, we performed an immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry screen to identify iRhom-binding proteins. This identified a novel protein, that we name iTAP (iRhom Tail-Associated Protein) that binds to iRhoms, enhancing the cell surface stability of iRhoms and TACE, preventing their degradation in lysosomes. Depleting iTAP in primary human macrophages profoundly impaired TNF production and tissues from iTAP KO mice exhibit a pronounced depletion in active TACE levels. Our work identifies iTAP as a physiological regulator of TNF signalling and a novel target for the control of inflammation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35032.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation forms part of the body's defense system against pathogens, but if the system becomes faulty, it can cause problems linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Immune cells coordinate their activity using specific signaling molecules called cytokines. For example, the cytokine TNF is an important trigger of inflammation and is produced at the surface of immune cells. A specific enzyme called TACE is needed to release TNF, as well as other signaling molecules, including proteins that trigger healing.</p><p>Previous work revealed that TACE works with proteins called iRhoms, which regulate its activity and help TACE to reach the surface of the cell to release TNF. To find out how, Oikonomidi et al. screened human cells to see what other proteins interact with iRhoms. The results revealed a new protein named iTAP, which is required to release TNF from the surface of cells. It also protects the TACE-iRhom complex from being destroyed by the cell’s waste disposal system.</p><p>When iTAP was experimentally removed in human immune cells, the cells were unable to release TNF. Instead, iRhom and TACE travelled to the cell's garbage system, the lysosome, where the proteins were destroyed. Removing the iTAP gene in mice had the same effect, and the TACE-iRhom complex was no longer found on the surface of the cell, but instead degraded in lysosomes. This suggests that in healthy cells, the iTAP protein prevents the cell from destroying this protein complex.</p><p>TNF controls many beneficial processes, including fighting infection and cancer. However, when the immune system releases too many cytokines, it can lead to inflammatory diseases or even cause cancer. Specific drugs that target TNF are not always effective administered on their own, and sometimes, patients stop responding to the drugs. Since the new protein iTAP works as a switch to turn TNF release on or off, it could provide a target for the development of new treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cytokine TNF controls numerous important biological processes (e.g. inflammation, fever, apoptosis, necroptosis, cachexia, tumorigenesis, viral infection, insulin signaling) and is heavily implicated in inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner et al., 2015</xref>). Anti-TNF biologics are the highest-selling drugs internationally and there is intense interest in how TNF signaling is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner et al., 2015</xref>). TNF is expressed by a range of cells including macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, endothelial cells and microglia and is synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein with a cytosolic domain of 76 amino acids that assembles into a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locksley et al., 2001</xref>). The capacity of TNF to trigger such pleiotropic biological outcomes is determined by its ability to activate two distinct receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locksley et al., 2001</xref>). Generally, TNFRI activation is associated with induction of acute or chronic inflammatory responses, or cell death, whereas TNFRII mediates pro-survival signals and has been associated with the tolerogenic properties of regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleijwegt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Additional complexity is imposed by the form of TNF that engages in signalling. The transmembrane form of TNF (mTNF) triggers juxtacrine signalling, while TNF released as a soluble form (sTNF), drives paracrine signalling. Notably, whereas TNFRI can be activated by both soluble and membrane TNF, TNFRII is activated efficiently only by mTNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grell et al., 1995</xref>). Whereas mTNF is sufficient for the development and maintenance of some lymphoid tissues, soluble TNF is important for acute and chronic inflammation. Specifically, mice unable to produce soluble TNF resist endotoxic shock and exhibit reduced severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruuls et al., 2001</xref>). Membrane TNF is also insufficient to rescue the defects in primary B cell follicle formation observed in TNF KO mice, but mediates protective immune responses to intracellular bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruuls et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexopoulou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The ability to engage biological outcomes that require TNFRI versus TNFRII, (and the capacity to control the physical distance over which signaling is effective) therefore, critically depends on the ability to release soluble TNF from the cell surface. This is catalyzed by the protease TACE (TNF α Converting Enzyme) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horiuchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>), also called ADAM17 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gooz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zunke and Rose-John, 2017</xref>). Crucially, TACE imposes an additional layer of versatility and regulation to TNF signaling, since in addition to cleaving TNF, both TNFRs are also physiological TACE substrates. Hence, TACE is a master orchestrator of TNF signaling, tuning signaling to fit a panoply of biological roles ranging from inflammatory responses to immune tolerance. TACE also has significant biological importance beyond TNF signaling since it cleaves other prominent substrates, including the activating ligands of the EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), an important pathway that drives growth control, tissue repair and immune responses.</p><p>Given its ability to elicit potent biological responses, it is unsurprising that TACE is stringently regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grötzinger et al., 2017</xref>). A major control point in TACE regulation involves its trafficking within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>). TACE is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a catalytically inactive precursor. For TACE to become proteolytically active, it must undergo a maturation step—removal of its prodomain—which is catalysed by proprotein convertases in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>). The exit of TACE from the ER and its trafficking to the cell surface requires regulatory proteins called iRhoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, iRhom KO mice, or cells in which iRhoms are ablated, lack TACE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christova et al., 2013</xref>). Mice null for iRhom2, whose expression is enriched in myeloid cells, cannot secrete TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siggs et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>An important checkpoint to license TACE activity involves its stimulation on the cell surface by agents including phorbol esters, Toll-like receptor agonists and G-protein coupled receptor ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grötzinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arribas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall and Blobel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wetzker and Böhmer, 2003</xref>). Importantly, as well as controlling TACE trafficking, iRhoms exist in a molecular assembly with TACE on the cell surface—the ‘sheddase complex’ which is central to stimulation of TACE sheddase activity. Within the sheddase complex, iRhom proteins serve as a platform that senses and transduces TACE-activating stimuli. These agents provoke the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic tail, which in turn triggers the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins. This enforces the detachment of TACE from iRhom2 (or triggers a conformational change within the sheddase complex) which is required to facilitate TACE’s ability to cleave its substrates, including TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, iRhoms are allosteric regulators of TACE’s proteolytic activity as well as acting as trafficking factors.</p><p>As iRhom and TACE form an intrinsic complex, their trafficking itinerary and fate within the secretory pathway must presumably be interdependent. In spite of the importance of trafficking for TACE regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>), surprisingly little is known about the machinery that controls TACE, or iRhom, trafficking to/from the plasma membrane. An exception is PACS-2 (Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting Protein 2), a protein that colocalizes with mature TACE in endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>) and controls its endocytic recycling. Ablation of PACS-2 in cells impairs the cell surface availability of TACE, reducing substrate cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>). However, PACS-2 has a relatively modest impact on TACE biology <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dombernowsky et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the possibility of unidentified trafficking regulators that may act separately from, or redundantly with, PACS-2.</p><p>As iRhoms form functionally important complexes with cell surface TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), modulation of iRhom trafficking in the endocytic pathway has the potential to act as a regulatory mechanism that controls TNF secretion.

Consistent with this, loss of iTAP results in a dramatic reduction in TACE activity and TNF secretion.

This confirmed that iTAP KO cell lines were substantially depleted of mature TACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D,E</xref>), which could be rescued specifically by iTAP overexpression in iTAP KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Overexpression of iTAP in WT cells also modestly enhanced mature TACE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and densitometric analysis confirmed once again that the loss, or reintroduction, of iTAP most profoundly affected mature TACE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, graphs).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35032.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mature TACE is specifically depleted in iTAP KO cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). iTAP was knocked out in L929, RAW 264.7 and HEK 293ET cells using CRISPR.

Alternatively, as TACE undergoes constitutive recycling from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>) and iRhom2 traffics to the cell surface and enters the endolysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), iTAP could stabilize iRhom/TACE complexes on the plasma membrane or within the endocytic pathway. Given the established role of FERM domain proteins in stabilizing proteins on the cell cortex, this second possibility seemed plausible.</p><p>To investigate the impact of iTAP on iRhom2 stability, we first used RAW 264.7 cells. These macrophage-like cells express high levels of endogenous iRhom2, making its detection more feasible than in HEK 293ET cells or MEFs. Strikingly, endogenous iRhom2 was depleted in iTAP KO RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that iTAP is essential to maintain iRhom2 stability. Consistent with this, in HEK 293ET cells, iTAP transient overexpression increased steady state levels of overexpressed iRhom2-HA and enhanced the half-life (see graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) of the protein, during a timecourse of cycloheximide (CHX) treatment, used to block additional protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This experiment, in which iRhom2 was expressed from an artificial promoter, indicates that the impact of iTAP on iRhom2 levels is independent of transcription. As anticipated by these results, transiently overexpressed iRhom2-HA was also destabilized in iTAP KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Two major possibilities exist to explain the decreased half-life of iRhom2 in iTAP KO cells: in the absence of iTAP, iRhom2 may be degraded in the early secretory pathway (the ER), or in the late secretory pathway (lysosomes). To address this, we used Endo-H deglycosylation to discriminate between the impact upon iTAP overexpression on the Endo-H-sensitive pool of iRhom2 in the ER, versus the Endo-H-insensitive fraction that has entered the later secretory pathway. As anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zettl et al., 2011</xref>), most overexpressed iRhom2 is Endo-H sensitive, hence still located within the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Strikingly, the co-expression of iTAP increased the overall levels of iRhom2, but selectively enriched the post-ER fraction of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting a disproportionate impact on the form of iRhom2 that had traversed to the late secretory pathway.</p><p>To obtain additional insights, we used a binding assay, coupled to deglycosylation analysis, to compare which species of iRhom2 bind to iTAP. Cells were treated with or without DSP, a thiol-reducible cell-permeable cross-linker, to covalently trap complexes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>), enabling us to discriminate between interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>, compared to potential adventitious binding post-lysis. After immunoprecipitation, samples were treated with DTT to reverse the cross-linking. Notably, compared to IPs done without cross-linking, iTAP IPs from cross-linked cells showed a clear enrichment for post-ER (Endo-H insensitive) iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), although the ER-localized form of iRhom2 was also readily detected. Taken together with the colocalization data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we propose that the loading of iTAP onto the sheddase complex occurs already in the ER but the binding is sustained throughout the sheddase complex’s itinerary in the late secretory pathway, where iTAP’s affinity for iRhom2 appears to be higher. These data are consistent with the finding that iTAP selectively affects mature TACE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, ruling out a requirement for iTAP in controlling the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of iRhom2, we found that the ER exit of iRhom2 was unimpaired in iTAP KO cells, judged by the presence of Endo-H-resistant iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, although iTAP binds to the sheddase complex in the early secretory pathway, its impact appears to be more decisive in the late secretory pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>iTAP modulates the plasma membrane stability of iRhom2 and TACE by preventing their aberrant sorting to the lysosome</title><p>As ablation of iTAP results in dramatically reduced iRhom2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and iTAP increases the abundance of post-ER iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>), we hypothesized that iTAP controls the stability of iRhom2 in the late secretory pathway. Consistent with this premise, cell surface biotinylation experiments revealed that iTAP expression increased the steady state levels of cell surface iRhom2, and prolonged its cell surface stability, when CHX was used to block additional protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In further agreement, the co-expression of iTAP with GFP-iRhom2 in MEFs enhanced the amount of GFP-iRhom2 detected on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), supporting the premise that iTAP promotes the cell surface stability of iRhom2.

To test the hypothesis that loss of iTAP triggers the degradation of iRhom2 and TACE in lysosomes, the major degradative compartment in the late secretory pathway, we examined the localization of mCherry-iRhom2 in WT or iTAP KO HeLa cells derived by CRISPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, in WT HeLa cells, mCherry-iRhom2 did not co-stain appreciably with lysosomes. By sharp contrast, iTAP ablation resulted in a pronounced co-localization of iRhom2 with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2), indicating mis-sorting of iRhom2 to lysosomes. This phenotype was specific since the co-transfection of iTAP-GFP into iTAP KO HeLas rescued the aberrant accumulation of mCherry-iRhom2 in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), resulting in the marked co-localization of iRhom and iTAP observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

The phenotype observed in (<bold>A</bold>) is reverted upon the co-expression of iTAP-GFP, resulting in no co-localization of mCherry-iRhom2 with endogenous LAMP2. (<bold>C</bold>). WT or iTAP KO RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 50 µM Chloroquine (CQ) for 48 hr, 100 µM Bafilomycin (Baf) for 16 hr, or 10 mM ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) for 48 hr and endogenous iRhom2 levels were detected by western blotting. Actin or tubulin were used as loading controls and the Transferrin Receptor (TfR) acts as a control for the inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases. (<bold>D</bold>). Lysates from cells treated with Baf as described above, were conA-enriched and probed for TACE on a western blot. Tubulin and TfR are controls for loading and lysosomal inhibition, respectively.

In the left-hand panel, eGFP-iRhom2 was stably expressed in WT MEFs (expressing endogenous iTAP) in the presence of lysosomal marker LAMP1-mCherry, and the subcellular localization of both proteins was imaged in live cells using confocal microscopy in the absence (upper row) or presence (lower row) of 10 µM Chloroquine. The results indicate that iRhom2 alone is trafficked into the lysosomes. In the right-hand panel, WT MEFs stably expressing TACE-GFP and LAMP1-mCherry in the presence of 10 µM Chloroquine were imaged similarly. The results indicate that TACE alone does not localize in lysosomes (upper row).

In conclusion, our data reveal that when the normal stoichiometric ratio of iTAP to iRhom2 is disrupted (e.g. upon iRhom2 overexpression or iTAP ablation), iRhom2 is mis-sorted into the lysosome, then degraded.

Our current and previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that trafficking to, and degradation within, the lysosome is a default itinerary incurred by iRhom2, and that iRhom2 potentially encodes the determinants that lead to the default trafficking of iRhom2 and TACE to the lysosome. We now show that iTAP is essential to stabilize iRhom2 on the cell surface, preventing the routing of the sheddase complex to the lysosome, and licensing TACE to cleave its substrates for signaling (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). iTAP, hence, emerges as an important regulator of inflammation and growth factor signaling, during development, normal physiology, infection and inflammatory disease.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35032.030</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model showing regulation of the cell surface stability of the sheddase complex by iTAP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). In WT cells the iRhom2/TACE sheddase complex successfully transits from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where TACE undergoes maturation (prodomain removal). The sheddase complex then traffics to the cell surface, where TACE cleaves it substrates (e.g. TNF, EGFR ligands), enabling their release for signaling. iTAP, which loads onto the sheddase complex in the ER, remains associated with the sheddase complex and ensures the stability of the complex on the cell surface, promoting the cleavage of TACE substrates. (<bold>B</bold>). By contrast, in iTAP KO cells, the sheddase complex is aberrantly sorted to the lysosome, where iRhom2 and mature TACE are degraded. As a result, no TACE substrates are released for signaling. The dotted arrows indicate a putative itinerary taken by the sheddase complex in iTAP KO cells. The sheddase complex may be destabilized on the cell surface: aberrantly targeted for endocytosis and shunted to the lysosome. Alternatively, the sheddase complex may be endocytosed from the cell surface at the normal rate, but loss of iTAP may result in a defect in recycling the complex back to the cell surface, favouring delivery to the lysosome.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35032-fig8-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35032.031</object-id><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>iTAP does not bind to features commonly recognized by FERM domain proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). iTAP appears not to have a high affinity for actin.

A general theme is that FERM-domain proteins connect the cytoplasmic tails of cell surface client proteins to the cortical actin cytoskeleton to enhance their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoover and Bryant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baines et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>). While iTAP binds to the cytoplasmic tails of iRhoms, which are found on the plasma membrane, our preliminary experiments failed to detect robust binding of iTAP to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Besides, we have not identified predicted actin binding motifs in the C-terminus of iTAP. Future experiments will be required to determine precisely how iTAP stabilizes iRhom and TACE in the late secretory pathway.</p><p>Some FERM-domain proteins are implicated in endosomal sorting, the process whereby endocytosed proteins are sorted in early endosomes, for routing to the multi-vesicular body, lysosome, <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi network, recycling endosome or, alternatively, ‘fast’ recycling back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen, 2008</xref>). Analogous to the degradation of iRhom2 in iTAP KO cells, loss of Snx17, which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of β1 integrins, results in a failure in their endocytic recycling, leading to their degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böttcher et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the iRhom2 cytoplasmic tail contains two motifs, NxxY and NPxY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>) that are the consensus endocytic signals recognized by a subset of FERM-domain containing sorting nexins, involved in endocytic recycling. However, our preliminary experiments in which we have mutated those motifs to alanines (AAAA), show that they appear not to be required for iTAP/iRhom2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, although sorting nexins are intimately connected with the endocytic/recycling machinery, our preliminary experiments detect no obvious colocalization of iTAP with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Endocytic sorting is however only one theme within the wider FERM biology. Future studies will be required to clarify the relationship between iTAP and the trafficking machinery, to map the vesicular itinerary taken by iRhom/TACE complexes, and to establish the precise basis of the mis-sorting defect in iTAP-null cells.</p><p>It will also be interesting to reconcile the role of iTAP in the control of iRhom/TACE stability, versus that of PACS-2, which binds directly to TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dombernowsky et al., 2015</xref>). iTAP and PACS-2 both impact on TACE stability, but iTAP can presumably only influence TACE stability indirectly via iRhoms. This is relevant because TACE stimulants trigger detachment of TACE from iRhom2 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), a mechanism important for facilitating access of TACE to its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). As iRhom and TACE are uncoupled at a crucial stage during signaling, their degradative fates could also be separated, leaving open the possibility that iTAP and PACS-2 may govern different stages in TACE’s trafficking lifecycle.</p><p>The TNF (and EGFR) pathway(s) are very stringently regulated by positive and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vereecke et al., 2009</xref>). Considering the significant impact that iTAP has on TACE biology, it is tempting to speculate that feedback control over the signaling pathways that culminate in TNF or EGFR ligand release, could be governed by controlling the interaction between iTAP and iRhom, or by modulating the stability of iTAP itself. Our preliminary experiments suggest that the phosphorylation of iRhom2 at residues required for the stimulation of TACE activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>) does not appear to influence iTAP binding (data not shown), but future studies are required to investigate more widely the possibility of iTAP regulation by stimuli relevant to TACE biology.</p><p>In addition to our extensive evidence indicating the requirement for iTAP for normal TACE function in human and mouse cells, we show that mature TACE levels are dramatically depleted in tissues from iTAP KO mice, including macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This reinforces the notion that iTAP is an important physiological regulator of the sheddase complex at the organismal level, in multiple tissues. Notably, whereas ADAM17 homozygous mutant mice exhibit perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peschon et al., 1998</xref>), iTAP KO mice are born at near-normal mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), reach adulthood, appear superficially healthy and are fertile.

versions of human iRhom1, the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhom1 (amino acids 1–404), mouse iRhom2, mouse Rhbdd2, human RHBDD3 and mouse Ubac2 were cloned into the lentiviral expression plasmid pLEX-MCS, using Gibson cloning. These plasmids were used only for the respective mass spectrometry experiments. C-terminally triple FLAG-tagged iTAP and mouse iRhom2-HA were cloned into the retroviral pM6P vector (a kind gift of Felix Randow) using Gibson assembly. The N-terminal truncations of iRhom2 used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were cloned into a modified version of the lentiviral expression vector pLEX-MCS in which the puromycin resistance cassette was replaced with a blasticidin resistance gene. The packaging vectors for the production of retrovirus or lentivirus were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). A Cherry-tagged iRhom2 plasmid previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2016</xref>) was used only for the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. LAMP1-mCherry was subcloned from Addgene plasmid #45147 (a gift from Amy Palmer) into pM6P vector with zeocin resistance (prepared by replacing the blasticidin resistance gene in the original vector with zeocin resistance). Mouse eGFP-iRhom2 and mouse TACE-GFP were cloned using Gibson assembly into pM6P.HisD vector. Mouse TACE-TagRFP was cloned using Gibson assembly into pM6P.Blast, using Addgene plasmid #42635 (a gift from Silvia Corvera) as a source of TagRFP DNA and a mTACE-GFP plasmid from Jürgen Scheller as a source of mTACE cDNA. Murine iTAP-mCherry (iTAP cDNA from Origene Technologies) and mCherry-iRhom2 were cloned using Gibson assembly into pM6P.Blast. Human iTAP was inserted with standard cloning techniques into the eGFP containing pIC111 vector (pIC111 is gift from Iain Cheeseman and Arshad Desai; Addgene plasmid # 44435). Alkaline phosphatase-tagged TACE substrates, a gift of Shigeki Higashiyama were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>). V5-tagged ADAM expression plasmids and secreted luciferase construct were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christova et al., 2013</xref>). CRISPR plasmids are described below. Human Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) containing an N-terminal FLAG tag, was cloned into pCR3 by standard techniques. Flag-tagged SREBP2 was a gift of Larry Gerace and STING-FLAG a gift of Lei Jing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>, iRhom2-HA in a modified version of pEGFP-N1/non EGFP was used as a template for Quick-Change mutagenesis resulting in the constructs iRhom2 NPAY &gt;AAAA, iRhom2 NRSY &gt;AAAA and iRhom2 Double NxxY &gt;AAAA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Our work involved the use of cell lines.

Macrophage differentiation was induced using recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, 100 ng/ml) over five-seven days during cell culture in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS. Primary human macrophages (5 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were nucleofected with 200 nM of each siRNA (control NS oligo, MWG Eurofins - 5'- guuccugagccuggacuac −3'; iTAP oligo #1, Santa Cruz - catalog code sc-96500; iTAP oligo #2, GE Dharmacon - M-018955-01-0005; TACE oligo #1, Santa Cruz - sc-36604; TACE oligo #2, GE Dharmacon - M-003453-01-0005) in nucleofection buffer (5 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.2]) using Amaxa Nucleofector (program Y-010).

For the ablation of iTAP in human cells, HEK 293ET cells (2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup>/ cm<sup>2</sup>) were transfected using Fugene with pLentiCRISPR v2 empty vector, or either of the pLentiCRISPR-derived sgRNA plasmids described above. The next day, the cells were selected with puromycin (8 µg/mL) for 3 days until mock transfected cells were eliminated. Cells were expanded and single-cell sorted by FACS or serial dilutions on 10 cm culture plates. To screen for the presence of indels in clones, genomic DNA was extracted from each clone and a 200 bp region flanking the site targeted by the gRNA was amplified for exon 1 (forward = 5’-CCTCCAGCCCCCCATCCCTGGCTC-3’; reverse = 5’-GCCAGAGCTACTTCTCCAGGGCTGGGG-3’) or exon 4 (forward = 5’-TCGGGAGAGGGGAGGGCTAAGCAG-3’; reverse = 5’-GGGCAAGGTGCGAATGTCCAGGGGTC-3’).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;iTAP, a novel iRhom interactor, controls TNF secretion by policing the stability of iRhom/TACE&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Christopher G Burd (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Oikonomidi et al. addresses the role of a newly identified protein that associates with iRhom, which the authors call iTAP. The results suggest that iTAP, iRhom2, and TACE form a tripartite complex in cells, and that the elimination of iRhom or iTAP impairs activation of TACE. It is further shown that the stability of these proteins is compromised in the absence of the other subunits and the authors suggest that this is due to lysosome-mediated turnover. Finally, it is shown in mouse and human macrophages that iTAP is necessary for shedding of TNF. Altogether, a strong case is made that iTAP is a component of a TACE complex required for physiological TNF shedding. The trafficking data, particularly those used to argue for lysosomal turnover, are less definitive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Direct protein binding interactions are not demonstrated. The text should clearly make this distinction or this should be demonstrated using pure proteins (or fragments thereof).</p><p>2) The interpretation of the TACE levels and processing patterns presented in Figure 5 is problematic. The Figure 5B blots of the L929 and RAW cell material show one band that does not appear to co-migrate with the unprocessed or mature forms of TACE that are produced by the HEK and MEF cells (indicted with arrows). The interpretation of the EndoH, F experiments presented in Figure 5C depends critically on this. In panel 5C, the lower band of the EndoF-treated samples is considered the mature form, but no mature form is visible in the untreated lanes. This suggests that TACE is being proteolyzed during the Endo treatments, rather than in cells. Please explain and/or repeat the experiment in a manner that controls for non-physiological proteolysis.</p><p>3) The reviewers felt that the conclusion that iTap promotes the 'stability' of TACE, and hence cell surface residence, is not sufficiently supported by the data. It is not apparent from the data shown in Figure 6 that turnover rate of any of the three proteins is reduced by overexpression of iTAP. The cycloheximide chase data shown in Figure 6 needs to be quantified, In Figure 5E, which form of TACE is biotinylated at the cell surface (see point 2)?</p><p>Related, throughout the text it is proposed that the proteolytic activity of TACE is affected by loss of iRhom or iTAP, but this is never directly tested and this information is critical for understanding the roles of iTAP and iRhom. The legend from Figure 4 serves as an example: &quot;Figure 4. KO of iTAP diminishes TACE proteolytic activity.&quot; The proteolytic activity of surface associated TACE on control versus iTAP (and/or IRhom) null cells should be quantified; is it that the specific activity of cell surface TACE is reduced or that there is simply less TACE on the cell surface? It is noted that there is a commercial TACE enzyme assay using a fluorogenic Peptide Substrate Mca-PLAQAV-Dpa-RSSSR-NH2 (R&amp;D systems).</p><p>4) Figure 6E The doublet that is referred to in the text is not apparent. While the endo F treatment does appear to collapse the material to a more prominent band compared to endoH (suggesting that some of the material is endo H resistant), these data are not very compelling. Either the data need to convincingly show the two bands that are referred to, or the experiment should not be included in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The conclusion that FRMD8 prevents lysosome-mediated degradation of mature TACE is inferred from the recovery of mature TACE protein level by lysosomotropic agents, but it is never directly demonstrated that TACE (or iRhom) is delivered to the lysosome. Absent more information about sorting of the iRhom/iTAP/TACE complex (does the complex promote recycling to the plasma membrane? limit rate of endocytosis?, etc.), this should be explicitly shown and could be easily addressed by comparing immunofluorescence patterns of TACE and a lysosome resident.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35032.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Direct protein binding interactions are not demonstrated.

The interpretation of the EndoH, F experiments presented in Figure 5C depends critically on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the resolution in the original Figure 5B made it difficult to discern the immature versus mature species of TACE. Heavily glycosylated proteins, like TACE, are often difficult to separate effectively by electrophoresis. We note that, as for many glycoproteins, differential glycosylation in different cell lines may change the relative mobility of the two TACE species. This is precisely why we used deglycosylation (current Figure 4C, D) to improve the resolution. This is a standard technique often applied to glycoprotein analysis.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have now improved the separation of immature/mature TACE by improving the denaturation/reducing conditions (0.5% SDS and 50 mM DTT; increasing the denaturation temperature to 95°C). We believe that the resultant new panel in Figure 4B makes it easier to discern the immature/mature TACE species.</p><p>We have added new panels of the deglycosylation experiments (new Figure 4C, D) which we believe resolve the immature vs mature species of TACE much better. Finally, we note that we have used multiple iTAP KO cell lines of different species (human, mouse) all of which reveal the same effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In panel 5C, the lower band of the EndoF-treated samples is considered the mature form, but no mature form is visible in the untreated lanes.</p></disp-quote><p>A potential explanation is that heterogeneity in the molecular weight of differently glycosylated species of mature TACE results in a diffuse electrophoretic migration of the mature species. This then becomes a much sharper (i.e., more visible) band when deglycosylated with PNGAse F into a single species. We observed this in our previous studies (Adrain et al., 2012). We believe that the resolution is improved in the new panels (new Figure 4 C, D) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This suggests that TACE is being proteolyzed during the Endo treatments, rather than in cells. Please explain and/or repeat the experiment in a manner that controls for non-physiological proteolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that this is a consequence of proteolysis. In addition to the comments above, we note that the bands revealed by PNGase F are of precisely the anticipated molecular weight corresponding to deglycosylated TACE minus only its prodomain (Schlondorff, Becherer and Blobel, 2000). Second, the lysis conditions of all of our experiments, pre- and post-revision, included a robust cocktail of protease inhibitors (Aprotinin (2ug/ml, Leupeptin (2 μg/ml), Pepstatin A (1 µg/ml) and AEBSF (80 µM)) in addition to the metalloprotease inhibitor 1-10 phenanthroline (10 mM)(Schlöndorff et al., 2000). Further, the deglycosylation reactions were performed on heat-denatured/reduced protein samples containing 0.5% SDS and 50 mM DTT. To reiterate, we believe that the major issue is the heterogeneity in glycans and the known difficulty in the electrophoretic resolution of heavily glycosylated proteins which can only be accurately resolved by deglycosylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers felt that the conclusion that iTap promotes the 'stability' of TACE, and hence cell surface residence, is not sufficiently supported by the data. It is not apparent from the data shown in Figure 6 that turnover rate of any of the three proteins is reduced by overexpression of iTAP. The cycloheximide chase data shown in Figure 6 needs to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this conclusion was not demonstrated sufficiently in the original version. We have now addressed this issue by examining the cell surface stability of iRhom2 (new Figure 5G). We find that the co-expression of iTAP increases the steady state levels of cell surface iRhom2 as well as the stability over a timecourse (new Figure 5G). In addition we have quantitated the experiment in Figure 5B and are now able to conclude that iTAP expression increases the half-life of iRhom2 (from 1.3 hours in the control, to 4.4 hours in cells expressing iTAP).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5E, which form of TACE is biotinylated at the cell surface (see point 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point which we have now clarified fully. We provide additional experiments which indicate, as anticipated from previous studies (Schlondorff, Becherer and Blobel, 2000), that mature TACE is the only form found (biotinylated) at the cell surface. This new data (Figure 4F, right hand panel) is included alongside the original cell surface biotinylation experiment (now Figure 4F, left hand panel). The PNGase F reactions indicate that the only species found on the cell surface of WT cells is the mature TACE. This band is depleted in the iTAP KO cells and is not found on the cell surface of iTAP KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related, throughout the text it is proposed that the proteolytic activity of TACE is affected by loss of iRhom or iTAP, but this is never directly tested and this information is critical for understanding the roles of iTAP and iRhom. The legend from Figure 4 serves as an example: &quot;Figure 4. KO of iTAP diminishes TACE proteolytic activity.&quot; The proteolytic activity of surface associated TACE on control versus iTAP (and/or IRhom) null cells should be quantified; is it that the specific activity of cell surface TACE is reduced or that there is simply less TACE on the cell surface? It is noted that there is a commercial TACE enzyme assay using a fluorogenic Peptide Substrate Mca-PLAQAV-Dpa-RSSSR-NH2 (R&amp;D systems).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we have introduced ambiguity by referring to “proteolytic activity”. We have changed the relevant paragraph headings to read “iTAP-deficient cells are impaired in the shedding of TACE substrates” and “Mature TACE is specifically reduced in iTAP-deficient cells”. We have also amended the text carefully to refer to proteolytic activity only where it is strictly appropriate.</p><p>Our data demonstrates (1) that mature TACE (i.e. the proteolytically active form) is specifically depleted in iTAP KO cells (Figure 4) and further (2) that cell surface levels of mature TACE are substantially reduced in iTAP KO cells (Figure 4F). These observations are sufficient to reconcile why the release of TACE substrates is defective, without having to invoke the possibility of altered specific activity.</p><p>Unfortunately, it would be extremely difficult to make a side-by-side comparison of the specific activity of equal amounts of mature TACE in WT cells, versus the minority of mature TACE that survives in iTAP KO cells. This would require a specific method to isolate <italic>equal</italic> amounts of <italic>only</italic> the mature species. However, as a useful surrogate, we have now carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> peptide hydrolysis assays to determine the activity of TACE in WT versus iTAP KO cells. These data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) show that the activity of TACE in immunoprecipitates from iTAP KO cells is, as expected, significantly reduced.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that iTAP KO cells have reduced capacity to release TACE substrates because mature (active) TACE is depleted, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6E The doublet that is referred to in the text is not apparent. While the endo F treatment does appear to collapse the material to a more prominent band compared to endoH (suggesting that some of the material is endo H resistant), these data are not very compelling. Either the data need to convincingly show the two bands that are referred to, or the experiment should not be included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the deglycosylation data with endogenous iRhom2 is more difficult to resolve, as noted in our previous work (Adrain et al., 2012). However, this panel specifically examines endogenous, not overexpressed, iRhom2 in a setting (macrophage-like cells) highly relevant for iRhom2 biology. It also comes to the same conclusion as our experiment in which overexpressed iRhom2 was analyzed. Rather than removing the data completely, we propose to move this ‘endogenous’ experiment to the supplementary data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). The overexpression experiment (new Figure 5F) will be used as the major evidence that iRhom2 leaves the ER in iTap KO cells, with the ‘endogenous’ experiment providing additional reinforcement in the figure supplement. We hope that this is a suitable solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The conclusion that FRMD8 prevents lysosome-mediated degradation of mature TACE is inferred from the recovery of mature TACE protein level by lysosomotropic agents, but it is never directly demonstrated that TACE (or iRhom) is delivered to the lysosome. Absent more information about sorting of the iRhom/iTAP/TACE complex (does the complex promote recycling to the plasma membrane? limit rate of endocytosis?, etc.), this should be explicitly shown and could be easily addressed by comparing immunofluorescence patterns of TACE and a lysosome resident.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the paper needed strengthening in these aspects and thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have now added several pieces of new data to address these issues:</p><p>1) As suggested by the reviewer, we now show using fluorescence microscopy that in iTAP KO cells, iRhom2 is delivered to the lysosome (Figure 6A). This defect is rescued by re-expressing iTAP in the KO cells (Figure 6B). This is consistent with our original biochemical experiments that used lysosomotropic drugs to reach the same conclusion.</p><p>2) In a gain-of-function model we show that overexpression of TACE alone does not result in its recruitment to the lysosome, presumably because it is not present at stoichiometric ratios with iRhom2. By contrast, over-expressed iRhom2 leads to its recruitment to the lysosome (Figure 6E) and, in turn, recruits TACE to the lysosome too. This suggests that, in the absence of normal iTAP stoichiometry to iRhom2, the sheddase complex (e.g. TACE, iRhom2) is subject to a default trafficking itinerary to the lysosome.</p><p>3) Further, we show that iTAP does not colocalize with early endosomes (Figure 8—figure supplement 1D), implying that it is not a direct component of the endocytic trafficking machinery and is hence unlikely to directly promote recycling or directly impinge on endosomes.</p><p>4) In addition, we show that iTAP expression increases the steady state levels of cell surface iRhom2 as well as the cell surface stability of the protein (Figure 5G).</p><p>In summary, relating the role of iTAP to the wider themes amongst FERM domain biology, we can conclude that iTAP does not form an intimate connection with the endocytic recycling machinery. Instead, iTAP’s apparent role appears to more closely resemble the canonical function of FERM domain proteins in stabilizing (anchoring) membrane proteins on the cell surface.</p></body></sub-article></article>
