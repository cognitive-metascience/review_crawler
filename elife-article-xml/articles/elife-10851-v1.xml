Cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits govern most aspects of meiotic chromosome function, but whether Wapl regulates these complexes remains unknown. We show that during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oogenesis WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of cohesin containing COH-3/4 kleisins, but not REC-8, demonstrating that sensitivity to WAPL-1 is dictated by kleisin identity. By restricting the amount of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin, WAPL-1 controls chromosome structure throughout meiotic prophase. In the absence of REC-8, WAPL-1 inhibits COH-3/4-mediated cohesion, which requires crossover-fated events formed during meiotic recombination. Thus, WAPL-1 promotes functional specialization of meiotic cohesin: WAPL-1-sensitive COH-3/4 complexes modulate higher-order chromosome structure, while WAPL-1-refractory REC-8 complexes provide stable cohesion. Surprisingly, a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin before metaphase I. Our studies provide insight into how meiosis-specific cohesin complexes are regulated to ensure formation of euploid gametes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10851.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10851.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10851.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of the genetic material of plant and animal cells is stored in structures called chromosomes. Nearly all the cells in the body contain two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from the mother and the other from the father, but sex cells – such as egg and sperm – contain just one copy of each. If eggs or sperm contain the wrong number of copies of a chromosome, genetic disorders such as Down syndrome can occur.</p> <p>New sex cells form in a process called meiosis, which begins with a cell that contains two copies of each chromosome duplicating each of these copies. The duplicated copies are known as sister chromatids, and are held together by a ring-like protein complex called cohesin. In addition to tethering sister chromatids, cohesin affects the ‘higher-order’ organization of chromosome structure and promotes the recruitment of other proteins that are essential for different aspects of chromosome behavior during meiosis. Therefore, regulating cohesin binding during meiosis is key to ensuring that sex cells contain the correct number of chromosomes.</p> <p>Cohesin is ultimately removed from chromosomes in two steps during the consecutive cell divisions at the end of meiosis, resulting in the formation of sex cells containing a single copy of each chromosome. However, whether cohesin is actively removed from chromosomes during early meiosis, when chromosomes undergo dramatic structural changes, is not known.</p> <p>Using a combination of microscopy and genetic techniques to study the developing egg cells of the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Crawley et al. investigated how a protein called WAPL-1 affects cohesin binding to chromosomes during early meiosis. This revealed that WAPL-1’s effects depend on the identity of a particular subunit of the cohesin complex. If this subunit is a protein called COH-3 or COH-4, WAPL-1 reduces the ability of cohesin to bind to chromosomes during the early stages of meiosis. However, WAPL-1 does not affect cohesin complexes that instead feature a protein called REC-8 as this subunit.</p> <p>By preventing excessive binding of COH-3 and COH-4 cohesin, WAPL-1 regulates chromosome structure and sister chromatid cohesion during early meiosis. Crawley et al. further observed that during the stage preceding the first meiotic division, cohesin is removed from chromosomes by a mechanism that does not involve WAPL-1.</p> <p>The next challenge is to work out why cohesin containing the REC-8 protein is protected from being released by WAPL-1. Whether defects in this protection can trigger the premature separation of sister chromatids is also an important question to answer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10851.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10851.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Meiosis</kwd><kwd>Cohesin</kwd><kwd>Sister chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>Chromosome structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-A652-5PY60</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-Perez</surname><given-names>Enrique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By specifically antagonizing binding of complexes carrying COH-3/4 kleisins, WAPL-1 regulates chromosome structure and cohesion throughout meiotic prophase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins take part in complexes that associate with DNA to promote key events of the cell cycle, such as chromosome condensation and segregation, DNA repair, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeppsson et al., 2014</xref>). The cohesin complex, which mediates sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) between S-phase and chromosome segregation at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>), consists of two SMC proteins (Smc1 and Smc3) plus a kleisin subunit (Scc1/Rad21), forming a tripartite structure that topologically embraces DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haering et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haering et al., 2008</xref>). A fourth cohesin subunit (Scc3) binds to the kleisin and is also required for the functionality of the complex, while other proteins associate temporarily with cohesin to regulate its binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haarhuis et al., 2014</xref>). Cohesin is loaded to chromosomes by the Scc2/4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>), and SCC is established during DNA replication in a process that involves acetylation of Smc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). SCC is ultimately dissolved at anaphase onset, when cleavage of the kleisin subunit by the protease separase triggers the segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uhlmann et al., 1999</xref>). Proper establishment and release of SCC is also essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division program that produces haploid gametes from diploid germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petronczki et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the separase-dependent removal of cohesin at anaphase onset, a pathway dependent on the Wapl protein removes cohesin from chromosomes at earlier stages of the cell cycle in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandhi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). Wapl is thought to destabilize the interaction between the kleisin and Smc3 subunits, allowing the release of cohesin from DNA without catalytically cleaving any subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2014</xref>). Cohesin complexes in which the Smc3 subunit is acetylated during DNA replication become resistant to Wapl and remain stably bound to DNA, thereby providing persistent SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lopez-Serra et al., 2013</xref>). However, acetylated cohesin is also removed from chromosome arms during prophase and early prometaphase in mammalian cells, when phosphorylation of Scc3 and Sororin, a protein that antagonizes Wapl, renders these complexes sensitive to Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hauf et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishiyama et al., 2013</xref>). This mode of cohesin removal is known as the prophase pathway and its failure in cells lacking Wapl causes increased arm cohesion in metaphase chromosomes and defects in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Waizenegger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haarhuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>). Removal of Wapl before S-phase causes a large increase in chromatin-associated cohesin and dramatic changes in chromosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>), demonstrating that Wapl is a key regulator of SCC and chromatin organization throughout the mitotic cell cycle.</p><p>Cohesin is an essential component of meiotic chromosomes, not only by mediating SCC, but also by promoting the acquisition of structural features required for meiotic chromosome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNicoll et al., 2013</xref>). Meiotic chromosomes are organized as linear arrays of chromatin loops, which are attached at their base to cohesin-containing proteinaceous axial elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleckner, 2006</xref>). Proper assembly of axial elements during early prophase is required for subsequent pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes. Crossovers formed during recombination, together with SCC, form attachments between homologous chromosomes (chiasmata) that are responsible for the correct orientation of chromosomes on the first meiotic spindle and ultimately for their correct partitioning during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petronczki et al., 2003</xref>). Crucially, these events require the formation of axial elements containing meiosis-specific cohesin complexes in which the mitotic kleisin Scc1 is substituted by Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>). Moreover, additional meiosis-specific kleisins beyond Rec8 have been identified in mouse (Rad21L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrán et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>) and in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the highly homologous and functionally redundant COH-3 and COH-4 kleisins associate with SMC-1 and SMC-3 to form cohesin complexes that associate with meiotic chromosomes independently of REC-8 cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Although Rad21L and COH-3/4 are not essential for SCC, these kleisins are required for pairing and recombination between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, large amounts of Rad21L and COH-3/4 are removed from chromosomes before metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrán et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), and a prophase pathway has recently been proposed to operate during late meiotic prophase in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether Wapl induces cohesin removal at any stage of meiotic prophase in animals, and whether Wapl may regulate some of the functions of different meiosis-specific cohesin complexes is not known.</p><p>Using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line, which contains a complete time course of meiotic prophase, we demonstrate that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin binding from the onset of meiosis, and show that cohesin complexes containing the COH-3/4 kleisins are specifically targeted by WAPL-1. By antagonizing the binding of COH-3/4 complexes to axial elements, WAPL-1 acts as a regulator of meiotic chromosome structure and SCC. Moreover, we also show that SCC is modulated by WAPL-1 and recombination during the chromosome remodeling process that starts at the end of pachytene, and report that a WAPL-1-independent mechanism removes cohesin during the oocyte maturation process preceding metaphase I.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WAPL-1 is required for fertility</title><p>In order to investigate the role of WAPL-1 during meiotic prophase, we used a deletion allele, <italic>wapl-1(tm1814)</italic>, that removes the first two exons of the <italic>C. elegans Wapl</italic> homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

During oogenesis, each meiotic division results in the formation of a polar body that contains a full complement of homologs (meiosis I) or sister chromatids (meiosis II). Polar bodies are extruded away from the egg pronucleus, localizing on the cortex and not contributing to the genetic content of the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). All <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos analyzed formed two polar bodies, however, only 22% of post meiotic embryos (up to the two-cell embryo) displayed both polar bodies at the cortex, with most embryos (61%) displaying one polar body located away from the cortex and the remaining (11%) displaying both polar bodies away from the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). In addition, we noticed that chromatin morphology in the polar bodies was altered in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants, often displaying separated DNA masses within the polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To gain better understanding of the effect of WAPL-1 on polar body extrusion, we performed live imaging of the meiotic and early mitotic divisions in wild type and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos expressing histone H2B::mcherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D;</xref> <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). These experiments confirmed that most <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos display defects in the extrusion of the second polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). We also observed that in 2 out of 11 <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos, the second polar body, which failed to migrate to the cortex, underwent chromatin decondesation and condensation cycles, mimicking the changes observed in the mitotic nuclei of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">3</xref>). Moreover, in 1 out of 11 filmed embryos the second polar body eventually fused with one of the mitotic nuclei generated after the first mitotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), demonstrating that the failure in polar body extrusion of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants can lead to aneuploidy in the embryo. We also used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to investigate if chromosome non-disjunction occurs during the meiotic divisions of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants. Labeling of the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V in early embryos demonstrated that the oocyte pronucleus contained one single signal for the 5S rDNA in all embryos analyzed from wild-type (17) and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants (17) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that chromosome V segregates properly during the meiotic divisions in the absence of WAPL-1. This analysis demonstrates that WAPL-1 is required to ensure proper polar body extrusion during the meiotic divisions, and suggests that defects in this process may contribute to the embryonic lethality observed in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10851.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>WAPL-1 is required for polar body extrusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projections of fixed embryos at the 1- or 2-cell stage stained with DAPI, arrowheads point to the position of polar bodies generated during the meiotic divisions.

In order to understand better the effect of WAPL-1 on the organization of axial elements, we investigated chromosome structure in pachytene nuclei of <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> double mutants, since lack of SYP-1 prevents SC assembly without affecting the formation of axial elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>). Late pachytene nuclei of <italic>syp-1</italic> mutant germ lines displayed many long and thin HTP-3 tracks, corresponding to individualized and elongated axial elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, late pachytene nuclei of <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> double mutants contained fewer HTP-3 tracks, which also appeared bulkier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggested that axial elements were much shorter, and/or the presence of some kind of SC-independent association between axial elements, in <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> double mutants. Visualization of the 5S rDNA locus on chromosome V by FISH showed that this region was unpaired in most pachytene nuclei of both <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> double mutants, demonstrating that increased association of homologous axial elements is not responsible for the overall reduction in total axial element length observed in <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, visualization of the X chromosome pairing center region using HIM-8 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) demonstrated that at late pachytene, when this region becomes separated in <italic>syp-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), each HIM-8 signal is associated with a short track of axial element in <italic>syp-1 wapl-1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, removal of WAPL-1 induces dramatic changes in the overall organization of axial elements in pachytene nuclei.</p><p>Since cohesin loading during early meiosis is an essential step in the assembly of axial elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lightfoot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Llano et al., 2012</xref>), and Wapl antagonizes stable cohesin binding before S-phase in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>), we investigated whether WAPL-1 regulates the morphogenesis of axial elements at meiosis onset. In order to visualize all cohesin complexes in the germ line we used CRISPR to add a C-terminal GFP tag on the endogenous <italic>smc-1</italic> gene. Homozygous <italic>smc-1::GFP</italic> worms are viable and healthy and, as expected, the SMC-1::GFP protein is present in all germline and somatic nuclei. To clearly define the onset of meiotic prophase (leptotene stage), we stained germ lines of SMC-1::GFP wild type and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant worms with PLK-2 antibodies, as PLK-2 forms aggregates on the nuclear envelope of leptotene nuclei to promote homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labella et al., 2011</xref>). In wild-type germ lines, the presence of elongated SMC-1::GFP structures (axial elements) coincided with the appearance of PLK-2 aggregates (8 out 8 germ lines), while nuclei preceding the formation of PLK-2 aggregates displayed diffuse SMC-1::GFP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, the appearance of elongated SMC-1::GFP structures preceded the formation of PLK-2 aggregates in transition zone nuclei of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant germ lines (7 out of 8 germ lines, average of 5 nuclei per germ line) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, transition zone nuclei in which chromosome clustering has not yet occurred display the highest intensity of WAPL-1 staining in the whole germ line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that high levels of WAPL-1 activity may be present in these nuclei. These observations suggest that WAPL-1 regulates the timing of axial element assembly by antagonizing cohesin association with chromosomes during early meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>WAPL-1 regulates chromosome remodeling at the end of pachytene</title><p>During late pachytene meiotic chromosomes initiate a major remodeling process that includes the ordered disassembly of the SC, chromosome condensation and changes in axial element composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>). Whether the early steps of this process involve major changes in the association of cohesin with chromosomes is not known, but imaging of SMC-1::GFP in wild-type germ lines demonstrated that a diffuse pool of nuclear SMC-1::GFP starts accumulating in late pachytene, becoming very prominent in diplotene and diakinesis oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This staining pattern suggests that there is strong expression of <italic>smc-1</italic> during late prophase, but that most of this SMC-1 remains unbound to chromosomes, and/or that cohesin is actively removed from axial elements during these stages. In contrast, a diffuse pool of SMC-1::GFP is not observed in late prophase nuclei of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, while axial elements labeled by SMC-1::GFP remained as easily traceable linear structures in diplotene nuclei of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants, they appeared as longer and more diffuse structures in wild-type oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggests that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin binding during late pachytene and diplotene stages. Interestingly, the intensity of nuclear GFP::WAPL-1 undergoes an increase during late pachytene and diplotene compared with earlier prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that WAPL-1 activity may be increased during these stages.</p><p>In addition to the increased amount of cohesin associated with diplotene chromosomes, <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants display other defects in the chromosome remodeling process. First, diplotene nuclei in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants do not show the coiling of axial elements that is characteristic of this stage in wild-type germ lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>) and instead axial elements visualized by SMC-1::GFP or anti-HTP-1 antibodies display a more linear appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Second, <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants display altered SC disassembly, as evidenced by the persistence of long tracks of SC component SYP-1 in diplotene oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). These observations suggest that cohesin removal by WAPL-1 is an intrinsic feature of chromosome remodeling during late pachytene and diplotene.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>WAPL-1 regulates the levels of chromosome-bound COH-3/4 cohesin complexes, but not REC-8 complexes</title><p>The evidence presented above strongly suggests that <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants undergo meiotic prophase with increased levels of axis-associated cohesin. During <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis cohesin complexes carrying different kleisin subunits, either REC-8 or the highly homologous and functionally redundant COH-3 and COH-4, associate with axial elements to ensure efficient SCC and crossover formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasierbek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Thus, we used anti-REC-8 and anti-COH-3/4 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to determine the staining pattern of the different meiotic cohesin complexes in the presence and absence of WAPL-1. Upon initial observation, the intensity of REC-8 staining appeared very similar in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant germ lines and wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the COH-3/4 signal was clearly increased in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A quantitative analysis of the mean nuclear intensity of REC-8 and COH-3/4 staining between leptotene and late pachytene confirmed that <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant germ lines display increased levels of COH-3/4 throughout meiotic prophase, with the highest differences detected in late pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The same results were obtained using a COH-3-specific antibody, instead of the COH-3/4 used above, and anti-GFP antibodies to determine the staining of REC-8::GFP expressed from a single copy, and fully functional, transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>). In order to confirm that removal of WAPL-1 causes an increase in the levels of axis-associated COH-3/4, we also performed a line profile analysis of REC-8, COH-3/4 and SMC-3 intensity across late pachytene nuclei. This analysis allows a direct comparison of the signal intensity associated with axial elements versus the intensity observed in the inter-chromosomal regions of the same nucleus. The average difference between axis-associated and inter-chromosomal signal for COH-3/4 was increased by 114% in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants compared with wild-type controls, while the increase observed for REC-8 and SMC-3 was 27% and 59% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The intermediate increase of axis-associated SMC-3 levels is to be expected since SMC-3 should form part of both REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin complexes. Separation of soluble and DNA-bound protein fractions from whole-worm extracts confirmed that the amount of COH-4 associated with DNA is increased in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants compared to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of WAPL-1 there is a large increase in the amount of cohesin associated with axial elements, and most of this increase corresponds to cohesin complexes containing the COH-3/4 kleisins.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10851.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>WAPL-1 antagonizes binding of COH-3/4 cohesin to axial elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projections of pachytene nuclei stained with the indicated antibodies and DAPI.

The presence of between 7 and 12 chromatin masses in diakinesis oocytes indicates defects in the formation of chiasmata, while defects in SCC typically result in oocytes containing more than 12 chromatin bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although gross loss of SCC in diakinesis oocytes requires the simultaneous depletion of REC-8, COH-3 and COH-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tzur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), REC-8 appears to play a more prominent role in mediating SCC than COH-3/4. For example, removal of REC-8 from <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants, which fail to form meiotic DSBs, induces extensive separation of sister chromatids in oocytes, and removal of REC-8 from mutants lacking the SC results in oocytes with separated sisters and extensive chromosome fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colaiácovo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>).

These observations, together with the finding that WAPL-1 antagonizes the association of COH-3/4 with axial elements, led us to investigate if the antagonistic effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 may be responsible for the compromised cohesion in mutants lacking REC-8. We first tested if removing WAPL-1 from <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants had an effect on SCC observed in oocytes. Strikingly, the presence of detached sister chromatids was dramatically reduced in the oocytes of <italic>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</italic> triple mutants, which displayed an average of 11.2 DAPI-stained bodies, while diakinesis oocytes of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants displayed an average of 19.1 DAPI-stained bodies, demonstrating that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesion in <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Crucially, cohesion observed in <italic>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8</italic> oocytes is mediated by COH-3/4, since sister chromatids were separated in oocytes of <italic>wapl-1 spo-11 rec-8 coh-3 coh-4</italic> quintuple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>).

The extensive presence of small chromosome fragments with irregular shapes in <italic>rec-8 syp-1</italic> oocytes made manual quantification of the number of DAPI-stained bodies impractical. Thus, we used CellProfiler to determine the boundaries and area (in pixels) of each DAPI-stained body in projections of diakinesis oocytes. By imaging diakinesis oocytes from wild type, <italic>coh-3 coh-4</italic> double mutants and <italic>rec-8 spo-11</italic> double mutants we were able to calibrate the area range corresponding to bivalents, univalents and sister chromatids respectively. Despite the fact that some overlap of chromosomes occurs in projections of diakinesis oocytes, this automated method clearly identifies the predominant types of chromatin bodies known to be present in each of the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on this analysis, chromosome fragments were defined by an area smaller than 120 pixels and 49% of chromatin bodies in <italic>syp-1 rec-8</italic> oocytes fell within this category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast, chromosome fragments only accounted for 10% of chromatin bodies in <italic>wapl-1 rec-8 syp-1</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). This reduction in chromosome fragments was accompanied by a large increase in the number of chromatin bodies corresponding to univalents. Thus, WAPL-1 is largely responsible for the chromosome fragmentation and sister separation seen in <italic>rec-8 syp-1</italic> oocytes, likely by antagonizing COH-3/4 cohesin. We further tested this possibility by building a <italic>coh-4 rec-8</italic> double mutant, in which we hypothesized that the presence of a single meiotic kleisin (COH-3) should result in a worsening of the cohesion defects observed in <italic>rec-8</italic> single mutants. In agreement with this, 25% of chromatin bodies in <italic>coh-4 rec-8</italic> oocytes had an area corresponding to chromosome fragments, while this number was reduced to 8% in <italic>wapl-1 coh-4 rec-8</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>).

However, we considered the possibility that the formation of inter-sister recombination events during the repair of SPO-11 DSBs leads to the formation of sister attachments in <italic>rec-8</italic> oocytes. To test this hypothesis we built worms lacking REC-8 and COSA-1, a protein required for the late stages of crossover formation but not for the induction of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>).

Thus, WAPL-1 affects meiotic prophase events by promoting cohesin removal from the beginning of meiosis, not just as part of a meiotic prophase pathway that removes cohesin during the late stages of chromosome condensation in preparation for the first meiotic division. Importantly, we have uncovered that cohesin complexes containing the COH-3/4 kleisins, rather than REC-8, are the main targets of WAPL-1, showing that kleisin identity is key in determining the sensitivity of meiotic cohesin to WAPL-1 activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>WAPL-1 regulates meiotic chromosome structure</title><p>Similar to mitotic prophase chromosomes, meiotic chromosomes are organized as linear arrays of sister-chromatid loops that are attached at their base to a proteinaceous axial element containing cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleckner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). Under this organization, the shape of chromosomes is largely determined by the size of chromatin loops and by the compaction exerted by axial elements on loop bases, two parameters that must be regulated by proteins localizing to axial elements. In fact, the meiosis-specific subunit Smc1β, which localizes to axial elements, regulates the organization of chromatin loops and the length of axial elements in mouse pachytene oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Novak et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that a key role of meiosis-specific cohesin complexes may be to modulate the higher-order organization of chromosomes. Our studies provide strong support for this hypothesis. First, the formation of SMC-1-labelled axial elements is observed in nuclei before the onset of meiotic prophase (leptotene) in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants, but not in wild-type germ lines. Interestingly, the intensity of GFP::WAPL-1 is at its highest in nuclei preceding leptotene, suggesting that WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin binding from the onset of meiosis and that the regulation of WAPL-1 levels, and presumably its activity, may be coupled to meiotic progression. Second, in pachytene nuclei removal of WAPL-1 causes a dramatic increase in the levels of chromosome-associated COH-3/4 cohesin and shortening of axial elements, consistent with COH-3/4 complexes acting as regulators of axis compaction. Shortening of axial elements is also observed in yeast cells lacking <italic>wpl1</italic> (A. Shinohara personal communication), consistent with our findings. Interestingly, we observed that the shortening of axial elements caused by the absence of WAPL-1 is exacerbated in mutants lacking the SC, hinting that the SC is somehow capable of antagonizing cohesin’s ability to induce compaction of axial elements.</p><p>In contrast to COH-3/4, REC-8 levels remain similar to wild-type controls throughout meiotic prophase of <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant germ lines. The specific effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 complexes is consistent with the finding that REC-8 and COH-3/4 display clear differences in their timing and mechanism of loading during early prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), and may help to explain some of the functional differences between REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin. For example, the fact that REC-8 complexes are refractory to the removal activity of WAPL-1 is consistent with these complexes playing a prominent role in providing cohesion, while COH-3/4 promote SC assembly in a cohesion-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Similarly, mouse Rad21L promotes homolog pairing without playing a direct role in cohesion, presumably by regulating higher-order structure of chromosomes during early prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). A clear precedent for cohesin affecting chromosome topology independently of cohesion is observed when Wapl is removed from mammalian cells before S-phase, which causes unscheduled condensation of unreplicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that by antagonizing the stable association of COH-3/4 cohesin to axial elements, WAPL-1 acts as a major regulator of meiotic chromosome structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Why are COH-3/4, but not REC-8, complexes sensitive to WAPL-1?</title><p>The finding that WAPL-1 has a strong antagonistic effect on the chromosomal association of COH-3/4, but not REC-8, suggests that some property of REC-8 cohesin must make these complexes refractory to the removal activity of WAPL-1. In mitotic cells, Wapl is thought to mediate cohesin removal by triggering opening of an 'exit gate' present at the interface delimited by the interaction between the N-terminal region of Smc3 and the Scc1 kleisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huis in 't Veld et al., 2014</xref>). Opening of this interface by Wapl is antagonized by acetylation of two conserved lysines in Smc3, a process that is mediated by the acetyl transferase Eco1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Under unchallenged growth conditions, Smc3 acetylation only occurs during DNA replication, since Eco1 is degraded after S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lyons and Morgan, 2011</xref>). Thus, cohesin that associates with chromosomes during G2 is not acetylated and shows a rapid turnover mediated by Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, REC-8 is the only meiosis-specific kleisin subunit that appears to be loaded to chromosomes during S-phase in mice and worms, while Rad21L (mice) and COH-3/4 (worms) are loaded post S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Thus, a plausible explanation for our observations is that only REC-8 forms part of cohesin complexes in which SMC-3 is acetylated, while COH-3/4 associate with non-acetylated SMC-3 and therefore are sensitive to WAPL-1. However, mechanisms that protect cohesin from the removal activity of Wapl independently of Smc3 acetylation have been described in yeast and human mitotic cells. For example, DSBs induce the establishment of Wpl1-resistant cohesion during G2 by a mechanism involving Eco1-mediated acetylation of Scc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of Eco1 after meiotic S-phase induces chromosome segregation defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, suggesting that Eco1 is functional during meiotic prophase, although the targets of Eco1 in this case remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weng et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to acetylation by Eco1, the presence of DNA damage also induces Scc1 sumoylation, which is required for establishment of cohesion and sister chromatid-mediated homologous repair during G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McAleenan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). If posttranslational modifications on REC-8, or another subunit of REC-8 complexes, are required to antagonize the releasing activity of WAPL-1, untimely loss of these modifications could lead to premature release of REC-8 cohesin, compromising chromosome segregation during the meiotic divisions. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that prevent removal of REC-8 complexes by WAPL-1 during meiotic prophase remains an important goal for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cohesion is modulated by WAPL-1 and recombination during late prophase chromosome remodeling</title><p>Our results indicate that cohesin removal by WAPL-1 is an important aspect of the chromosome remodeling process that starts during late pachytene and that involves SC disassembly and changes in chromosome condensation. In organisms as diverse as <italic>Sordaria</italic> and mouse (oocytes), visualization of cohesin during late prophase demonstrates that the emergence of compacted chromosomes attached by chiasmata is preceded by the large disappearance of axial elements as continuous linear structures, and by the accumulation of diffuse cohesin staining in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prieto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storlazzi et al., 2008</xref>). We report that WAPL-1 promotes loosening of axial element structure and accumulation of soluble cohesin during late prophase in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that a Wapl-dependent weakening of cohesin-mediated chromosome organization may be a general feature of late prophase chromosome remodeling. Importantly, this wave of WAPL-1-mediated cohesin removal has a direct impact on the ability of COH-3/4 complexes to provide cohesion following the completion of chromosome remodeling. In the absence of REC-8, attachment of sister chromatids in diakinesis oocytes requires COH-3/4 cohesin and SPO-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Severson et al., 2009</xref>), but since sister chromatids are attached in pachytene nuclei of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), loss of cohesion must occur during the process of chromosome remodeling via an unknown mechanism. By showing that removal of WAPL-1 causes a rescue of cohesion in oocytes of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants and that this rescue requires COH-3/4 cohesin, we clearly identify WAPL-1 as a factor that antagonizes COH-3/4-mediated cohesion during late prophase.</p><p>Our investigation of the mechanisms that mediate cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants has uncovered an important role for recombination in the modulation of cohesion during late meiotic prophase. The requirement of DSBs for cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants has been explained by the existence of a mechanism similar to the break-induced cohesion observed in mitotic yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>). Under this model, DSBs trigger establishment of COH-3/4 cohesion via a mechanism involving CHK-2-mediated phosphorylation of COH-3/4. However, we show that removal of COSA-1, a protein that localizes to chromosomes during late pachytene and that is not required for the formation and early processing of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>), causes loss of cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants. Therefore, the presence of DSBs alone is not sufficient to induce COH-3/4 cohesion that persists in diakinesis oocytes. Instead, tethering of sister chromatids in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutant oocytes appears to require the presence of crossover-fated recombination events. This requirement would explain the lack of cohesion in diakinesis oocytes of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic>, which fail to initiate recombination, and in oocytes of <italic>syp-1 rec-8</italic> double mutants, since SYP-1 is required for crossover formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, SC proteins are thought to load between sister chromatids in mouse and worm mutants lacking REC-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>), suggesting that SC-promoted recombination intermediates may form between sister chromatids in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants. In agreement with this possibility, crossover designation appears to occur normally in <italic>Sordaria rec8</italic> mutants, which also display SC formation between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storlazzi et al., 2008</xref>). Since sister chromatids are not separated in pachytene nuclei of <italic>spo-11 rec-8, syp-1 rec-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>) or <italic>cosa-1 rec-8</italic> (this study), and removal of WAPL-1 from these three mutants restores cohesion in diakinesis oocytes, the antagonistic effect of WAPL-1 on COH-3/4 cohesion must occur after pachytene exit. Our studies identify chromosome remodeling as a key stage in the modulation of cohesion during meiotic prophase, and suggest that a complex interplay between late crossover precursors and WAPL-1 plays an important role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Active cohesin removal during meiotic prophase and human aneuploidy</title><p>An essential aspect of meiotic chromosome segregation is ensuring that chiasmata remain intact until the onset of anaphase I. This issue is particularly relevant to human fertility, as oocytes establish chiasmata during fetal development, but then arrest at the dictyate stage, with the first meiotic division only taking place at ovulation, up to several decades later. In fact, cohesion deterioration in arrested oocytes has been proposed as a contributing factor to explain why the incidence of aneuploidy increases dramatically with maternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagaoka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbert et al., 2015</xref>). Data from different mouse models offer support for this possibility. First, partial loss of cohesin before metaphase I in oocytes of mice lacking Smc1β (a meiosis-specific Smc1 subunit) causes the dissolution of chiasmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodges et al., 2005</xref>). Second, Rec8-mediated cohesion is not regenerated during late stages of meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>) and Smc1β expressed before birth is sufficient to ensure chiasma maintenance throughout adult age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Revenkova et al., 2010</xref>). Third, age-related deterioration of bivalents is observed in oocytes from <italic>Smc1β</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Revenkova et al., 2010</xref>), as well as in oocytes from old (long lived) wild-type mice that also display defects in chromosome segregation and depletion of cohesin from chromosomes before anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lister et al., 2010</xref>). These observations are consistent with the view that cohesin deterioration could be an important contributor to human aneuploidy. However, the mechanisms responsible for cohesin depletion in aged oocytes are not known, with possible explanations including decay of cohesin molecules over time and leaky separase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessberger, 2012</xref>). We have found that two different mechanisms actively remove cohesin during late prophase as part of normal meiotic progression: First, WAPL-1 antagonizes cohesin during chromosome remodeling and second, a WAPL-1-independent wave of cohesin removal occurs during oocyte maturation. These findings could be relevant to human aneuploidy, as excessive cohesin removal by the WAPL-1-dependent or independent mechanisms identified here could compromise maintenance of chiasmata before the onset of anaphase I, inducing errors in chromosome segregation during the meiotic divisions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics</title><p>All strains were maintained at 20°C and the N2 strain was used as the wild-type control.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior Editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Both reviewers felt that the manuscript presented some important new information, albeit not totally unexpected. However, several further experiments are required to solidify the paper:</p> <p>Essential requirements:</p> <p>1) Quantification/numbers analysed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E-G; 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">7A, B</xref> must be provided.</p> <p>2) A proper analysis of non-disjunction events in single WAPL-1 mutants.</p> <p>3) The reviewers believe that the work is descriptive and would be helped significantly by a molecular analysis showing increased cohesion association with chromatin in WAPL-1 mutants. If this is not feasible, a deeper phenotypic analysis that gives more insight would bring this work to a more meaningful conclusion.</p> <p>Other reviewer comments that would improve the paper:</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, figure legend: It is not stated in the legend what the arrowheads are pointing to in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. &quot;While SMC-1::GFP tracks preleptotene nuclei of WAPL-1 mutants, in which DAPI staining also shows increased condensation&quot;. To me, the chromosomes in the WAPL-1 mutant look less condensed rather than more. Furthermore, there is no accompanying description/quantitation in the Results section of this important observation. A key point of the manuscript is the effect of WAPL-1 on meiotic chromosome structure, so this needs strengthening.</p> <p>Figure legend 3F: &quot;Note the axial elements become elongated and, twisted with a more diffuse appearance in wild-type nuclei compared to wapl-1 mutant nuclei.&quot; The twisting is difficult to see so should be pointed out as in an enlarged inset.</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A,B</xref>: The figure (A) qualitatively shows the increased axial staining of COH-3/4 and the fluorescent intensity calculations (B) appear to be total rather than DNA specific. It would be more informative to quantitate the amount bound to DNA given the authors are trying to show an increased level of chromosome bound COH-3/4 in WAPL-1 mutants. This could be shown as the relative intensity/DAPI or the DAPI signal could be used as a mark to only calculate what is chromosome bound. […]</p> <p>The assay is explained in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (&quot;6 DAPI-stained bodies (WT) indicates the presence of 6 bivalents etc&quot;), however some accompanying explanation in the Results section would help the reader as I suspect most would be more familiar with chromosome loss or uneven segregation assays in meiosis.</p> <p>The effect of the <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutation on chromosome compaction is not very convincing. The argument for this is based on cytological images and measurements of axes lengths. The measurement of axis lengths is confounded by chromosome overlap. From the images presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A,C</xref>) it is not obvious that axes are shorter. In the measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the effect is subtle. Is it statistically significant? A better measure of chromosome compaction would be to look at distinct loci on a single chromosome by FISH.</p> <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, are the 5S rDNA foci further apart in the <italic>wapl-1</italic> cells?</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10851.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p> <italic>Essential requirements:</italic> </p> <p> <italic>1) Quantification/numbers analysed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E-G; 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">7A, B</xref> must be provided.</italic> </p> <p>We have added the following quantifications:</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>: We have quantified the mean intensity of the GFP::WAPL-1 in premeiotic nuclei, transition zone nuclei (leptotene/zygotene), and in late pachytene nuclei. Differences in GFP::WAPL-1 intensity between premeiotic and leptotene nuclei, and between leptotene and late pachytene nuclei are significant. Graph showing this quantification is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>): Short axial elements corresponding to the X chromosomes (as indicated by HIM-8 staining) that can be traced along their entire length in projections of late pachytene nuclei are found in 3 out of 3 <italic>syp-1 wapl-1</italic> double mutant germ lines. In contrast, X chromosome axial elements cannot be traced on projections of late pachytene nuclei from syp-1 mutants due to extensive overlap of axial elements. We now indicate this on the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and we have also added a figure with a <italic>syp-1</italic> and a <italic>wapl-1 syp-1</italic> example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>): We have performed new experiments to investigate the distribution of SMC-1::GFP at the onset of meiotic prophase in WT and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants. Specifically, we have used PLK-2 antibodies to clearly delimit the onset of meiotic prophase. This analysis has confirmed that tracks of SMC-1::GFP in nuclei preceding the onset of meiotic prophase are only observed in wapl-1 mutants. We now indicate in the main text the number of germ lines analyzed (8 in both WT and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants) and the average number of pre-leptotene nuclei displaying SMC-1::GFP tracks per germ line. The new data including PLK-2 staining is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. We have also added a new figure showing SMC-1::GFP staining in nuclei spanning the stages between preleptotene and early pachytene in WT and wapl-1 mutant germ lines, as images containing this section of the germ line (much larger than that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) help to visualize the differences in axial element organization between WT and wapl-1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>): We have quantified the average intensity of nuclear soluble SMC-1::GFP in diplotene nuclei, confirming that signal intensity is significantly higher in WT nuclei than in wapl-1 mutant nuclei. This quantification is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p> <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>): We have added the average number of DAPI-stained bodies observed in each genotype to the panels showing diakinesis oocytes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

We have added a table to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (panel C) in which we show the analysis of SMC-1::GFP reduction during late diakinesis in 14 WT germ lines and 26 wapl-1 mutant germ lines. In addition, we have added a further example of the distribution of SMC-1::GFP during late diakinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p> <p> <italic>2) A proper analysis of non-disjunction events in single WAPL-1 mutants.</italic> </p> <p>We have taken two complementary approaches to investigate if defects in chromosome segregation during the meiotic divisions occur in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos. First, we have significantly extended our in vivo analysis of meiotic chromosome segregation by filming 11 <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant and 14 wild type embryos. This new data demonstrates that the second polar body fails to be extruded in most (7/11) <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos, confirming our previous results on fixed embryos. Crucially, the new in vivo data reveals that the second polar body undergoes cycles of chromatin condensation and decondensation, mimicking the cell cycle of the oocyte pronucleus first and then mitotic nuclei, and that eventually chromosomes in the second polar body can fuse with the content of a mitotic nucleus. This demonstrates that the defects in polar body extrusion observed in <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants induce the formation of embryos carrying abnormalities in chromosome number, likely contributing to the embryonic lethality that we report. This data is presented on a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which includes a table summarizing the findings from all filmed embryos, as well as in 3 supplemental Movies. Second, we have used FISH to directly assess the segregation of chromosome V during the meiotic divisions. This analysis in 17 WT and 17 <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant embryos shows that all analyzed oocyte pronuclei contained a single copy of chromosome V, demonstrating normal segregation of chromosome V during the meiotic divisions. Although this FISH analysis cannot rule out segregation defects of the other five chromosomes present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, our in vivo data clearly demonstrates that wapl-1 mutant embryos are defective in the extrusion of the second polar body and that this defect contributes to produce chromosomally abnormal embryos.</p> <p> <italic>3) The reviewers believe that the work is descriptive and would be helped significantly by a molecular analysis showing increased cohesion association with chromatin in WAPL-1 mutants. If this is not feasible, a deeper phenotypic analysis that gives more insight would bring this work to a more meaningful conclusion.</italic> </p> <p>We have performed protein fractionation experiments to investigate the subcellular localization of COH-4 in whole-worm extracts prepared from WT controls and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants. These new experiments demonstrate that in the absence of WAPL-1 most COH-4 is associated with DNA, while in its presence the amount of COH-4 in the soluble fraction is higher than in the DNA-bound protein fraction. These new experiments confirm that WAPL-1 restricts COH-4 binding to chromosomes, fully supporting our previous observations based on the analysis of cohesin distribution by immunostaining. We have also attempted to analyze the distribution of REC-8 by protein fractionation, but unfortunately available anti-REC-8 antibodies do not work well on western blots. The new data is presented in panels D and E of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, with additional controls shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p> <p> <italic>Other reviewer comments that would improve the paper: Figure legend 3F &quot;Note the axial elements become elongated and, twisted with a more diffuse appearance in wild-type nuclei compared to</italic> wapl-1</p> <p> <italic>mutant nuclei.&quot; The twisting is difficult to see so should be pointed out as in an enlarged inset.</italic> </p> <p>We have included insets in the SMC-1::GFP panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> to magnify specific chromosomal regions from diplotene nuclei of WT and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants, facilitating the comparison of axial element organization in the two genotypes.</p> <p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 A,B</xref>: The figure (A) qualitatively shows the increased axial staining of COH-3/4 and the fluorescent intensity calculations (B) appear to be total rather than DNA specific.

This could be shown as the relative intensity/DAPI or the DAPI signal could be used as a mark to only calculate what is chromosome bound. […]</italic></p> <p>We agree with this point. The quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (previously 4C) shows the amount of chromosome-associated cohesin. As shown on the top left panel of the figure, we used DAPI intensity to identify the position of chromosomes within the nucleus and then measured the value of cohesin subunits (COH-3/4, REC-8, or SMC-3) on chromosomal regions, as well as in regions lacking DAPI signal (inter chromosomal domains). Using this method we calculated the increment of cohesin staining specifically associated with chromosomes.</p> <p> <italic>The assay is explained in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (&quot;6 DAPI-stained bodies (WT) indicates the presence of 6 bivalents etc&quot;), however some accompanying explanation in the Results section would help the reader as I suspect most would be more familiar with chromosome loss or uneven segregation assays in meiosis.</italic> </p> <p>We have added an explanation on the main text to clarify how the number of DAPI-stained bodies in diakinesis oocytes can be used to determine defects in cohesion (subsection “WAPL-1 antagonizes SCC mediated by COH-3/4 during late prophase”).</p> <p> <italic>The effect of the</italic> wapl-1 <italic>mutation on chromosome compaction is not very convincing. The argument for this is based on cytological images and measurements of axes lengths. The measurement of axis lengths is confounded by chromosome overlap. From the images presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 A,C</xref>) it is not obvious that axes are shorter. In the measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the effect is subtle. Is it statistically significant? A better measure of chromosome compaction would be to look at distinct loci on a single chromosome by FISH.</italic> </p> <p>Although chromosome overlaps occur in projections of pachytene nuclei stained with HTP-3 antibodies, the goal of this experiment was not be able to trace the six (paired) axial elements corresponding to the six pairs of homologs along their entire lengths, but rather to calculate the total length of HTP-3 tracks per nucleus, which can be easily obtained despite some overlaps. The differences in total HTP-3 length per nucleus between WT and <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutants are statistically significant (indicated in figure legend). Of note, chromosome overlap is much higher in projections of WT pachytene nuclei than in projections from <italic>wapl-1</italic> mutant pachytene nuclei, where it is often possible to trace 6 individual linear tracks (each corresponding o a pair of homologous chromosomes) (see also new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p> <p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, are the 5S rDNA foci further apart in the wapl-1 cells?</italic> </p> <p>Images shown are projections of 3D stacks and therefore calculating distances between signals corresponding to homologous chromosomes would require taking into account distances on Z the axis. While the data clearly shows that homologous chromosomes are separated in most pachytene nuclei of both <italic>syp-1</italic> and <italic>syp-1 wapl-1</italic> double mutants (see quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we have not attempted to quantify absolute distances between 5S rDNA signals on pachytene nuclei.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
