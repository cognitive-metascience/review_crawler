proteins to promote infection. Here we identify host proteins that bind the Zika virus (ZIKV) sfRNA. We identified fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) as a ZIKV sfRNA-binding protein and confirmed this interaction in cultured cells and mouse testes. Depletion of FMRP elevated viral translation and enhanced ZIKV infection, indicating that FMRP is a ZIKV restriction factor. We further observed that an attenuated ZIKV strain compromised for sfRNA production was disproportionately stimulated by FMRP knockdown, suggesting that ZIKV sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Importantly, ZIKV infection and expression of ZIKV sfRNA upregulated endogenous FMRP target genes in cell culture and ZIKV-infected mice. Together, our observations identify FMRP as a ZIKV restriction factor whose activity is antagonized by the sfRNA. Interaction between ZIKV and FMRP has significant implications for the pathogenesis of ZIKV infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39023.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Certain mosquitoes can carry pathogens that are able to infect humans, including Zika and dengue viruses. Most people infected with Zika virus only develop mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. But if the virus infects a pregnant woman, it can lead to miscarriage and other pregnancy complications, or cause severe birth defects in her unborn baby.</p><p>Viruses must infect the cells of a host to multiply. To do so, they hijack the cellular machinery to make proteins needed to copy their genetic material and assemble new virus particles. The genetic material of Zika virus is made of ribonucleic acid (RNA). When the Zika virus infects cells, pieces of the virus RNA, known as subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (or sfRNAs for short), accumulate in the cell.</p><p>Cells infected with dengue virus, which is closely related to the Zika virus, also accumulate sfRNA. Dengue sfRNA is known to bind to and inhibit the activity of specific proteins in cells that would otherwise block the virus from multiplying. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether the sfRNA from Zika virus performs a similar role.</p><p>Soto-Acosta et al. searched for human proteins that could bind to Zika sfRNA and may affect the ability of the virus to multiply. The experiments showed that a protein known as FMRP, which, when faulty, is linked to a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems, binds to Zika sfRNA in human and mouse cells infected with Zika virus. FMRP inhibits the production of virus proteins in the cells and limits the ability of the virus to multiply. However, as Zika sfRNA gradually accumulates during infection, the sfRNA binds to FMRP and interferes with its activity, allowing the virus to multiply more efficiently. Soto-Acosta et al. also found that Zika sfRNA affects the ability of FMRP to regulate the production of other proteins that are normally found in cells.</p><p>These findings suggest that the interference of the virus with FMRP may contribute to Zika disease in humans. Moreover, a mutant Zika virus unable to produce sfRNA could be developed into a vaccine to potentially prevent Zika.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Zika virus</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI089526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Blanco</surname><given-names>Mariano A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007865</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Medical Branch</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Blanco</surname><given-names>Mariano A</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradrick</surname><given-names>Shelton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI101431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Blanco</surname><given-names>Mariano A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Pei-Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007130</institution-id><institution>University of Texas System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STARs award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Pei-Yong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012394</institution-id><institution>Robert J.

There are three ZIKV genotypes: one from Asia, which has caused the recent pandemic in the Americas, and two from Africa (East and West African) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lanciotti et al., 2016</xref>). ZIKV infection is characterized by fever, arthralgia and conjunctivitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goeijenbier et al., 2016</xref>) and was considered an exceedingly rare human infection since only 14 cases were reported prior to 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faye et al., 2014</xref>). In 2007, the first ZIKV outbreak caused by an Asian lineage was reported in Micronesia, followed by epidemics in French Polynesia in 2013 and the recent pandemic (2015â2016) in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weaver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aliota et al., 2017</xref>). During this period, it has been estimated that 1.5 million cases occurred in Brazil and more than 25,000 cases in Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Focosi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Samarasekera and Triunfol, 2016</xref>). As of January 2018, the virus was widely distributed in 50 countries in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">PAHO/WHO, 2018</xref>). The public health concern about Zika has been primarily driven by its maternal-fetal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasil et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Driggers et al., 2016</xref>) and sexual modes of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deckard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hills et al., 2016</xref>) as well as its association with congenital abnormalities, especially microcephaly, and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Krauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martines et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brasil et al., 2016b</xref>). These unique aspects set ZIKV apart from other flavivirus infections and have spurred efforts to understand ZIKV host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>The ZIKV life-cycle starts with virus attachment and receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meertens et al., 2017</xref>). Upon endosome acidification, the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm for uncoating and initial viral translation at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Translation produces a single polyprotein that is cleaved co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 mature proteins: three structural proteins forming the virion (capsid, C; pre-membrane, prM; and envelope, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) required for viral replication and inhibition of host defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrows et al., 2018</xref>). Replication of ZIKV RNA and assembly of viral particles occur in close association with rearranged ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossignol et al., 2017</xref>). Assembled virions are transported through the secretory pathway, where the furin protease cleaves prM into and M, resulting in mature virions that are secreted into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hasan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The flaviviral genome contains 5â² and 3â² untranslated regions (UTR) that are essential for genome cyclization and initiation of RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>). The ZIKV 3â² UTR is highly structured and consists of four domains: xrRNA1, xrRNA2, the dumbbell (DB) and the 3â² SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). The ZIKV 3â² UTR contains confirmed and predicted pseudoknot interactions located in xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, respectively. These pseudoknots are important for stalling of the cellular 5â² to 3â² exonuclease, XRN1, and accumulation of at least two sfRNA species (sfRNA1 and sfRNA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>). The sfRNA of a few different flaviviruses has been described to exert pro-viral functions, possibly through acting as a âspongeâ for antiviral host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">GÃ¶ertz et al., 2018</xref>). The DENV sfRNA has been shown to interact with stress granule associated proteins G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 and the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to dampen innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bidet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manokaran et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Moon et al reported that DENV-2 and KUNV sfRNAs inhibited XRN1 activity, leading to accumulation of uncapped transcripts in infected cells and disruption of mRNA homeostasis that could potentially deregulate antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding ZIKV, Musashi-1 (MSI1) was reported to be required for efficient infection and interact with viral genomes; additionally, ZIKV infection disrupted the activity of MSI1 (33). However, whether or not ZIKV sfRNA interacts with MSI1 and modulates its activity is unclear.</p><p>In this work, we identified the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) as a host factor that binds to the ZIKV sfRNA and to viral genomes. Functional assays indicated that FMRP represses ZIKV infection by inhibiting viral translation. Analysis of an attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate (Î10Â ZIKV) that is defective for sfRNA production suggests that sfRNA enhances ZIKV infection partly through antagonizing FMRP activity. Additionally, we observed that ZIKV infection blocks the canonical activity of FMRP and increases the expression of FMRP target genes. Finally, we present evidence implicating deregulation of FMRP activity in a mouse model of ZIKV infection, suggesting that ZIKV pathogenesis may involve virus-mediated FMRP inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FMRP interacts with the ZIKV 3â² UTR in cell extracts, infected cells and infected mouse testes</title><p>Before this work, there was no knowledge of host proteins that bind and are modulated by ZIKV sfRNA. We previously used RNA affinity chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (RAC-MS) to identify proteins that interact with DENV-2 sfRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bidet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manokaran et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we used a similar approach with lysates from JEG3 (choriocarcinoma) cells, which are permissive for ZIKV infection, to identify host proteins that interact with full-length ZIKV 3â² UTRs of the pandemic Asian lineage strain PRVABC59 and the African strain MR766. This analysis revealed 27 proteins that preferentially interacted with the ZIKV RNAs compared to an RNA derived from the coding sequence of DENV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>-source data 1). We also analyzed a second negative control RNA derived from vector backbone sequence and obtained similar results (data not shown).

Both ZIKV sfRNA and viral genome co-precipitated with anti-FMRP but not control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) for all three virus strains.

Forty-eight hours post-infection with ZIKV-Dakar at low MOI (0.01), we measured viral titers using plaque assay and rate of infection by flow cytometry.

The antiviral effect of FMRP was corroborated by immunofluorescence (IF) of infected cells to detect viral antigen and analysis by high-content imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

We observed that Î10 ZIKV infection rate in HeLa cells is reduced compared to WT ZIKV under negative control conditions (~11% vs~25% infected cells) and, importantly, FMRP KD disproportionately enhanced Î10 ZIKV infection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>): whereas WT virus was enhanced by approximately 3-fold, the infection rate for Î10 ZIKV rose by nearly 5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Additionally, similar effects were observed on levels of cell-associated ZIKV NS2B and NS4B proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> to G). Together, these results suggest that sfRNA antagonizes FMRP and thus enhances ZIKV infection.</p><p>Given the key role of FMRP in neurodevelopment, its mechanism of action has been extensively studied and several cellular mRNAs are known targets for translational repression by FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zalfa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Korb et al., 2017</xref>).

Protein levels of FXR2, TLN1 and BRD4 increased after transfection of siRNA targeting FMRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that the mRNAs encoding these proteins are genuine FMRP targets in HeLa cells. The remaining proteins were either undetectable (ARC) or were unaffected (RAC1, Rho A, PNPLA6, KDM5C, TSC2, SOD1) which suggests that FMRP may have cell-type specific effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darnell and Klann, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To probe for antagonistic effects of ZIKV sfRNA on FMRP activity, the expression of FMRP targets was evaluated in the context of infection. First, we analyzed expression levels of FXR2 by WB in HeLa cells infected with WT ZIKV and Î10 ZIKV. In order to achieve similar infection rates for the two viruses, cells were infected at MOI of 3 for WT ZIKV and MOI of 4.5 for the mutant virus. Interestingly, these experiments revealed a 2.7-fold-increase of FXR2 protein levels in cells infected with WT ZIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Although Î10 ZIKV infection also increased the mean level of FXR2, this effect was not statistically significant (p=0.277) compared to uninfected cells. In parallel, we measured the expression of FXR2 by flow cytometry in ZIKV-infected cells using a double staining protocol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the distributions of the cells based on infection with either WT ZIKV or Î10 ZIKV, indicating similar levels of infection for both viruses (~86% for WT andÂ ~90% for Î10 ZIKV). FXR2 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was enhanced by WT virus and, to a lesser extent, by the Î10 ZIKV mutant. Quantitatively, there was a two-fold increase of FXR2 MFI in WT ZIKV infected cells and a 1.5-fold increase for Î10 ZIKV compared to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We also conducted IF microscopy analysis and observed FXR2 accumulation specifically in ZIKV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, infection of cells by Î10 ZIKV caused FXR2 to redistribute into discrete cytoplasmic puncta which was also evident at reduced frequency in WT ZIKV-infected cells. FXR2 has been previously reported to concentrate in stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GonÃ§alves et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that infection with the attenuated virus may induce formation of stress granules more efficiently than WT ZIKV. In addition to FXR2, we also observed elevated expression of TLN1 by WB in cells infected with WT ZIKV compared with uninfected and Î10 ZIKV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39023.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ZIKV infection increases expression of FXR2.</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with WT (MOI of 3) or â10 ZIKV (MOI of 4.5) or left non-infected (NI).

Electroporation was used to transfect full-length, in vitro synthesized sfRNA or a deletion mutant lacking xrRNA1 and xrRNA2 (DBSLIII). We electroporated RNAs with either 5â² triphosphate or monophosphate into HeLa cells and evaluated RNA integrity and abundance side-by-side with sfRNA from infected cells. We detected three distinct sfRNA species in infected cells that have been previously reported for ZIKV: sfRNA1, sfRNA2 and sfRNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Filomatori et al., 2017</xref>). Electroporated RNAs were partially degraded although some intact sfRNA remained even at 48 hr post-electroporation. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of the FMRP targets FXR2 and BRD4 by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> to F). Compared to the DBSLIII RNA, electroporation of intact sfRNA resulted in modest, but highly significant, increases in both FXR2 and BRD4 levels. These results suggest expression of ZIKV sfRNA is sufficient to interfere withÂ FMRP.Â We next asked whether ZIKV infection alters the expression of FMRP targets in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

FMRP interacted with ZIKV RNA, with particular affinity for the sfRNA, in both infected cultured cells and mouse testes. FMRP interaction with the viral genomic RNA presumably limits infection through inhibiting early synthesis of viral proteins. Importantly, accumulation of ZIKV sfRNA suppressed the anti-viral activity of FMRP and, consequently, resulted in de-repression of endogenous FMRP target mRNAs. Together, our observations have important implications for ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.</p><p>Multiple studies have been performed to characterize the RNA-binding specificity of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maurin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2013</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis of FMRP CLIP-seq datasets identified WGGA (WÂ =Â T/A) as the top sequence motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) which is found at six sites in the ZIKV 3â² UTR, each of them located in the dumbbell regions. Our mapping experiments, however, showed that the dumbbells are dispensable for FMRP binding to ZIKV 3â²UTR, suggesting that these WGGA motifs do not mediate interaction with FMRP. Interestingly, using in vitro RNA selection Darnell et al. identified a highly structured target for the FMRP KH2 domain containing a pseudoknot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2005</xref>). To date, no FMRP target mRNA has been identified that contains this motif but it is notable that the ZIKV xrRNA1, which is required for FMRP binding in vitro, folds into a complex structure containing several tertiary interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that the artificial RNA identified by Darnell and colleagues shares similar three-dimensional structural features with the sfRNA which allow it to bind FMRP with high affinity.</p><p>FMRP inhibited infection of multiple ZIKV strains but did not restrict the related flavivirus, DENV, even though we previously identified FMRP as a DENV RNA-binding protein by RNA affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that FMRP acts as an intrinsic restriction factor for ZIKV. It is not clear why DENV infection is immune to FMRP. It is possible that DENV eludes physical interaction with FMRP in infected cells or that ribosomes translating DENV RNA do not effectively recruit FMRP, which is thought to be a prerequisite for translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackwell et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, FMRP was recently described as a proviral host factor for influenza A virus that promotes assembly of viral RNPs, and FXR proteins were shown to redundantly promote replication of specific alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Hirano et al. showed interaction of FMRP with the genomic RNA of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV), accumulation of FMRP at sites of local TBEV replication, and that FMRP depletion reduces TBEV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Muto et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, FMRP can play a positive, negative or no role in infection, depending on viral species.</p><p>Mechanistically, we determined that FMRP inhibits ZIKV translation. FMRP is widely expressed and has been characterized to repress translation of specific neuronal mRNAs but the precise mechanism is unknown. Chen et al. demonstrated that drosophila FMRP (dFMRP) can bind directly to the ribosome in the absence of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). The authors proposed that FMRP docks on the 80S ribosome using KH1/2 domains and simultaneously binds to mRNA via its RGG motif. The binding location of dFMRP on the ribosome suggests that it occludes recruitment of elongation factors and tRNA, leading the ribosome reversibly stall as observed by Darnell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). Based on this proposed mechanism, we speculate that FMRP binds the ZIKV genome within the viral open reading frame and causes elongating ribosomes to stall, leading to a deficiency in viral protein synthesis. Alternatively, it is possible that FMRP interaction with the 3â² UTR of the viral genome could lead to impaired translation. Finally, changes in the expression of FMRP targets may indirectly contribute to enhanced ZIKV infection upon FMRP knockdown. For example, the increase in FXR2 subsequent to FMRP depletion could positively impact ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We found that the recently developed ZIKV vaccine strain, Î10 ZIKV, is compromised for sfRNA production and is replication-deficient in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shan et al., 2017b</xref>). Interestingly, infection with Î10 ZIKV, but not WT ZIKV, caused relocalization of FXR2 to cytoplasmic granular structures reminiscent of stress granules (SG), suggesting that sfRNA may prevent SG formation. This is consistent with previous reports that show very low SG formation in flavivirus infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bidet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emara and Brinton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruggieri et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, Î10 ZIKV infection was disproportionately increased by FMRP depletion compared to WT ZIKV, suggesting that one function of ZIKV sfRNA is to antagonize FMRP. In support of this, our RNA-IP experiments showed that FMRP preferentially co-IPs sfRNA compared to viral genomes. This may be partly explained by stoichiometry of sfRNA to genomes which reaches nearly 4 to 1 at the height of infection, depending on ZIKV strain. It is also possible that sfRNA structure differs from the corresponding region present in the viral genome and this dictates preferential FMRP interaction. We speculate that ZIKV sfRNA works as a âsinkâ to saturate FMRP and prevent its repressive interactions with both viral RNA and cellular target mRNAs. This is reminiscent of recently described roles for the DENV sfRNA as a molecular sink for proteins involved in interferon responses (G3BP1, G3BP2, CAPRIN1, TRIM25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bidet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manokaran et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Besides interferon responses, there are intrinsic restriction factors that recognize viral components and block replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yan and Chen, 2012</xref>). For flaviviruses, a few intrinsic anti-viral factors have been described: YTHDF1-3 proteins that bind methylated RNA and regulate stability, were reported to interact with ZIKV RNA and inhibit infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>); YB-1 and QKI bind to the DENV 3â² UTR and repress DENV RNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paranjape and Harris, 2007</xref>); similarly, FBP1 blocks translation of JEV through interacting with untranslated regions of JEV RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chien et al., 2011</xref>). The association of these antiviral factors with the viral genome and their functional consequences have only been observed in cell culture and it remains to be seen whether or not these will be validated in vivo. Furthermore, there are no reports that the intrinsic anti-viral function of these proteins is counteracted by flaviviral factors. In this work we describe that FMRP is an intrinsic, direct-acting ZIKV restriction factor that interacts with ZIKV RNA and is counteracted by the sfRNA as it accumulates during infection.</p><p>We provide evidence for de-repression of endogenous FMRP target mRNAs in the context of ZIKV infection of cultured cells and mouse testes. Specifically, we observed that the FMRP targets, <italic>FXR2</italic>, <italic>TLN1</italic>, <italic>BRD4</italic>, and <italic>PNPLA6</italic> were elevated at the protein level as a consequence of ZIKV infection. Moreover, infection with Î10 ZIKV, which produces less sfRNA than WT virus, resulted in weaker or no effects on FMRP targets compared with WT ZIKV. We further observed that introduction of synthetic sfRNA into cells leads to upregulation of two FMRP targets: FXR2 and BRD4. These results provide functional evidence indicating that the ZIKV sfRNA interferes with the activity of FMRP, although sfRNA-independent mechanism(s) for modulation of FMRP targets by ZIKV may also be at play.</p><p>Our observations have implications for ZIKV pathogenesis in tissues with high expression of FMRP: brain, placenta and testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hinds et al., 1993</xref>). Given the well-established role for FMRP in promoting neurodevelopment, it is tempting to speculate that certain aspects of ZIKV neuropathogenesis may be explained by sfRNA-mediated FMRP inhibition, leading to inappropriate expression of FMRP target mRNAs. Development of congenital Zika syndrome is likely multifactorial and symptoms such as microcephaly, which is only one disease manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aliota et al., 2017</xref>), are unlikely to be the consequence of FMRP inhibition. Nevertheless, our findings warrant further research into how ZIKV interactions with FMRP might contribute to disease outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>A129 IFNAR <break/>Knock out mouse</td><td>UTMB, Galveston, TX</td><td>MGI:5652612</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rossi et al.

Eluted RBPs were identified by label-free mass spectrometry at the UTMB Mass Spectrometry Core. Samples were dissolved in 30 Î¼l denaturation buffer (4% SDS and 100 mM DTT in 0.1M TEAB pH 8.5), heated at 65Â°C for 15 min, and loaded onto 30 kDa spin filters (Merck Millipore). The buffer was exchanged three times with UA solution (8 M UREA in 0.1 M TEAB pH 8.5) by centrifugation at 14,000 g. After removal of SDS, cysteine alkylation was accomplished through the addition of alkylation buffer (50 mM IAA, 8 M UREA in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5) for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. UA buffer was exchanged with TEAB buffer (40 mM TEAB pH 8.5). The proteins were digested with trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio [w/w] of 1:100) and 5% ACN at 37Â°C overnight.

The combined peptide solution was then dried in a speed vac and resuspended in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water and placed in an autosampler vial for LC/MS analysis. Raw data files from the mass spectrometer were aligned by accurate mass and time in Progenesis QI for proteomics (version 2.0.5556.29015, Nonlinear Dynamics, a Waters Company). The top five spectra for each feature were exported as *.mgf files and searched against a combined Uniprot-Human canonical database. Peptide identifications were imported into Progenesis QI, and all peptides with â10logP scoresÂ &lt;Â 30 (Mascot or confidence score) were removed. Conflict resolution was performed in order to remove lower scoring peptides when multiple peptides were assigned to a single feature. Protein quantification was calculated from normalized peptide abundances using a summed abundance of unique peptides. Unique peptide abundance was calculated by the area of the corresponding peaks in the ion chromatograms. Protein abundance from RBPs interacting with PRVABC59 and MR766 ZIKV 3â² UTRs were compared with control RNA to calculate ratios of enrichment (PRVABC59 3â² UTR/NS2A and MR766 3â² UTR/NS2A).

After incubation, beads were washed four times with NT2 buffer and processed for WB and RNA isolation as in the RIP for HeLa cells. qPCR was performed using ZIKV ORF primers described above and specific primers that amplify ZIKV 3â² UTR (nucleotides 10623 to 10722 of ZIKV-Cambodia: forward 5â² <named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGAACTGGAGATCAGCTGTG</named-content> 3â²; reverse 5â² <named-content content-type="sequence">GGTCTTTCCCAGCGTCAATA</named-content> 3â²).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA electroporation</title><p>5â² triphosphate RNAs were generated as described above using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs) and specific primers for sfRNA (forward: 5â² <named-content content-type="sequence">GATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGT GTTGTCAGGCCTGCTAGTCAGCCACAGC</named-content> 3â²; reverse: 5â² <named-content content-type="sequence">AGAAACCATGGATTTCCCCACACCGGCCGCCGCT</named-content> 3â²) and the DBSLIII mutant (forward: 5â² <named-content content-type="sequence">GATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCCTCAGAGGACACTGAGTCAAAAAA</named-content> 3â²). 5â² monophosphate RNAs were by generated by synthesis of capped RNAs followed by treatment with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 5â² tri- and monophosphate RNAs were treated with the Turbo DNAse I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNAs were purified using Trizol LS and Direct Zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) for RNA clean up. 36 pmol of DBSLIII or sfRNA were electroporated into 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> HeLa cells in 250 ÂµL of Ingenio electroporation solution (Mirus) using the Gene Pulser X cell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) following manufacturerÂ´s instructions. 48 hr post electroporation, cells were analyzed for expression of FXR2 and BRD4 and transfection efficiency by NB as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>The independent experiments were performed with three biological replicates except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> two infected mice, each with three technical replicates, were processed separately. Differences between treatments and control groups were evaluated using the SigmaPlot/Stat package 11. In all cases, parametric or nonparametric tests and the appropriate post-hoc test were applied. If data met with assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and equal variance test, a <italic>t</italic>-test (parametric) was conducted. Data that did not meet with either normality test or equal variance test were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Drs.

Additionally, the FMRP-related FXR proteins enhance replication of some alphaviruses. In this manuscript, Soto-Acosta and coworkers add to this list by using RNA affinity chromatography and MS to identify a number of host proteins that bind to the Zika virus 3'UTR. Among these proteins FMRP, and related proteins FXR1 and FXR2, were selected for further studies. These proteins bind a specific RNA structure of the viral 3'UTR known as xrRNA1, which is present in the viral genome and in viral sfRNAs. FMRP, a cellular RNA-binding protein (RBP) that binds to the 3'UTR of Zika virus, inhibits virus production by interfering with viral translation. FMRP binds a specific 3' UTR region (xrRNA1) of ZIKV subgenomic RNA (sfRNA), which accumulates during ZIKV infection and inhibits FMRP inhibitory activity. Using siRNA-mediated FMRP depletion, they provide evidence that FMRP loss increases ZIKV translation/infection and also stimulates sfRNA-deficient ZIKV10-del. ZIKV also upregulates FMRP translational targets in both Hela cells and mouse testes.</p><p>Studies on ZIKV continue to be of biomedical concern due to ZIKV-associated congenital microcephaly and inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. In this context, the findings reported in this study are important since they add to our understanding by dissecting the interaction of FMRP/FXR proteins with sfRNA. Overall, the described experiments are well-controlled, the manuscript is well-written and the finding that FMRP acts as a restriction factor for ZIKV infection is novel and of high interest. The reviewers felt, however, that key experiments were missing to fully support the conclusions. Especially, the conclusion that sfRNA strongly antagonizes FMRP activity is less well supported because it is mainly based on an attenuated ZIKV strain with distinct replication kinetics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further testing of the specificity of the FMRP-sfRNA interaction is needed.</p><p>1a) The Î10 mutation produces less sfRNAs but its attenuation can be due to any number of reasons. For example, the 3'UTR is crucial for recruiting pro-viral RBPs that aid in translation and replication; the Î10 mutation can disrupt this independently of sfRNAs. Thus, the observation that the attenuated virus is rescued to a higher extent upon FMRP depletion could be due to other non sfRNA related mechanism. More direct evidence is required to support the claim that sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Is it possible to transfect sfRNA (and non-FMRP binding mutant sfRNA) in the cell and show effects on FMRP activity outside of the context of infection?</p><p>1b) Figure 5. shows that Î10 ZIKV is disproportionately enhanced by FMRP KD.

To address this we performed electroporation of sfRNA and a mutant version with deletion of xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, regions required for FMRP-sfRNA interaction. Levels of established targets of FMRP (FXR2 and BRD4) were analyzed by flow cytometry. These experiments show that introduction of sfRNA in uninfected cells leads to increased levels of FXR2 and BRD4, supporting a role for ZIKV sfRNA in FMRP inhibition. Data from these experiments are shown in new Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b) Figure 5. shows that Î10 ZIKV is disproportionately enhanced by FMRP KD.

The experiments referred to are not comparable: Figure 3C was performed with the WT Dakar strain and the experiments in Figure 5 used WT Cambodia strain derived from the previously reported infectious clone. A closer comparison could be performed with the Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B where the increase in the WT Cambodia strain was 2.5-fold. We emphasize in the revised manuscript that different ZIKV strains exhibited somewhat different sensitivities to FMRP depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1c) For Figure 2A and B, at least one RBP control antibody, and not just IgG, should be included in this RIP to confirm preferential interaction of FMRP with sfRNA over an unrelated RBP.

In response to this comment we performed additional RNA immunoprecipitation assays with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) along with northern blot analysis. This revealed that sfRNA strongly prefers interaction with FMRP compared to PTB. These results are included in new Figure 2C. Regarding the experiment with mouse testes shown in Figure 2C we speculate that efficiency of IP from this tissue was relatively inefficient compared to IP from cultured cells. Nevertheless, this experiment showed clear enrichment of ZIKV RNA with FMRP IP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1d) Can the authors exclude that the enrichment for sfRNA is not due to RNA degradation during the IP?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make a good point concerning the possibility of differential RNA decay during the RNA IP reaction. To address this, we analyzed ZIKV genomes and sfRNA in supernatants from RNA IP reactions by Northern blot side-by-side with input RNA. This showed that both viral genomes and sfRNA remain intact during the IP. These data are shown in new Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1e) Although FXR2 is a FMRP translational target, FXR2 also binds sfRNA (Figure 1B).

We performed knockdown of these proteins and observed contrasting effects: FXR2 knockdown decreased rate of ZIKV infection, making it unlikely to repress ZIKV translation, while FXR1 depletion slight enhanced infection. These observations are now shown in new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The possibility that FXR2 is relocalizing to stress granules should be tested using a SG marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the interesting observation that FXR2 relocalizes to granular structures upon infection with the Î10, but not WT, ZIKV. While it is possible these are stress granules, we respectfully submit that testing this hypothesis is beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarification of the mechanism of restriction.

Our combined data showing binding of FMRP to ZIKV RNA and correlated enhanced infection/translation due to FMRP knockdown strongly suggest that the effect of FMRP is direct. While this is the most parsimonious explanation, our data do not prove that this is the case and it is possible that alteration in expression of FMRP targets contributes to the effect on ZIKV infection. Likewise, our data do not inform on whether binding to the 3â UTR or ORF restricts virus translation. These possibilities are noted in the revised manuscript Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3b) In Figure 4, what are the kinetics of viral RNA replication in FMRP KD cells with the NanoLuc reporter system? This analysis can add useful mechanistic information.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments in Figure 4 were performed at a short time point in the presence or absence of the NS5 inhibitor, NITD008, to account for a possible contribution of viral RNA synthesis to luciferase signals. We do not know the kinetics of RNA synthesis with this modified virus but we observed essentially no difference plus or minus NITD008 in the effects of FMRP knockdown on luciferase levels. This lack of difference is the critical point to note. We interpret these data as evidence supporting a role for FMRP in ZIKV translational repression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
