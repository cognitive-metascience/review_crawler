PFTs are used by a variety of bacterial pathogens to attack host cells. Due to the lack of structural information, the molecular mechanism of action of Xax toxins is poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the XaxAB pore complex from <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> and the crystal structures of the soluble monomers of XaxA and XaxB. The structures reveal that XaxA and XaxB are built similarly and appear as heterodimers in the 12–15 subunits containing pore, classifying XaxAB as bi-component α-PFT. Major conformational changes in XaxB, including the swinging out of an amphipathic helix are responsible for membrane insertion. XaxA acts as an activator and stabilizer for XaxB that forms the actual transmembrane pore. Based on our results, we propose a novel structural model for the mechanism of Xax intoxication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38017.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some bacteria make toxins that punch large holes into the membranes of host cells, destroying them like a puncture destroys a football. These “pore-forming toxins” allow many bacterial species to infect a variety of organisms, from insects to humans. Some sophisticated pore-forming toxins, such as the anthrax toxin, do not only form a pore but also use it to flood lethal toxins into the cell to kill it.</p><p>One bacterium called <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> punctures the membranes of insect cells, using the same type of pore-forming toxins that other bacteria use to infect humans. Previous research has shown that two proteins – components A and B – form these pore-forming toxins. Given this two-protein formation, some scientists predicted these pore-forming toxins might act like those of the anthrax bacterium: one component forms the pore; the other component poisons the cell. But without detailed images of this pore-forming toxin’s structure, understanding exactly how these two components work together is almost impossible.</p><p>To explore how components A and B operate within <italic>X. nematophila,</italic> Schubert et al. captured images of the molecular structure of the two proteins. Common methods reliant on X-rays and electron microscopes revealed the layouts of both components. By visualizing the proteins at different stages, Schubert et al. observed key structural changes that enable them to form the pore and puncture a host cell.</p><p>Component A binds to component B’s back, forming a subunit – twelve to fifteen of which then conjoin as the pore-forming toxin. Schubert et al. conclude that component A stabilizes each subunit on the membrane and activates component B, which then punctures the membrane by swinging out its lower end. Unlike the anthrax pore-forming toxin, both components collaborate to form the pore complex and puncture the membrane. These results provide a foundation of knowledge about what these toxins look like and how they operate. More research building upon this structural analysis may help scientists develop antibiotics that prevent bacteria from destroying human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>xenorhabdolysin</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>pore-forming toxin</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>xenorhabdus</kwd><kwd>bi-component toxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seventh Framework Programme: ERC 615984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM and X-ray structures of α-xenorhabdolysin in soluble and pore form of <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> give novel insights into the mechanism of action of bi-component α-pore-forming toxins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are soluble proteins produced by bacteria and higher eukaryotes, that spontaneously form pores in biomembranes and act as toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>). Dependent on their transmembrane region, which is formed either by α-helices or β-strands, PFTs are classified as α-PFTs and β-PFTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacovache et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischofberger et al., 2012</xref>). A common trait of all PFTs is the conversion from a soluble monomer to a membrane-embedded oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischofberger et al., 2012</xref>); however, a different mechanism has been recently found for ABC toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gatsogiannis et al., 2016</xref>). Specific targeting of the PFTs to the host membrane involves mostly recognition of specific proteins, glycans or lipids on the target membrane. Conformational changes resulting in the oligomerization and membrane perforation are triggered by receptor binding, catalytic cleavage, pH change or other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacovache et al., 2008</xref>). The sequential order of oligomerization and membrane penetration including the formation of an oligomeric pre-pore is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cosentino et al., 2016</xref>). The size of the oligomers ranges from tetrameric pores in Cry1Aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gómez et al., 2014</xref>) and heptameric pores in the anthrax protective antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>) to 30–50-meric pores in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>).</p><p>PFTs can be further divided into two groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iacovache et al., 2010</xref>). PFTs of the first group perforate membranes by forming stable pores resulting in an uncontrolled influx and efflux of ions and other biomolecules. This destroys ion gradients and electrochemical gradients at the membrane. The toxins of the second group also perforate the membrane, but use the transmembrane channel to specifically translocate toxic enzymes into the host. Binary toxins, also called AB toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Odumosu et al., 2010</xref>) and also recently characterized ABC toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meusch et al., 2014</xref>) belong to the latter group. A prominent AB toxin is the anthrax toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collier and Young, 2003</xref>), where component B, the protective antigen, forms a translocation pore through which lethal factor or edema factor, different A components, are translocated.</p><p>The members of α-PFTs show a high structural diversity. They include proteins mainly consisting of α-helical structures (bax, colicins) or β-strand motifs with a single helix responsible for membrane insertion (actinoporins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parker and Feil, 2005</xref>). Their transmembrane regions are all composed of hydrophobic or amphipathic regions buried within the core structure of the soluble monomer. Therefore, a conformational change that exposes the hydrophobic or amphipathic region is required for successful membrane insertion. The structures of cytolysin A (ClyA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>) and fragaceatoxin C (FraC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>) of both the monomer and oligomer gave the first structural insight into the mechanism of action of this class of PFTs.</p><p>In contrast to α-PFTs, the structures of many β-PFTs, such as members of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hotze and Tweten, 2012</xref>), hemolysin and aerolysin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>), have been determined in their monomeric and pore conformation. The transmembrane β-strands in the soluble monomers of β-PFTs are typically amphipathic with small hydrophobic patches that upon oligomerization form a hydrophobic membrane-spanning β-barrel.</p><p>α-Xenorhabdolysin is a PFT that has been first isolated from the bacterium <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ribeiro et al., 2003</xref>). Xenorhabdolysins are also found in other entomopathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic>, and human pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vigneux et al., 2007</xref>). They are composed of two subunits, namely XaxA (45 kDa) and XaxB (40 kDa) and are only active when the two components act together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vigneux et al., 2007</xref>). Xenorhabdolysins, which were suggested to be binary toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vigneux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), perforate the membranes of erythrocytes, insect granulocytes and phagocytes and induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vigneux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism of action of xenorhabdolysins including the interaction between components A and B, oligomerization and pore formation has remained enigmatic so far.</p><p>Structural prediction using the PHYRE2 server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>) does not yield any significant similarities for XaxB. XaxA cytotoxins, however, are predicted to be similar to two pore-forming cytolysins, Cry6Aa from <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) and binding component B of hemolysin BL (Hbl-B) from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madegowda et al., 2008</xref>). The best characterized cytolysin is probably ClyA from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> strains. The structure of ClyA has been determined in its soluble form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>) and pore conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>) and the mechanism of pore formation mechanism has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roderer and Glockshuber, 2017</xref>). However, in contrast to XaxAB, ClyA only contains one component. Thus, despite the structural similarity, the mechanism of action must be different.</p><p>So far structural data on xenorhabdolysins are missing limiting our understanding of these important type of toxins. Here, we used a hybrid structural biology approach combining X-ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the crystal structures of XaxA and XaxB from <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> as soluble monomers and the cryo-EM structure of the XaxAB pore complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of XaxA and XaxB soluble monomers</title><p>In two different experiments, we independently expressed and purified XaxA and XaxB (Materials and methods).

XaxA and XaxB have a similar domain organization. They both contain a tail domain that is formed by a five-helix bundle (αA, αB, αC, αG and αH) and elongated neck and head domains. The five-helix bundle motif has so far only been described for ClyA and ClyA-type toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roderer and Glockshuber, 2017</xref>). Like in the case of ClyA-type toxins the N-terminal helices (αA) of XaxA and XaxB are significantly shorter than in ClyA, where it plays a crucial role in pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, XaxA contains two large loops connecting the helices, a big hook-shaped loop (lp1, aa 136–169) between helices αB and αC at the top of the tail domain and an additional loop (lp2, aa 202–215) dividing helix αC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The four XaxB molecules in the asymmetric unit differ considerably in their tail domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Especially, helices αB and αC that protrude slightly from the five-helix-bundle take different positions. Although this might be due to tight crystal packing, it also indicates a certain degree of flexibility of the tail domain of XaxB.</p><p>A long coiled-coil structure, composed of a continuous helix (αG) and another one that is divided into three (XaxA: αC1, αC2 and αD) or two (XaxB: αC, αD) segments, form the backbone of XaxA and XaxB. It connects all domains and forms in both XaxA and XaxB the neck and head domain. The neck domain, that is approximately 35 Å in length, does not exist in ClyA-type toxins, which are in general more compact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). In XaxA, the tip of the coiled-coil, predicted as hydrophobic transmembrane region is not resolved in our crystal structure, however, secondary structure predictions for this region suggest a continuation of the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to XaxA the head domain of XaxB contains in addition to the central coiled-coil a helix-loop-helix motif, dividing helix αE and a 21-residue long amphipathic helix (αF). The highly conserved hydrophobic face of helix αF is oriented toward helices αD and αG and thereby shielded from the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The conformation of the head domain is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic as well as electrostatic interactions, including putative salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38017.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Interactions in the head domain of the XaxB monomer.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The head domain of XaxB is stabilized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions including putative salt bridges.

An important feature of ClyA and ClyA-type cytotoxins is the typical tongue motif that inserts into the membrane during pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a,b</xref>). In ClyA, Hbl-B, NheA, and Cry6Aa the tongue is formed by a hydrophobic or amphipathic β-hairpin or a large hydrophobic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madegowda et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of XaxB the tongue is formed by an amphipathic helix, while XaxA does not contain such motif. Comparing the structure of XaxA with that of its pore conformation (see below) suggests that XaxA is already in its extended conformation as soluble monomer.</p><p>It is tempting to speculate that the function of the N-terminal helix and β-tongue in ClyA has been evolutionary compensated in multicomponent toxins, such as XaxAB, NheABC and Hbl-ABC that only contain a short N-terminal helix. In the case of XaxAB, the hydrophobic helices of XaxA that enter the membrane in the pore, are functionally equivalent to the hydrophobic β-tongue of ClyA, The β-tongue likely inserts first into the membrane, where it rearranges into two α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to XaxA, these helices only span half the membrane. αF and the helix-turn-helix motif αE of XaxB, that span the complete membrane in the XaxAB pore, would substitute the N-terminal membrane-spanning helix of ClyA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structure of the XaxAB pore complex</title><p>To investigate the pore complex formed by XaxA and XaxB, we planned to induce pore formation in vitro and analyze the structure of the complex by single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). We first mixed both soluble monomers, incubated them with a variety of detergents and analyzed the pores by negative stain electron microscopy. We could indeed observe pore formation in most cases; however, the choice of detergent greatly influenced the size and homogeneity of the observed crown-shaped pore complexes. Some detergents induced the formation of star-like aggregates or differently sized pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed the most homogenous distribution of XaxAB pore complexes, that appear as crown-shaped structures, after incubating the monomers with 0.1% Cymal-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The average diameter of the pores was ~250 Å. However, the pores had the tendency to aggregate and were not suitable for further structural investigations. Interestingly, when we incubated soluble monomers of XaxA and XaxB in the absence of detergents at room temperature, we observed the formation of higher oligomers but not of complete pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>). This is not the case when XaxA and XaxB are not mixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). This indicates that heterodimerization and oligomerization of XaxAB can happen independently of the hydrophobic environment provided by detergents or a lipid bilayer and may happen prior to pore formation also in vivo.</p><p>To improve the homogeneity of our XaxAB pore complexes, we exchanged Cymal-6 with amphipols and separated the amphipol-stabilized XaxAB pores from the aggregates by size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c,d</xref>). The thus obtained pore complexes were homogeneous and suitable for single particle cryo-EM.</p><p>Analyzing the single particles by two-dimensional clustering and sorting in SPHIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>) revealed populations of XaxAB pores with different numbers of subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Most of the complexes contain either 12, 13, 14 or 15 subunits. We separated the different populations by multi-reference alignment and solved the structure of the different complexes in SPHIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moriya et al., 2017</xref>) (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 4–5</xref>).

In bi-component toxins, where both proteins contribute to building the pore, the two components first dimerize into a heterodimer prior to oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colletier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badarau et al., 2015</xref>). In several cases, PFTs have been shown to oligomerize and insert spontaneously into membranes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iacovache et al., 2008</xref>). However, membrane insertion in vivo depends on the specific interaction with lipids or proteins on the membrane surface of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ros and García-Sáez, 2015</xref>). To better understand the process of dimerization, membrane insertion and pore formation of XaxA and XaxB, we performed in vitro reconstitution assays with and without liposomes.</p><p>XaxA alone has the tendency to form small aggregates by interacting with its head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>). Since the short hydrophobic region of the head domain resides inside the membrane in the pore complex, we believe that the clustering of XaxA monomers is caused by mild hydrophobic interactions of these regions. This again suggests that already the soluble monomeric form of XaxA has a certain affinity to the hydrophobic environment of biomembranes. To test, whether XaxA can spontaneously insert into or associate with membranes, we incubated it with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or brain polar lipids (BPL) liposomes and analyzed its incorporation by size exclusion chromatography and negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–d</xref>). Interestingly, the protein was not incorporated into the liposomes and no larger structures could be observed on the vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,d</xref>). This indicates that albeit the hydrophobic tip of the head domain, XaxA cannot spontaneously insert blank membranes in vitro. The same is true for XaxB alone.

Notably, this is independent of the sequence of mixing, that is XaxA can be added before XaxB or vice versa, suggesting that dimerization of XaxA and XaxB is necessary for spontaneous association of the proteins with the membrane and subsequent pore formation. Importantly, association with liposomes happens without specific lipids, such as cholesterol, or protein receptors at the membrane surface. At this point, we cannot distinguish between association with and insertion into the membranes.

During oligomerization XaxA sterically clashes with the loop connecting helices αF and αG in XaxB. We therefore propose that XaxA induces conformational changes in XaxB that do not immediately result in exposing its hydrophobic domain but rather put XaxB in an activated state for membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b–c</xref>). When interacting with a lipid membrane, aromatic residues at the bottom of the head domain of XaxB likely trigger the conformational change resulting in membrane perforation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Our reconstitution assays in liposomes showed that neither XaxA nor XaxB strongly interact with liposomes. Thus, neither the interaction of the aromatic residues of XaxB nor the hydrophobic domain of XaxA are able to enter membranes on their own and dimerization and induced conformational changes during oligomerization are crucial for membrane insertion.

Although, we never observed structures at high resolution that would indicate a pre-pore complex, we cannot exclude that such a complex exists as intermediate state on liposomes before permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2e</xref>). Obviously, more evidence is needed before our proposed mechanism of XaxAB action can be regarded as established. Thus, additional structures of intermediate states are needed to fully understand the process.</p><p>In summary, our results provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of xenorhabdolyins and serve as a strong foundation for further biochemical experiments to fully understand the molecular mechanism of xenorhadolysin intoxication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparison to YaxAB</title><p>During the revision of our work, crystal structures and a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of the human pathogenic homolog YaxAB from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> as well as a crystal structure of PaxB from <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bräuning et al., 2018</xref>). The crystal structures of YaxA and XaxA, as well as YaxB (PaxB) and XaxB are very similar although their sequences are only 54.5 and 36.0% (56.7%) identical, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,c,d</xref>). Importantly, YaxA does not contain the hook-shaped loop (lp1), which is a prominent feature of XaxA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The neck and head domain of XaxA and YaxA as well as the head of XaxB and PaxB differ in their position indicating that these domains are flexible in solution. This is supported by the fact that the head domain of XaxA and YaxB are not resolved in the structures. Similarly, the tip of the tail domain takes different positions in XaxB and is not resolved in YaxB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>).</p><p>Although the authors used the same detergent for pore assembly and also stabilized the pores in amphipols, the YaxAB pore complex comprises 8 to 12 heterodimers in contrast to the 12 to 15 heterodimers in our XaxAB pore. This suggests a species-dependent size variability. The protomer structures of YaxAB and XaxAB are very similar (RMSD of 1.145 and 1.252, respectively). Significant differences, however, can be seen in the head domains which could in principle indicate structural differences between the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,e</xref>). However, since the relatively low resolution of the YaxAB pore structure (5.5 Å) impedes an accurate building of the atomic model, only a high-resolution structure of YaxAB would enable a proper comparison.</p><p>Interestingly, YaxA associates directly with erythrocyte membranes. This is in direct contrast to our findings showing that XaxA does interact with liposomes in vitro. This results in different models. Whereas Bräuning et al. hypothesize that YaxA enters the membrane first and then recruits YaxB, we propose that XaxA and XaxB already heterodimerize/oligomerize in solution and then associate with the membrane as heterodimers or oligomers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic>)</td><td>XaxA</td><td>N/A</td><td>NCBI Reference <break/>sequence: FN667742.1</td><td>Genes ordered <break/>from GenScript</td></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>X. nematophila</italic>)</td><td>XaxB</td><td>N/A</td><td>NCBI Reference <break/>sequence: FN667742.1</td><td>Genes ordered <break/>from GenScript</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL</td><td>Agilent Technologies</td><td>Agilent: 230280–41</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET19b</td><td>Novagen</td><td>Merck: 69677</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cymal-6</td><td>Anatrace</td><td>Anatrace: 228579-27-9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Amphipol A8-35</td><td>Anatrace</td><td>Anatrace: 1423685-21-5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPHIRE software package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moriya et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Membrane insertion of α-xenorhabdolysin in near-atomic detail&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors describe comprehensive structural studies of pore forming toxin (PFT) XaxAB. The crystal structures of the monomeric forms of XaxA (at 2.5 Å) and XaxB (at 3.4 Å) together with the cryo-EM structure of the assembled heteromeric pore (at 4 Å) provide mechanistic insights into the pore formation by these toxins. The pore complex structure in amphipol shows that the number of the heterodimers varies between 12 and 15 units. The highest resolved pore complex map was the one with 13 heterodimers why the authors fit in the model into this map. Extensive hydrogen network and ionic interactions between XaxA/XaxB heterodimers were identified by the analysis of the pore complex structure. Finally, a model of membrane insertion and pore formation was postulated on the basis of the X-ray structures of the monomers and cryo-EM structure of the pore complex. This is a well-constructed manuscript and body of work that provides new insight into the various mechanisms proteins can use for assembly and pore formation. The authors have done an excellent job of presenting their findings in a way that can be easily appreciated by the reader. The reviewers have appreciated the quality of the work and have focused primarily on the editorial aspects.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Recently, in parallel with the submission of this manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>, a manuscript about the structure and function of a similar, a two-component α-PFT (YaxA/YaxB from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>) was published (Bräuning et al., 2018). The authors must extensively compare and discuss the above-mentioned manuscript in their revised manuscript.</p><p>2) Overall, the work is not sufficiently put into the context of what is known about similar toxin systems to make it of significant interest to broader readership, even as some structural comparison is given.

We have also included an evolutionary perspective on similar toxins, e.g. ClyA-type toxins. In this context we also discuss now in subsection “Structure of XaxA and XaxB soluble monomers” the loss of function of the rudimentary N-terminal helix observed in the multi-component ClyA-type toxin systems and the new role of the head domain in XaxA and XaxB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors make a point of suggesting that XaxA and XaxB can dimerize in solution but with no direct evidence. They should discuss their results more clearly or provide additional experiments to support the point.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, we show by negative stain EM that XaxA and XaxB form oligomeric structures in the absence of detergents. The size and shape of the particles range from dimers to the crown-shaped oligomeric structures resembling partly assembled pores. This is not the case when XaxA or XaxB are imaged separately (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, 2C). We therefore conclude that XaxA and XaxB form heterodimers in solution, which are the building blocks of XaxAB oligomers. However, we are not able to biochemically separate dimers from oligomers. We discuss the results more clearly in the revised manuscript also highlighting the possibility of pre-pore complex formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) From the &quot;membrane-inserting&quot; experiments (subsection “XaxAB spontaneously inserts membranes”, Figure 7) whereby liposomes are incubated with XaxA and XaxB, it is not very clear whether the circular-oligomeric XaxAB heterodimers form a pore, as the structures on the liposomes could also represent a pre-form of the pore embedded in the membrane. This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is right. We cannot distinguish if the circular oligomeric XaxAB complexes only associate with the membrane as pre-pore complexes or if they actually insert into the membrane. We describe this now more carefully in the revised manuscript. However, since XaxAB clearly forms pores in detergents and amphipols, we indeed believe that the complexes insert into the membrane before they are completely oligomerized. However, this has to be proven empirically in future experiments. We have discussed this aspect in the revised manuscript and added an alternative route for membrane insertion including a pre-pore complex in our model (Figure 9).</p></body></sub-article></article>
