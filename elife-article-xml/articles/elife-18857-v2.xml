The flagellar capping protein (FliD) regulates filament assembly by chaperoning and sorting flagellin (FliC) proteins after they traverse the hollow filament and exit the growing flagellum tip. In the absence of FliD, flagella are not formed, resulting in impaired motility and infectivity. Here, we report the 2.2 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of FliD from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the first high-resolution structure of any FliD protein from any bacterium. Using this evidence in combination with a multitude of biophysical and functional analyses, we find that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD exhibits unexpected structural similarity to other flagellar proteins at the domain level, adopts a unique hexameric oligomeric state, and depends on flexible determinants for oligomerization. Considering that the flagellin filaments on which FliD oligomers are affixed vary in protofilament number between bacteria, our results suggest that FliD oligomer stoichiometries vary across bacteria to complement their filament assemblies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18857.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18857.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18857.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria, including several that cause diseases in people, have long whip-like appendages called flagella that extend well beyond their cell walls. Flagella can rotate and propel the bacteria through liquids, such as water or blood, and they are constructed primarily from thousands of copies of a single protein called flagellin. When flagella are built, the flagellin proteins are placed in their proper positions by another protein called FliD, several copies of which form a cap on the end of flagella. Without FliD, bacteria cannot properly assemble flagella and, thus, can no longer swim; this also hinders their ability to cause disease.</p><p>Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein, down to the level of its individual atoms, can provide unique insights into how the protein operates. However, no one had resolved the structure of a FliD protein from any bacterium to this level of detail before.</p><p>Now, Postel et al. report the high-resolution structure of a large fragment of FliD from the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The structure reveals that parts of this FliD protein are shaped like parts of other proteins from which flagella are constructed, including the flagellin protein that FliD places into position. Some parts of the FliD protein are also very flexible and these parts of the protein are responsible for holding numerous FliD proteins together as a cap. Finally, Postel et al. saw that six copies of FliD bind to one another to form a protein complex on the end of flagella. This last finding was particularly unexpected since it was thought that all FliD proteins formed five-membered cap complexes, an assumption that was based largely on studies of FliD from another bacterium called <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p><p>The current structure covers about half of the FliD protein, and so the next challenge is to determine the structure of the full-length protein. An improved understanding of the structure of FliD may, in future, help researchers to design drugs that stop bacteria from building flagella and, therefore, from swimming and causing disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18857.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18857.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas</italic></kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>hydrogen-deuterium exchange</kwd><kwd>analytical ultracentrifugation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH S10 RR15899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckett</surname><given-names>Dorothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first high-resolution structure of a bacterial flagellar cap protein, FliD, reveals new insights into the assembly of bacterial flagella.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathogenic bacteria cause a multitude of deadly human diseases. Many of these microbes possess flagella, molecular machines responsible for cell motility, adherence to host cells, and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haiko and Westerlund-Wikstrom, 2013</xref>). Flagella are helix-shaped hollow attachments formed predominantly by thousands of copies of the protein flagellin (also called FliC), anchored in the bacterial membrane by a hook (or joint) that is attached to the basal body and that is composed of rotary motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arora et al., 1998</xref>). A proton motive force typically drives the propeller motion of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg, 2003</xref>), resulting in swimming motility. A FliD (also called HAP2) oligomer forms the cap protein complex that is located at the tip of the flagellar filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>). This complex controls the distal growth of the filament by regulating the assembly of FliC molecules, which are transported through the hollow filament from the cytoplasm to the tip of the flagellum.</p><p>The dynamic movement of FliD in this assembly was modeled based on low (~26 Å)-resolution cryo-electron microscopic (EM) structures of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> serovar Typhimurium flagellum-cap complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2003</xref>), which adopts the shape of a five-legged stool with flexible leg domains that regulate the assembly of new FliC molecules onto the tip of the growing flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>). It has been suggested that the plate of the stool is formed by core regions of the FliD molecule, and that disordered/flexible regions form the five leg structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</xref>) that are known to interact with the FliC filament. FliD exhibits low sequence similarity to the flagellar hook proteins and to FliC. Nevertheless, it shares the disordered terminal regions of these flagellar proteins, a common structural characteristic that is thought to control the polymerization of flagellar proteins and to play an important role in interaction with the FliC filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</xref>). These regions are the most conserved in FliD sequences across bacteria. Flagellum-mediated motility is crucial for the virulence and pathogenicity of numerous bacteria, including <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Black et al., 1988</xref>), <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen-Vercoe and Woodward, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchetti et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">La Ragione et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</xref>), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arora et al., 2005</xref>), as well as the major causative agent of gastric cancer <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). To date, however, no high-resolution structure of any FliD protein exists. To better define the roles of FliD in bacterial motility and pathogenesis, we determined the first X-ray crystal structure of FliD at 2.2 Å resolution, and assessed the structural contributions of its flexible regions using a multitude of complementary biophysical and functional analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of the FliD protein from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1</title><p>To facilitate crystallization of FliD from the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain, we deleted the predicted coiled-coil domains on both the N- and C-termini of full length FliD, which has 474 residues (FliD<sub>1–474</sub>), to generate the truncated FliD<sub>78-405</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We expressed FliD<sub>78–405</sub> in <italic>E. coli</italic> with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and purified it to homogeneity by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA, size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. We improved initially weakly diffracting crystals of FliD<sub>78–405</sub> by random matrix microseed screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergfors, 2003</xref>), yielding crystals that diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution. In the absence of any homologous protein that could be used as a model for molecular replacement, we crystallized a seleno-methionine derivative of FliD<sub>78–405</sub> that included four leucine-to-methionine mutations (FliD<sub>78–405</sub>/L<sub>4</sub>–M<sub>4</sub>). This crystal provided phase information sufficient to build an initial model, which we used subsequently for molecular replacement with the native FliD<sub>78–405</sub> dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We modeled residues 80–273 into clear electron density, including all side chains, but observed density of increasingly poor quality in the C-terminus beyond residue 273 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Thus, we were able to model with confidence only a single α helix in this region, corresponding to residues 274–308, with incomplete side chain structures. To determine whether the remaining region of the protein actually existed in the crystals and not just in the protein preparation used for crystallization, we analyzed crystals using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and SDS-PAGE. Both analyses indicated that the crystals consisted of an approximate 50:50 mixture of the FliD<sub>78–405</sub> protein used for crystallization and a further proteolyzed version with a molecular weight of about 27 kDa. The N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag is still detectable by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Thus, the proteolyzed form corresponds approximately to residues 78–319 of FliD. The 86 residues absent from the C-terminus in a population of FliD proteins are clearly not required for crystal packing, suggesting that they are highly flexible even in a crystalline environment.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18857.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD reveals structural similarity to other flagellar proteins.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the FliD proteins used in these studies.

The head region is itself comprised of two separate, but entwined, protein domains. Residues 80–101 form two β strands that belong to the first domain (Head 1), the second domain (Head 2) is formed in its entirety by the contiguous residues 104–230, and residues 231–273 then complete the first domain. The second domain is, thus, a loop insertion of the first domain. We searched for structural homologs of these domains in the Protein Data Bank and found that the first domain of the head region (Head 1) exhibits high structural similarity (RMSD=2.5 Å), despite low sequence identity (14%), to the FlgK/HAP1/hook filament capping protein of <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (PDB code 4UT1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Likewise, the second head region domain (Head 2) exhibits high structural similarity (RMSD=2.7 Å), despite low sequence identity (17%), to the FliC/flagellin protein of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PDB code 4NX9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In contrast to the head region, the leg region of FliD is highly flexible, as indicated by the paucity of electron density corresponding to residues 274–405 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Despite this, we were able to model the initial α helical structural element, corresponding to residues 274–308, of this region. This helix extends from the axis of the head region at a nearly perpendicular angle, resulting in an L-shaped monomer subunit structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FliD from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 forms a hexamer</title><p>In the crystal, FliD<sub>78–405</sub> monomer subunits are arranged in hexamers, resulting in a shape akin to a six-pointed star when viewed from the top of the FliD oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), which corresponds to the distal end of the growing flagellum. This star shape has a minimum inner diameter of 48 Å and a maximal outer diameter of 136 Å. When viewed from the side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), the FliD hexamer appears as a six-legged stool, the legs of which extend 55 Å below the bottom of the head region. Additional crystallographic symmetry results in the stacking of hexamers in alternating head-to-head and leg-to-leg orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The leg-to-leg stacking forms dodecamers, resulting from the helix–helix interaction of the residues 274–302 of stacked molecules and the interaction of residues 303–308 of one FliD<sub>78–405</sub> molecule with Head 1 domain of a stacked molecule, burying a surface area of 1362 Å<sup>2</sup>. The formation of dodecamers may be unique to the FliD<sub>78–405</sub> fragment, as this strand could potentially be replaced by additional N-terminal residues in the full-length FliD<sub>1–474</sub> protein. All of the morphologies observed for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD are highly reminiscent of the pentamer/decamer oligomeric organization of <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD as determined by low-resolution cryo-EM analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Indeed, despite the difference in the stoichiometries of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD oligomers, the gross measurements are nearly identical for these two proteins of similar molecular weight. In our crystal structure, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD measures 136 Å in diameter with a head region that is 30 Å deep and a leg region that is 55 Å long; whereas, in the cryo-EM structure, <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD measures 145 Å in diameter with a head region that is 30 Å deep and a leg region that is 55 Å long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18857.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD forms hexamers in crystals.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top view, cartoon representation of the FliD<sub>78–405</sub> hexamer.

Thus, we confirmed that the hexameric assembly of FliD<sub>78–405</sub> occurs not only in the crystalline environment but also in solution using negative stain EM class averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in an image that clearly exhibits a hexameric assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). These data are consistent with the oligomerization state that we detected in the crystal structure, in which a view looking down the α-helices of the leg reveals a six-membered ring organization. We also verified that both FliD<sub>78–405</sub> and full-length FliD<sub>1–474</sub> form oligomers by both analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and crosslinking analyses. We found that the FliD<sub>78–405</sub> fragment that we crystallized oligomerizes up to a dodecameric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,c</xref>), similar to the crystallographic assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

To determine whether these interactions were sufficient to drive oligomerization of FliD, we expressed and purified the head region only, FliD<sub>78–273</sub>.

Because different buffer conditions, including changes in pH, have been shown to affect the polymerization states of flagellar filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shibata et al., 2005</xref>) and capping proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imada et al., 1998</xref>), we performed additional AUC experiments and found that FliD<sub>78–273</sub> is entirely monomeric at pH 8.0 and becomes approximately one-third dimeric at pH 5.0; we observed no higher-order oligomers of FliD<sub>78–273</sub> regardless of buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We also assessed, by chemical cross-linking, the oligomerization states of FliD variants lacking only the N-terminal coiled-coil domain (FliD<sub>78–474</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) or the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (FliD<sub>1–405</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).

We subjected FliD<sub>78–405</sub> to H/D exchange for 10 s to 2 hr and observed that the head region (residues 80–273) of FliD<sub>78–405</sub> adopts a largely stable exchange-protected fold with greater stability observed for domain 2 relative to that of domain 1. The leg region, particularly residues C-terminal to the α helix observed in the crystal structure, is more disordered or less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).

HDX-MS heat maps show the overall high degree of flexibility of FliD regions outside the head domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), and difference plots of FliD truncations in comparison to the full length FliD<sub>1–474</sub> indicate that the head region, and more specifically head region domain 1, is stabilized by FliD regions outside of the head region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Indeed, the N-terminal coiled coil is responsible for this stabilization of head region domain 1, in addition to stabilization of residues between the leg region α helix and the C-terminal coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Finally, the C-terminal coiled coil predominantly stabilizes residues in the N-terminal coiled coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). The stabilization of one FliD region by another is most likely to be direct and intramolecular, rather than allosteric and intermolecular, as the full-length protein FliD<sub>1–474</sub> adopts predominantly monomeric species under the conditions that we used for HDX-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This leads to a transient structural model of the entire FliD monomer subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>) in which the N-terminal coiled coil bridges the head and foot regions and is itself pinned to these structural elements by the C-terminal coiled coil. Notably, none of the flexible regions of FliD, save the C-terminal 20 residues, are consistently predicted by sequence analysis to be intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>); rather, they are inherently capable of adopting a limited number of conformations required to be in an 'on-state' (actively chaperoning and sorting a FliC protein) or an 'off-state' (engaging only structured and previously positioned FliC proteins).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At the gross structural level, our studies show that the oligomeric states differ between FliD protein assemblies in diverse bacteria. <italic>Salmonella</italic> has long served as the model for bacterial flagellum structure and function. Since <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD performs its native flagellar capping function as a pentamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>), it could reasonably be assumed that all FliD proteins form pentamers at the distal ends of all bacterial flagella. We found that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD instead forms hexamers both in crystals and in solution. Additionally, we showed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD constrained to its hexameric state by inter-subunit disulfide bonds is functional in vivo, resulting in the formation of flagella and swimming motility. Conversely, <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD that assembles as pentamers does not allow flagellar formation and swimming motility in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria.</p><p>Much like cryo-EM studies of flagellar filaments from diverse bacteria unequivocally showed that the number of protofilaments ranges, at least, from 11 in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>) to seven in <italic>Campylobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galkin et al., 2008</xref>), our structural analyses show that the proteins that cap these filaments also vary in their oligomeric states. The end of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> filament exhibits a non-planar surface with five indentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>) into which the five legs of the corresponding FliD pentamer have been modeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>). Although no structure of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> filament has been determined even at low resolution, our hexameric FliD structure suggests that it may incorporate an even greater number of protofilaments than does the <italic>Salmonella</italic> filament. This would allow the formation of an additional molecular cavity on the distal end of FliD that accommodates its unique capping protein hexamer. Indeed, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> flagellar filaments have been found to be macroscopically different from those of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shibata et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>At 2.2 Å resolution, our crystal structure reveals several previously unknown structural features of FliD that are likely to be critical to its function. First, each one of the six FliD head regions that appear as discreet lobes when visualized by EM analysis is actually composed of the first and second domains of neighboring monomer subunits, as opposed to both domains belonging to the same subunit. This is likely the case for FliD oligomers from diverse bacteria, including <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD for which cryo-EM analyses showed five head region lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maki-Yonekura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yonekura et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2003</xref>). Second, despite vanishingly low sequence similarity, each domain within the head region exhibits high structural similarity to the corresponding domains of other flagellar proteins, including the hook-filament junction protein/FlgK and flagellin/FliC. Thus, at least one protein domain from the proteins that occupy the distal ends of the hook (FlgK) and the cap (FliD) adopts a common structural fold, which may be required for and unique to their function at these related positions within the flagellum. This domain conservation among flagellar proteins confirms a previous study proposing a structural relationship of FliD to other flagellar proteins despite their low sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</xref>). This structural conservation suggests that a structurally similar cap complex may form at both hook and on the distal end. It also suggests that FliD may play a functional role earlier in the flagellar assembly process, prior to its known FliC sorting function. Notably, in mutants of <italic>Salmonella</italic> that lack filaments, FlgK (HAP1), FliD (HAP2) and FlgL (HAP3) form a layered structure at the distal end of the hook-basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Homma and Iino, 1985</xref>). In addition, the shared domain structure of portions of FliC and FliD suggests that the chaperoning activity of FliD could derive, at least in part, from its presentation of a like-structured template against which FliC subunits may fold prior to being positioned into the growing filament.</p><p>Owing to the conformational flexibility of FliD necessitated by its FliC sorting function, we still lack high-resolution structural information for certain regions of this protein. However, using a number of biophysical methods, we found that molecular determinants outside of the conformationally stable head regions control FliD oligomerization. Previous analysis of a trypsinized fragment of <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD that lacks the N-terminal 42 residues and C-terminal 51 residues, which is similar to the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD<sub>78–405</sub> protein that we crystallized, showed that this fragment can form pentamers but not decamers in solution and dissociates into smaller oligomers at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vonderviszt et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that determinants outside of the head regions of FliD proteins of diverse bacteria control their oligomeric states. Accordingly, we showed that FliD, when constrained to its hexameric state by disulfide bonds formed between neighboring head domain subunits, is fully functional in vivo. Thus,conformational flexibility in or relative repositioning of the head regions are not functional requirements of FliD but flexibility in regions outside of the head regions undoubtedly is. Considering that inhibiting protein–protein interfaces with small molecules remains a major technical challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkin et al., 2014</xref>), the dependence of FliD oligomeric assembly on its flexible regions enhances the prospects of developing small molecule inhibitors of FliD oligomerization, and consequently of flagellar function, as a novel class of antibiotic agents.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For crystallization, the coding sequence optimized for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> of FliD<sub>78–405</sub> from the PAO1 strain of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was synthesized and cloned into the pET-28b vector (Novagen) with the inclusion of an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site.

author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bacterial flagellar capping proteins adopt diverse oligomeric states&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Richard M Berry (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Keiichi Namba (Reviewer #2) and Gillian Fraser (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the findings are important and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, one major point of concern remains: whether the hexameric form is biologically relevant in the full-length FliD, rather than a consequence of the loss of the D0 domain.</p><p>Before the paper can be accepted for publication, the authors should present solid experimental evidence that the hexameric complex is really the physiological form of the filament cap of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> flagella. This might best be achieved if the authors could show hexamers of full-length FliD by negative stain EM and class averaging, as they have done for the FliD<sub>78-405</sub> truncate.</p><p>The individual reviewers' reports are included below. The authors should also address the reviewers' points in detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The presentation of the atomic structure of the hexameric fragment of FliD, with its similarities in fold to other flagellar components but different symmetry to the pentameric FliD of <italic>Salmonella</italic> make this paper interesting and important.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Introduction: Chain mechanism is controversial. Acknowledge that and cite instead – Trends Microbiol. 2015 May;23(5):296-300. Fueling type III secretion. Lee PC, Rietsch A.

Present evidence of a hexamer in the full-length protein.</italic> </p><p>In the absence of the flagellar filament, full-length FliD from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> PAO1 does not predominate as stable hexamers. We have shown that the hexamer is formed in crosslinking experiments and by AUC, but only a small fraction of the total protein actually forms a hexamer. By crosslinking, we can detect monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric and hexameric species; by AUC analysis of highly concentrated FliD solutions, we detect tetrameric and hexameric species, predominantly. It is possible that the tetramer may be some form of stable intermediate on the path to hexamers, but we do not have enough data to say this unequivocally. Despite the lack of stability of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD hexamer, we previously (prior to submission of the original manuscript, in fact) attempted to perform negative-stain EM using both crosslinked FliD<sub>1-474</sub> and native FliD<sub>1-474</sub> at low pH, in the hopes that we could detect larger particles. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in this regard. The tendency of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD to oligomerize is much less than that of <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD, for which the equilibrium state in solution, even in the absence of the flagellar filament, is almost entirely decameric, as previously shown by crosslinking and AUC analyses conducted by others (and confirmed by us – data not shown).</p><p>Regardless of whether we could visualize the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD hexamer or not in solution at low resolution by negative-stain EM, we contend that this experiment would not conclusively show that the hexamer was the bona fide functional unit. To show this, we would have to show that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD acts as a hexamer in vivo, which we have done in a series of additional experiments shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. These experiments are briefly summarized, as follows. We designed, based on our crystal structure, disulfide bonds in full-length <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD that results in a stable FliD hexamer under non-reducing conditions, which we showed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry and SAXS. We then complemented a △<italic>fliD Pseudomonas</italic> strain with the full-length disulfide-constrained <italic>fliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub></italic> gene, which we tested for swimming motility in a functional assay. This complemented strain restored the swimming motility that was lost in the △<italic>fliD</italic> strain, in a way indistinguishable to that of a full-length wildtype complement (△<italic>fliD/fliD<sub>1-474</sub></italic>). We isolated flagella from the live, growing △<italic>fliD/fliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub> Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria and showed by Western blot analysis that the FliD<sub>1-474(I167C/D253C)</sub> protein remained hexameric in these flagella that provided swimming motility to the bacteria. We therefore conclude that FliD from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> is functional in a disulfide-locked, hexameric state. Because the disulfide bond was formed between neighboring head regions, these data also indicate that flexibility of the head domains, or at least their relative repositioning, is not required for FliD capping function. In contrast, we found in a similar set of genetic and functional experiments that <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD cannot complement a △<italic>fliD Pseudomonas</italic> strain and does not restore swimming motility, additional evidence that FliD in a pentameric state is incompatible with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> flagella formation.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “Multiple regions of FliD interact with one another”: show a model of a full-length monomer and relate this to the native state.</italic> </p><p>We have added a model of what our data suggests the full-length monomer structure is (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This model is based on the following data: (i) our crystal structure indicating the atomic positions of FliD residues 78-273 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); (ii) the likely interfacing regions from those domains that are not modeled in our crystallographic model or missing from the fragment that we crystallized, including the foot, N-terminal coiled coil and C-terminal coiled coil domains, as indicated by our HDX-MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>); and (iii) the SAXS molecular envelope that we generated for the disulfide-linked hexamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We believe that this model of the monomer reflects its native “resting” state, that is, the structure of the monomer in the absence of the flagellar filament or of a FliD monomer subunit on the distal end of the flagellar filament that is not actively chaperoning and sorting a FliC protein subunit. The dynamic nature of FliD suggests that FliD monomers within the cap oligomer will adopt a different structure(s) when chaperoning and sorting FliC subunits, which our data does not inform and that we believe is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>4) In the first paragraph of the Discussion: Is this the most likely solution?

(See also reviewer #3, comment 1).</italic> </p><p>Yes, all of our data indicates that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD oligomerizes as a hexamer in crystals, in solution and in vivo (see response to reviewer #1, comment #2). No evidence exists that <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD ever adopts any form other than a pentamer (except when it forms a decamer in the absence of the flagellar filament) and, likewise, there is no evidence that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD exists in a state other than a hexamer in vivo.</p><p><italic>5) In the first paragraph of the Discussion: Compare to &quot;domain-swap&quot; model of FliG – Domain-swap polymerization drives the self-assembly of the bacterial flagellar motor.

Accordingly, “domain-swapping” between head domains cannot be the driving force for self-assembly. Also, by locking full-length FliD in a hexameric state with disulfide bonds between neighboring head domains, the protein remains functional and complements △<italic>fliD</italic> strains in swimming motility assays. Therefore, it is also unlikely that domain-swap polymerization between the head domains plays any functional role. Without high-resolution structural information for the other flexible regions of FliD that do drive self-assembly, though, it is possible that domain-swaps occur between these other domains. Such a domain-swap molecular mechanism within these other regions outside of the head region may contribute, in part or in whole, to FliD self-assembly. However, with such an extent of missing structure, we have no evidence of this at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Abstract: Phrases such as &quot;regulates assembly&quot; and &quot;Without FliD, flagella are improperly constructed&quot; do not appropriately describe the FliD function because the flagella are not formed at all in the absence of FliD.</italic> </p><p>This has been altered accordingly in text.</p><p><italic>2) Introduction: Many people have expressed doubt on the validity of the chain mechanism proposed by Evans et al. 2013, partly because of the presence of solid data of an exponential decay in the flagellar growth rate by Iino 1974.

We conclude that the authors of this paper have incorrectly interpreted their data. While it is clear from their data that <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> FliC and FliD can be exchanged (see Figures 2A, 3A, 4A and 7A), it is equally clear that <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliC as well as FliD cannot be exchanged to produce functional flagella. For instance, there is clearly no difference in Figure 2B, spots #3 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> mutant (SJW2536)), #4 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> mutant transduced with p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliC</italic>). #5 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> mutant p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAK) <italic>fliC</italic>), #6 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant (MH43)), and#7 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant transduced with p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliD</italic>). None of these strains exhibit swarming motility in this assay, whereas wildtype <italic>Pseae</italic> (PAK) and <italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) strains do exhibit swarming motility, as seen in Figure 2B, spots #1 and #2, respectively. Likewise, the electron microscopic evidence is non-existent for functional FliC and FliD exchange between <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. In Figure 5A, panels #2 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> mutant transduced with p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliC</italic>) and #3 (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> mutant transduced with p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAK) <italic>fliC</italic>) do not show functional flagella. Similarly, appendages shown in Figure 8A (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant transduced with p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliD</italic>) look nothing like fully formed wildtype flagella. These short, stubby appendages do not resemble the functional flagella shown in other electron micrographs in this paper (e.g., of wildtype bacteria strains), but could possibly be flagella formed up to the hook, which would fit with non-exchangeability of these FliC and also FliD proteins (although we do not have access to enough of their data to say this with any certainty). Finally, in Figure 9C, the double complementation (<italic>Salty</italic> △<italic>fliC</italic> △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant transduced with both p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliC</italic> and p<italic>Pseae</italic> (PAO1) <italic>fliD</italic> together) exhibit absolutely no appendages that could be (mis)construed as flagella. It is unclear to us how Inaba et al. could interpret these data to conclude that <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD are functionally exchangeable.</p><p>We took the additional step of testing this concept ourselves. We asked whether <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD could be functionally exchanged with <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD, using wildtype <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, a △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain, and the same △<italic>fliD</italic> mutant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strain complemented with <italic>Salmonella fliD</italic> – essentially a repetition of the Inaba et al. experiments but in the reverse knock-out/complementation direction. In our swimming motility assay, we found that the latter (△<italic>fliD/fliD<sub>StyFliDe</sub></italic>) strain was completely non-functional in this assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> in our revised manuscript). These data agree with our re-interpretation of Inaba et al.’s data and indicate that, indeed, <italic>Salmonella</italic> FliD (a pentamer) cannot be functionally exchanged with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> FliD (a hexamer).</p><p>We have also revisited the Cohen-Krausz &amp; Trachtenberg paper mentioned by the reviewer. Well prior to the publication of this paper in 2003, <italic>Pseudomonas rhodos</italic> had been renamed <italic>Methylobacterium rhodinum</italic>. These bacteria diverge at the class level – the former belongs to the class of Gammaproteobacteria and the latter to Alphaproteobacteria. No genomic sequence data is available for this bacterium and no gene or protein sequence from it appears when we conduct a BLAST search using the <italic>Pseudomonas fliD</italic> gene or FliD protein sequences.
