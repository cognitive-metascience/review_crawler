crucial for several T cell functions, but a role in regulating basal cellular motility has not been described. Here, we show that inhibition of Orai1 channel activity increases average cell velocities by reducing the frequency of pauses in human T cells migrating through confined spaces, even in the absence of extrinsic cell contacts or antigen recognition. Utilizing a novel ratiometric genetically encoded cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Salsa6f, which permits real-time monitoring of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> along with cell motility, we show that spontaneous pauses during T cell motility in vitro and in vivo coincide with episodes of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Furthermore, lymph node T cells exhibited two types of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients: short-duration ‘sparkles’ and longer duration global signals. Our results demonstrate that spontaneous and self-peptide MHC-dependent activation of Orai1 ensures random walk behavior in T cells to optimize immune surveillance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27827.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To help protect the body from disease, small immune cells called T lymphocytes move rapidly, searching for signs of infection. These signs are antigens – processed pieces of proteins from invading bacteria and viruses – which are displayed on the surface of so-called antigen-presenting cells. To visit as many different antigen-presenting cells as possible, T cells move quickly from one to the next in an apparently random manner. How T cells are programmed to move in this way is largely unknown.</p><p>The entry of calcium ions into cells triggers characteristic actions in many cells throughout the body. In T cells, calcium ions enter through Orai1 proteins that form calcium channels on the cell surface. Now, Dong, Othy et al. have asked whether calcium signals guide moving T cells as they search for antigens.</p><p>Experiments with individual human T cells in small tubes showed that blocking the Orai1 calcium channels caused the T cells to move faster, because the cells paused less often. The same was seen when human T cells were transplanted into mice.</p><p>These findings suggested that calcium signals may indeed guide the T cells’ movement, but actually being able to see the calcium signals in the cell would give a much clearer picture of what goes on. To achieve this, Dong, Othy et al. report, in a related study, how they genetically engineered mice to produce a calcium-sensitive reporter protein in their T cells.</p><p>Using these new transgenic mice, Dong, Othy et al. could see calcium signals in the T cells before each of the T cell’s pauses. Further experiments showed that the calcium signals that control the cell’s movements are triggered both by contact with the antigen-presenting cells and internally within the T cells themselves. In another related study, Guichard et al. also conclude that contact with antigen-presenting cells causes calcium signals that control the responses of T cells.</p><p>Seemingly random patterns of movement help T cells search for signs of infection, and these new findings reveal a basic part of how T cells are programmed to move in this way. A deeper understanding of T cell movement might allow this process to be controlled. In particular, this knowledge could lead to new treatments for autoimmune diseases, in which T cells incorrectly recognize the body’s own antigens as signs of an infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell motility</kwd><kwd>Orai1</kwd><kwd>genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ signaling</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS-14609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IGERT DGE-1144901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Tobias X.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI-121945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-41514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant T32-AI-060573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Milton L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Grant T32-GM-008620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Tobias X.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Orai1 channels activate intermittently in motile T cells, generating calcium transients, detected by a novel genetically encoded indicator and inducing pauses that favor antigen scanning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To initiate the adaptive immune response, T cells must make direct contact with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the lymph node, enabling T cell receptors (TCRs) to engage peptide-bound MHC molecules presented on the APC surface. Because cognate antigens are rare for any given TCR, many APCs must be scanned to identify those bearing cognate antigens. Thus, optimizing T cell motility to balance search sensitivity, specificity, and speed is crucial for efficient antigen search and proper immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahalan and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>). Both cell-intrinsic and environmental factors have been proposed to regulate T cell motility within lymph nodes and peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousso and Robey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mempel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mrass et al., 2010</xref>). T cell motility in steady-state lymph nodes under homeostatic conditions, referred to as ‘basal motility’, has been likened to diffusive Brownian motion, resembling a ‘stop-and-go’ random walk that results in an overall exploratory spread characterized by a linear mean-squared displacement over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). Subsequent studies defined a role of cellular cues in guiding T cell migration, such as contact with the lymph node stromal cell network or short-term encounters with resident dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajénoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khan et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas the basic signaling mechanisms for cell-intrinsic induction of random motility have been previously explored in fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrie et al., 2009</xref>), it remains unclear if such mechanisms apply in T cells.</p><p>Upon T cell recognition of cognate antigen, TCR engagement results in an elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that acts as a ‘STOP’ signal to halt motility and anchor the T cell to the site of antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donnadieu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dustin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhakta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreau et al., 2015</xref>). The predominant mechanism for increasing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in T cells is through store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE), which is mediated by the molecular components STIM1 and Orai1. TCR stimulation triggers depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in translocation of the ER-resident Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 to specialized ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where Orai1 channels aggregate into puncta and activate to allow sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calloway et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Orai1 channel activity is crucial for immune function, as human mutations in Orai1 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feske et al., 2006</xref>). Additional roles of Orai1 have been defined in chemotaxis to certain chemokines and T cell homing to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>); actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich and Burkhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartzell et al., 2016</xref>); migration during shear flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schaff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixit et al., 2011</xref>); lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maus et al., 2017</xref>); and dendritic spine maturation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Korkotian et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite their contributions to other aspects of T cell function, no role has been identified for Orai1 channels in T-cell motility patterns underlying scanning behavior.</p><p>In this study, we use human and mouse T cells to assess the role of Orai1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in regulating basal cell motility. Expression of a dominant-negative Orai1-E106A construct was used to block Orai1 channel activity in human T cells, both in vivo within immunodeficient mouse lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>), and in vitro within microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobelli, Friedman et al. 2010</xref>). We use our genetically encoded Salsa6f tandem green/red fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2017</xref>) to monitor spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human T cells migrating in confined microchannels in vitro. Finally, using a transgenic mouse strain expressing Salsa6f homozygously in Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cells, designated as Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice from here on, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals occur in the absence of specific antigen as T cells crawl in the lymph node. Our results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, activated intermittently through Orai1 channels, triggers spontaneous pauses during T-cell motility and fine-tunes the random-walk search for cognate antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of Orai1 in human T cells using a dominant-negative construct</title><p>To study the role of Orai1 channel activity in T cell motility, we transfected human T cells with the dominant-negative mutant Orai1-E106A to selectively eliminate ion conduction through the Orai1 pore. The glutamate residue at position 106 in human Orai1 forms the selectivity filter of the Orai1 pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeromin et al., 2006</xref>), and because the Orai1 channel is a functional hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2012</xref>), mutation of E106 to neutrally charged alanine completely inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation in a potent dominant-negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Using Fura-2 based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we confirmed Orai1 channel block by E106A in activated human T cells transfected with either eGFP-tagged Orai1-E106A or empty vector for control. Thapsigargin-induced SOCE was greatly diminished in cells expressing eGFP-Orai1-E106A, referred to here as eGFP-E106<sup>hi</sup> T cells, compared to empty vector-transfected control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was also partially inhibited in a population of transfected T cells with minimal eGFP fluorescence referred to as eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> cells. To confirm that eGFP-E106A inhibits T cell activation, we challenged transfected human T cells with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with the superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lioudyno et al., 2008</xref>). T cell proliferation was markedly suppressed in eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not in eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This shows that the residual Orai1 channel activity in eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells is sufficient for T cell activation and proliferation. Taken together, these experiments show that eGFP-tagged Orai1-E106A expression can serve as a robust tool to assess cellular roles of Orai1 channel activity and that transfected cells without detectable eGFP fluorescence can be used as an internal control.</p><p>Orai1 function in human T cell motility was evaluated in vivo using a human xenograft model in which immunodeficient NOD.SCID.β2 mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes, followed by imaging of excised lymph nodes using two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Reconstitution has been shown to produce a high density of human immune cells within the lymph nodes of immunodeficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mosier et al., 1988</xref>), simulating the crowded migratory environment experienced by T cells under normal physiological conditions. Three weeks after reconstitution, human T cells were purified from the same donor, transfected, and adoptively transferred into the reconstituted NOD.SCID.β2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas control T cells transfected with eGFP showed robust expression and successfully homed to lymph nodes following adoptive transfer 24 hr post-transfection, eGFP-E106A transfected T cells did not home to lymph nodes in the same period, consistent with our previous study indicating that functional Orai1 channel activity is required for T cell homing to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>). To circumvent the homing defect, we injected eGFP-E106A transfected T cells only 3 hr post-transfection, before the expression level of eGFP-E106A had become sufficiently high to block lymph node entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Orai1 block increases human T cell motility within intact lymph node</title><p>To evaluate Orai1 function in T cell motility, we imaged human T cells within intact lymph nodes of reconstituted NOD.SCID.β2 mice by two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells migrated with significantly higher average velocities than co-transferred, mock-transfected CMTMR-labeled T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although both populations had similar maximum and minimum instantaneous cell velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells traversed longer distances compared to CMTMR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and directionality ratios, a measure of track straightness, decayed more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) indicating straighter paths when Orai1 channels were blocked. Orai1-blocked cells displayed shallower turn angles than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, arrest coefficients, defined by the fraction of time that cell velocity was &lt;2 µm/min, was six-fold lower for eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells than for control T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These differences in motility suggest that the increase in average cell velocity caused by Orai1 block is not due to eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells moving faster than control T cells, but rather due to a reduced frequency of pausing. Consistent with this interpretation, no eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells with average velocities &lt;7 µm/min were observed, unlike control T cells in which 23% of average velocities were &lt;7 µm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>To replicate our findings in a different immunodeficient mouse model, we repeated our human T cell adoptive transfer protocol using NOD.SCID mice depleted of NK cells. Lymph nodes in these mice are small and contain reticular structures but are completely devoid of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shultz et al., 1995</xref>). Similar to experiments on reconstituted NOD.SCID.β2 mice, eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> human T cells in NOD.SCID lymph nodes migrated with significantly elevated average velocities compared to control T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and exhibited lower arrest coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Both eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> and control T cells migrated at lower speeds in the NK-depleted NOD.SCID model compared to the reconstituted NOD.SCID.β2 model. Because control human T cells in reconstituted NOD.SCID.β2 lymph nodes migrated at similar speeds to wild-type mouse T cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2002</xref>), reconstitution results in a lymph node environment that more closely mimics normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, the greater effect of Orai1 block on T cell arrest coefficients in crowded reconstituted lymph nodes suggests that Orai1’s role in motility is more pronounced in crowded cell environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Orai1 channel activity triggers pauses during human T cell motility in vitro in the absence of extrinsic cell contact</title><p>To evaluate whether the pronounced effect of Orai1 channel block on the arrest coefficient in reconstituted lymph nodes was a result of environmental factors such as increased cellular contacts or increased confinement, we tracked human T cells in microfabricated PDMS chambers with cell-sized microchannels 7 µm high x 8 µm wide. These ICAM-1 coated microchannels simulate the confined environment of densely packed lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobelli et al., 2010</xref>), while eliminating possible cell-extrinsic factors. Transfected human T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/28 antibodies and soluble IL-2, then dropped into chambers and monitored by time-lapse confocal microscopy, using phase contrast to visualize eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Upon entry into microchannels, eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells migrated with higher average cell velocities than eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), similar to our in vivo findings from intact lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To ensure that the observed difference in cell velocity was due to suppressed Orai1 channel function and not overexpression of Orai1 protein, we also tracked T cells transfected with eGFP-tagged wild-type Orai1. Both eGFP-Orai1<sup>hi</sup> and eGFP-Orai1<sup>lo</sup> T cells migrated at the same average cell velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), demonstrating that Orai1 channel overexpression, in itself, does not perturb T cell motility in microchannels. Since eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells have reduced Orai1 channel activity but still retain the same cell velocity as eGFP-Orai1 transfected T cells (c.f., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>), this suggests that partial Orai1 function is sufficient to generate normal pausing frequency in confined environments. The frequency distribution of cell velocities in vitro is comparable to our in vivo data: fewer GFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells migrated with average cell velocities &lt;7 µm/min as compared to eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (11% vs 29%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells exhibited lower arrest coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and less variation in velocity than eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Although eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells had lower arrest coefficients, the durations of their pauses were not significantly different than in eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken together, the reduced arrest coefficients in eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> T cells indicate that inhibition of Orai1 channel activity results in reduced frequency of pauses during T cell motility. These in vitro results confirm our in vivo findings and support the hypothesis that Orai1 activity intermittently triggers cell arrest, resulting in an overall decrease in motility within confined environments. Moreover, since our in vitro microchannel assay eliminates extrinsic cell-cell interactions, this indicates that Orai1 can be spontaneously activated to modulate T cell motility.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27827.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of expressing Orai1-E106A on human T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Averaged thapsigargin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, measured by fura-2, in activated human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells transfected with eGFP-Orai1-E106A (left) or empty vector control (EV, right, n = 133 cells); eGFP-E106A transfected cells were grouped into two populations, either eGFP-E106A<sup>hi</sup> with high eGFP fluorescence (solid squares, n = 43 cells) or eGFP-E106A<sup>lo</sup> with no detectable eGFP fluorescence (empty squares, n = 115 cells); bars represent SEM.

However, this approach is limiting when it comes to identifying the abundance and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events, because transferred cells label only a fraction of the lymph node (&lt;1%) and longer imaging intervals are required to collect sufficient volume of 4D data (&gt;5 s). Therefore, to measure the endogenous frequency and duration Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we imaged homeostatic Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) lymph nodes at two frames per second. All endogenous T cells (Cd4<sup>+</sup> and Cd8<sup>+</sup>) are labeled with the Salsa6f probe in Cd4-Salsa6f lymph nodes because T cells go through the double-positive stage during development in the thymus. More than 800 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were identified in a 300 × 300 µm area in a 10-min interval. We identified two types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients: numerous small and brief spots (sparkles); and less frequent large, cell-wide transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

Indeed, constant recognition of low levels of self-antigens through T cells receptor (TCR)-pMHC interactions is critical for maintaining sensitivity to foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stefanová et al., 2002</xref>); and deprivation (&gt;7 days) of pMHC-II signals impairs T cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>).

In contrast, the intensity of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in MHC blocked lymph nodes did not differ significantly from the ITC controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>).

Human T cells expressing the dominant-negative Orai1-E106A construct migrated with higher average velocities than controls, both in reconstituted mouse lymph nodes in vivo and in confined microchannels in vitro. In particular, we found that the increase in average cell velocity was not due to an increase in maximum cell velocity, but to a reduced frequency of cell pausing accompanied by increased directional persistence, resulting in straighter paths. Human T cells demonstrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient-associated and Orai1-dependent pauses in vitro within confined microchannels devoid of cell-extrinsic factors. Furthermore, we use a novel ratiometric genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Salsa6f, along with T cells from Cd4-Salsa6f(Hom) transgenic mice, to show that intermittent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals coincide with reduced cell velocity. Treatment of Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice with MHC class-I and -II blocking antibodies substantially reduces but does not eliminate the frequent T cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients seen in lymph nodes. Based on these findings, we propose that Orai1 channel activity regulates the timing of stop-and-go motility in T cells and tunes the search for cognate antigen in the crowded lymph node.</p><p>Our Orai1-E106A construct derives its specificity and potency by targeting the pore residue responsible for the channel selectivity filter. Incorporation of Orai1-E106A likely blocks heterodimers of Orai1 and other channels, such as Orai2 or Orai3, in addition to homomeric Orai1 channels. Very recent evidence demonstrates the existence of heteromeric channels composed of Orai1 and Orai2 in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaeth et al., 2017</xref>). These heteromers appear to simply reduce the flow of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the Orai1 channel without targeting additional signaling pathways. In the absence of contradictory evidence, we conclude that in T cells Orai1-E106A acts to produce an essentially complete functional knockdown of Orai1-mediated store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p><p>Human T cells exhibit systematic changes in motility behavior after Orai1 block, including: increased average velocity, fewer pauses, increased directional persistence and decreased turn angles, and increased motility spread over time. Importantly, maximum and minimum instantaneous velocities are unchanged. For human T cells assessed in motility assays in vitro, similar Orai1-dependent changes are seen. Altered pausing behavior caused by Orai1 block is displayed by isolated single cells inside microchannels formed from photolithographically precise silicon master molds. Changes in motility are dependent upon confinement, as Orai1 block alters pausing under confined but not open-field conditions. The absence of changes to maximum and minimum velocities in vivo and open-field motility in vitro indicates that Orai1 block is not generally deleterious for cell health and movement, but instead acts upon subcellular mechanisms that are selectively employed during cell motility in confined spaces. Taken together, these systematic changes caused by Orai1 block reveal the presence of an Orai1-dependent cell motility program that is utilized frequently enough to be easily detected by changes in the motility characteristics of T cells in the lymph node.</p><p>We used Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice to track Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in intact mouse lymph nodes and Salsa6f transient transfection to track Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in human T cells in vitro and in reconstituted mouse lymph nodes. In our companion paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2017</xref>, we show that Salsa6f expression in Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cells is non-perturbing with respect to lymphocyte development, cellular phenotype, cell proliferation, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that homing to lymph nodes is unaffected, as are movement patterns within the lymph node, cell velocity, directional persistence, diffusive spread, and motility coefficient. We find that across cells, elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are inversely correlated with instantaneous velocity, both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, moving cells exhibit local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are strongly associated with pauses in motility. By inspection of movement patterns, turning is likely associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events as well, but this has not been established because most cells move outside of our shallow imaging field either before or after pausing. In many contexts, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown not only to accompany, but also to cause cell arrest and loss of cell polarity, such as in T cells after activation by antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dustin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). By averaging events, the peak of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was found to precede the velocity minimum. This event order is consistent with Ca<sup>2+</sup> causing pauses. While we do not show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals we observe emanate directly from Orai1 channels, taken together our data are consistent with Orai1 actively regulating cell motility by directly inducing a subcellular motility program that leads to cell arrest.</p><p>Two-photon imaging indicated that the frequency of Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cells Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients varies widely between Salsa6f lymph nodes, even when events are normalized for different cell numbers. The origin of this variability is unclear but may result from differences in the distribution and functional properties of APCs within the imaging field. Treatment of MHC class-I and –II blocking antibodies substantially reduces but does not eliminate T cells Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Clearly, a significant number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are caused by T cell-APC interactions that act through MHC proteins. Given that Orai1 motility events occur frequently as T cell migrate through the lymph node, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are associated with pauses in motility, we propose that spontaneously generated Orai1-dependent pauses and turns can be triggered by T cell-APC interaction through MHC proteins.</p><p>However, we find evidence for MHC-independent triggering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and Orai1 channel activation in the lymph node. Human T cells exhibit Orai1-dependent pauses in vitro when migrating as isolated cells in highly uniform microchannels. Salsa6f expression independently detects Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in isolated T cells moving within microchannels but not in T cells in adjacent open field portions of the same PDMS imaging chamber. In both cases, responses were produced in the absence of MHC proteins or APCs. Moreover, we note that, in paired experiments, treatment with MHC class-I and –II blocking antibodies leads to a reduced but notably consistent frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events. Partial block would be expected to produce substantial variation, especially when combined with a variable input population. Taken together, these data point to the existence of not only MHC-independent Orai1 motility events, but also cell-intrinsic triggering of Orai1. Of note, the apparently random nature of naïve T cell movement in the lymph node has led to the hypothesis that T cells use intrinsic and stochastic motility mechanisms to accomplish immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mrass et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Germain et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies of Orai1 signaling, Orai1 activation has been placed downstream of extracellular ligand binding to cell surface receptors, integrating their input upon use-dependent depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalan and Chandy, 2009</xref>). While we expect signaling downstream of self-antigen detection to be the same as for cognate antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stefanová et al., 2002</xref>), at this point it is unclear which aspects of internal cell state might lead to cell-intrinsic opening of Orai1 channels and pauses in motility. Of particular interest is determining the step in the signaling cascade from phospholipase C to Orai1 that might be targeted by a novel cell-intrinsic activation pathway. Molecular candidates that underlie regulation of T cell motility by Ca<sup>2+</sup> are less well defined. One clue to Orai1 action is the subcellular location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at the back T cells moving within intact lymph nodes, similar to the localization of Orai1 channels during movement in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2008</xref>). Early studies demonstrated that immobilization and rounding of T cells bound to antigen-presenting B cells occurred via a calcineurin-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive cytoskeletal proteins, such as myosin II or the actin bundling protein L-plastin, as good candidates for downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich and Burkhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morley, 2013</xref>). Like Orai1, Myosin 1 g is selectively required for motility mechanisms under confined conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gérard et al., 2014</xref>). While Orai1 block reduces pausing but does not otherwise alter T cell velocity, Myo1g block increases pausing and causes cells to move faster. These differences in phenotype suggest that Orai1 and Myo1g act in different, and in part opposing, ways to control T cell motility.</p><p>Immune surveillance requires balancing many factors associated with antigen search, including speed and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedl and Weigelin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>). As moving T cells in the lymph node encounter APCs bearing antigen-MHC, they pause due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms unleashed by Orai1 channel opening. These pauses likely ensure adequate time for TCR-antigen scanning by T cell-APC pairs. Our observations of T cell motility indicates that each T cell does not stop at every APC it encounters. Because of this movement pattern, Orai1 provides attractive point of regulation of immune surveillance. Increasing Orai1 activity might be expected to cause T cells to pause more frequently when encountering APCs, restricting the distance T cells move and offering increased opportunities for contact with nearby APCs. Alternatively, decreasing Orai1 activity leads to fewer pauses, greater directional persistence, fewer turns, and greater overall diffusive spread. In this way, Orai1 channel activity could tailor T cell excursions to match the density and reach of dendritic cells in the lymph node. Finally, our findings provide further evidence that during resting conditions, TCR interactions with self-MHC antigens drive continual but limited activation of downstream signaling pathways.</p><p>We note some differences between our study and others involving Orai1, STIM1, and T cell motility. These differences might be accounted for, in part, by the expected consequences of our Orai1 dominant-negative approach: block of all three Orai isoforms, limited time for compensatory changes in cell function, and restriction of Orai block to T cells that are adoptively transferred after transfection. (1) Orai1/2 and STIM1/2 KOs have been reported to home to lymph node like wild type, unlike our results here and in a previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waite et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaeth et al., 2017</xref>). (2) Maximal T cell velocity in the lymph node requires the action of the integrin LFA-1 and the chemokine receptor CCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davalos-Misslitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katakai et al., 2013</xref>), which we have previously shown to be required for entry of T cells into lymph nodes and to act in an Orai1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Based upon these findings, blocking Orai1 would be expected to reduce CCR7 and LFA-1 function during interstitial motility as well, resulting in a decrease in T cell velocity. Instead, we find the opposite: Orai1 block leads to an increase in average cell velocity. The absence of any Orai1-dependent change in maximum velocity strongly suggests that CCR7 and LFA-1 do not act through Orai1 during motility in the lymph node. Regardless, any motility effects of LFA-1 and CCR7 are more than compensated by the reduction in pauses caused by Orai1 E106A expression. (3) Previous studies using unconfined open field motility assays have excluded a role for Orai1 in T cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svensson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuras et al., 2012</xref>). Our experiments confirm that Orai1 block does not detectably affect unconfined motility; in contrast, our studies in reconstituted lymph nodes and in confined microchannels in vitro both exhibit Orai1-dependent effects. Others have shown that confined motility in vitro better recapitulates mechanisms of motility found in T cells in intact lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal the existence of an Orai1-dependent cell motility program that leads to pausing of T cells moving within lymph nodes. Imaging with the newly developed genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Salsa6f identifies local transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events with the expected characteristics of Orai1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. We provide evidence that Orai1-dependent pauses in T cells are triggered in at least two different ways: by self-peptide MHC complexes displayed on the surface of APCs and by a novel cell intrinsic mechanism within the T cells themselves. Together these mechanisms generate motility patterns that promote efficient scanning for cognate antigens in the lymph node.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top"><bold>Designation</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Source or reference</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Identifiers</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Additional</bold> <break/><bold>information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Salsa6f</td><td valign="top">Dong et al (doi: 10.7554/eLife. 32417)</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">Cd4-Salsa6f (Het), Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom)</td><td valign="top">Dong et al (doi: 10.7554/eLife. 32417)</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>B2m<sup>tm1Unc</sup></italic>/J (NOD.SCID.β2)</td><td valign="top">Jackson #002570</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">NOD.CB17-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup></italic>/J (NOD.SCID)</td><td valign="top">Jackson #001303</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Cd4<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson #017336</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson #000664</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">transfected construct (synthetic)</td><td valign="top">eGFP-Orai1-E106A, eGFP-Orai1</td><td valign="top">23455504</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">biological sample (human)</td><td valign="top">Primary T cells from healthy human subjects</td><td valign="top">UCI</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> IRB approved</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-MHC II (Clone Y3P), <break/>anti-MHC I (Clone AF6-88.5.5.3), <break/><break/>IgG2a Isotype control (Clone: C1.18.4) </td><td valign="top">BioXCell</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NK cell antibody</td><td valign="top">Wako Chemicals</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">αCD3 and αCD28</td><td valign="top">Tonbo Biosciences</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">recombinant human ICAM</td><td valign="top">R&amp;D Systems</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">recombinant human IL-2</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">EasySep human T Cell Isolation Kit</td><td valign="top">Stemcell Technologies</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">EasySep mouse T Cell Isolation Kit</td><td valign="top">Stemcell Technologies</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Nucleofection kit</td><td valign="top">Lonza</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Sylgard Elastomer 184 kit</td><td valign="top">Dow Corning</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cell tracker CMTMR, CellTrace Yellow <break/>or CellTrace Violet</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Imaris</td><td valign="top">Bitplane</td><td valign="top"> </td><td valign="top"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and antibodies</title><p>NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>B2m<sup>tm1Unc</sup></italic>/J (NOD.SCID.β2) and NOD.CB17-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup></italic>/J (NOD.SCID) mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Stock #002570 and #001303) were housed and monitored in a selective pathogen-free environment with sterile food and water in the animal housing facility at the University of California, Irvine. NOD.SCID.β2 mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mosier et al., 1988</xref>). A total of 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> human PBLs were injected i.p., and experiments were performed 3 weeks later. To inhibit NK cell activity, NOD.SCID mice were i.p. injected with 20 μL anti-NK cell antibody (rabbit anti-Asialo GM1, Wako Chemicals, Irvine, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions 3–4 days before adoptive transfer of human T cells.

PDMS base and curing agent were mixed 10:1 and poured onto the silicon master, then left overnight in vacuum. Once the PDMS was set, it was baked at 55°C for 1 hr and cooled at room temperature. The embedded microchambers were then cut from the mold, and a cell well was punched adjacent to entry into the channels. The PDMS cast and a chambered coverglass (Nunc Lab-Tek, ThermoFisher, Grand Island, NY) were activated for 2 min in a plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY), bonded together, then incubated at 55°C for 10 min. Prepared chambers were stored for up to 1 month before use. Prior to imaging, microchambers placed in the plasma cleaner for 5 min under vacuum and 1 min of activation, then coated with 5 µg/mL recombinant human ICAM-1/CD54 Fc (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in PBS for at least 1 hr at 37°C. The microchambers were then washed three times with PBS, and T cells were loaded into cell wells (3−5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells resuspended in 10 µL) and incubated at 37°C for at least 1 hr before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal imaging and analysis</title><p>Two different Olympus confocal microscopy systems were used to image T cells in vitro. For experiments tracking T cell motility in microchambers, we used the self-contained Olympus Fluoview FV10i-LIV, with a 473 nm diode laser for excitation and a 60x phase contrast water immersion objective (NA 1.2). The FV10i-LIV contains a built-in incubator set to 37°C, together with a Tokai-Hit stagetop incubator to maintain local temperature and humidity. T cells were imaged in RMPI adjusted to 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 2% FCS, and mounted at least half an hour before imaging to allow for equilibration. Cells were imaged at 20 s intervals for 20–30 min, and the data analyzed using Imaris software. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of Salsa6f transfected T cells, we used a Fluoview FV3000RS confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with high-speed resonance scanner and the IX3-ZDC2 Z-drift compensator. Diode lasers (488 and 561 nm) were used for excitation, and two high sensitivity cooled GaAsP PMTs were used for detection of GCaMP6f and tdTomato. Cells were imaged using the Olympus 40x silicone oil objective (NA 1.25), by taking four slice z-stacks at 1.5 µm/step, at 3 s intervals, for up to 20 min. Temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2</sub> were maintained using a Tokai-Hit WSKM-F1 stagetop incubator. Data were processed and analyzed using Imaris software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Two-photon imaging and analysis</title><p>Multi-dimensional (x, y, z, time, emission wavelength) two-photon microscopy was employed to image fluorescently labeled lymphocytes in explanted mouse lymph nodes, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheu et al., 2015</xref>). The following wavelengths were used to excite single or combinations of fluorophores: 900 nm to excite eGFP and CMTMR; 800 nm to excite cell trace violet (Thermofisher C34557) and cell trace yellow (Thermofisher, C34567); 920 nm to excite tdTomato and GCaMP6f; Fluorescence emission was split by 484 nm and 538 nm dichroic mirrors into three detector channels, used to visualize CellTrace Violet or second harmonic signal generated from collagen in blue; GCaMP6f or eGFP-Orai1E106A transfected cells in green; tdTomato or CellTrace Yellow or CMTMR-labelled cells in red. For imaging, lymph nodes were oriented with the hilum away from the water dipping microscope objective (Olympus 20x, NA 0.9 or Nikon 25x, NA 1.05) on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51). The node was maintained at 36–37°C by perfusion with medium (RPMI) bubbled with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>). For imaging of human T cells 3D image stacks of x = 200 μm, y = 162 μm, and z = 50 μm were sequentially acquired at 18–20 s intervals using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For tracking adoptively transferred mouse T cells, 3D image stacks of x = 250 μm, y = 250 μm, and z = 20 or 52 μm (Voxel size 0.48 μm x 0.48 μm x 4 μm) were sequentially acquired at 5 or 12 s intervals, respectively, using image acquisition software Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheu et al., 2015</xref>). This volume collection was repeated for up to 40 min to create a 4D data set. For fast imaging of Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) lymph nodes, we acquired 2DT images of 300 µm x 300 µm (pixel size 0.65 × 0.65 μm) every 0.5 s. For comparing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in MHC blocking experiments, 3D image stacks of x = 350 μm, y = 350 μm, and z = 20 μm (Voxel size 0.65 μm x 0.65 μm x 4 μm) were sequentially acquired at 5 s intervals. Cell motility data were processed and analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane USA, Concord, MA). A combination of manual and automatic tracking was used to generate highly accurate cell tracks. The x,y,z coordinates of the tracks were used to calculate speed, M.S.D, directionality ratio, motility coefficients, and to plot tracks as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorelik and Gautreau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheu et al., 2015</xref>). Calcium transient (sparkles and cell-wide) analysis and estimation of duration was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). XYT data was processed to mask autofluorescent structures, and time was mapped on the Z axis for the purpose of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient identification. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were identified in Imaris by a surface-based object identification approach, after manual thresholding of intensity, voxel size (&gt;10) and 2 s minimum duration. Objects were modeled as ellipsoids; X and Y diameter measurements of surfaces were used to calculated areas, and Z diameter (time) was used to estimate duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. For MHC-block experiments to estimate the number and intensities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we utilized maximum intensity projections from 6 Z stacks. Integrated intensities were normalized to standard deviations of the green channel for comparison of brightness of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis and statistical testing</title><p>Samples sizes were comparable to previous single cell analyses of motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gérard et al., 2014</xref>). Each experiment used separate isolations of human T cells from different donors. With the exception of instantaneous velocities in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, each measurement corresponds to a different cell. Mean ± standard error of the mean was used as a measure of the central tendency of distributions. Video analysis was performed using Imaris software, Spots analysis was used for tracking of cell velocity and Volumes analysis was used for measuring total fluorescence intensity of GECI probes. To reduce selection bias in our analysis of motility and trajectory, all clearly visible and live cells were tracked from each video segment. The arrest coefficient is defined as fraction of time each cell had an instantaneous velocity &lt;2 µm/min. The coefficient of variation was defined for each individual cell as the standard deviation divided by the mean of its instantaneous velocity. For Salsa6f imaging analysis, ratio (R) was calculated by total GCaMP6f intensity divided by total tdTomato intensity, while initial ratio (R<sub>0</sub>) was calculated by averaging the ratios of the first five time points in each individual cell trace. Photobleaching of tdTomato fluorescence intensity (20–30% decline) was corrected in ratio calculations, as a linear function of time. Figures were generated using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) and Origin 5 (OriginLabs, Northampton, MA). Due to the expectation that individual cells exhibit multiple motility modes, and to avoid assumptions concerning the shapes of motility distributions, non-parametric statistical testing was performed (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, unpaired samples, two-tailed, Spearman's rank correlation). Differences with a p value of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant: *p≤0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.005; ****p&lt;0.001. Similar distributions were compared using the Hodges-Lehmann median difference value and 95% confidence intervals under the assumption that the starting distributions had similar shapes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Angel Zavala and Drs.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cell-intrinsic activation of Orai1 regulates human T cell motility&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michel Nussenzweig (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael L Dustin (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers and editors feel that your paper (Cahalan et al.) potentially complements an independently submitted paper (“Calcium-mediated shaping of naive CD4 T-cell phenotype and function” by Auffray et al.). You were contacted about this opportunity and agreed to exchange information with the authors of that paper after receiving the three individual reviews for each. The following is a consensus review among three of the reviewers who agreed to oversee a co-revision. The intention is to help you prioritise the revision and also to clarify the opportunity for coordination from our perspective.</p><p>The two papers deal with different consequences of calcium mobilization in vivo. Cahalan et al. focuses on transcriptional changes that are brought about in the most self-reactive naïve T cells in mice that lead to loss of Ly6C expression and a tendency to differentiate into peripheral Treg upon activation. This state could be mimicked by treatments that may chronically enhance cytoplasmic calcium, but the evidence for any effects on cytoplasmic calcium ion levels by self pMHC in vivo or low concentrations of thapsigargin in vitro are lacking, which is a major gap. There are also mechanistic aspects related to cytokine production in the Ly6C positive population that could be explored.</p><p>Cahalan et al. also focuses on the role of CRAC channel activation in T cell trafficking and interstitial migration in the T cell zone of lymph nodes. A unique aspect of the paper is that they focus entirely on human T cells in profoundly immunodeficient mice. CRAC is eliminated through expression of a dominant negative Orai, which is well established to eliminate sustained calcium increases. The authors developed a new calcium reporter based on fusing GCaMP6f to tdTomato to make a ratiometric reporter called Salsa6f, which is sufficient sensitive to detect calcium spikes in intact lymph nodes. The main points are that CRAC channel function is needed for efficient lymph node entry and that cell-autonomous calcium fluxes result in slowing of T cell migration. The weakness in this paper is that the actual mechanism of the calcium fluxes is not established and objective statistical tests supporting a relationship are not provided. The trigger for the calcium fluxes observed is not clear.</p><p>The editors felt that there is strong possibility that addressing issues in Cahalan et al. may provide key supporting data for Auffray.et al. And reciprocally, data in Auffray et al. provides further physiological significance for data in Cahalan.et al. The authors may therefore benefit from coordinating on the revisions and the authors have agreed to exchange information. The editors have prepared the following joint consensus review following provision of the individual reviews.</p><p>1) The main concern with Auffray et al. is that there is no data on the impact of pharmacological manipulations on cytoplasmic calcium levels in the naïve mouse T cells. The authors of Cahalan et al. are experts in this area. It will be important for the authors to use in vitro calcium studies to determine the impact of chronic exposure to 4 nM thapsigargin in different time windows – does this result in sustained cytoplasmic calcium elevation capable to inducing NFAT translocation? This may require a highly sensitive method and advice from authors of Cahalan et al. should be helpful to address this concern in a 2-month time frame. But this concern needs to be addressed.</p><p>2) The main concern with Cahalan et al. is that the mechanism triggering the calcium fluxes in vitro and in vivo is not clear. T cell migrating on flat substrates didn't display the calcium fluxes, but movement in PDMS channels and within lymph nodes did. The authors’ attention was called to recent studies that suggest that surface interactions could trigger calcium signals related to formation of close contacts that exclude CD45. Thus, some cellular confinement in the PDMS channels may trigger signals. The in vivo situation is of greatest interest. The use of the human-mouse system is a complication as its not entirely clear self pMHC is supplied by human monocyte derived DC or mouse xeno-MHC, which can trigger T cell responses. In murine systems, particularly on H2-b haplotype, it is relatively easy to eliminate self pMHC signals in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells acutely by blocking I-Ab with an antibody (e.g. Stefanova I, Dorfman JR, Germain RN. Self-recognition promotes the foreign antigen sensitivity of naive T lymphocytes. Nature. 2002;420(6914):429-34) or by transferring CD4 T cells in to I-Ab deficient mice. Thus, while the human mouse system has some utility as a preclinical model, it's a relatively weak tool to study basic mechanisms in this case as even if only human pMHC is recognized, there are multiple possible class I and class II genes that would need to be blocked to eliminate all possible recognition. The author should repeat a key experiment in a mouse model system where a role of self-pMHC in the in vivo calcium fluxes could be supported or ruled out. Introduction of the Salsa6f reporter into naïve T cells would be helpful in this context. If the authors happen to have generated a transgenic model with Salsa6f or have the ability to introduce it by RNA electroporation then this could be combined with antibody blocking to test a role for self-pMHC in the calcium activity independent of the DN Orai construct, which is not necessarily needed to ask this question. The result of this experiment would also provide key information for Auffray.et al.</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) Additional statistical analysis of the migration in lymph nodes should be undertaken to better understand the statistical relationship between calcium fluxes and T cell turning and pausing behavior. Is there a statistical correlation that can be identified?</p><p>2) Can the authors perform in in vivo calibration such that calcium levels in the DN Orai and control T cells could be directly compared? Is there a difference in the average calcium levels, beyond the spiking?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27827.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) The main concern with Auffray et al. is that there is no data on the impact of pharmacological manipulations on cytoplasmic calcium levels in the naïve mouse T cells.

We advised to expand the calcium measurements to include different time‐points and not to use a “delta measurement”, instead to focus on the baseline levels. We also cautioned that upregulation of PMCA activity could explain some of the results. In addition, we consulted on the conditions for pMHC antibody block and are assured that our experiments with the same antibody are compatible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The main concern with Cahalan et al. is that the mechanism triggering the calcium fluxes in vitro and in vivo is not clear.

Indeed, relevant to the main concern and reviewer comment highlighted in bold above, we have made a Cre‐dependent transgenic mouse to allow subset‐specific expression of Salsa6f driven by CD4‐ and other Cre‐dependent driver lines, and we submitted a second manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as the first of two back‐to‐back publications. The proposed companion paper is titled: “T Cell Calcium Dynamics Visualized in a Ratiometric tdTomato‐GCaMP6f Transgenic Reporter Mouse”. It presents the breakthrough capabilities of the transgenic Salsa 6f mouse presents for imaging calcium signaling in a cell‐specific manner in isolated cells and in the complex tissue environment in vivo. Our proposed companion manuscript introduces the new probe, Salsa6f, and demonstrates advantages for Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring in T cells from CD4‐Cre‐Salsa6f transgenic mice, including the following outline of the Results section:</p><p>• A novel ratiometric genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Salsa6f;</p><p>• Generation of Salsa6f transgenic reporter mice and validation in immune cells;</p><p>• Single‐cell ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement in CD4‐Cre‐Salsa6f reporter mice;</p><p>• Cytosolic localization and calibration of Salsa6f in transgenic T lymphocytes;</p><p>• T cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion, T cell receptor engagement, and mechanical stimulation;</p><p>• TCR‐induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in naïve and differentiated helper T cell subsets;</p><p>• Two‐photon microscopy of CD4Cre<sup>+/‐</sup>Salsa6f<sup>+/‐</sup> T cells in lymph node revealing novel spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling during basal motility in the absence of specific antigen.</p><p>Of particular note and related to our revision of this manuscript, we were able to detect spontaneous, transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in T cells migrating in lymph node under steady‐state conditions. Our revised manuscript would then follow our companion paper. We now include a section fully describing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals detected using Salsa6f in transgenic mouse T cells during basal motility under homeostatic conditions in mouse lymph node and in the absence of specific antigen. We call these localized signals sparkles because of their appearance on rapid playback; and show that they are correlated with pausing and turning behavior. They are inhibited by antibody treatment to peptide MHC Class I and II. We suggest that putting the two papers back to back will not only strengthen our manuscript and address reviewer comments, but will attract a great deal of interest in the calcium signaling field, which would include immunologists as well as neuroscientists.</p><p>We would be happy to consider if the new data set include experiments that address the role of selfpMHC recognition, to rule it in or out. This is key to the potential synergy with the Auffray paper and we feel its intrinsic to any demonstration that the calcium signals don't represent &quot;antigen&quot; as the cells are differentially sensing self and foreign pMHC. So if &quot;antigen&quot; includes explicit data on self this should be great. One concept that might be interesting to consider is that a truly antigen (self or foreign) independent Calcium signal could generate white noise that has some impact on motility, but also allows the T cells to detect the sub‐threshold self‐antigen signal and respond to it with calcineurin/NFAT dependent transcription. This might be an example of stochastic resonance and is described in other sensing systems that need to detect weak signals. We agree that testing the role of self and foreign antigen signalling in the new mouse model makes much more sense than any such manipulation in the human‐mouse system described in this paper, which could be revised to address the mechanism of antigen independent Calcium signalling and co‐submitted with the new manuscript describing the new mouse model.</p><p>There are four new figures in the motility manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>‐9), including the peptide‐MHC blocking studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We found that treatment of MHC class‐I and –II blocking antibodies substantially reduces but does not eliminate T cells Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We hope you and the reviewers will find the new results of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional points:</p><p>1) Additional statistical analysis of the migration in lymph nodes should be undertaken to better understand the statistical relationship between calcium fluxes and T cell turning and pausing behavior.
