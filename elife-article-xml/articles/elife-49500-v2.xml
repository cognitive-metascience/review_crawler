responses. IFI16 also regulates cellular transcription and act as a DNA virus restriction factor. IFI16 knockdown disrupted the latency of Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and induced lytic transcripts. However, the mechanism of IFI16’s transcription regulation is unknown. Here, we show that IFI16 is in complex with the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 and GLP and recruits them to the KSHV genome during de novo infection and latency. The resulting depositions of H3K9me2/me3 serve as a docking site for the heterochromatin-inducing HP1α protein leading into the IFI16-dependent epigenetic modifications and silencing of KSHV lytic genes. These studies suggest that IFI16’s interaction with H3K9MTases is one of the potential mechanisms by which IFI16 regulates transcription and establish an important paradigm of an innate immune sensor’s involvement in epigenetic silencing of foreign DNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KSHV epigenetics</kwd><kwd>IFI16 and KSHV gene silencing</kwd><kwd>KSHV latency</kwd><kwd>innate sensing</kwd><kwd>host methyltransferases</kwd><kwd>epigenetic silencing</kwd><kwd>IFI16</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001808</institution-id><institution>Public Health Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 180758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandran</surname><given-names>Bala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008900</institution-id><institution>University of South Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandran</surname><given-names>Bala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The innate immune DNA sensor IFI16 is in association with H3K9 methyltransferases SUV39H1 and GLP under physiological conditions in the nucleus which facilitates the epigenetic silencing of foreign viral DNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Entry of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell triggers numerous innate immune responses such as the induction of the inflammasome, type 1 interferon and DNA damage responses, as well as the recruitment of the ND10 or PML body components. In addition to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a defense, the cell also maintains its homeostasis by limiting the expression of the invading foreign genes. Transcription factors like Daxx, Sp1 and PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merkl et al., 2018</xref>), and heterochromatin inducing factors like HDAC1 and CBX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poleshko et al., 2008</xref>) have been shown to be instrumental in silencing foreign viral DNA. Interestingly, a Pyrin-Hin200 family nuclear innate immune DNA sensor, IFI16 (Interferon-γ-inducible protein 16) has emerged as a preeminent viral transcription restriction factor against a number of DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gariano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orzalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merkl and Knipe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo Cigno et al., 2015</xref>). Although the innate immune DNA sensor role of IFI16 where it senses foreign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orzalli et al., 2013</xref>) or damaged self DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ouchi and Ouchi, 2008</xref>) and induces the ASC-dependent inflammasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ansari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>) and the IFN-β pathway through the STING-TBK1-IRF3 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Unterholzner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>) is well understood, its transcription restriction role is not fully understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gariano et al. (2012)</xref> observed that IFI16 restricted human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transcription and replication by displacing the Sp1 transcription factor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orzalli et al. (2013)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merkl and Knipe (2019)</xref> showed that IFI16 promotes silencing of human herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) gene expression and replication by adding the repressive chromatin mark, H3K9me3. Our studies showed that IFI16 restricts HSV-1 replication by modulating the binding of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 histone marks and the RNA Pol II, TATA-binding protein (TBP) and Oct1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). Similar observations were made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo Cigno et al. (2015)</xref> for human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18).</p><p>Recently, we observed that IFI16 is essential for the repression of Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic gene transcription during latency and thus facilitates latency maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). IFI16 knockdown (KD) in the latently KSHV-infected primary effusion B-lymphoma (PEL) BCBL-1 and BC-3 cell lines resulted in a global increase of KSHV lytic transcripts, proteins, and viral genome replication but not latent genes. We also demonstrated these results during KSHV lytic cycle induction in TREX-BCBL-1 cells with the doxycycline-inducible lytic cycle switch replication and transcription activator (RTA) gene. Overexpression of IFI16 reduced lytic gene induction by a chemical agent TPA. Intracellular viral genome copy number and virion particle associated KSHV DNA copy numbers were also elevated as a result of this KD. IFI16 chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) showed that IFI16 binds to the promoters of all temporal KSHV gene classes. In addition, IFI16 repressed the transcription of KSHV luciferase promoter constructs in the uninfected epithelial SLK and osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Furthermore, during lytic reactivation of KSHV, we observed that IFI16 was polyubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasomal pathway, and thus relieving the lytic promoters of the repressive action of IFI16 to create a conducive environment for lytic gene expression. Blocking of KSHV DNA replication and late lytic gene expression resulted in the absence of IFI16 degradation. Our studies suggested that KSHV utilizes the innate immune nuclear DNA sensor IFI16 to maintain its latency by repressing the lytic gene transcription.</p><p>The transcription regulatory role of IFI16 has been also reported in other unrelated systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnstone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caposio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnstone et al. (1998)</xref> fused IFI16 to GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and observed that it acts as a potent transcription repressor when positioned in proximity to a GAL4DBD binding sequence containing promoter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caposio et al. (2007)</xref> reported that overexpressing IFI16 resulted in an increased expression of genes involved in immunomodulation, cell growth, and apoptosis. IFI16 has been shown to interact with cellular transcription factors such as SP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luu and Flores, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo Cigno et al., 2015</xref>) and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnstone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwak et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al.

(2014)</xref> described a regulatory role for IFI16 in the transcriptional regulation of IFN-α gene expression. Recently, a closely related murine PYHIN family member p205 has been shown to control ASC gene expression by regulating RNA polymerase II binding to its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used KSHV latency establishment and maintenance as a model system to study the transcription and possible epigenetic modulatory roles of IFI16. KSHV, an oncogenic human herpesvirus, is etiologically associated with endothelial Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion B-cell lymphoma (PEL) and B-lymphoproliferative multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cesarman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soulier et al., 1995</xref>). Like all other herpesviruses, KSHV establishes a lifelong latency in humans with periodic lytic reactivation and reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boshoff and Chang, 2001</xref>). Based on the temporal regulation of expression, the lytic genes are classified as immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) genes. After primary infection of permissive cells, the chromatin-free input KSHV genome enters the nucleus and undergoes rapid chromatinization which is mediated by cellular epigenetic factors and viral chromatin regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toth et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Günther et al., 2014</xref>). This chromatinized viral genome is maintained as an extrachromosomal episome. During latency, lytic genes are under tight transcriptional repression by epigenetic factors and transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan et al., 2004</xref>). Upon conducive conditions such as hypoxia, infection by other pathogens, inflammatory cytokines, or immune suppression, KSHV transitions from latency to lytic reactivation leading to progeny virion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toth et al., 2013b</xref>). KSHV lytic reactivation can be induced by treating latently infected cells in culture with small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic modulators such as histone methyltransferases (HMTases), histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hopcraft et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of KSHV genome maintenance during latency are under intense investigations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al. (2010)</xref> reported that activating histone marks AcH3 and H3K4me3 colocalized on the KSHV genome and predominantly occupied the latency and the early-lytic regions during latency. On the other hand, the repressive H3K27me3 mark was widely distributed throughout the KSHV genome, while H3K9me3 was restricted mainly to two regions spanning 30–60 kb and 95–115 kb encoding several late lytic genes (ORF16–40 and ORF58–68). In agreement with Toth et al.’s results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff (2010)</xref> also found H3K9me3 to be mainly restricted to two consecutive KSHV genomic regions, ~33–46 kb and 100–114 kb in latently infected cells. Both these authors found that many lytic loci which are transcriptionally inactive during latency are occupied by both activating as well as repressive histone marks, instigating the hypothesis that these promoters are ‘bivalent’ and are suspended in a transcriptionally poised state capable of reactivating rapidly when needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toth et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ter Horst and Luiten, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff, 2010</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al. (2017)</xref> performed ChIP-Seq experiments on classic KS tissues and found that the activating acetylated H3 (H3Ac) marks were restricted to the latency locus, while the repressive H3K27me3 was widespread on KSHV genome.</p><p>Although the transcription repression and the possible epigenetic histone mark modification roles of IFI16 are known, no definitive mechanism has been identified till date linking IFI16 to epigenetic chromatin remodeling. Here, we used KSHV latency as a model and asked the question - ‘how does IFI16 modulate epigenetic histone marks leading to its transcription regulatory activity?'. Our studies show that KD of IFI16 most significantly reduces H3K9me3 and increases H3K4me3 on the KSHV gene promoters, and that IFI16 interacts with H3K9 histone methyltransferase (H3K9-MTase) Suppressor of variegation 3–9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) and G9a-like protein (GLP) both in uninfected and infected cells. IFI16 KD and knockout (KO) drastically reduces the recruitment of these two H3K9-MTase onto the KSHV genome which was confirmed by the IFI16 rescue experiments in KO cells. Our studies suggest that IFI16 dependent recruitment of GLP mono and di-methylates (me1/me2) at H3K9 on the KSHV genome, while SUV39H1 further establishes tri-methylated H3K9me3 marks. This consequently regulates the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1-α (HP1α) protein which functions downstream of H3K9me3 resulting in DNA compaction and heterochromatization of the KSHV genome and silencing of the KSHV genes, especially the late lytic genes. Our findings unravel a previously unknown function of IFI16 namely the interactions with SUV39H1 and GLP H3K9-MTases that facilitate the epigenetic silencing of foreign viral DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockdown of IFI16 causes prominent changes in the deposition of H3 lysine methylation marks and RNA Pol II on KSHV promoters</title><p>IFI16 suppresses the transcription from KSHV lytic promoters and KD of IFI16 results in lytic reactivation of latently infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the potential mechanism(s) of IFI16-mediated suppression of KSHV lytic transcription, we determined the role of IFI16 in recruiting the five known H3 lysine trimethylation marks (H3Kme3) - H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3, on the KSHV genome. Among these, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me3 are known to be associated with transcriptionally permissive euchromatin, whereas H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are known to be associated with transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin. For this, we depleted IFI16 in latently infected BCBL-1 cells using lentivirus-mediated shRNA (shIFI16) transduction and evaluated the recruitment of the different H3Kme3s and total H3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) after 72 hr of transduction. Compared to control shRNA (shC), we observed ~70% KD of IFI16 as evaluated by qRT-PCR and WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, respectively). Since IFI16 KD results in the induction of KSHV lytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>), when we evaluated the levels of lytic ORF50 mRNA by qRT-PCR, we observed a six-fold increase after IFI16 KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49500.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of IFI16 knockdown (KD) on H3K9me3 and RNA Pol II deposition on KSHV lytic gene promoters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IFI16 was KD in BCBL-1 cells using shRNA lentivirus for 72 hr and KD efficiency was assessed by q-RT PCR and successful induction of lytic KSHV ORF50 gene as a result of IFI16 KD was assessed by q-RT PCR of ORF50.

For real-time PCR analysis of the ChIP DNA, we used four KSHV promoter primers representing the four temporal KSHV gene classes, namely, pORF73 (La), pK8 (IE), pvIRF2 (E), and pORF63 (L). To better represent the resulting fold changes, ChIP efficiencies were normalized to input chromatin and represented as relative to shC. Among all the H3Kme3s tested, we observed that IFI16 KD results in a consistent increase in H3K4me3 recruitment and decrease in H3K9me3 recruitment (black arrows) on all the KSHV promoters tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Total H3 remained relatively unaltered after IFI16 KD, and in contrast, RNA Pol II recruitment was enriched on pK8, pvIRF2 and pORF63 but not pORF73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This observation is in agreement with our previous observations where we demonstrated that IFI16 KD in BCBL1 cells had little effect on latent gene transcription, while lytic genes of all gene classes were induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested the effect of IFI16 KD during de novo KSHV infection of TIME cells, which are human neonatal foreskin microvascular endothelial cells immortalized with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). These cells exhibit a normal karyotype, extended lifespan in culture, and endothelial characteristics at late passages which make them an ideal model for KSHV de novo infection. These cells were electroporated with a pool of siIFI16 or siC and 72 hr later, infected with KSHV at 100 DNA copies/cell for 6 or 48 hr. qRT-PCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and WBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) assessed IFI16 KD efficiencies. Using the same ChIP promoter primers, we found that 48 hr post-infection (p.i.) with KSHV in IFI16 depleted cells, recruitment of H3K9me3 on lytic pK8, pvIRF2 and pORF63 decreased at least by 0.5-fold (black arrows) while H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 did not change significantly. Similar to our observations in BCBL-1 cells, recruitment of RNA Pol II increased significantly on these promoters, but not on latent pORF73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To further assess if IFI16 KD can influence the outcome of KSHV de novo infection, we measured the copy numbers of latent ORF73 and lytic ORF50 mRNAs after IFI16 KD in TIME cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). In the control siC-treated cells, ORF73 mRNA increased between 6 hr and 48 h p.i. and ORF50 mRNA decreased by about 2.5-fold after its initial round of transcription during the early phases of de novo infection.

(2004)</xref> where they showed the transient transcription of a subset of KSHV lytic genes in addition to the latent genes, with roles in latency establishment immediately after de novo infection of HMVEC-d cell. In the IFI16 KD cells, although no major changes were observed at 6 h p.i., ORF73 mRNA decreased significantly at 48 h p.i. compared to siC while ORF50 mRNA increased by about 2-fold. This suggested that when IFI16 is depleted, KSHV fails to establish latency and lytic phase commences. This corroborates with our previous observations in PEL cells where we demonstrated that IFI16 is important for the maintenance of KSHV latency and in its absence, KSHV reactivates to lytic life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To determine the importance of H3 lysine methylations in KSHV latent and lytic cycles, we determined the dynamics of different H3Kme3s on the KSHV genome during reactivation from latency to lytic cycle. TRExBCBL1-Rta cells carry latent KSHV genomes and an epitope-tagged KSHV lytic cycle switch replication and transcription activator (RTA) protein cassette under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. We chose these PEL cells as KSHV lytic cycle can be reactivated by doxycycline (DOX) induced RTA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2003</xref>) instead of phorbol esters and sodium butyrate, both of which are known to effect transcription globally and are not KSHV specific. We induced the TRExBCBL1-Rta cells with doxycycline and evaluated the recruitment of total H3 and different H3Kme3s on the late lytic ORF63 promoter by ChIP at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post-induction. The results were represented as % of input to confirm the ChIP efficiencies of the respective antibodies, and we also included IgG ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). We have previously reported that IFI16 is polyubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasomal pathway as soon 48 hr post-induction of TREXBCBL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that recruitment of total H3 did not change between 1- and 3 days post-induction but decreased at 4 days post-induction. This possibly represents the newly synthesized viral genomes that are not chromatinized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh and Fraser, 2008</xref>). Recruitment of H3K4me3 on the late ORF63 promoter increased steadily until day 4, suggesting the gradually increasing transcriptional activity from this promoter. H3K9me3 recruitment decreased sharply on day 1 and remained at similar levels until day 4. This emphasizes the repressive role of H3K9me3 during lytic reactivation. H3K27me3 recruitment also decreased but more gradually between day 1 and day 4. RNA Pol II was predominantly recruited between days 3 and 4 which was expected as ORF63 is a late gene.</p><p>Together, these observations suggested the following: a) IFI16 is important for the recruitment and maintenance of the repressive H3K9me3 mark and for the exclusion of the permissive H3K4me3 mark on the KSHV genome both, after de novo infection and during prolonged latency; b) IFI16 influences the recruitment of RNA Pol II on KSHV lytic promoters; c) depletion of IFI16 during de novo infection of endothelial cells results in lytic gene expression and failure to establish latency, and d) re-distribution of H3K9me3 along with H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 plays an important role during reactivation from latency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K9 methylations play an important role in KSHV life cycle and IFI16 interacts with cellular H3K9 methyltransferases (H3K9MTase)</title><p>Based on the previous studies of IFI16-mediated transcriptional repression and possible role of IFI16 in the modulation of H3K9me3 on herpesvirus genomes, we next determined the connection of this histone mark with IFI16.

MTT toxicity assays revealed that 100 µM concentration of A366 is non-toxic on BCBL-1 cells for up to 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). BCBL-1 cells were treated for 72 hr with 10 µM or 100 µM concentrations of A366 or mock treated with DMSO vehicle control and we measured the expression of all four KSHV temporal gene by real-time qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed that although there were no significant changes at 10 µM, treatment with 100 µM A366 induced robust initiation of lytic IE, E, and L gene transcripts. As a control, we also evaluated cellular IFI16 and GAPDH transcripts and found no significant changes after A366 treatment. When we tested the levels of different H3 lysine methylations after 72 hr 100 µM A366 treatment, we observed that A366 specifically inhibited H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 methylations, and the levels of IFI16 did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hopcraft et al. (2018)</xref> screened a number of H3 MTases in an attempt to identify host chromatin-modifying proteins that are essential for maintaining KSHV latency and found that 1 μM and 10 μM concentrations of A366 were ineffective in inducing KSHV lytic cycle.

Except for RIZ1, we could detect six of the seven H3K9 MTases tested – SUV39H1, SUV39H2, GLP, G9A, SETDB1, and SETDB2. In the same experiment, we also tested the recruitment of H3K9me1, me2, and me3 and observed that all three H3 marks are associated with the KSHV genome within 24 hr of de novo infection.

Moreover, an IgG + IgG control PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) also confirm the specificity of the observed PLA signals.</p><p>To further confirm these results, we used IFI16 CRISPR knockout (KO) osteosarcoma U2OS cells (U2OS 67) generated in our earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>) to study the effect of IFI16 KO and re-introduction of IFI16 in a KO background on the recruitment of H3K9me3, SUV39H1 and GLP. U2OS wt and U2OS 67 cells were infected with KSHV for 24 hr, and ChIPs were performed with anti-H3, H3K9me3, SUV39H1 and GLP antibodies. KSHV late ORF63 promoter occupancy was assessed by real-time PCR. Consistent with previous results, we observed reduced recruitment of H3K9me3, SUV39H1 and GLP on the ORF63 promoter in IFI16 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Total H3 did not decrease under similar conditions. The WB confirms KO of IFI16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Next, we reintroduced IFI16 (pCDNA3.1+ IFI16) or control GFP (pCDNA3.1+ GFP) in the U2OS 67 KO cells and performed WBs which confirmed the expression of IFI16 and GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). When we performed the same experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, we observed that rescue with IFI16 resulted in about threefold increase in H3K9me3 recruitment and about 1.5-fold increase in SUV39H1 and GLP recruitment on the KSHV late ORF63 promoter in U2OS 67 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, these results suggested that IFI16 is instrumental in recruiting H3K9MTase SUV39H1 and GLP onto KSHV lytic promoters during de novo infection, resulting in deposition of the heterochromatin H3K9me3 mark.</p><p>PLA in IFI16 KO cells confirms that IFI16 recruits SUV39H1 and GLP onto the KSHV genome resulting in the deposition of H3K9me3 but not H3K27me3</p><p>To confirm the IFI16-mediated recruitment of heterochromatic factors at a single-cell level, we infected U2OS wt and IFI16 KO U2OS67 cells with BrdU-labeled KSHV and preformed PLA for BrdU and the indicated proteins.

In addition to PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, red), we also immunostained for IFI16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, green).

We observed that the abundance of SUV39H1 on the KSHV genome decreased to about 25% of that of uninduced on day 2 post-induction and remained at that level until day 4. In contrast, a more drastic decrease was observed with GLP which was reduced to less than 10% of the uninduced level by day 1 post-induction. Abundance of IFI16 decreased more gradually and reduced to less than 20% by day 4, which is also probably due to the degradation of IFI16 during lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). Next, we investigated the role of these two H3K9MTases in KSHV life cycle, and included G9A as well in this assay as it is known to exist in a complex with GLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>).

Although these studies suggested that IFI16 may have the ability to promote epigenetic modification of foreign/viral DNA leading to transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orzalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merkl and Knipe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo Cigno et al., 2015</xref>), till date, no precise epigenetic function of IFI16 has been identified that can explain its ability to inhibit transcription. Our comprehensive studies here demonstrate that under physiological conditions, IFI16 is associated with the H3K9 methyltransferases SUV39H1 and GLP which mediates the deposition of H3K9me2/me3, and thus unravels one of the potential mechanisms by which IFI16 mediates epigenetic modifications and transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Lysines 4, 9, 27, 36 and 79 of histone H3, and 20 of histone H4 can be methylated, but, no attempt has been made to comprehensively study the possible role of IFI16 in recruiting these H3 lysine tri-methylations. Hence, we undertook a systamatic approach toward identifying the H3 lysine tri-methylations that can be modulated by IFI16 on the KSHV epigenome and tested all five identified lysine tri-methylations of H3. Our studies demonstrate that depletion of IFI16 results in increased recruitment of H3K4me3 and decreased recruitment of H3K9me3 on the KSHV promoters in both latent BCBL1 cells and in de novo infected TIME cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). Both these epigenetic modifications are conducive of increased transcriptional activity which is in agreement with our previous observation that KD of IFI16 results in increased transcription of lytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). As a further confirmation of this, we found that KD of IFI16 resulted in increased recruitment of RNA Pol II on all the lytic promoters tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). It is interesting to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff (2010)</xref> found that abundant levels of H3K9me3 recruitment was restricted mainly to two regions of KSHV genome (30–60 kb and 95–115 kb) encoding a number of late genes (ORF16–40 and ORF58–68) in TRExBCBL1-Rta cells. However, lesser basal levels were detectable throughout the KSHV genome. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff (2010)</xref> did not observe significant deposition of H3K9me3 on the KSHV genome during de novo infection of SLK cells. However, it must be considered that SLK cells are of epithelial origin and have been shown to be a contaminant from the renal-cell carcinoma cell line Caki-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stürzl et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we used the hTERT immortalized human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line, TIME, which we believe is a more suitable cell model for KSHV de novo infection.</p><p>After observing that IFI16 regulates the recruitment of H3K9me3, we first asked the question ‘Is the H3K9me3 mark important for the KSHV life cycle?”. Our studies demonstrate that after lytic induction of TRExBCBL1-Rta cells, levels of H3K9me3 reduced by half on the late ORF63 promoter as early as day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The location of the ORF63 promoter on the KSHV genome is between 102 and 103 kb which is within the high abundance H3K9me3 distribution region described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff, 2010</xref>). In contrast, abundance of H3K27me3 on the ORF63 promoter decreased more gradually between days 2 and 4 post-induction. This strongly suggested that H3K9me3 does play a role in the KSHV lifecycle. Further evidence of the role of H3K9me3 in KSHV lifecycle became evident when we treated BCBL1 cells with A366, a specific inhibitor of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaniskan et al., 2018</xref>). This caused significantly higher transcription of KSHV lytic genes, while expression of the latent genes and the control GAPDH and IFI16 genes did not alter significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This is a hallmark of successful lytic reactivation of the latent KSHV genome. Thus, H3K9me2/3 recruitment and maintenance are indispensable for the maintenance of latency. This experiment also suggests that the H3K9me2/3 mark and possibly all the other epigenetic marks on the KSHV genome is dynamic in nature and must be continuously recruited to maintain latency. This may be solely or partly due to the fact that as the BCBL1 cell divides, the newly replicated latent epigenetically naive KSHV genomes must recruit the proper epigenetic marks to be effectively silenced in order to maintain latency.</p><p>It is generally considered that H3K9me3 is a hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin while H3K27me3 is typically seen in facultative heterochromatin. Constitutive heterochromatin are often considered to be irreversible such that they will never revert to euchromatin, as those seen at the telomeres and centromeres in mammalian cells. Alternatively, facultative heterochromatin is considered to be reversible and capable of undergoing active gene expression. However, resent advances disprove this notion and H3K9me3’s role in cell-type-specific regulation of facultative heterochromatin has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, numerous reports have demonstrated that herpes viral and retroviral genomes are associated with H3K9me3 during latency and almost all these genes undergo active transcription during lytic reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Günther and Grundhoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orzalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lo Cigno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merkl and Knipe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our observations confirm that IFI16 recruits the H3K9MTases SUV39H1 and GLP on to the KSHV genome resulting in the enrichment of H3K9me2/me3 marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). GLP and its partner G9A are known to be responsible for mono and di-methylation (me1/me2) of H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, SUV39H1 has been established to use mono and di-methylated H3K9 as a primary substrate and establish tri-methyl H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we believe, that the establishment of H3K9me3 heterochromatic locus on the KSHV genome requires the concerted action of GLP and SUV39H1. The fact that IFI16 interacts with and recruits both these H3K9MTases explains the functional importance of this mechanism and that IFI16 has evolved to specifically interact/recruit these MTases to establish heterochromatin. Although KD of SUV39H1 and GLP resulted in the induction of KSHV lytic transcripts in BCBL-1 cells, KD of GLP only caused a marginal twofold increase in KSHV genome DNA replication, while KD of SUV39H1 alone had no effect. This may signify that IFI16-mediated recruitment of H3K9me3 is one among the multiple barriers that herpesviruses have to overcome before the successful induction of lytic replication. Other important barriers including H3K27me3 exists and a concerted action of all these viral restriction factors help to establish and maintain latency.</p><p>The above suggestion is also supported by the observation that H3K4me3 modification on ORF73 promoter after IFI16 KD is significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.F, p-value **). We have previously reported ORF73 mRNA expression under similar conditions after IFI16 KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>), where we observed that KD of IFI16 lead to a marginal increase (2-fold) in ORF73 expression in contrast to lytic genes which increased by several folds. This observation can be explained by the fact that the ORF73 promoter is under the concerted regulation of numerous transcription and epigenetic factors including Oct1, GATA-1 Ap1, and RBP-Jκ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the ORF73 promoter consists of two mRNA start sites – the LANA constitutive (LTc) and the RTA-inducible (LTi) mRNA start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Veeranna et al., 2012</xref>). This makes the ORF73 promoter particularly complex and it is possible that additional factors are involved in keeping the expression of LANA in check after IFI16 KD despite the fact that H3K4me3 is significantly enriched on the ORF73 promoter.</p><p>Chromatin marked by H3K9me3 are recognized by the chromo domain protein, HP1α which facilitate heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>). HP1 proteins serves as a scaffold to recruit other chromatin modifying proteins, including more H3K9 MTases and histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore reasoned that if IFI16 recruits SUV39H1 and GLP to establish H3k9me3 marks on the KSHV genome, the subsequent recruitment of HP1α should also be dependent on IFI16. Our data showed that depletion of IFI16 resulted in reduced recruitment of HP1α on the KSHV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–G</xref>) and KD of HP1α caused robust induction of KSHV lytic gene transcription. Together, these confirmed that HP1α is important for maintenance of latency and IFI16 is indispensable for its recruitment. Studies of HP1 dynamics have revealed that HP1α is not a stable component of heterochromatin but is highly mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krouwels et al., 2005</xref>). This dynamicity of HP1α together with the need to epigenetically silence nascent KSHV genomes synthesized as a result of multiplication of latently infected cells helps explain the indispensable nature of IFI16 in HP1α recruitment.</p><p>One common factor binding all the identified functions of IFI16 is its DNA binding ability. However, crystal structure of IFI16 HIN domains in complex with B-form dsDNA revealed that it binds dsDNA in a non-sequence specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, how IFI16 distinguishes between self and non-self DNA and if there is any specific signal that dictates both innate sensing and epigenetic silencing by IFI16 remains unanswered. Further studies are required to determine the possible existence of nuclear macromolecular complex(es) detecting and epigenetically silencing foreign invading DNA. Multiple observations point such a possibility. We have observed that silencing of IFI16 also effects the recruitment of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that a H3K4-specific demethylase is also recruited by IFI16. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al. (2010)</xref> reported that Suv39H1, G9a, GLP, and SETDB1 participate in a multimeric complex. Suv39H1 has been found to interact with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lehnertz et al., 2003</xref>) and HP1α has been reported to recruit DNMT3B. Previous reports have also shown that IFI16 is instrumental in recruiting transcription factors like Sp1 and Oct1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gariano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the possibility of all these chromatin silencing factors acting in a concerted fashion is plausible.</p><p>Our earlier studies have demonstrated that IFI16 is in association with different proteins in the nucleus and mediates the innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>). We identified two IFI16 complexes, namely IFI16-BRCA1 and IFI16-BRCA1-H2B. These complexes recognized the KSHV and HSV-1 genomes soon after their entry into the nucleus, leading into BRCA1-mediated p300 recruitment and acetylation of IFI16 and H2B by p300. IFI16 acetylation resulted in the formation of BRCA1-IFI16-ASC-procaspase-1 inflammasome formation in the nucleus, transport to the cytoplasm, pro-IL-1β cleavage and IL-1β formation. Cytoplasmic transport of acetylated IFI16-H2B-BRCA1 results in the association with cGAS and STING leading into phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3, nuclear translocation of p-IRF3 and IFN-β production. Our present study identified a novel epigenetic function of IFI16 and demonstrates that IFI16 is in association with H3K9MTases SUV39H1 and GLP in the nucleus and IFI16 recruits these MTases to the KSHV genome which sequentially methylates H3K9 to me1/me2 and me3. This serves as a docking site for HP1α which recruits further chromatin compaction factors leading to heterochromatin formation and lytic gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>). Thus, our studies uncovered an important paradigm and demonstrated that IFI16-mediated innate immune sensing of foreign viral DNA not only leads to the induction of innate interferon and inflammasome pathways, but also results in the epigenetic silencing of the foreign DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>KSHV-positive PEL cell lines BCBL-1 and BC-3 and KSHV-negative BJAB cells were obtained from the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum: Atlanta Biologicals) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies).

Briefly, 107 TIME cells were infected with unlabeled or EdU-labeled KSHV (100 DNA copies/cell) for 2 hr, washed and cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT. For IFI16 KD condition, cells were microporated with either siC or siIFI16 72 hr before infection. Unreacted formaldehyde was quenched using 0.125 M glycine for 10 min at RT. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 mins on ice and washed with PBS. Following this, Click chemistry was used to covalently couple biotin azide to the EdU genome. For this, the following reagents were added sequentially: 10 mM (+)-Sodium-L-ascorbate, 0.1 mM biotin-TEG azide and 2 mM copper (II) sulfate. Reactions were incubated in the dark for 30 mins at RT following which, reaction was quenched with 10 volumes of 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS for 10 mins. Cells were washed three times with PBS and nuclei isolated by incubating in 500 μl CL lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) NP-40, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol) with protease inhibitors for 10 min at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were then pelleted, washed with 500 μl wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT) for 10 min at 4°C, and lysed by resuspension in 500 μl RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Na-Deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) with protease inhibitor cocktail. These were processed for shearing of the chromatin via sonication on ice at an amplitude setting of 40 with pulses of 15 s on and 10 s off for a total of 10 mins on a Qsonica Q700 sonicator. The extract was then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and protein content quantitated by the BCA method. 1 mg of the protein extract was pulled-down for 3 hr at 4°C with 50 μl of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 (Thermo scientific #65601) which were previously washed with wash buffer, equilibrated with RIPA buffer and blocked overnight at 4°C with 0.5 mg/ml BSA and 0.4 mg/ml pre-sheared salmon sperm DNA to minimize non-specific binding. Beads with bound complexes were then washed three times with wash buffer and subjected to reverse protein-DNA cross-linking and elution of proteins by incubation with 2X Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min at 95°C before SDS-PAGE and WB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measurement of KSHV gene expression by real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen #74106) following manufacturer’s instructions. On-column DNase digestion was performed by using an RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen #79254). Concentration of the extracted RNA was estimated using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and 1 μg RNA was reverse transcribed by using the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems #4368814) with random primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in PEL cells, the synthesized cDNA was used as a template with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems #4367659) on an ABI Prism 7500 detection system (Applied Biosystems). All RNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels and calculated as the delta-delta threshold cycle (ΔΔCT). All primers used have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). In KSHV infected TIME cells, ORF 73 and ORF 50 mRNA were quantified by real time RT-PCR using gene-specific TaqMan primers, probes and standards that has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan et al., 2004</xref>).

After chromatin shearing, Triton X-100 and NaCl in the sheared lysate were adjusted to final concentrations of 1% and 150 mM, respectively. Shearing efficiencies were evaluated by using a 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies #5067–4626) following manufacturer's instructions. The fragment size was ensured to be between 200 bps and 500 bps. For immunoprecipitation, 10 μg sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg desired antibody or ChIP-grade control IgG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) overnight at 4°C. The chromatin-antibody complex was pulled down with ChIP-grade protein G magnetic beads (Active Motif #104502) for 2 hr at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated complex was then washed three times with low-salt and once with high-salt wash buffers (Cell Signaling Technology #14231S). To elute the chromatin, the beads were incubated in ChIP elution buffer (Cell Signaling Technology #14231S) at 65°C for 30 min on a ThermoMixer (1,200 rpm). Following this step, the eluted chromatin was incubated with NaCl and proteinase K for 2 hr at 65°C to remove all proteins and reverse the cross-linking. DNA was purified by using the ChIP DNA Clean and ConcentratorTM kit (Zymo Research #D5205). The ChIP-enriched DNAs were quantitated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems #4367659) and primers described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). ChIP enrichment was calculated as relative to input chromatin (% input) and expressed as fold enrichment over control (shC or siC) ChIP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ravi Mahalingam (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers found the manuscript to be important, thorough, and well-written. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study aims to define the mechanism by which the intrinsic DNA sensor, IFI16, suppresses transcription of the lytic genes encoded by KSHV. Previous work by this group and others has defined IFI16 as a restriction factor for herpesvirus lytic replication including as an inducer of the inflammasome and also as a repressor of lytic gene expression. Other groups have defined the epigenetic landscape of KSHV infected cells in latency and upon reactivation implicating H3K9me3 at two large regions of late lytic genes in the genome. The question being addressed by this study is precisely which histone marks are regulated by IFI16 through which methyltransferases and how this impacts repression of lytic gene expression. The authors take a comprehensive approach to this problem with many specific histone marks, methyltransferases, and cellular models under study.</p><p>Title: The title does not have the word &quot;virus&quot; in it anywhere, and therefore this looks like a chromatin paper. Would you consider changing it to: &quot;IFI16 mediates epigenetic silencing of herpesvirus genomes by its association with H3K9 methyltransferases SUV39H1 and GLP&quot;?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What are the effects of IFI16, SUV39H1/GLP, or HP1a loss on KSHV viral DNA replication and particle formation? Is the IFI16/H3K9me3 barrier an initial barrier to RTA expression, but another H3K27me3 barrier exists (e.g. Toth data) for full lytic reactivation including DNA replication, late gene expression, and particle production?</p><p>2) What is the impact of IFI16, SUV39H1/GLP, and HP1a loss on RTA-induced lytic reactivation? Related to the question above, does RTA over-expression mitigate IFI16 mediated suppression?</p><p>3) Subsection “Knockdown of IFI16 causes prominent changes in the deposition of H3 lysine methylation marks and RNA Pol II on KSHV promoters”, second paragraph. Why do the authors artificially define the significance as above 2-fold or below 0.5-fold, and not depend on the statistical analysis in their experiments? It seems that H3K4me3 modification on ORF73 promoter after IFI16 knock-down is quite significant (Figure 1C). In addition, H3K4me3 is recognized as a histone marker to identify active gene promoter and promote gene expression. Did they determine the level of ORF73 expression side by side in a similar experiment? The p-values should support the findings and the 2-fold lines should be removed.</p><p>4) The statistics in ChIP experiments in Figure 1C are confusing. For example, the large change in pORF73 H3K4me3 upon IFI16 loss with minimal error has &quot;ns&quot; for non-significant above it. Likewise, the H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 bars with high variation have &quot;*&quot; for p&lt;0.05. And the pvIRF2 H3K27me3 with no change has &quot;**&quot; for p&lt;0.01. While it is conceivable that these statistical tests do not correlate with the error and effect sizes, it seems that there may be some miscalculations or misplacements of these error notations.</p><p>5) There are no quantitative assessments of the pulldown efficiencies of the IFI16 interactions to assess their significance.</p><p>6) There is no quantitation of the PLA assays. This is a significant issue because conclusions can only be drawn by assessing the PLA in one or two cells. These data would be strengthened with the inclusion of data from at least 50 cells and appropriate statistical analysis.</p><p>7) There is no quantitation of the H3-MTase/EdU co-localization data in Figure 2F. Since the EdU signal is so extensive, it is hard to evaluate the relative co-localization of these enzymes with genomes. It might be useful to do this experiment with a lower MOI of EdU labeled virus and also to perform quantitation on the co-localization of these signals to better understand the specificity of these interactions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49500.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: The title does not have the word &quot;virus&quot; in it anywhere, and therefore this looks like a chromatin paper.

There, we had observed that IFI16 KD resulted in 5-fold increase in the intracellular viral genome copy numbers, and the DNase resistant packaged virion genome copy numbers increased by 2.6-fold.</p><p>We have now included this information in the second paragraph of the Introduction section.</p><p>For this revised manuscript, we have now performed new experiments to address the reviewer’s question about the effects of SUV39H1, GLP, G9A (new Fig. 8H) and HP1α (new Fig. 9I) loss on KSHV viral DNA replication. &quot;</p><p>These new observations are discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “H3K9 MTase SUV39H1 and GLP are essential for KSHV gene regulation but not G9A” and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Recruitment of Heterochromatin Protein 1α (HP1α) on the KSHV genome is 513 dependent on IFI16 mediated H3K9-trimethylation”, respectively.</p><p>In this new experiment, we have KD SUV39H1, GLP, G9A and HP1α in BCBL-1 cells and quantitated the KSHV genomic DNA copy number representing KSHV replication after 2 and 4 days of KD. We observed that KD of GLP resulted in a 2-fold increase in the intracellular viral genome copy numbers after 4 days of shRNA treatment, while KD of SUV39H1 and G9A MTases were not sufficient to induce lytic cycle replication. KD of HP1α also, failed to induce lytic reactivation.</p><p>In light of this new data, we agree with the reviewers that IFI16 mediated recruitment of H3K9me3 is one among the multiple barriers that herpesviruses have to overcome before the successful induction of lytic replication. Other important barriers including H3K27me3 exists and a concerted action of all these viral restriction factors help to establish and maintain latency.</p><p>We have included this information in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the impact of IFI16, SUV39H1/GLP, and HP1a loss on RTA-induced lytic reactivation? Related to the question above, does RTA over-expression mitigate IFI16 mediated suppression?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this question by performing new experiments in the TREX-BCBL-1 RTA cells.</p><p>TRExBCBL1-Rta cells carry latent KSHV genomes and an epitope-tagged KSHV lytic cycle switch replication and transcription activator (RTA) protein cassette under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Treatment with doxycycline induces the overexpression of RTA, which in turn induces the KSHV lytic reactivation.</p><p>We induced the TREXBCBL-1 cells with doxycycline and studied the abundance of IFI16, SUV39H1, GLP, and HP1α on the KSHV genome by ChIP at 1, 2, 3 and 4 days post-induction (new Figure 8A and 9H). These new results demonstrate that over-expression of RTA does mitigate the IFI16 mediated recruitment of SUV39H1, GLP, and HP1α.</p><p>The abundance of SUV39H1 on the KSHV genome decreased to about 25% of that of uninduced cells on day 2 post-induction and remained at that level until day 4. GLP, on the other hand showed a more drastic decrease and was reduced to less than 10% of the uninduced level by day 1 post-induction. Abundance of IFI16 decreased more gradually and reduced to less than 20% by day 4 which could be also due to the specific IFI16 degradation during KSHV lytic reactivation as demonstrated by us before (Roy et al., 2016 – Figure 7).</p><p>In addition, HP1α abundance dropped by about 60% during reactivation.</p><p>These new observations are discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “PLA in IFI16 KO cells confirms that IFI16 recruits SUV39H1 and GLP onto the KSHV genome resulting in the deposition of H3K9me3 but not H3K27me3” and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Recruitment of Heterochromatin Protein 1α (HP1α) on the KSHV genome is dependent on IFI16 mediated H3K9-trimethylation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Knockdown of IFI16 causes prominent changes in the deposition of H3 lysine methylation marks and RNA Pol II on KSHV promoters”, second paragraph.

As suggested, we have removed the 2-fold lines and now support our data with appropriate p-values.</p><p>It has been rightly pointed out by the reviewers that H3K4me3 modification on ORF73 promoter after IFI16 KD is significant (p-value **).</p><p>ORF73 mRNA expression under similar conditions after IFI16 KD has been reported by us previously (Roy et al., 2016 – Figures 1 and 2). There, we had observed that KD of IFI16 lead to a marginal increase (2 fold) in ORF73 expression in contrast to lytic genes which increased by several folds. This observation can be explained by the fact that the ORF73 promoter is under the concerted regulation of numerous transcription and epigenetic factors including Oct1, GATA-1 Ap1, and RBP-Jκ (Lan et al., 2005). In addition, the ORF73 promoter consists of two mRNA start sites – the LANA constitutive (LTc) and the RTA-inducible (LTi) mRNA start sites (Veeranna et al., 2012). This makes the ORF73 promoter particularly complex and it is possible that additional factors are involved in keeping the expression of LANA in check after IFI16 KD despite the fact that H3K4me3 is significantly enriched on the ORF73 promoter.</p><p>This is included in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The statistics in ChIP experiments in Figure 1C are confusing.

We have re-calculated the p-values and rectified the mistakes in placement accordingly. However, for the pvIRF2 H3K27me3 data point, re-calculation still yielded the result as significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are no quantitative assessments of the pulldown efficiencies of the IFI16 interactions to assess their significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Co-IP is a standard and robust method to detect protein-protein interactions. Co-IP followed by western blotting is not a quantitative method and our objective in this study is to attain qualitative information whether IFI16 interacts with our protein of interests or not. Moreover, antibodies against all these proteins are very diverse with varying binding efficiencies and therefore achieving a quantitative assessment of their pulldown efficiencies will be challenging if not impossible. We have assessed the specificity of the interaction by performing IgG IPs and confirmed the IFI16 mediated recruitment of SUV39H1 and GLP by methods other that co-IP like EdU labeled genome pulldowns (Figure 5A) and His-tagged IFI16 pulldowns (Figure 4C), both of which are antibody independent.</p><p>In addition, interactions and the specificities were confirmed by PLA as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is no quantitation of the PLA assays. This is a significant issue because conclusions can only be drawn by assessing the PLA in one or two cells. These data would be strengthened with the inclusion of data from at least 50 cells and appropriate statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>PLA detects protein-protein interactions at &lt;40 nm compared to the ~200nm of IFA. PLA detects the endogenous protein levels, detects the weak and transient interactions that might not survive the co-IP manipulations, and gives spatial and subcellular resolutions. PLA will not work if two proteins are not in close proximity and PLA dots represent the close proximity (interactions) of two proteins being examined. Hence, it is a positive or negative testing in our system.</p><p>In the earlier submission, we have shown the specificity of the PLA reaction between IFI16 and MTases by including an IFI16 + IgG PLA (Figure 5C, bottom panel) which does not show any positive PLA dots.</p><p>Similarly, absence of PLA signal between BrdU KSHV+H3K9me3, BrdU KSHV+SUV39H1 and BrdU KSHV+GLP in uninfected TIME cells (UI) were shown to confirm that non-specific PLA interactions were absent in our system (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have now included new figures showing the absence of significant PLA signal between BrdU labelled KSHV genome and IgG (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and IgG+IgG control PLAs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) (subsection “IFI16 interacts with H3K9MTase SUV39H1 and GLP and recruits them on to the KSHV genome”, second paragraph and subsection “PLA in IFI16 KO cells confirms that IFI16 recruits SUV39H1 and GLP onto the KSHV genome resulting in the deposition of H3K9me3 but not H3K27me3”, first paragraph).</p><p>Additionally, we have now included the source un-cropped images for all PLA data in this manuscript as Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3, Figure 6—figure supplements 2 and 3, and Figure 7—figure supplements 2 and 3. This shows multiple cells for all experiments and confirms that these results are significant. We have also shown IFI16 transfected and un-transfected cells in the same field in Figure 7. However, we regret that we do not have images for 50 cells for all experimental conditions. We believe that these supportive data together are convincing evidence that the recruitment of H3K9me3, SUV39H1 and GLP are IFI16 dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is no quantitation of the H3-MTase/EdU co-localization data in Figure 2F. Since the EdU signal is so extensive, it is hard to evaluate the relative co-localization of these enzymes with genomes. It might be useful to do this experiment with a lower MOI of EdU labeled virus and also to perform quantitation on the co-localization of these signals to better understand the specificity of these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. We have deconvoluted the EdU signal (red) in Figure 2F to distinctly visualize KSHV genomes in the nucleus and now we believe the co-localization of the different MTases with the KSHV genome is more prominent.</p><p>This improved figure is now included in place of the old Figure 2F.</p></body></sub-article></article>
