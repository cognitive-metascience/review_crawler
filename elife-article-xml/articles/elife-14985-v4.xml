In the primary visual cortex (V1), visual responses of pyramidal neurons increase during locomotion. This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons, resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14985.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14985.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14985.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How we perceive what we see depends on the context in which we see it, such as what we are doing at the time. For example, we perceive a park landscape differently when we are running through it than when we are sitting on a park bench. Behavior can also alter neuronal responses in the brain. Indeed, the neurons in the part of the brain that receives information related to vision (known as the visual cortex) respond differently to visual stimuli when an animal is moving compared to when the animal is still. However, while some recent studies revealed that specific types of neurons become more or less responsive during movement, others reported the opposite results.</p><p>One hypothesis that would explain these contradictory findings would be if the way that behavior, in this case movement, affects neuronal responses also depends on the external context in which the movement happens. Now, Pakan et al. have tested this hypothesis by imaging the activity of different types of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice that were either running on a treadmill or staying still. The experiments were conducted in two different contexts: in total darkness (in which the mice could not see) and in the presence of display screens (which provided the mice with visual stimulation).</p><p>Pakan et al. confirmed that running does indeed affect the activity of specific neurons in different ways in different contexts. For example, when the mice received visual stimulation, the three main classes of neurons that send inhibitory signals in the visual cortex became more active during running. However, when the mouse ran in the dark, two of these neuron types became more active during running while the third type of neuron was unresponsive. This finding reveals more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity that strongly depends on the animal’s behaviour. It also shows how these neurons influence the excitatory neurons in the visual cortex, which send information to the rest of the brain for further processing towards perception.</p><p>The next step will be to identify what precise mechanism makes these neurons respond differently in unique contexts, and to tease apart how these movement-dependent signals affect the way animals perceive visual stimuli.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14985.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14985.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

In primary sensory areas, neuronal responses to sensory inputs are also modulated by behavioral states, including level of arousal, attention and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iriki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petersen and Crochet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>). In vivo recordings in awake mice have shown that locomotion modulates the response properties of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), resulting in an increased gain of excitatory neuron responses to visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erisken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). However, the neuronal circuits underlying this response modulation are unclear.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that a specific subclass of inhibitory neurons, expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), strongly increase their activity during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>). VIP neurons mainly inhibit a second class of inhibitory neurons, expressing somatostatin (SST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>). It has been proposed that cholinergic activation of VIP neurons during locomotion would inhibit SST neurons, alleviating inhibition onto excitatory neurons and, as a consequence, increase the gain of excitatory neuron visual responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). However, a previous study has reported an increase of SST spiking activity in layer 2/3 during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>), an observation that challenges the hypothesis of an SST-cell mediated disinhibitory circuit. The aforementioned recordings of SST neuronal activity were acquired in different sensory contexts, either in darkness or during the presentation of visual stimuli. One hypothesis that would explain the discrepancies between these results is that V1 neuronal responses to locomotion are context-dependent.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14985.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Imaging locomotion responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mouse V1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the connectivity between pyramidal neurons (Pyr) and subtypes of inhibitory neurons, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) expressing neurons, established from in vitro studies in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>).

We used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of excitatory neurons as well as of three non-overlapping populations of inhibitory neurons (VIP, SST and parvalbumin [PV] neurons) in layer 2/3 and layer 4 of V1 in awake behaving mice. Our results show that during visual stimulation these three classes of interneurons increase their activity with locomotion, challenging the model of a disinhibitory circuit mediated through SST neurons. We found that locomotion affects the activity of inhibitory circuits differently in darkness and during visual stimulation, revealing a context-dependent, cell type specific response to locomotion in V1. The highest proportion of context-dependent responses to locomotion was found among SST neurons, which play a central role in V1 microcircuits. We suggest alternative mechanisms of how locomotion modulates the neuronal activity in V1, highlighting the dynamic nature of interneurons function that strongly depends on the behavioral context of the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We compared the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), between two different sensory contexts: darkness and visual stimulation. To do this, we used two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice that ran freely on a cylindrical treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The relative changes in somatic fluorescence of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f were used as a non-linear readout of the neuronal spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibitory neuronal subtypes were labeled by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) into V1 of Cre-recombinase transgenic mice (PV-, SST-, or VIP-Cre mice) for the Cre-inducible expression of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). To image excitatory neurons, we co-injected a floxed version of GCaMP6f and an AAV where Cre expression is driven by a CaMKII promoter, into C57/BL6 mice. After 2–3 weeks of expression, we recorded the running speed and GCaMP6f signals simultaneously, both in total darkness and during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Layer 2/3 celltype-specific responses to locomotion differ in darkness and during visual stimulation</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Excitatory neurons</title><p>We quantified, for each excitatory neuron (n = 1124 in 12 mice), the mean amplitude of calcium transients during locomotion periods and stationary periods, both during visual stimulation (drifting gratings) and in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A(i),B(i)</xref>).

We quantified the effect of locomotion by calculating a locomotion modulation index (LMI) for each neuron, corresponding to the difference between the mean ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> during locomotion (R<sub>L</sub>) and stationary (R<sub>s</sub>) periods, normalized by the sum of the mean ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> during both behavioral states (LMI = (R<sub>L</sub> – R<sub>s</sub>)/(R<sub>L</sub> + R<sub>s</sub>)). An LMI equal to 0 indicates no difference between locomotion and stationary periods, while an LMI equal to 0.5 indicates that the average amplitude of calcium transients was three times higher during locomotion than during stationary periods. Comparing the distribution of LMIs between the two sensory contexts, we found that the modulation of the activity of excitatory neurons by locomotion was significantly different in darkness compared to visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C(i),D(i)</xref>; mean of median LMI: 0.07 ± 0.02 darkness versus 0.19 ± 0.02 visual stimulation; p=0.001, n = 12, Kruskal–Wallis test). During visual stimulation, 47 ± 4% of excitatory neurons were significantly locomotion responsive (see Materials and methods for locomotion responsive criteria), compared with 28 ± 4% in darkness. Additionally, in the dark, a small proportion of neurons were inhibited by locomotion, decreasing their activity during locomotion periods relative to stationary periods (10 ± 1% of neurons).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14985.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Locomotion differentially modulates excitatory and inhibitory neuronal responses in darkness and during visual stimulation in V1 layer 2/3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Scatter plots of the mean amplitude of fluorescence changes (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) of each neuron for locomotion periods versus stationary periods, in darkness (<bold>A</bold>) and during visual stimulation (oriented gratings) (<bold>B</bold>); (<bold>i</bold>) excitatory cells (Exc), n = 1124; (<bold>ii</bold>) VIP, n = 210; (<bold>iii</bold>) SST, n = 79; (<bold>iv</bold>) PV, n = 199 neurons.

Context-dependent locomotion responses of layer 2/3 neurons may thus come from one of these distinct inputs or from a combination of them.

In this study, we found that the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and cell type specific, in layer 2/3 and layer 4 of mouse V1. During periods of visual stimulation, locomotion increases the activity of excitatory neurons as well as of three classes of inhibitory neurons (VIP, SST, PV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate that the enhancement of excitatory neuron visual responses during locomotion does not result from the inhibition of SST neurons, in mouse V1. Our findings thus challenge the generality of a disinhibitory circuit involving VIP, SST and pyramidal neurons for the gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Relationship between somatic fluorescence changes and spiking activity in different neuronal types and behavioral contexts</title><p>In this study, we used the relative changes in fluorescence of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f as a reporter of the spiking activity of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). For a given fluorescent calcium indicator, the relationship between the amplitude of somatic fluorescence changes and the number of spikes can be affected by a number of factors including the concentration of calcium buffers in the soma, the balance between calcium influx and efflux as well as calcium release from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grienberger et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, potential confounding factors in the present study would be (1) different intracellular calcium dynamics in different types of inhibitory neurons as well as (2) a higher increase of cytosolic free calcium concentration for the same number of spikes during locomotion compared to stationary periods. Considering that neuromodulators can regulate calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fucile, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen and Yakel, 2009</xref>), this second possibility may result from the action of neuromodulators released during locomotion that would increase the amount of calcium entering the neuron in response to each spike. In that case, for the same number of spikes, the increase in fluorescence of our calcium indicator would be higher during locomotion than during stationary periods.</p><p>Without an independent readout of the spiking activity for each neuronal type in each behavioral context, we cannot exclude that the relationship between fluorescence transients and the number of spikes differ between different neurons and different contexts. However, the comparison of our results (mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, ‘stim’ column) with spiking frequencies published in a previous study (see Supplementary Table 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>) in mouse V1 strongly suggests that somatic GCaMP6f fluorescence changes do reflect changes in spiking activity related to locomotion. For the same neuronal populations (layer 2/3 Excitatory, SST and PV neurons; layer 4 Excitatory neurons) and visual stimulation condition (drifting gratings), both data sets show the same relative change in signal during locomotion compared to stationary periods (corresponding to an approximate doubling of activity during locomotion for all three cell types). This similarity suggests that somatic GCaMP6 fluorescence changes during locomotion do reflect changes in spiking activity, at least in these cell types during visual stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison with previous findings: locomotion responses differ in darkness and during visual stimulation</title><p>In this study, we found that SST activity increased with locomotion during visual stimulation. This is in line with previous electrophysiological recordings of SST neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>) but in contradiction with the current disinhibitory model that relies on the inhibition of SST neurons during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Our results provide an explanation for these discrepancies since the aforementioned electrophysiological recordings were acquired during visual stimulation whereas imaging of SST activity was done in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The disinhibitory model was based on the assumption that the locomotion-driven response of SST neurons would be similar in the dark and during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The same assumption was made in the interpretation of membrane potential fluctuations of VIP and SST neurons recorded during the presentation of a blank screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). While VIP neurons were reliably depolarized during running, the SST population was heterogeneous. The authors distinguished two populations of SST interneurons (see Supplementary Figure 5C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>): Type I cells were inhibited by running while Type II cells were depolarized. Importantly, spiking activity of SST neurons was not reported and it is thus not clear how the membrane potential fluctuations relate to spiking activity.</p><p>Our findings regarding the locomotion responses of SST neurons in darkness are consistent with the previous imaging study performed in similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> of the present study compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Figure S3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>) as well as with the heterogeneity of membrane potential fluctuations of SST neurons during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that a disinhibitory circuit may underlie the activity of a small fraction of neurons in darkness: the majority of VIP neurons increase their activity with locomotion, while a small proportion of SST neurons are inhibited during locomotion, potentially leading to the increase in activity of some pyramidal neurons. However, the results obtained in darkness show that the majority of SST neurons are not responsive to locomotion at all, challenging the generality of a disinhibitory circuit acting through the inhibition of SST neurons. With visual stimulation, the inconsistency of the disinhibitory model is even stronger since the vast majority of SST neurons increase their activity with locomotion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B(iii)</xref>). Consequently, the results obtained during visual stimulation (present study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>) are incompatible with a model in which VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons by inhibiting SST neurons. Additionally, while the vast majority of VIP neurons are context-independent with regard to their locomotion response, excitatory neurons show significantly increased locomotion responses during visual stimulation compared to darkness conditions. Therefore, the context-dependent responses of excitatory neurons do not result from a disinhibitory circuit initiated by VIP neurons.</p><p>An appealing aspect of the disinhibitory model was the idea of a canonical circuit for gain modulation of sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). While the connectivity may be canonical, we show that the circuit activity can strongly differ depending on the behavioral context. Therefore, functional properties of inhibitory neurons should not be generalized from one context to the next, and caution should be taken when inferring connectivity from functional recordings obtained in a specific behavioral context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Alternative circuit mechanisms for behavioral-state modulation of visual responses in V1</title><p>Our results indicate that, in addition to the activation of VIP neurons during locomotion, other pathways are involved in linking locomotion and visual responses in V1. We suggest that neuromodulatory inputs triggered by locomotion would not only activate VIP neurons through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alitto and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), but would also directly activate PV, SST, and excitatory neurons. Previous work has demonstrated cholinergic facilitation of cortical inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alitto and Dan, 2012</xref>), including SST neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in vitro studies have shown that norepinephrine can depolarize both excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCormick et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirkwood et al., 1999</xref>) and inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawaguchi and Shindou, 1998</xref>) cortical neurons. Finally, in vivo studies have shown that neuromodulatory inputs, cholinergic and noradrenergic, can control the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of V1 excitatory neurons during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that in darkness, the effect of neuromodulatory inputs remains subthreshold in SST neurons. During visual stimulation, SST neurons are strongly activated and the effect of neuromodulatory inputs becomes suprathreshold. In agreement with the known intra-cortical connectivity in mouse V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), our findings support this neuromodulatory hypothesis. In darkness, VIP and PV neurons are activated by locomotion and inhibit SST and excitatory neurons, preventing their activation by locomotion-dependent inputs. During visual stimulation, SST and excitatory neurons are activated: they overcome the intra-cortical inhibition by VIP and PV neurons and become responsive to direct locomotion-dependent inputs. Since SST neurons provide the main intra-cortical input to VIP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>) and are strongly visually-responsive, they likely inhibit VIP neurons (or a subpopulation of VIP neurons) during visual stimulation. This is consistent with the decrease in activity of a portion of VIP neurons that was observed during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B(ii</xref>).</p><p>An alternative or complementary hypothesis to the neuromodulatory pathway is that the modulation of visual inputs by locomotion already takes place in subcortical nuclei, such that the thalamo-cortical inputs received by excitatory neurons, and potentially SST neurons, would convey the increased gain of visual responses during locomotion. Indeed, recent studies have shown that projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erisken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roth et al., 2016</xref>) and from the thalamic latero-posterior nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roth et al., 2016</xref>) to V1 both convey locomotion signals.</p><p>The diversity of context-dependent responses to locomotion within SST, PV and, to a lesser extent, VIP populations indicates that there are functional sub-types within each of these interneuron populations. Based on a comprehensive analysis of morphological and electrophysiological properties of inhibitory neurons, a recent in vitro study has identified seven distinct types of cortical interneurons in layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Further, in vivo characterization of the activity of these sub-types will be necessary to identify how these populations relate to the different context-dependent responses identified in the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Three Cre-driver transgenic mice lines were used to label inhibitory interneurons: <italic>Sst</italic>&lt;tm2.1(cre)Zjh&gt; (SST-Cre) [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link>], <italic>Pvalb</italic>&lt;tm1(cre)Arbr&gt; (PV-Cre) [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008069">IMSR_JAX:008069</ext-link>], <italic>Vip</italic>&lt;tm1(cre)Zjh&gt; (VIP-Cre) [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:010908">IMSR_JAX:010908</ext-link>], all originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA.

To define stationary and locomotion periods we used the following criteria. Stationary corresponded to periods where the instantaneous speed (as measured at the 40 Hz sampling rate) was less than 0.1 cm/s. Locomotion corresponded to periods meeting three criteria: instantaneous speed ≥ 0.1 cm/s, 0.25 Hz lowpass filtered speed ≥ 0.1 cm/s, and an average speed ≥ 0.1 cm/s over a 2 s window centered at this point in time. Any inter-locomotion interval shorter than 500 ms was also labelled as locomotion. Stationary periods less than 3 s after or 0.2 s before a period of locomotion were removed from the analysis. The locomotion modulation index (LMI) was defined as the difference between the mean ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> during locomotion (R<sub>L</sub>) and stationary (R<sub>s</sub>) periods, normalized by the sum of both values: LMI = (R<sub>L</sub> – R<sub>s</sub>)/(R<sub>L</sub> + R<sub>s</sub>).</p><p>To estimate the error on the LMI in both dark and stimulated conditions for each neuron, bootstrapping with sample replacement was employed. We binned the signal into 1 s bins, each of which had only one visual stimulus and one behavioral activity (locomotion or stationary) throughout its duration. For each 1 s bin, we took the mean ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and regarded this value as a single sample. For periods of time which had a single stimulus and behavioral activity persisted for longer than 1 s, additional samples were drawn with intervals of no less than 2 s. This interval duration was selected based on the autocorrelation of the calcium fluorescence signal, which took approximately 2 s to fall to 0.5. The average correlation between consecutive samples of the same stimulus and activity condition was computed as a weighted average over all conditions, and was found to be R = 0.35. We then randomly selected samples of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> with replacement from our original set of samples. The number of samples selected in each bootstrap resample (65% = 1-R) was reduced from the total number of samples available to reflect the fact that our samples were not completely independent. This process was repeated 10000 times to obtain 95% confidence intervals for significance tests for each neuron individually.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Behavioural state modulation of inhibitory activity is context-dependent and cell-type specific in mouse V1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study compares the modulation of neuronal activity in mouse visual cortex by locomotion between two conditions (contexts): in darkness and during visual stimulation. To monitor activity the authors use calcium indicators conditionally expressed in distinct neuron types in layer 2/3 and 4. During visual stimulation all cell types (VIP, SST, PV and Excitatory neurons) showed increased activity during locomotion. In darkness the response to locomotion was essentially restricted to VIP and PV cells. These interesting results challenge the generality of some recent publication and are discussed in the context of state dependent neuromodulation. The mechanisms by which visual processing is affected by locomotion has captured the curiosity of many labs. Clearly, determining how distinct types of cortical inhibitory neurons are modulated by locomotion is an important step towards this goal. The observations challenge the notion that all running-based modulations can be accounted for by a disinhibitory circuit involving VIP – SOM – pyramidal cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers felt the authors could get much more out of the data with more analysis. For example, the variability analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> is very hard to interpret without a quantification of measurement variability, i.e. how variable is the LMI between two sessions of dark and two session of visual stimulation. To estimate this, the authors could split the data in two and look at the variability between the first and second half (e.g. calculate an LMI on the first half the dark data and compare that to LMI from the second half of the dark data). Without this it is very hard to interpret what the variability means. The argument can be applied to data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, and corresponding parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>To provide stronger visual support for the hypothesis that locomotion effects differ between darkness and visual stimulation conditions, can the authors please show a scatter plot of the LMI during visual stimulation vs. darkness for the neurons?</p><p>Therefore, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, the reviewers strongly advise to choose a different format of presentation. For example, the reader might expect scatter plots where each dot is the LMI of a neuron measured during darkness and during visual stimulation. Adding mean differences across neurons and sem for the relevant comparisons could help convey the results of the statistical analyses. To address these criticisms, the authors should choose the most appropriate format and statistics for data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 &amp; 4</xref>.</p><p>Other reports have shown that the locomotion-based modulation of an (indiscriminative) population of V1 neurons is stronger during visual stimulation than during gray screen conditions (e.g. Erisken et al., 2014). Does the presence of light that make a difference or is it rather the visual stimulation with gratings? New experiments should be conducted using a gray screen (without patterned visual stimulation) to address this question.</p><p>Also, more analyses should be provided to address the following questions: Is there any characteristic feature of a cell that is locomotion responsive during stim only? Are the visual responses different of these cells than of cells that are locomotion responsive during darkness only? There is quite a bit of straightforward analysis that could be included that would significantly increase the value of the study.</p><p>By using the amplitude of calcium transients as a proxy for neuronal firing rates and comparing these transients across context and behavioral state, the authors make the assumption that both context and behavioral state will not impact the amount of calcium entering the cell in response to each spike. However if context and/or behavioral state modifies the level of neuromodulators in the cortex this assumption may be incorrect. Neuromodulators (e.g. acetylcholine) can regulate calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels. This issue needs to be explicitly stated and thoroughly discussed in the Discussion.</p><p>The authors have correctly noticed several contradictions between previously published stories and have identified one factor (i.e. darkness vs. visual stimulation) that might explain at least some of these contradictions. While this is an important observation, the authors should be more precise and complete in their review of the existing literature. Here are a few examples: (1) Did Adesnik et al., 2012 indeed show higher responses of SOM for running vs. stationary? To my knowledge, they only show that activity of SOM interneurons is very low during anaesthesia, and much higher during running (2) Reimer et al., 2014 observed more hyperpolarized Vm of SOM interneurons during running with a blank screen (which is possibly a gray screen condition), but again this is not treated in the manuscript. (3) Contrary to the citation in l. 226, to my knowledge neither Ayaz et al. 2013 nor Saleem et al. 2013 performed targeted electrophysiological recordings of SOM interneurons. (4) Fu et al., 2014 already reported that the magnitude of VIP activation during locomotion is stronger during darkness than visual stimulation, but this is nowhere explicitly stated. (5) Most importantly, please explain which conditions and findings are replications of and agree with Fu et al. (2014) and which do not.</p><p>Interpretation of the layer 4 data is difficult for two reasons: a) layer 4 cells seem to be inherently resistant to transfection by AAVs using the standard promoters used (hsyn, camkII, ef1a). Transgene expression is typically weaker and sparser in layer 4 than in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells. Given the sparse expression in layer 4, it is more than likely that the expression system preferentially targets a specific subtype of layer 4 pyramidal cell. Thus it is hard to extrapolate to layer 4 in general. Note, this is not something the authors should address experimentally, but it is a caveat that should probably be discussed. b) Layer 4 could of course receives input from all other layers, thus it becomes a chicken and egg problem as to where the locomotion modulation in layer 4 comes from. The authors' data may therefore not support the conclusion of a &quot;prominent role of subcortical inputs in both layers for the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion&quot; (Results section, subsection “Layer 4 excitatory and inhibitory responses to locomotion are similar to layer 2/3”). These issues should be discussed comprehensively in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Behavioral-state modulation of inhibition is context-dependent and cell type specific in mouse visual cortex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there is one remaining issue that need to be addressed before acceptance. During the consultation session, the reviewers thought that the Discussion needs a little more detail about how the disinhibitory circuit model fails. Specifically, compared to the previous version, there is the impression that the data became even more complicated. Specifically, based on the LMI, you concluded that the VIP modulation by locomotion is context-independent (i.e. probably consistent with the disinhibitory scheme), while the SST modulation during visual stimulation is probably breaking the scheme. The addition of the cross-correlation analysis, however, suggests that part of the observations look more in line with the disinhibitory model: in darkness, where VIP have higher cross-correlation peaks, SST have lower ones; during visual stimulation, where VIP have lower cross-correlation peaks, SST have higher ones. A similar trend is visible for the LMI but not significant.</p><p>The reviewers thought that while your primary message is clear (that the proposed disinhibitory circuit cannot explain the data), you could try to point out and discuss a bit more in which way the circuit fails. E.g. is it maybe already a failure that neither the SST LMI nor the SST cross-correlation are negative in the data, even during darkness? Why are the results different for the LMI and the cross-correlation analysis?</p><p>The manuscript will be accepted once you extend your discussion to include these suggestions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14985.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>All reviewers felt the authors could get much more out of the data with more analysis.

We have now added a quantification of the variability of locomotion responses in each context (darkness and visual stimulation) for each neuronal type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. As suggested, we have divided the data in two halves: we calculated separate LMI values for all odd and all even locomotion periods.

This format of presentation does indeed provide stronger visual support to our conclusions: neurons near the identity line display context-independent locomotion responses (similar LMI in darkness and during visual stimulation), while the other neurons changed their response to locomotion from one context to another (context-dependent responses – shown in red). We now quantify the proportion of context-dependent neurons by applying the 2 following criteria:</p><p>(1) a locomotion response that was significantly different across contexts (neurons distance from the identity line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); We estimated the error on the LMI in both darkness and stimulated conditions for each neuron, by using bootstrapping.</p><p>(2) low variability of locomotion responses both in darkness and during visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and see answer to Point 1).</p><p>A full description of the method is provided in Materials and methods (subsection “Analysis of Locomotion Responses”).</p><p>Additionally, in order to convey the results of our statistical tests, we have now added to each relevant figure histograms showing the values (i.e. mean and sem) that were used for each statistical test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Other reports have shown that the locomotion-based modulation of an (indiscriminative) population of V1 neurons is stronger during visual stimulation than during gray screen conditions (e.g. Erisken et al., 2014).

New experiments should be conducted using a gray screen (without patterned visual stimulation) to address this question.</italic> </p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we have now included new data of neurons imaged during the presentation of a grey screen. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have quantified the amplitude of fluorescence changes during stationary and locomotion periods in all three contexts: darkness, grey screen and drifting gratings. We did not find any significant difference for any of the inhibitory populations (VIP, SST and PV neurons) between the two types of visual stimulation (gratings vs grey screen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). For excitatory neurons, we found a lower LMI during the presentation of a grey screen than during drifting grating presentation (mean of median LMI: 0.17 ± 0.02 grey versus 0.19 ± 0.02 visual stimulation; p=0.033, n=12, Kruskal–Wallis test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>(i)).</p><p>These results show that locomotion increases the response of excitatory, VIP, SST and PV neurons during visual stimulation, independently of the presence of patterned visual stimuli. These results are presented in the Results section.</p><p> <italic>Also, more analyses should be provided to address the following questions: Is there any characteristic feature of a cell that is locomotion responsive during stim only? Are the visual responses different of these cells than of cells that are locomotion responsive during darkness only? There is quite a bit of straightforward analysis that could be included that would significantly increase the value of the study.</italic> </p><p>Following the suggestions described in Point 1 and Point 2, we have now refined our criteria for the definition of context-dependent neurons. We have tested whether context-dependent neurons differ from context-independent ones with regard to the following characteristics: percentage of visually responsive neurons, orientation selectivity and direction selectivity. We did not find any significant difference in any neuronal population (comparisons between context-dependent and context independent neurons for each cell type, OSI, p&gt;0.261; DSI p&gt;0.093, Kruskal–Wallis test), suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the modulation of locomotion responses differ from those determining the selectivity of visual responses. These results are now included in the Results section, subsection”Diversity of context-dependent locomotion responses within cell types”.</p><p>We have also tested whether visual response properties would differ between the previously defined ‘stimulus only’ and ‘dark only’ neurons. We again did not find any significant difference for the proportion of visually responsive neurons, the orientation and direction selectivity in any cell type. Taking these results into account, we have followed the suggestion of Point 10, and removed the pie chart classification of cell types. We now have only two categories: significantly context dependent and context independent neurons, defined by using bootstrapping methods and variability criteria (see Materials and Methods and responses to Points 1 and 2). We believe this simplified classification better reflects the nature of the data while still demonstrating the diversity of responses that exist within each cell type.</p><p> <italic>By using the amplitude of calcium transients as a proxy for neuronal firing rates and comparing these transients across context and behavioral state, the authors make the assumption that both context and behavioral state will not impact the amount of calcium entering the cell in response to each spike. However if context and/or behavioral state modifies the level of neuromodulators in the cortex this assumption may be incorrect. Neuromodulators (e.g. acetylcholine) can regulate calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels. This issue needs to be explicitly stated and thoroughly discussed in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We agree and we have now included a section at the beginning of the discussion in which we clearly present and discuss this issue (subsection “Relationship between sp,atic and fluorescence changes and spiking activity in different neuronal types and behavioral contexts).</p><p>Without an independent read out of the spiking activity for each neuronal type in each behavioural context, we cannot exclude that the relation between fluorescence transients and number of spikes differ between different neurons and different contexts. However, the similarity of our results (mean df/F0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, ‘stim’ column) with changes in spiking frequencies published in a previous study (see Supplementary Table 3 of Polack et al., 2013) in mouse V1 strongly suggests that somatic GCamp6f fluorescence changes do reflect changes in spiking activity related to locomotion. For the same neuronal populations (layer 2/3 Excitatory, SST and PV neurons and layer 4 Excitatory neurons) and visual stimulation condition (drifting gratings), both data sets show the same relative increase of activity during locomotion compared to stationary periods (corresponding to an approximate doubling of activity during locomotion for all three cell types). This similarity suggests that somatic GCamp6 fluorescence changes during locomotion do reflect changes in spiking activity, at least in these cell types during the presentation of drifting gratings.</p><p> <italic>The authors have correctly noticed several contradictions between previously published stories and have identified one factor (i.e. darkness vs. visual stimulation) that might explain at least some of these contradictions. While this is an important observation, the authors should be more precise and complete in their review of the existing literature. Here are a few examples: (1) Did Adesnik et al., 2012 indeed show higher responses of SOM for running vs. stationary?

(5) Most importantly, please explain which conditions and findings are replications of and agree with Fu et al. (2014) and which do not.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text in order to be more precise in our statements:</p><p>(1) We agree that the sentence was misleading. We now cite this article in the discussion: ‘These results are consistent with electrophysiological recordings of SST neurons performed during running periods and showing an increase in the response of layer 2/3 SST neurons with stimulation of the receptive field surround, in mouse V1 (Adesnik et al. 2012)’. (Discussion section, subsection “Comparison with previous findings[…]”)</p><p>(2) Reimer et al. (2014) observed two populations of SOM interneurons in V1, that they describe as: ‘’SOM Type I and Type II cells respond differently during active behaviour (running and whisking). Type I cells are inhibited by running while Type II cells are depolarized’’). However, the authors indicate that: ‘’we excluded Type II SOM+ cells in subsequent analyses’’ (page 358; Reimer et al., 2014). Importantly, spiking activity of SOM neurons is not described in this article that only presents changes in membrane potential (Vm). It is thus not clear how the (mild) hyperpolarization of Type 1 neurons during locomotion relates to the spiking activity. These results were obtained during the presentation of a blank screen. Our results obtained in darkness are consistent with the heterogeneity of membrane potential fluctuations of SST neurons described in the Reimer et al. (2014) article.</p><p>We have included a discussion of these results in the revised version of the manuscript (Discussion section, subsection “Comparison with previous findings[…]”).</p><p>(3) We apologize for this mistake due to an error in editing the references. We have modified the sentence and removed the 2 citations.</p><p>(4) and (5) For a direct comparison of our data with the results published in the Fu et al. (2014) paper, we have now included in the revised manuscript a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) in which our data are analysed in the same way as in the Fu et al. (2014) article. We calculated the cross-correlation between calcium signals and running speed for each cell type, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> of Fu et al., (2014). In the revised version, we have now included a section in the Discussion comparing directly our data with the results presented in the Fu et al., 2014 article (Discussion section, subsection “Comparison with previous findings[…]”)</p><p> <italic>Interpretation of the layer 4 data is difficult for two reasons: a) layer 4 cells seem to be inherently resistant to transfection by AAVs using the standard promoters used (hsyn, camkII, ef1a). Transgene expression is typically weaker and sparser in layer 4 than in layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal cells. Given the sparse expression in layer 4, it is more than likely that the expression system preferentially targets a specific subtype of layer 4 pyramidal cell. Thus it is hard to extrapolate to layer 4 in general. Note, this is not something the authors should address experimentally, but it is a caveat that should probably be discussed. b) Layer 4 could of course receives input from all other layers, thus it becomes a chicken and egg problem as to where the locomotion modulation in layer 4 comes from. The authors' data may therefore not support the conclusion of a &quot;prominent role of subcortical inputs in both layers for the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion&quot; (Results section, subsection “Layer 4 excitatory and inhibitory responses to locomotion are similar to layer 2/3”). These issues should be discussed comprehensively in the revised manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We agree and we have modified the text accordingly (Results section, subsection “Layer 4 excitatory and inhibitory responses to locomotion are similar to layer 2/3”). We now state specifically that the GCamp6f labelling in layer 4 is sparser than in layer 2/3 and that we may preferentially target a subtype of layer 4 neurons. We have removed our conclusion of a <italic>&quot;prominent role of subcortical inputs in both layers for the modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion&quot;</italic> and discuss the potential input pathways that modulate the activity of both layer 2/3 ad layer 4 neurons during locomotion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>The reviewers thought that while your primary message is clear (that the proposed disinhibitory circuit cannot explain the data), you could try to point out and discuss a bit more in which way the circuit fails. E.g. is it maybe already a failure that neither the SST LMI nor the SST cross-correlation are negative in the data, even during darkness? Why are the results different for the LMI and the cross-correlation analysis?</italic> </p><p>We have now extended our discussion in order to emphasize how the disinhibitory circuit fails (Discussion section, subsection “Comparison with previous findings[…]”), stating more clearly how our results are incompatible with the disinhibitory circuit model.</p><p>Regarding the cross-correlation analysis, we agree that the presentation of the results was confusing. The LMI and cross-correlation analyses both show similar results regarding the relative changes of VIP and SST responses to locomotion in darkness and visual stimulation. The only difference in the previous submission was in the level of statistical significance. The cross-correlation analysis was initially included following the suggestion of the reviewers to provide a direct comparison between our data and those published previously (Fu et al. 2014). With this aim, we used the same statistical approach (pooling all neurons together) as in the Fu et al., 2014 article and the difference between dark and visual stimulation became significant for VIP neurons (whereas it is not the case in the LMI analysis in which statistics are performed across animals). We agree that this was confusing and we have now applied the same statistical approach for our cross-correlation data as for the rest of the article. As we discussed in our answer to point 20 in our first revision, we think that using the number of animals as our sample size is more suitable. Comparing measures across neurons, rather than across animals, would incorrectly inflate the degrees of freedom with the risk of false positive results for detecting significant differences. The justification of this statistical approach is clearly described in the Materials and methods section (Materials and methods section, subsection 'Statistics').</p><p>As a result, using consistent statistical criteria, there is no difference between LMI and cross-correlation analyses: they both show that during visual stimulation, VIP neurons have lower LMI and cross-correlation peaks (without reaching significance), while SST and excitatory cells have significantly higher LMI and cross-correlation peaks compared to the dark condition.</p><p>We suggest that this pattern of activity results from the fact that SST neurons provide the main intra-cortical input to VIP neurons (Pfeffer et al., 2013). Since SST neurons are strongly visually-responsive, they likely inhibit VIP neurons (or a subpopulation of VIP neurons) during visual stimulation, resulting in a decrease of activity in some VIP neurons. This is now explained in the Discussion (subsection “Alternative circuit mechanisms for behavioral-state modulation of visual responses in V1”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
