It remains, however, unclear whether neuronal diversity, intricate tissue architecture, and axonal connectivity can be regenerated; yet, this is critical for recovery of function and a central aim of cell replacement strategies in the mammalian central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that, upon mechanical injury to the adult pallium, axolotls can regenerate several of the populations of neurons present before injury. Notably, regenerated neurons acquire functional electrophysiological traits and respond appropriately to afferent inputs. Despite the ability to regenerate specific, molecularly-defined neuronal subtypes, we also uncovered previously unappreciated limitations by showing that newborn neurons organize within altered tissue architecture and fail to re-establish the long-distance axonal tracts and circuit physiology present before injury. The data provide a direct demonstration that diverse, electrophysiologically functional neurons can be regenerated in axolotls, but challenge prior assumptions of functional brain repair in regenerative species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13998.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13998.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13998.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and other mammals have a very limited ability to regenerate new neurons in the brain to replace those that have been injured or damaged. In striking contrast, some animals like fish and salamanders are capable of filling in injured brain regions with new neurons. This is a complex task, as the brain is composed of many different types of neurons that are connected to each other in a highly organized manner across both short and long distances.</p><p>The extent to which even the most regenerative species can build new brain regions was not known. Understanding any limitations will help to set realistic expectations for the success of potential treatments that aim to replace neurons in mammals.</p><p>Amamoto et al. found that the brain of the axolotl, a species of salamander, could selectively regenerate the specific types of neurons that were damaged. This finding suggests that the brain is able to somehow sense which types of neurons are injured. The new neurons were able to mature into functional neurons, but they were limited in their ability to reconnect to their original, distant target neurons.</p><p>More research is now needed to investigate how the axolotl brain recognizes which types of neurons have been damaged. It will also be important to understand which cells respond to the injury to give rise to the new neurons that fill the injury site, and to uncover the molecules that are important for governing this regenerative process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13998.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13998.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

physiological conditions, the neurogenic capacity of the adult mammalian brain is largely restricted to two neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, which gives rise to interneurons of the olfactory bulb and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, which generates granule cells of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). Neurons in other brain regions are only generated during embryonic development and are not replaced postnatally.</p><p>In contrast to mammals, other vertebrates are endowed with superior capacity to regenerate multiple organs, including parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Among these, urodele amphibians like the axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum)</italic> are endowed with the capacity to add new neurons to the brain throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maden et al., 2013</xref>) and can regenerate the spinal cord and parts of the brain after mechanical injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burr, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler and Ward, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piatt, 1955</xref>). Resection of the middle one-third of one hemisphere, but not the whole hemisphere, in the axolotl telencephalon results in reconstruction of the injured hemisphere to a similar length as the contralateral, uninjured side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winkelmann and Winkelmann, 1970</xref>). Similarly, after mechanical excision of the newt optic tectum, new tissue fills the space produced by injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, in the newt, selective chemical ablation of dopaminergic neurons within a largely intact midbrain triggers regeneration of the ablated pool of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parish et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to urodeles, teleost fish have also been extensively studied for their capacity to regenerate the CNS and have led to the identification of some of the molecular signals involved in the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kizil et al., 2012</xref>). These studies highlight the value of regenerative organisms as models to understand the mechanisms that govern brain regeneration for possible application to the mammalian brain.</p><p>However, the mammalian CNS is notoriously complex, and its ability to compute high-level functions, like those of the mammalian cerebral cortex, relies on the presence of a great diversity of neuronal subtypes integrated in specific long-distance and local circuits and working within a defined tissue architecture. Disruption of brain structure, connectivity, and neuronal composition is often associated with behavioral deficits, as observed in models of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disease. It is therefore likely that functional regeneration of higher-order CNS structures will entail the regeneration of a great diversity of neuronal subtypes, the rebuilding of original connectivity, and the synaptic integration of newborn neurons in the pre-existing tissue. It is not known to what extent even regenerative species can accomplish these complex tasks, beyond their broad ability to generate new neurons and to rebuild gross brain morphology. It remains therefore debated whether any vertebrates are capable of true functional brain regeneration.</p><p>Using the adult axolotl pallium as the model system, we have investigated whether a diverse array of neuronal subtypes can regenerate and whether their tissue-level organization, connectivity, and functional properties can also regenerate after mechanical injury.</p><p>In contrast to the teleostean pallium, the everted nature of which makes linking distinct regions to their mammalian counterparts difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Northcutt, 2008</xref>), the gross neuroanatomy of the axolotl pallium, organized around two ventricles, shows clear similarities to that of the mammalian telencephalon. In addition, while the evolutionary origin of the mammalian cerebral cortex remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MolnÃ¡r, 2011</xref>), it is likely that the axolotl pallium contains a basic representation of several of the neuronal subtypes found in the mammalian cerebral cortex and thus may serve as a good model for investigating regeneration of neuronal heterogeneity and complex circuit function.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that both pre- and post-metamorphosis adult axolotls are able to regenerate a diversity of neurons upon localized injury to the dorsal pallium. This process occurs through specific regenerative steps that we defined in live animals using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Strikingly, newborn neurons can acquire mature electrophysiological properties and respond to local afferent inputs. However, they unexpectedly fail to rebuild long-distance circuit and the original tissue architecture.</p><p>The data provide the first proof for the precision with which axolotls regenerate a diverse set of neurons, which in turn become electrophysiologically active and receive local afferent inputs. Notably, however, our results also challenge prior assumptions of functional brain regeneration in salamanders by uncovering unappreciated limitations in the capacity of adult axolotls to fully rebuild original long-distance connectivity and tissue organization, a finding that redefines expectations for brain regeneration in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The axolotl pallium contains molecularly diverse neuronal populations</title><p>In order to investigate whether axolotls can reconstruct neuronal diversity, we have started by building a molecular map of the neuronal populations present in the axolotl pallium.</p><p>The neuronal composition of the axolotl pallium is largely unknown, with the urodele pallium being classically divided into medial pallium (MP), dorsal pallium (DP), and lateral pallium (LP) based on the size and location of cell nuclei, as well as rudimentary connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herrick, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kokoros and Northcutt, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Westhoff and Roth, 2002</xref>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

In the mouse neocortex, <italic>Fezf2</italic> and <italic>Ctip2</italic> are specifically expressed by subcerebral projection neurons (ScPNs) in layer Vb at high levels and by corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPNs) in layer VI at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlotta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molyneaux et al., 2005</xref>).

To gain information on the tissue-level morphological changes that take place over the course of the regenerative process in individual animals and to account for animal-to-animal variability, we performed in vivo MRI of live axolotls undergoing pallial regeneration. This method demonstrated that the wound closure process occurs rapidly, between 2 and 4wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2câe</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Notably, the lateral pallium formed a stump, which subsequently thinned out before protruding towards the medial pallium and closing the gap generated by the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

To determine whether this distal proliferative response leads to regeneration of new neurons, we quantified the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in the rostral telencephalon at 11wpi in injured and sham controls, in which the skin and skull were opened but the brain was not injured. Quantification revealed that there were significantly more BrdU<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup> nuclei in the rostral telencephalon of injured animals compared to sham animals, indicating that an injury to the pallium leads to generation of newborn neurons distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that regeneration of the pallium initiates with distinct morphological changes to the injury edge (stump), which thins out and closes the wound.

It is therefore not possible to conclude whether some of the neurons in the regenerate are newborn (yet not labeled by BrdU) or are endogenous neurons that have migrated from neighboring territories. If migration of neurons into the injured region were a major contributor to the regenerative process, this could cause a decrease in the number of certain neuronal subtypes in regions adjacent to the injury site. We thus quantified the number of neuronal subtypes in MP and LP. We found no significant differences between contralateral, injured, and sham hemispheres for any of the neuronal subtype markers tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting, albeit not fully excluding, the possibility that no major waves of migration of endogenous neurons reconstitute neuronal diversity in the regenerated dorsal pallium.</p><p>It has been previously reported that the brain regeneration capability of the axolotl decreases upon metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirsche et al., 1965</xref>).

Given that the number of Retrobead<sup>+</sup> neurons remains significantly reduced at 42wpi, it is unlikely that this is a matter of neuronal maturity or low speed of axon growth. Interestingly, we also found a reduction in the number of Retrobead<sup>+</sup> neurons in the lateral pallium, despite the fact that this region was not mechanically injured (Uninjured n=5 118.2 Â± 38.96 neurons; 11wpi n=6 21.83 Â± 4.629 neurons; 42wpi n=3 29.67 Â± 10.35 neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâb</xref>).

Potential severance of the tract that connects the lateral pallium to the olfactory bulb during the dorsal pallium injury may account for this reduction.

In agreement with our retrograde tracing results, magnetic resonance tractography revealed distinct three-dimensional fiber tracts connecting the pallium and the olfactory bulb in the control, contralateral hemisphere. In striking contrast, we observed significant truncation of the same bundles in the regenerated hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, arrowheads).Â These results show that regeneration of the pallium does not remake long-distance projections present in the original brain.</p><p>To investigate whether regenerated neurons could excite physiological targets that were more closely located, we stimulated the dorsal pallium and performed extracellular field recordings in the lateral and medial pallium.

This demonstrates an unknown obstacle to functional brain repair even in a highly regenerative species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The function of the mammalian brain relies on the processing power of an outstanding diversity of neuronal subtypes, which are integrated into distinct networks necessary for the execution of specific functions. One central goal of regenerative medicine in the CNS is therefore to rebuild not only the original heterogeneity of neurons but also their specific patterns of connectivity within the endogenous tissue.</p><p>Prior work suggested that the axolotl might be a good model to understand the mechanisms of complete CNS regeneration because of its capacity to grossly regenerate large portions of the brain when mechanically injured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burr, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kirsche and Kirsche, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winkelmann and Winkelmann, 1970</xref>). However, it remains unclear to what extent brain regeneration in the axolotl leads to reformation of functional tissue.</p><p>Here, we found that, upon a large mechanical injury to the pallium, the adult axolotl can regenerate the original neuronal diversity. Notably, newborn neurons acquire intrinsic electrophysiological properties and process afferent input in a manner that is indistinguishable from the endogenous neurons in uninjured brains. It is also interesting that this capacity is not lost after metamorphosis, challenging the theory that, in this species, regeneration is partly linked to the maintenance of a paedomorphic state in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kirsche et al., 1965</xref>). These results indicate that, beyond instructing the birth of new neurons, the adult axolotl brain is capable of regenerating a diversity of neurons that in turn are electrophysiologically functional, even when a large region of the brain is removed.</p><p>An outstanding question in the field of brain regeneration remains whether, beyond rebuilding cellular complexity and local connectivity, new connections to distant targets can be restored upon brain regeneration. It is similarly unknown whether tissue architecture and neuronal topography can be regenerated. We found that axolotls possess only limited capacity to rebuild original tissue architecture after large deletions of the pallium. In addition, we uncovered an unexpected limitation to the capacity of newborn neurons to extend axons to original targets in distal brain regions. It is possible that the observed limitations relate to a lack of instructive signals from the environment rather than intrinsic limitations of the regenerated neurons. For example, in order to reach the OB, newborn neurons of the pallium will have to extend axons through uninjured territory that may lack developmental ligands necessary for axon guidance to the OB.</p><p>The processes and mechanisms that initially trigger wound closure and subsequently sustain brain repair in regenerative vertebrate species are not known. Using in vivo MRI, we were able to observe, for the first time, the dynamic changes in tissue morphology that occur in live animals over the course of brain regeneration. We found that early steps of wound closure involve the generation of thinner processes from a stump that directionally grow towards each other before fusing. This strategy resembles that observed in the limb, in which closure of the wound by the wound epithelium after amputation is necessary for subsequent regenerative steps and may serve as a source of signals to govern downstream regenerative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mescher, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thornton, 1957</xref>). It is possible that, much like the limb, morphogenetic movements act as a signaling event to trigger cellular proliferation and accumulation of newborn, differentiated cells at the site of injury. In support of this possibility, we did not observe major waves of neuronal migration from regions adjacent to the injury site, and the topography of neurons in these regions remains properly organized upon regeneration. In the future, it will be interesting to determine the cellular source of the newborn neurons. Activated ependymoglia cells are one of the major sources of injury-induced newborn neurons in the newt and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kroehne et al., 2011</xref>), and these cells may similarly be the main origin of newborn neurons in the axolotl pallium. An alternative, yet not exclusive, possibility is that reprogramming of endogenous differentiated cells may contribute to the generation of new neurons. Such reprogramming events were reported, for example, in the zebrafish retina, where Mueller glia appears capable of generating new neurons upon retinal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Together, our findings establish the axolotl pallium as a model to further investigate how diverse populations of electrophysiologically functional neurons are mechanistically regenerated. In addition, the results highlight previously unappreciated limits for what vertebrates are able to achieve when faced with the need to regenerate the most complex tissues. This should help define concrete goals and expectations for cellular replacement outcomes in the central nervous system of mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wildtype axolotls (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) were obtained from the Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) and were housed in standard conditions at 16Â°C in Holtfreterâs solution.

The caudal-medial corner of the rectangular injury site is defined as 1âmm lateral from and 2âmm rostral from the choroid plexus. The injury site tissue was removed using No.5 forceps. After the injury, the cranial flaps were replaced, and the skins flaps were secured with non-absorbable silk sutures (Myco Medical, Cary, NC). In sham injury, the telencephalon was similarly exposed but the dorsal pallium was left intact.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>BrdU/EdU labeling</title><p>250âÎ¼l (8 mg/ml in PBS) of BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) or EdU (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was injected intraperitoneally. For animals sacrificed at 4wpi, BrdU/EdU was injected three times a week while for animals sacrificed at 11wpi, BrdU/EdU was injected once at 3, 4, and 5wpi due to the toxic effect of more frequent regimens of BrdU/EdU administration. BrdU incorporation was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining (see below). EdU incorporation was detected with the Click-it EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and Nissl staining</title><p>Uninjured brains were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4Â°C. Injured and sham-injured brains were fixed overnight with the cranium attached, dissected from the cranium, and re-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4Â°C. The extra fixation step is necessary to preserve the morphological integrity of the injured tissue. After fixation, the brains were equilibrated in 30% sucrose solution at 4Â°C, embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and cryosectioned coronally at 30âÎ¼m thickness. 10 series (120 sections) were collected from each brain onto Vistavision microscope slides (VWR, Radnor, PA) and stored at -80Â°C. For BrdU detection, sections were incubated in 2M HCl for 20 min at 37Â°C, before incubation in blocking buffer (0.3% BSA, 8% serum, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2âhr at room temperature (RT). Sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C in primary antibodies, which were diluted in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: rat anti-CTIP2 antibody 1:100 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-SATB2 1:50 (Abcam), rabbit anti-TLE4 1:3000 (gift of Stefano Stifani), rabbit anti-CALB2 1:300 (Swant, Marly, Switzerland), rat anti-BrdU 1:300 (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY), mouse anti-BrdU 1:300 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), mouse anti-NeuN 1:300 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-Hu-C/D 1:300 (Genetex, Irvine, CA), rabbit anti-PH3 1:300 (Millipore), rabbit anti-Sox2 1:100 (Abcam), mouse anti-GFAP 1:300 (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-Tubb3 1:300 (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Sections were incubated in appropriate secondary antibodies from the Molecular Probes Alexa Fluor series (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1:750 dilutions for 2âhr at RT. After washing, sections were incubated in DAPI 1:50,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at RT. Sections were coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) before imaging. Tissue sections were imaged using a Nikon 90i fluorescence microscope equipped with a Retiga Exi camera (Q-Imaging, Surrey, Canada) and analyzed with Volocity image analysis software v4.0.1 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from axolotl pallium of injured and uninjured animals using recording pipettes (Glass type 8250, King Precision Glass, Claremont, CA) pulled in a horizontal pipette puller (P-87, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) to a resistance of 3â4 MÎ©, and filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 117.0âK-gluconate, 13.0 KCl, 1.0, MgCl2, 0.07 CaCl2, 0.1 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 2.0 Na-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, and 0.3% biocytin, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH and osmolarity adjusted to 298â300 mOsm with 15Â mM K<sub>2</sub>SO4.</p><p>For data acquisition and analysis, a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) and digidata 1440A were used to acquire whole cell signals. The signals were acquired at 20 KHz and filter at 2Â KHz. Conventional characterization of neurons was made in voltage and current clamp configurations. Access resistances were continuously monitored and experiments with changes over 20% were aborted. Analyses were performed using Origin (version 8.6, Microcal, Malvern, UK) and MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Extracellular field recording</title><p>Ex vivoÂ 300âÎ¼m thick slices were prepared by sectioning uninjured and injured (11â15wpi) brains on the vibratome. The extracellular field recording was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">PeÃ§a et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, a slice was placed into recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and constantly perfused with oxygenated aCSF at room temperature at a speed of 2.0âml/min. A platinum iridium concentric bipolar electrode (FHC) was positioned on the dorsal pallium to stimulate the neurons either in uninjured control or injured slice. A borosilicate glass recording electrodes filled with 2M NaCl was placed onto the lateral or medial pallium approximately 600âÎ¼m away from the stimulating electrode. Dorsal-lateral or dorsal-medial field population spikes were elicited by delivery step depolarization (0.15 ms duration with 0.1 mA intensity at a frequency of 0.1âHz). Stable baseline response of pop spike for at least 5âmin from individual slice was ensured before moving to input-output assay. Input-output curves were determined for both the negative peak 1 (NP1; fiber volley) and pop spike amplitude by delivery of three consecutive stimulations from 0 to 1 mA with 0.1 mA increments. Recordings were performed at room temperature and data were sampled using pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium imaging</title><p>Ex vivoÂ 300âÎ¼m thick slices were prepared by sectioning uninjured and injured (11â15wpi) brains.

Once anesthesia was achieved, animals were transferred to an MRI-compatible bed where anesthesia was maintained by partial immersion in tricaine with exposed skin covered by a damp towel.</p><p>Animals were imaged using a 9.4T horizontal bore animal imaging system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA). A circular, 20âmm receive-only surface coil was placed over the head. The animals were then situated with their heads near the isocenter of the magnet within an 84âmm quadrature transmit/receive volume coil. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images were acquired using a RARE (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hennig et al., 1986</xref>). All images had RARE factor 8 and echo time TE=33 ms, and a sufficient number of slices were acquired to cover the entire brain. Sagittal images were acquired with repetition time TR=2181 ms, 1âmm slice thickness, 158 Âµm Ã 188 Âµm in-plane resolution, and 1 signal average. Axial images were acquired with TR=2000 ms, 500 Âµm slice thickness, 150 Âµm Ã 150 Âµm in-plane resolution, and 16 signal averages. Coronal images were acquired with TR=3817 ms, 500 Âµm slice thickness, 158 Âµm Ã 188 Âµm in-plane resolution, and 4 signal averages.</p><p>3D surface rendering of the MRI images were created using OsiriX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosset et al., 2004</xref>). Regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn on consecutive coronal T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images to outline the contours of the brain. The pixel values within and outside of the ROIs were changed to 65,000 and -3024, respectively. 3D surface rendering was performed with these settings: highest resolution, 100 iterations, and 1000 pixel values. The sizes of the injury were determined by manually drawing ROIs for regions that are lacking continuous closure of the ventricle. The volumes of the ROIs were calculated using the Compute Volume algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging</title><p>The brains of anesthetized axolotls were extracted and fixed in 4% PFA containing 1âmM gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) MRI contrast agent to reduce the T1 relaxation time while ensuring that enough T<sub>2</sub>-weighted signal remained. For MR image acquisition, the brains were placed in formalin. Brains were scanned on a 9.4T Bruker Biospec MR system. The pulse sequence used for image acquisition was a 3D diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence, TR=330 msec, TE=31.23 msec, number of segments 4, with an imaging matrix of 232 Ã 96 Ã 96 pixels. Spatial resolution was 50 Ã 50 Ã 50 Âµm. Sixty diffusion-weighted measurements and one non-diffusion weighted (b=0) measurement were acquired, corresponding to a cubic lattice in Q-space at b = 12,000 sec/mm<sup>2</sup> with Î´ = 12.0 msec, Î = 24.2 msec, with 8 averages. The total acquisition time was 17âhr and 11 min for each imaging session.</p><p>Diffusion Toolkit and TrackVis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trackvis.org">http://trackvis.org</ext-link>) were used to reconstruct and visualize tractography pathways. Trajectories were propagated by consistently pursuing the orientation vector of least curvature. The color-coding of tractography pathways is based on a standard RGB code, applied to the vector between the end-points of each fiber (red: left-right, green: dorsal-ventral, and blue: anterior-posterior directions). We terminated tracking when the angle between two consecutive orientation vectors was greater than the given threshold (60Â°) for each specimen. ROIs were placed at the injury site and anatomically matched region in the contralateral hemisphere. Representative 3D fiber tracts that pass through the ROIs and a single coronal plane are shown.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Simona Lodato and Hsu-Hsin Chen for insightful advice and assistance with the manuscript, members of the Arlotta and Melton laboratories for experimental support and discussions, in particular Dennis Sun and Stephanie Tsai.

In this report, the authors investigate the extent to which the brain, specifically the pallium, of the adult axolotl can regenerate its neuronal types, their tissue organization, electrical properties and connectivity in response to mechanical injury. For this, they first characterize the diversity of the neurons in the normal pallium based on the in situ expression of a set of nine molecular markers known to label pyramidal neurons or interneurons in mouse. As in mouse, these markers label neurons in a regionalized manner in the axolotl pallium implying a map-like organization of diverse, molecularly defined neuron types in the pallium.</p><p>Next, the authors study the regeneration response to injury of the dorsal pallium at the overall anatomical level, and show that a morphological &quot;wound-closure&quot; -like response takes place in the pallium before proliferation of new cells is initiated. Molecular marker studies using 4 of the previously mapped labels together with cell counts in the regenerated pallium indicate that at least a subset of the molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes in the pallium are regenerated and that their number is comparable to that of controls. Further electrophysiological studies indicate that the regenerated neurons have passive and active membrane properties and also manifest spontaneous postsynaptic currents comparable to controls. Thus in these molecular and physiological respects, the regenerated neurons resemble control neurons.</p><p>In contrast, the authors find that in terms of tissue architecture, formation of long distance projections and ability to activate target structures in the pallium, the regenerated neurons are markedly defective. Thus, the radial organization of neurons in the dorsal pallium is perturbed, molecularly defined neuronal types are mislocalized, and neuronal fibers manifest misprojection phenotypes. Moreover, long distance projections from the regenerated dorsal pallium to the olfactory bulb are strongly reduced (10% of control values) and the field population spikes in lateral and medial pallium were significantly decreased implying lack of input to these regions.</p><p>Taken together, these findings show that the extent of brain regeneration in axolotl is more limited than previously thought. Diverse neuronal types are generated and have relatively normal electrical properties. However, these newly generated neurons do not form the correct tissue architecture nor do they form the appropriate projections to other parts of the brain implying that the reformation of functional brain circuitry is strongly impaired.</p><p>These findings have been thoroughly investigated, well documented and clearly presented. They will be of great value to the field as they describe not only the extent to which regeneration can occur in a higher brain centre of a vertebrate (generation of diverse neuron types with normal electrophysiological properties), but equally importantly, also what its limitations are (inability to form functional connections).</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>The authors interpret the existence of postsynaptic currents in regenerated neurons to indicate that these neurons are integrated into local circuits. This is a clear overinterpretation. Receiving synaptic input not circuit integration. There is no evidence at all that the regenerated neurons make synaptic connections to any neurons in the brain, local or long distance. Nor is there any evidence that the synaptic input to the regenerated neurons in appropriate for any type of circuit function. The new neurons get synaptic input and that is all that the authors show. This over-interpretation should be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>It is interesting to note that the process of regeneration first involves large-scale tissue remodelling akin to 'wound repair' before cell proliferation and differentiation. The authors also show that there is no change in the numbers of cells in the lateral pallium and no cell division either. Does this process then result in re/disorganisation of the lateral pallium? Tracings from the olfactory bulb suggest that this might be the case. Could the authors please comment on this?</p><p>Have the authors at all pursued what the progenitors of the regenerating neurons might be? Are there stem cells that are reactivated upon injury? Or is there a process akin to transdifferentiation that contributes to the regeneration? These aspects could also be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13998.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Concerns:</p><p>The authors interpret the existence of postsynaptic currents in regenerated neurons to indicate that these neurons are integrated into local circuits.

Accordingly, we have now removed all claims of neuronal integration from the text, and instead, we state that the newborn neurons receive afferent inputs, which is what the data demonstrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). In addition, to strengthen our claim that the newborn neurons acquire mature electrophysiological traits, we increased the number of neurons recorded from the injured brains. The overall claim still remains the same, but now has additional statistical power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Additionally, to understand what types of receptors are involved in the synaptic transmission to the newborn neurons, we have added data that show elimination of the majority of sPSCs when treated with the AMPA receptor blocker, DNQX (now, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>It is interesting to note that the process of regeneration first involves large-scale tissue remodelling akin to 'wound repair' before cell proliferation and differentiation.

Tracings from the olfactory bulb suggest that this might be the case. Could the authors please comment on this?</p><p>This is an interesting point and we have now added new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) to answer this question. Immunohistochemistry against NeuN and Tle4, as well as in situ hybridization against <italic>Rorb</italic>, show that the topography of neurons and neuronal populations is properly organized in the injured lateral pallium at 11wpi, compared to controls (uninjured and contralateral). These results suggest that the neurons in the lateral pallium maintain the original organization, but no longer extend their axons to the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). One possible explanation for the lack of OB projections from the lateral pallium of injured (regenerated) brains is that this axonal tract may be severed upon injury to the dorsal pallium. The data thus far suggest that the wound closes first, followed by a process of amplification of cells (likely progenitors, but possibly other cell types) that occurs right at the injury side, before differentiation starts. We have now better discussed this possible model and compared it to the situation in the limb, where the wound epithelium closes and triggers generation of an underlying blastema.</p><p>Have the authors at all pursued what the progenitors of the regenerating neurons might be? Are there stem cells that are reactivated upon injury? Or is there a process akin to transdifferentiation that contributes to the regeneration? These aspects could also be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>This is a key question, and one that certainly merits investigation in future years. Ependymoglia cells with radial glia-like morphology (and progenitor plasticity) are a likely source for regenerated neurons. However, differentiated endogenous cells of other types may also play a role. Answering this question will require generation of genetically modified axolotl Cre lines that reliably label only selected cell types and thus enable lineage fate mapping/tracing. We have now directly discussed this important point in the revised manuscript, highlighting also the intriguing possibility that reprogramming of endogenous, differentiated cells types (and not only progenitors) may be a possible source, as observed, for example, in the zebrafish retina.</p></body></sub-article></article>
