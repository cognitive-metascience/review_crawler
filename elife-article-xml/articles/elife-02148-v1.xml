Contrary to the common belief that cognitive ERPs are generated by local activity within the cerebral cortex, here we show that an attention-related ERP in the frontal cortex is correlated with, and likely generated by, subcortical inputs from the basal forebrain (BF). In rats performing an auditory oddball task, both the amplitude and timing of the frontal ERP were coupled with BF neuronal activity in single trials. The local field potentials (LFPs) associated with the frontal ERP, concentrated in deep cortical layers corresponding to the zone of BF input, were similarly coupled with BF activity and consistently triggered by BF electrical stimulation within 5–10 msec. These results highlight the important and previously unrecognized role of long-range subcortical inputs from the BF in the generation of cognitive ERPs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02148.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02148.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02148.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The vertebrate nervous system coordinates an animal’s involuntary and voluntary actions, and is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body. Two different cell types, glial cells and neurons, make up the nervous system: glial cells play a metabolic or structural role, whereas neurons are responsible for physically transmitting the signals. Signals are sent quickly and precisely between neurons in the form of electrochemical waves, and it is this electrical activity that allows researchers to measure and study the communication of signals throughout the body.</p><p>At the center of the nervous system is the brain. The brain receives and integrates information from all parts of the body, and coordinates appropriate responses to various stimuli. The outermost layer of the brain, which is known as the cerebral cortex, enables an organism to perceive and interact with the world in meaningful ways, and is also responsible for the body’s movement, as well as for thought and cognition. Composed of an estimated 30 billion neurons, the cerebral cortex generates a tremendous amount of electrical activity during sensory, motor or cognitive events.</p><p>Researchers interested in evaluating brain function or assessing the level of activity in the cerebral cortex often use a non-invasive technique called electroencephalography. This technique has provided insight into the regions of the brain that process sensory and motor events, but it has been difficult to work out where cognitive events are processed. To date, most studies have tried to identify the region of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for generating the electrical activity associated with cognitive events, ignoring the possibility that other regions of the brain could play a significant role in producing this activity that is observed in the cerebral cortex.</p><p>Now Nguyen and Lin have shown that the basal forebrain, a region of the brain located beneath the cerebral cortex, is responsible for generating some of the electrical activity that happens during cognitive events. The experiments involved making measurements on rats as they performed a cognitive task. Nguyen and Lin found that a form of electrical activity called an event-related potential occurred in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex at the same time as the activity of single neurons in the basal forebrain. Stimulating neurons in the basal forebrain also resulted in an event-related potential being measured within the frontal cortex. These findings raise the possibility that the impairment of these basal forebrain neurons is involved in conditions such as Schizophrenia, ADHD and Alzheimer’s disease, and also in normal cognitive aging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02148.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02148.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>basal forebrain</kwd><kwd>event-related potential</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>motivational salience</kwd><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>David P</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Shih-Chieh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Shih-Chieh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Contrary to the common belief that cognitive event-related potentials are generated by local activity within the cerebral cortex, it is shown that some of these potentials are modulated by subcortical inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Event-related potential (ERP) represents the stereotypical response of the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity to an internal or external stimulus, and reflects reproducible and highly coherent large-scale activity patterns in the underlying cerebral cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohrbaugh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luck, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luck and Kappenman, 2012</xref>). ERPs have been widely used in both healthy and neuropsychiatric conditions as robust physiological indices of cognitive functions because the amplitudes of late ERP components are modulated by various cognitive functions including attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hillyard and Kutas, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Näätänen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schreiber et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iragui et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Polich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrmann and Knight, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caravaglios et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luck and Kappenman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the broad applications of ERP in both basic and clinical research, there remains considerable debate regarding the source mechanisms that generate cognitive ERPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snyder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miltner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascual-Marqui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luck, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riera et al., 2012</xref>). It is commonly assumed that cognitive ERPs are generated by, and therefore reflect the functions of, local activity within the cerebral cortex. However, inferring the underlying sources based on the skull surface EEG pattern, generally referred to as the ‘inverse problem’, is difficult and lacks a unique mathematical solution because the same EEG pattern can be generated by many different configurations of underlying sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmholtz, 1853</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luck, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>). For this reason, it has remained difficult to experimentally demonstrate how cognitive ERPs are generated.</p><p>While most studies have focused on identifying cortical activities responsible for generating cognitive ERPs, one neglected possibility is that subcortical inputs play a significant role. In this study, we explored an alternative hypothesis that ERPs are driven by subcortical inputs from the basal forebrain (BF), one of the major cortically-projecting neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semba, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaborszky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones, 2003</xref>). This hypothesis is motivated by recent findings that a subset of BF neurons is robustly activated by motivationally salient stimuli that attract animals’ attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson and Delong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila and Lin, 2014</xref>), and that the phasic bursting response of these BF neurons is tightly coupled with LFP activity in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2006</xref>). These discoveries led us to the hypothesis that ERPs elicited by motivationally salient stimuli are generated by the bursting response of BF neurons.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we trained rats to perform an auditory oddball task that is commonly used in human ERP studies and observed a robust ERP response in the frontal cortex that was coupled with behavioral performance. We simultaneously recorded skull surface EEG and BF single neuron activity, and investigated whether frontal ERP and BF bursting activity were correlated, in single trials, in terms of amplitude and timing. To better understand how the frontal ERP was generated, we recorded LFPs throughout all layers of frontal cortical regions, and identified the layer-specific LFP response that was coupled with the frontal ERP and BF bursting activity. Finally, we tested whether activating BF via electrical stimulation was sufficient to trigger the layer-specific LFP response in the frontal cortex. The results support that the frontal ERP is correlated with, and likely generated by, subcortical inputs from the basal forebrain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first developed a rat version of the auditory oddball task commonly used in human ERP studies, with the goal of reproducing characteristic ERP responses.

This model consists of 10 BF bursting neurons (green to red traces show the PSTHs), where the ones with stronger bursting also have earlier onset latencies. Specifically, we set the peak bursting amplitudes to range from 100 to 20 spikes per second, and the onset latency to stagger by 5 msec. The population average is shown in black. In this model, we assume that all BF bursting neurons contribute to the generation of the frontal ERP with a fixed delay of 5 msec. The contribution of individual BF bursting neurons to the frontal ERP, indicated by dashed traces, cannot be directly observed and only the summed ERP response (black) can be experimentally observed. Two example trials are shown to illustrate how the BF bursting amplitude linearly scales with the frontal ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): one with bursting amplitude set at 100% (left) to resemble a hit trial, and the other with bursting amplitude set at 50% (right) to resemble a miss or standard trial. The relative amplitude and relative timing between BF bursting neurons, and also between BF and the frontal ERP, are unaffected by the amplitude scaling. Raster plots for neuron#1 and #10 are shown below the two example trials (30 repeats each). Baseline tonic activity of BF bursting neurons is omitted for clarity. In this model, the bursting amplitudes of all BF neurons are linearly scaled with the frontal ERP amplitude. The subset of BF neurons with stronger bursting responses temporally leads the frontal ERP, while the activity of the majority of BF neurons trails the frontal ERP, even though all BF neurons causally contribute to ERP generation. This model further predicts higher magnitudes of BF-ERP cross correlation coefficient in BF neurons with stronger bursting responses, even though each of the smoothed PSTHs should be perfectly and equally correlated with the frontal ERP. This prediction arises because the higher firing rate in strongly bursting BF neurons allows the underlying spike trains to better approximate the smoothed PSTH function in single trials (e.g., neuron #1), while the stochastic spike trains provide a poor approximation of the smoothed PSTH especially when the BF bursting rate is low (e.g., neuron #10), partly because no spike was generated in a significant proportion of trials. Clearly, this model is only one of many possible models compatible with our findings. The purpose of this model is to show that our results are fully compatible with the scenario that all BF neurons causally contributes to the frontal ERP, even for the BF bursting neurons whose activity trails the frontal ERP in the cross correlation analysis. Alternatively, our results are compatible with the model that the subset of BF neurons trailing the frontal ERP may instead be driven by inputs from the frontal cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02148.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02148.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02148-fig3-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To further understand how the frontal ERP was generated, we recorded LFP activity across all cortical layers in frontal cortical regions below the EEG electrode.

These data showed that the LFP layer profiles were highly stable across sessions in the same animal, and that the same LFP layer profile was coupled with the bursting activity of different populations of BF bursting neurons. Also note that the amplitude of BF bursting was the smallest in standard trials of Rat#7, which was accompanied by an ill-defined LFP layer profile that resembled the oddball LFP layer profile the least.

The LFP layer profile was defined as the mean LFP activity in the 60 msec window around the peak of BF bursting, averaged across both oddball and standard trials.

Arrows indicate the tip of the linear probes. Note that the linear probe in Rat #4 was positioned more ventrally than the tip of the probe in the corresponding photo. This was because some of the frontal cortex sections were not recovered during histology, and therefore the linear probe was positioned at 6 mm below cortical surface according to our surgical record.

Contrary to the common belief that cognitive ERPs are generated by local activity within the cerebral cortex, we found that a frontal ERP response closely linked to behavioral performance in the auditory oddball task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is tightly coupled with BF bursting activity in single trials in terms of both amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The coupling between BF bursting and the frontal ERP remains invariant in the face of different types of stimulus (oddball vs standard) and behavioral response (hit vs miss). The frontal ERP is likely generated by the underlying layer-specific LFP response, which is similarly coupled with BF bursting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). BF electrical stimulation reproduces the key features of LFP responses in the oddball task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that the BF bursting activity is sufficient to generate and account for most of the frontal ERP response in the oddball task. The BF bursting activity therefore provides a novel neural correlate of the frontal ERP response. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that a key component of cognitive ERPs has been linked to the activity of a well-defined neuronal population located outside of the cerebral cortex. These findings highlight the important and previously unrecognized role of long-range subcortical inputs from the BF in generating cognitive ERPs.</p><p>While the strong correlation between the frontal ERP and BF bursting activity does not rule out the possibility that the observed correlation might be generated by common inputs from other un-sampled structures, our finding that the activity of strongly bursting BF neurons temporally precedes the frontal ERP by 5–10 msec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is more compatible with BF driving the frontal ERP, and less compatible with the common input hypothesis. We suggest that even the weakly bursting BF neurons whose activity trails the frontal ERP may causally contribute to the frontal ERP with a short delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Another possibility is that the subset of BF bursting neurons trailing the frontal ERP may be driven by inputs from the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaborszky et al., 1997</xref>). The hypothesis that BF bursting activity generates the frontal ERP is further supported by our finding that BF electrical stimulation triggers the same layer profile of oddball LFP responses within 5–10 msec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the same temporal delay found in the correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given the complex anatomical connection network associated with the BF region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semba, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaborszky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones, 2003</xref>), the goal of this study was not to fully dissect the causal contributions of various connection pathways. Rather, our goal was to test the specific hypothesis that the BF bursting activity alone, through the prominent projection to the frontal cortex, is sufficient to trigger and account for the oddball ERP response. While our results do not rule out the possible contribution of common inputs, our findings support the conclusion that the BF bursting activity alone is sufficient to trigger and account for most of the frontal ERP in the auditory oddball task.</p><p>Two key features of the coupling between BF bursting and the frontal ERP—the short temporal delay and the LFP layer profile concentrating in deep cortical layers—are consistent with the specific properties of BF projections to the frontal cortex. The average conduction latency of BF neurons to the frontal cortex, measured by antidromic stimulation, is less than 5 msec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reiner et al., 1987</xref>). Moreover, the fast-conducting population of cortically-projecting BF neurons (latencies 1–4 msec) are most easily activated (with lowest activation threshold) when the stimulation electrode is placed in deep cortical layers of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reiner et al., 1987</xref>). Deep cortical layers in the frontal cortex (layer V–VI) are also the predominant target layers of cortical projections from the BF, which contain more than 70% of axonal varicosities from the BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>). Among the BF axonal varicosities, the most abundant (∼50%) is the large GABAergic terminal, while cholinergic terminals from the BF are smaller and fewer (15–20%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freund and Meskenaite, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>). These specific properties of BF projection to the frontal cortex support our hypothesis that the frontal ERP is generated by BF inputs to deep cortical layers through a fast circuit mechanism.</p><p>A likely candidate to mediate the fast circuit mechanism is the non-cholinergic BF inputs because of their anatomical abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freund and Meskenaite, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gritti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>) and their fast ionotropic actions. While studies of the BF have traditionally focused on its cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Everitt and Robbins, 1997</xref>), the majority of BF corticopetal projections are non-cholinergic neurons, consisting mostly of GABAergic neurons and a smaller subset of glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gritti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>). The GABAergic BF neurons in particular preferentially innervate intracortical GABAergic interneurons and therefore may rapidly enhance cortical activity through disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freund and Meskenaite, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>). Consistent with such a suggestion, salience-encoding BF bursting neurons represent a physiologically homogeneous group of non-cholinergic BF neurons, which, unlike cholinergic BF neurons, do not change their mean firing rates between awake and sleep states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>). The widespread spatial distribution of bursting neurons throughout multiple brain regions of the BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) is also consistent with the location of cortically-projecting BF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reiner et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gritti et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, our results highlight the potential functional significance of the poorly understood non-cholinergic BF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarter and Bruno, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau and Salzman, 2008</xref>), and the importance in determining the neurochemical identity of salience-encoding BF bursting neurons. Future studies are needed to elucidate the precise nature of this ERP response, and test whether the frontal ERP reflects, as a result of BF modulation, the synchronous activation of pyramidal neuronal ensembles in the frontal cortex as commonly assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snyder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miltner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascual-Marqui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luck, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riera et al., 2012</xref>), or, alternatively, reflects the direct postsynaptic response of cortical neurons to non-cholinergic BF inputs.</p><p>The single trial coupling between BF bursting activity and the frontal ERP in the current study suggests that both neural signals are functionally homologous and reflect the motivational salience of attended stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila and Lin, 2014</xref>). In support of this view, behaviorally irrelevant stimuli presented passively to the animal elicit little response in both the BF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>) and the frontal ERP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This observation indicates that both neural signals do not reflect passive sensory processing. Instead, the BF bursting activity, and likely the frontal ERP response, reflects motivational salience irrespective of sensory modality or stimulus identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila and Lin, 2014</xref>). This motivational salience signal is highly relevant for behavioral performance, which predicts successful detection of a near-threshold sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>) as well as performance in the oddball task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It is important to point out that the relationship between BF activity and behavioral performance is more complex and involves more than the phasic bursting response that encodes motivational salience. In behavioral contexts that require inhibition, such as Nogo trials in the Go/Nogo task, BF neurons display an initial bursting response followed by a subsequent sustained inhibition, with the latter response better correlated with behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>). Future studies will need to determine the contribution of BF inhibitory responses on behavioral performance when animals need to stop or cancel a behavioral response instead of making a response to motivationally salient stimuli. It will also be important to determine whether the BF inhibitory response leads to a corresponding frontal ERP signature.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose that the main function of non-cholinergic BF neurons is to serve as a signal amplifying mechanism for motivationally salient stimuli. This amplification mechanism is needed because most sensory stimuli animals and humans encounter are behaviorally irrelevant and not processed further by the brain. For the subset of stimuli that are motivationally salient and predict important outcomes, the brain therefore requires an additional system to amplify its processing based on the motivational, but not perceptual, salience of the stimulus. The non-cholinergic BF neurons represent an ideal candidate for this amplification mechanism, which not only needs to encode the motivational salience of the attended stimulus but also needs to powerfully modulate and amplify cortical activity as fast as possible.</p><p>The current study supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that the motivational salience information encoded by BF bursting activity is transformed into the frontal ERP response with a minimum delay, which likely provides powerful modulation and amplification on the early stages of information processing. Future studies need to determine precisely how task-related single neuron activity in the frontal cortex is modulated by BF inputs and the resulting frontal ERP. Ultimately, this proposed amplification mechanism should lead to faster and better decision making. In support of this prediction, we recently showed that stronger BF motivational salience signal is quantitatively coupled with faster and more precise decision speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila and Lin, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The findings in this study likely can be extended to primates because BF neurons with bursting responses to motivationally salient stimuli are similarly found in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeLong, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilson and Rolls, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson and Delong, 1991</xref>), and BF electrical stimulation in monkeys similarly triggers LFP responses in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson and Fetz, 2012</xref>). Despite the many differences in rodent and human ERP studies (such as species, the use of primary reward and punishment in rodents but not in humans, the choice of electrical reference, etc), the major ERP components are broadly similar in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamaguchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ehlers et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shinba, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sambeth et al., 2003</xref>). The rodent frontal ERP described in this study is most similar to the processing negativity or Nd ERP component in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen and Hillyard, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Näätänen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Näätänen et al., 1987</xref>) because both the rodent frontal ERP and the human processing negativity responses share several features—negative polarity of the ERP, early timing in the N1 ERP window, spatial distribution centered on the frontal cortex, as well as reflecting motivational salience or selective attention toward the stimulus. Further studies are needed to establish the functional homology between the rodent and human frontal ERP components, and determine the potential role of non-cholinergic BF neurons in selective attention in humans.</p><p>An important implication of this study is that rodent ERPs may serve as a unique translational platform to bridge the human ERP literature and the neurophysiology literature in animal models. Studies in rodent models may provide unique mechanistic insights that can inform human ERP studies. For example, localizing the sources of human ERP responses, that is solving the ‘inverse problem’, requires assumptions about the number and spatial distribution of underlying sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pascual-Marqui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luck, 2005b</xref>). Our results suggest that, at least in the case of the frontal ERP component, the underlying source may reflect the anatomical projection pattern of the salience-encoding BF neurons, which project extensively to broad regions of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gritti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zaborszky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henny and Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>). Our results also raise the novel hypothesis that the decline of frontal ERP amplitude and associated cognitive functions in conditions such as schizophrenia, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schreiber et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iragui et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Polich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caravaglios et al., 2008</xref>) may result from the functional impairment of the poorly understood non-cholinergic basal forebrain system or a dysfunctional BF-cortical interaction. These results also suggest that the increasing use of deep brain stimulation of the BF to ameliorate dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hescham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salma et al., 2014</xref>) may be mediated in part by activating non-cholinergic BF neurons and perhaps compensating for their functional impairment in these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eight male Long Evans rats (Charles River, NC), aged 3–6 months and weighing 300–400 grams at the start of the experiment, were used for this experiment.

Each chamber was equipped with one photo-beam lickometer reward port (CT-ENV-251L-P) located in the center of the front panel, with its sipper tube 7.5 cm above the grid floor. Two infrared (IR) sensors were positioned to detect reward port entry and sipper tube licking, respectively. Water reward was delivered through a custom-built multi-barrel sipper tube. The delivery system was controlled by pressurized air (2.6 psi) and each solenoid opening (10 msec) was calibrated to deliver a 10 μl drop of water. The reward port was flanked by two nosepoke ports (ENV-114M), located 6.6 cm to each side and 5.9 cm above the grid floor.

If the rat licked outside the 3 s reward window (false alarm), the ITI timer was reset.

The time between stimulus presentations was 2 s, and the number of standards that were presented in between oddball tones was uniformly drawn from 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, corresponding to 6–14 s ITI between oddball tones. When the oddball tone was presented, the rules for receiving reward were the same as that for the tone-reward association task. False alarms during the oddball task reset the ITI timer. Correct behavioral response to the oddball tone (hit) led to reward delivery, as well as a temporary cessation of any tone presentation and the ITI timer until the end of reward consumption.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of the BRE, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Howard Eichenbaum (Reviewing editor); Geoffrey Schoenbaum and Ben Hayden (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study Nguyen and Lin use an auditory oddball task to study a new question: what is the source of the ERP signal? While conventional theories hold that it likely derives from local cortical processing, there's not a lot of strong evidence in favor of this hypothesis. Nguyen and Lin favor an alternative: the ERP depends on inputs from the basal forebrain bundle, a structure whose responses have previously been shown to encode salience. The signals are temporally and functionally linked to non-cholinergic BF neurons that encode salience.</p><p>In the current study, the authors report correlations between BF neuron firing and frontal ERP and LFP's recorded in rats performing an oddball discrimination task. Rats had to discriminate an oddball tone from an ongoing sequence in order to know when to lick to receive a fluid reward. The authors show that successful responding to the oddball tone was associated with bursting in BF neurons and with a frontal ERP. Further they show that the BF bursting was correlated with and led the frontal ERP and subsequent LFP recordings. Further, electrical activation of BF in both awake and anesthetized rats was sufficient to reproduce a similar LFP response. The authors argue that these data challenge the assumption that ERP measures reflect local processing.</p><p>The reviewers concluded that this is a strong paper, well supported and well argued. The experiments are convincing and well done. At the same time, the reviewers had some recommendations for improvement that should be addressed:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>My general issue with the interpretation is that it is unclear to me that the results necessarily challenge at least a weak version of the hypothesis that ERP's and LFP's reflect local processing or functions. In other words, while they certainly show that these measures are influenced by or can be affected by large-scale afferent input, it seems to me that this is not necessary a shocking result. In fact to some extent this would be as expected I think – that any manipulation that altered the frontal networks in significant ways might impact these measures, even if they reflect local processing. To the extent that this is the first demonstration of such a thing, I think it is significant. And as the authors point out, this has implications for how diseases affecting BF and subcortical areas might impact prefrontal processing. But I think the black and white assertion that the authors make is unnecessary and a bit of a straw man. It is not a surprise that subcortical systems affect processing in the cortical mantle. In fact this is what such inputs are supposed to do – the real question – and perhaps a logical next step to suggest is how they affect the processing. What local information processing or function is specifically lost when BF does not burst?</p><p>To assess this, it would be necessary to do two things that the authors did not do. The first would be to eliminate the bursting instead of inducing it. Generally I think this is more effective since it shows that the function requires the input. Though I think it is unlikely here, it is possible that activation is causing something that does not normally occur. And the second would be to relate the manipulation to behavior. Even in the context of the current report, this would have been terrific – does artificial activation of the BF neurons facilitate correct hits? Or does inhibition cause misses?</p><p>Lastly I wish the authors had reversed their task. As it stands, I am somewhat concerned that the electrical activity is only observed when the animal makes a motor response – licking. I assume the authors think it reflects a function – recognizing the oddball tone and redirecting behavior generally. But what is the evidence of this? Would it be the same if the rat had to stop licking at the oddball tone? Some discussion of this would be helpful.</p><p>No further experiments are needed here, but the results should be framed in a way to acknowledge these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>I only had one major comment and this is with how the paper is framed. The authors describe two competing hypotheses, that ERP is generated by local cortical processing and that it is generated by BF neurons. But I don't think these hypotheses are in conflict. It seems that ERP may be derived from local processing that is in turn driven by BF firing. Indeed, the authors seem to acknowledge this when they say that “our results support the alternative hypothesis that some ERP components reflect how CC is modulated by subcortical inputs. ” Which seems like an acknowledgement that both may be right. It seems that their data cannot answer the question they ask: do ERPs come from BF or from CC? Instead they answer a different (and also very important) question, what is it that ultimately drives the ERP? And the answer is “salience signals in BF” although they may do so through changing cortical targets. I still think these results are nonetheless important; I just think they should be framed differently.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02148.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>My general issue with the interpretation is that it is unclear to me that the results necessarily challenge at least a weak version of the hypothesis that ERP's and LFP's reflect local processing or functions.

The current study was not able to address this issue because the multi-site linear probe was not able to record single unit activity in the frontal cortex after it had been chronically implanted and remained in the same position after two weeks post-implant.</p><p><italic>To assess this, it would be necessary to do two things that the authors did not do.

Though I think it is unlikely here, it is possible that activation is causing something that does not normally occur</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that selective inhibition of BF bursting under behavioral contexts will provide a stronger support of our hypothesis. A suitable technique to achieve this goal is optogenetics, which provides the required spatial and temporal resolution to transiently inhibit BF neurons in behavioral contexts. Because of the anatomical heterogeneity in the BF region that contains three major corticopetal projection populations, we had chosen to develop optogenetic approaches in a separate study using transgenic mice instead of rats. Using transgenic mice will allow us to determine the neurochemical identity of salience-encoding BF neurons, as well as providing the necessary tools to selectively manipulate the activity in subsets of BF neurons.</p><p><italic>And the second would be to relate the manipulation to behavior. Even in the context of the current report, this would have been terrific</italic> – <italic>does artificial activation of the BF neurons facilitate correct hits? Or does inhibition cause misses</italic>?</p><p>While the BF motivational salience signal is highly relevant for behavioral performance, which predicts successful detection of a near-threshold sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>) as well as performance in the oddball task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the relationship between BF activity and behavioral performance is more complex and involves more than the phasic bursting response that encodes motivational salience. For example, in behavioral contexts that require inhibition, such as Nogo trials in the Go/Nogo task, BF neurons display an initial bursting response followed by a subsequent sustained inhibition, with the latter response better correlated with behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Nicolelis, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Because of the complex dynamics of both bursting and inhibitory responses in the BF, we did not attempt to manipulate the behavioral performance in the current study using the non-selective electrical stimulation technique. However, in a related study that does not involve behavioral inhibition, BF electrical stimulation that augments the strength of BF bursting leads to faster and more precise reaction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avila and Lin, 2014</xref>). We will revisit this issue of manipulating BF activity in behavioral contexts in future studies using optogenetic approaches that can bidirectionally manipulate the activity of selected BF neurons.</p><p><italic>Lastly I wish the authors had reversed their task.

Would it be the same if the rat had to stop licking at the oddball tone? Some discussion of this would be helpful</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important and unresolved question, especially considering the potential role of BF inhibitory responses and its association with Nogo responses discussed earlier. Future studies will need to determine the contribution of BF inhibitory responses on behavioral performance when animals need to stop or cancel a behavioral response instead of making a response to motivationally salient stimuli. It will also be important to determine whether the BF inhibitory response leads to a corresponding frontal ERP signature.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>I only had one major comment and this is with how the paper is framed.
