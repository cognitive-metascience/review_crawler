The axon/myelin-unit becomes impaired in myelin-related disorders and upon normal aging. However, the molecular cause of many pathological features, including the frequently observed myelin outfoldings, remained unknown. Using label-free quantitative proteomics, we find that the presence of myelin outfoldings correlates with a loss of cytoskeletal septins in myelin. Regulated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-levels, myelin septins (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-adaptor anillin form previously unrecognized filaments that extend longitudinally along myelinated axons. By confocal microscopy and immunogold-electron microscopy, these filaments are localized to the non-compacted adaxonal myelin compartment. Genetic disruption of these filaments in <italic>Sept8</italic>-mutant mice causes myelin outfoldings as a very specific neuropathology. Septin filaments thus serve an important function in scaffolding the axon/myelin-unit, evidently a late stage of myelin maturation. We propose that pathological or aging-associated diminishment of the septin/anillin-scaffold causes myelin outfoldings that impair the normal nerve conduction velocity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17119.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17119.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17119.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Normal communication within the brain or between the brain and other parts of the body requires information to flow quickly around the nervous system. This information travels along nerve cells in the form of electrical signals. To speed up the signals, a part of the nerve cell called the axon is frequently wrapped in an electrically insulating sheath made up of a membrane structure called myelin.</p><p>The myelin sheath becomes impaired as a result of disease or ageing. In order to understand what might produce these changes, Patzig et al. have used biochemical and microscopy techniques to study mice that had similar defects in their myelin sheaths.</p><p>The study reveals that forming a normal myelin sheath around an axon requires a newly identified ‘scaffold’ made of a group of proteins called the septins. Combining with another protein called anillin, septins assemble into filaments in the myelin sheath. These filaments then knit together into a scaffold that grows lengthways along the myelin-wrapped axon. Without this scaffold, the myelin sheath grew defects known as outfoldings. Axons transmitted electrical signals much more slowly than normal when the septin scaffold was missing from the myelin sheath.</p><p>Future studies are needed to understand the factors that control how the septin scaffold forms. This could help to reveal ways of reversing the changes that alter the myelin sheath during ageing and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17119.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17119.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>glial cells</kwd><kwd>myelinated axons</kwd><kwd>neuropathology</kwd><kwd>myelin structure</kwd><kwd>label-free proteomics</kwd><kwd>septin cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-125210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaeren-Wiemers</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-141185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaeren-Wiemers</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nave</surname><given-names>Klaus-Armin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE2720/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Werner</surname><given-names>Hauke B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly identified component in the architecture of the axon/myelin-unit – the septin/anillin scaffold – maintains the structure of myelin in the central nervous system, thereby preventing myelin outfoldings.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fast nerve conduction is crucial for normal motor, sensory, and cognitive abilities. In vertebrates, rapid (‘saltatory‘) signal propagation is achieved by the myelination of axons. Myelination is largely completed before adulthood, notwithstanding that adult-born oligodendrocytes can assemble new myelin sheaths throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). Yet, myelin is one of the most long-lived structures in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>). With age however, the abundance and dynamics of CNS myelin decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lasiene et al., 2009</xref>) while there is an increase in the frequency of pathological redundant myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peters, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sturrock, 1976</xref>), i.e., local outfoldings of compact myelin with normal-appearing axo-myelinic interface. These myelin outfoldings emerge from the innermost, adaxonal myelin layer, a part of the non-compacted, cytoplasmic channel system through myelin. This compartment of myelin has previously been implicated in glia-axonal metabolic coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). Analogous focal outfoldings of peripheral myelin are the pathological hallmark of tomaculous neuropathies affecting the PNS. The normal structure of myelin thus requires stabilization, which can fail upon normal aging and in myelin-related disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms that might prevent myelin outfoldings have remained unknown.</p><p>A striking variety of myelin-related genes causes – when mutated in human disorders and in animal models - common pathological features including axonopathy, neuroinflammation, hypomyelination, and structural impairments affecting myelin. For example, abundant constituents of CNS myelin such as proteolipid protein (PLP), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP), and myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), are not essential for the biogenesis of myelin per se but their deficiency in mice causes complex CNS pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edgar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montag et al., 1994</xref>). The neuropathological profiles observed in these and other myelin mutants are highly overlapping, which has made it difficult to explain distinct aspects of neuropathology by the loss of individual structural myelin proteins. Here, we followed the hypothesis that mutations of single genes can have secondary consequences for the entire protein composition of myelin, which allow elucidating the molecular cause of distinct neuropathological features.</p><p>We report the discovery of a previously unrecognized filamentous scaffold in the innermost layer of CNS myelin that extends longitudinally along myelinated axons. This filament is composed of distinct septin monomers (SEPT2/SEPT4/SEPT7/SEPT8) and associated with the adaptor protein anillin (ANLN). The formation of myelin septin filaments is a late stage of myelin maturation, thereby avoiding that the property of septins to rigidify the membranes they are associated with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tooley et al., 2009</xref>) could hinder the normal developmental ensheathment of axons. Importantly, this sub-membranous septin/anillin-scaffold (SAS) is required for the normal structure of the axon/myelin unit in vivo as its deficiency causes a specific structural impairment of the myelin sheath, myelin outfoldings, and reduced nerve conduction velocity. These findings were possible by systematic label-free myelin proteome analysis in several models of complex neuropathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuropathology and myelin proteome analysis in myelin mutants</title><p>By quantitative evaluation of electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), hypomyelination was a significant feature in <italic>Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic> and <italic>Mag<sup>null</sup></italic> mice, swellings of the inner tongue of myelin in <italic>Mag<sup>null</sup></italic> and <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup></italic> mice, axonal spheroids in <italic>Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic> mice, and degenerated axons in <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup></italic> mice.

Indeed, myelin outfoldings were evident 18 weeks pti according to electron microscopic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

While it is plausible that myelin outfoldings impede current flow along myelinated fibre tracts, we cannot formally rule out that unidentified secondary effects also contribute to decelerated conduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Myelin outfoldings are frequently observed during developmental myelination, and these membranes have been interpreted as a reservoir for the elongation of axon/myelin-units during body growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cullen and Webster, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenbluth, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). Our data reveal that the assembly of septin filaments is a late stage of myelin maturation. By forming a scaffold underlying the innermost membrane layer of compact myelin, septins prevent outfoldings of the entire stack of compact myelin layers in the adult CNS. Septin filaments assemble by associating with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bridges et al., 2014</xref>) involving the interactions of particular septin monomers and the adaptor protein anillin with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>), a recruitment mechanism conserved between the yeast cleavage furrow and mammalian myelin. As submembraneous filaments, septins can provide structure and rigidity to the membranes they are associated with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spiliotis and Gladfelter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tooley et al., 2009</xref>). The adaxonal myelin compartment is regularly spaced, and the cytoplasmic surfaces of the flanking membranes are in close proximity but not compacted. Adaxonal myelin differs from compact myelin by lacking MBP and instead containing oligodendroglial cytoplasm. In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), the septin/anillin scaffold stabilizes compact myelin by associating with its innermost membrane surface. This architecture counteracts hydrostatic pressure and lateral membrane flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilden and Krummel, 2010</xref>), which in the absence of adhesive forces would push compact myelin outward, e.g. as a consequence of the net growth of individual myelin membranes or the slow but lifelong intercalation of new myelin segments between existing sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Young et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>High PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>-levels trigger the active net growth of myelin sheaths and thus myelin thickness via the Akt/mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macklin, 2010</xref>) whereas high PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-levels are required to recruit the septin/anillin-scaffold of myelin. Loss of septins in the myelin sheath is likely owing to dysregulated filament assembly or stability, which in addition to membrane-phosphoinositides and ANLN may also involve other regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joberty et al., 2001</xref>). Several mechanisms are thus feasible how mutations affecting structural myelin proteins may cause the post-transcriptional decrease of septins. For example, PLP is required for a normal myelin lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Werner et al., 2013</xref>) and CNP prevents premature closure of the cytoplasmic channels through myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>), which probably provide transport routes for molecules and vesicles into the adaxonal myelin layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). It is plausible that both phenomena may directly or indirectly affect the septin/anillin-scaffold that prevents the formation of myelin outfoldings.</p><p>The axon/myelin-unit comprises various stabilizing molecules. Recently, a cytoskeletal actin/spectrin-lattice has been discovered that underlies the axonal membrane along its entire length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, neuronal and glial Ig-CAMs interact along the axon-myelin interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinter et al., 2012</xref>). We note that at the sites of pathological myelin outfoldings, the axo-myelinic membrane apposition is not disrupted. However, the lack of myelin septins causes the entire stack of compacted myelin to focally detach from the adaxonal oligodendroglial membrane and to ‘fold out‘. This reflects strong adhesive forces between adjacent layers of compact myelin mediated by myelin proteins such as MBP. The non-compact compartments of myelin are considered as cytoplasmic routes enabling the axon-supportive function of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). We conclude that the septin/anillin-scaffold reported here stabilizes mature CNS myelin while allowing diffusion and transport processes in the non-compact adaxonal myelin layer to take place.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p><italic>Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic>, <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup>, Mag<sup>null</sup></italic>, and <italic>Pten<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Cnp<sup>Cre/WT</sup></italic> mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klugmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Montag et al., 1994</xref>).

Kinoshita, 1:50), SEPT7 (IBL18991, 1:50), or MAG (Chemicon MAB1567, 1:50). To quantitatively assess the exact protein localization within the adaxonal non-compact myelin layer, all gold particles located to this compartment on the micrographs (a minimum of 200 gold particles per animal) were assigned to one of two categories as schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H'</xref>: associated with the innermost membrane layer of compact myelin (type 1) or associated with the adaxonal myelin membrane (type 2).</p><p>Preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy by high pressure freezing and freeze substitution was performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Möbius et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, optic nerves were dissected and placed into aluminum specimen carriers with an indentation of 0.2 mm. The remaining space was covered with 20% PVP (Sigma) in PBS, and the sample was cryofixed using a HPM100 high-pressure freezer (Leica). Freeze substitution was carried out in a Leica AFS (Leica, Vienna, Austria) as follows: samples were initially kept in tannic acid (0.1% in acetone) at −90°C for 100 hr, washed with acetone (4 × 30 min, −90°C) and then transferred into OsO<sub>4</sub> (EMS; 2%) and uranyl acetate (SPI Chem, 0.1%) in acetone at −90°C. The temperature was raised from −90 to −20°C in increments of 5°C/hr, then kept unaltered at −20°C for 16 hr, and then raised to +4°C in increments of 10°C/hr. The samples were then washed with acetone (3 × 30 min at 4°C), allowed to adjust to room temperature, and finally transferred into Epon (Serva) (25%, 50%, and 75% Epon in acetone for 1–2 hr each, 90% Epon in acetone for 18 hr, 100% Epon for 4 hr). The samples were placed in an embedding mold and polymerized (60°C, 24 hr). Preparation of samples for transmission electron microscopy by conventional aldehyde fixation was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Möbius et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, mice were perfused with 2,5% glutaraldehyde and 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffer containing 0.5% NaCl. Spinal cord samples, optic nerves, and brain samples were postfixed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and embedded in epoxy resin (Serva). Ultrathin sections (50 nm) were cut using a Leica Ultracut S ultramicrotome (Leica) and contrasted with an aqueous solution of 4% uranyl acetate (SPI Chem) followed by lead citrate. The samples were examined in a LEO 912AB Omega transmission electron microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken with an on-axis 2048 × 2048-CCD-camera (TRS).</p><p>For assessment of pathology, mice were analyzed at postnatal day 75 (P75) unless indicated otherwise; 3–6 male mice were used per genotype and age. 10–15 randomly selected, non-overlapping images were taken per optic nerve at 7000 × magnification (1 field=220 µm). Electron micrographs were analyzed using ImageJ (Fiji). To quantify axonal pathology and the proportion of nonmyelinated axons, all axons on the micrographs (a minimum of 700 axons per animal) were assigned to one of five categories: healthy-appearing myelinated axons, healthy-appearing nonmyelinated axons, axons with myelin comprising a swollen adaxonal compartment (inner tongue), axonal spheroids, and degenerated axons. Axons were counted as myelinated if ensheathed by at least one complete layer of compacted myelin. Axonal changes were identified by mild signs of pathology including invaginations of adaxonal myelin membrane into the axon. Degenerated axons were identified by tubovesicular structures and amorphous cytoplasm. The area occupied by myelin outfoldings was quantified by a point counting method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edgar et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, a regular grid of 0.25 µm<sup>2</sup> was placed on the images. The number of intercepts coinciding with myelin outfoldings was related to the evaluated area. When quantifying myelinated axons, axonal pathology, axonal diameters, and myelin outfoldings, to compare <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup></italic>, <italic>Mag<sup>null</sup></italic>, and <italic>Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic> mice with WT mice significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6.0. To compare SEPT8 mutant mice with WT littermates, significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 6.0. The g-ratio was calculated as the ratio between the axonal Feret diameter and the Feret diameter of the corresponding myelin sheath. To determine g-ratios, a regular grid was placed on the images for randomization. All axons crossed by the grating were assessed, yielding a minimum of 100 myelinated axons per animal. The g-ratio was assessed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. All quantifications were performed blinded to the genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemistry to determine neuropathology on sections of paraffin-embedded brains and spinal cords was essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Monasterio-Schrader et al., 2013</xref>).

Mice were 12 months old; sections from 4–6 male mice per genotype including the mean of both fimbriae were quantified. To quantify white matter area immunopositive for MAC3 or GFAP, the hippocampal fimbria was selected and analyzed using an ImageJ plugin for semiautomated analysis.

Blocking solution contained 10% horse serum, 0.5% triton X-100, and 1% BSA in PBS. Antibodies were specific for SEPT7 (IBL18991; 1:1000), SEPT8 (ProteinTech Group 11769-1-AP; 1:500), ANLN (Acris AP16165PU-N; 1:200), TUJ1 (Covance; 1:1000), neurofilament (SMI31; Covance; 1:1500), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG 513; Chemicon; 1:50), voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1,6 (alomonelabs; 1:500), or contactin-associated protein (CASPR; Neuromabs; 1:500). Secondary antibodies were donkey α-rabbit-Alexa488 (dianova), donkey α-goat-Cy3 (dianova), and donkey α-mouse Dyelight633 (Yo-Pro). Images were obtained by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5). The signal was collected sequentially with the objective HCX PL APO CS 63.0 × 1.30 GLYC 21°C UV. An argon laser with the excitation of 488 nm was used to excite the Alexa488 fluorophore, and the emission was set to 500–573 nm. The laser DPSS 561 was used to excite the Cy3 fluorophore, and the emission was set to 573–630 nm. The HeNe laser 633 was used to excite Dyelight633, and emission was detected between 645–738 nm. DAPI was excited with 405 nm and collected between 417–480 nm. The LAS AF lite and Fiji were used to export the images as tif-files. Imaris was used for 3D-reconstructions.</p><p>The number of SEPT8-puncta (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) was determined using Fiji.

SEPT8-punctae per myelinated axon as identified by the MAG-immunopositive ring were counted in WT at P75 (n=4 animals, 1 section each). Per animal, 6 random confocal micrographs of spinal cord white matter with a size of 2500 µm<sup>2</sup> per micrograph were quantified, yielding about 100 axons per animal. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0. For the quantifications of nodal density, the frequency of occurrence of two CASPR-immunopositive paranodes was analyzed using Fiji. CASPR-immunopositivity was converted using a threshold and counted using ITNC plugin (n=3 animals per genotype, 1 section each, 8 random confocal micrographs of spinal cord white matter with a size of 2500 µm<sup>2</sup> per micrograph).

For immunoblot analyses of myelin during development and aging, male wild-type (C57Bl/6N) mice of the indicated ages were used. For proteome or immunoblot analyses of mutant mice and their respective wild-type littermates, male mice at the age of 75 days were used. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (BioRad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Proteome analysis</title><p>Differential quantitative myelin proteome analyses were based on previously described label-free, gel-free procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Distler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jahn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patzig et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, brains were dissected from three male <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup>, Mag<sup>null</sup>, Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic>, or <italic>Sept8<sup>null/null</sup></italic> mice at the age of 75 days and three respective control littermates, and myelin was biochemically purified (see above). Per sample, 25 µg of total myelin protein was precipitated using the ProteoExtract Protein Precipitation Kit (Calbiochem), solubilized in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> with 0.1% Rapigest (Waters) (10 min, 85°C), reduced with 5 mM DTT (45 min, 56°C), and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide (45 min, room temperature) in the dark. Solubilized proteins were digested with 0.5 µg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 16 hr (37°C). After digestion, Rapigest was hydrolyzed by adding 10 mM HCl, the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (13,000 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial. Data for the analysis of myelin purified from <italic>Cnp<sup>null</sup>, Plp1<sup>null</sup></italic>, and <italic>Sept8<sup>nul/nulll</sup></italic> mice and the respective littermate controls were obtained using separation of tryptic peptides by nanoscale ultraperformance liquid chromatography (nanoUPLC) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) Premier mass spectrometer (Waters) with an alternating low and elevated (E) energy mode of acquisition (MS<sup>E</sup>) (UPLC-MS<sup>E</sup>). Data for the analysis of myelin purified from <italic>Mag<sup>null</sup></italic> mice and littermate controls were obtained using a Synapt G2S mass spectrometer (Waters). For each biological replicate, 2–4 technical replicates were measured. The continuum LC-MS<sup>E</sup> data were processed and searched using the IDENTITYE-algorithm of ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) version 2.3 (Waters). Protein identifications were assigned by searching the Uni-ProtKB/Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledgebase Release 52.3 for mouse proteins (12,920 entries) supplemented with known possible contaminants (porcine trypsin, human keratins) using the precursor and fragmentation data afforded by LC-MS acquisition as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patzig et al., 2011</xref>). Mass tolerances for peptide and fragment ions were set at 15 and 30 ppm, respectively. Peptide identifications were restricted to tryptic peptides with no more than one missed cleavage. Carboxyamidomethylation of Cys was set as fixed modification, and oxidation of Met, acetylation of protein N termini, and deamidation of Asn and Gln were searched as variable modifications. For a valid protein identification, the following criteria had to be met: at least two peptides detected together with at least seven fragments. The false-positive rate for protein identification was set to 1% based on search of a 5x randomized database, which was generated automatically using PLGS 2.3 by reversing the sequence of each entry. By using the replication rate as a filter, the false-positive rate was further minimized, as false-positive identifications do not tend to replicate across injections due to their random nature. By requiring a protein identification to be made in at least three technical replicates, the effective false-positive rate was lowered to &lt;0.2%. For label-free absolute quantification of protein abundance by mass spectrometry based on the TOP3-method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Silva et al., 2006</xref>), data were post-processed using ISOQuant software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Distler et al., 2014</xref>).

After cannulation of the jugular vein, anesthesia was continued with 40–60 mg methohexital per kg and hour. Tracheotomy was performed, and a tube for artificial ventilation was inserted. Active respiratory movements were abolished by paralysis with pancuronium (800 µg per kg supplemented i.p. every hour) and artificial ventilation with a gas mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> (2.5%), O<sub>2</sub> (47.5%), and N<sub>2</sub> (50%) at 120 strokes/min (100–160 µl/stroke depending on the body weight). The vertebral column was rigidly fixed with two custom-made clamps. Electrocardiograms were monitored throughout. Changes of heart rate and temperature were used to control the anaesthetic state. Blood O<sub>2</sub> saturation was monitored by a sensor in the inguinal region (MouseOx system, Starr Live Sciences Corp.). Laminectomy was performed from vertebrae TH13 to L5 to expose spinal cord segments L1-L4 and dorsal roots L3-L5. For electrophysiology, the spinal cord was covered with mineral oil. Stimulation and recording were performed with bipolar platinum electrodes. Rectangular constant voltage pulses were used with a duration of 0.1 ms to stimulate dorsal root L4. Supramaximal stimulation strength of 5T was used, which is 5 times the electrical threshold for the lowest threshold fibres (T=threshold; thresholds were frequently tested and adjusted during the experiment). Recording was performed with a sampling rate of 50 kHz on the ipsilateral fasciculus gracilis at spinal cord level L1. The signal was appropriately pre-amplified and filtered. At the end of the experiment, the distance between the stimulation electrode (cathode) and the recording electrode was measured in situ by using a thin cotton thread.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Kinoshita, C Linington, K-I Nagata, and W Trimble for antibodies, U Suter for mice, M Schindler for blastocyst injection, A Fahrenholz, R Jung, and T Ruhwedel for technical assistance, J Ficner for help with graphics, ED Schomburg for help with electrophysiology, and C ffrench-Constant, O Jahn, and members of our department for discussions. <italic>Plp<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> </italic>mice have been used in collaboration with U Suter.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Septin/anillin filaments scaffold CNS myelin to accelerate nerve conduction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: David Lyons (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and important paper that identifies a novel role of associated septin/anillin filaments in scaffolding the axon/myelin unit in late stages of myelination. Genetic disruption of Sept8 resulted in myelin outfoldings that have been observed in myelin related disorders and aging. The data are compelling and well presented and represent a significant advance for the myelin field and more broadly. The reviewers did not have substantive suggestions for additional experiments. Both raised a few questions and points for clarification that should included in the discussion of the revised manuscript. Once these and minor comments are addressed, this paper will make a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors perform a proteomic comparison among myelin mutants that have a common phenotype: myelin outfoldings. Amazingly, they identify as a common feature the reduction in septins. They demonstrate this reduction by quantitative mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. They then demonstrate through confocal microscopy and electron microscopy that septins form a filamentous structure that lines the adaxonal membrane of myelin. The septins also form a putative complex with Anillin, and the authors show that this protein colocalizes with septins and is dramatically reduced in the myelin mutants with outfoldings. Consistent with the idea that septin-anillin-phosphoinositide interactions are important, they show that <italic>Pten</italic> cKO mice have dramatic reductions in septins and anillin, and strikingly also have myelin outfoldings. Finally, the authors generate a septin8 conditional knockout and show that by removing septin8 from myelinating oligodendrocytes this results in myelin outfoldings and reduced nerve conduction velocity. These experiments may also explain myelin changes in aging since aged mice also have outfoldings and reduced levels of septins.</p><p>Overall I thought the data were excellent and very compelling. I enjoyed reading the paper and think it is a very nice story. I have only one major comment: it is not clear to me why septins form filaments along the axon.

Amazingly, they identify as a common feature the reduction in septins. They demonstrate this reduction by quantitative mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. They then demonstrate through confocal microscopy and electron microscopy that septins form a filamentous structure that lines the adaxonal membrane of myelin. The septins also form a putative complex with Anillin, and the authors show that this protein colocalizes with septins and is dramatically reduced in the myelin mutants with outfoldings. Consistent with the idea that septin-anillin-phosphoinositide interactions are important, they show that Pten cKO mice have dramatic reductions in septins and anillin, and strikingly also have myelin outfoldings. Finally, the authors generate a septin8 conditional knockout and show that by removing septin8 from myelinating oligodendrocytes this results in myelin outfoldings and reduced nerve conduction velocity. These experiments may also explain myelin changes in aging since aged mice also have outfoldings and reduced levels of septins.</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall I thought the data were excellent and very compelling. I enjoyed reading the paper and think it is a very nice story. I have only one major comment: it is not clear to me why septins form filaments along the axon. Is the idea that the septins provide structural support for adaxonal cytoplasmic channels that might be a 'weak-link' in the structure? If not, why are the septins not evenly distributed around the myelin sheath along the adaxonal membrane? Perhaps this could be clarified. In any case, I think this is a great paper and appropriate for ELife.</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer’s wording of the conclusion that ‘the septins provide structural support ‘in the adaxonal non-compacted myelin layer (‘cytoplasmic channels‘) that ‘might be a 'weak-link' in the structure‘. Indeed, we speculate that an ‘even distribution (of septins) along the myelin sheath ‘may hinder diffusion and transport processes through non-compacted myelin.</p><p>In response we have re-checked if this aspect is sufficiently visibly covered in our manuscript. We find that this aspect is already stated visibly, including in the last sentence of our Discussion section. We have thus not changed the manuscript in response to this comment. If the reviewer or editor would further specify what more precisely she/he recommends clarifying here, we will be glad to implement that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Patzig et al. submit &quot;Septin/anillin filaments scaffold CNS myelin to accelerate nerve conduction&quot; for consideration at eLife.
