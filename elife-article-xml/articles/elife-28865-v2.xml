complex molecular apparatus which physically divides many eukaryotic cells. Despite knowledge of its protein composition, the molecular architecture of the ring is not known. Here we have applied super-resolution microscopy and FRET to determine the nanoscale spatial organization of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> contractile ring components relative to the plasma membrane. Similar to other membrane-tethered actin structures, we find proteins localize in specific layers relative to the membrane. The most membrane-proximal layer (0–80 nm) is composed of membrane-binding scaffolds, formin, and the tail of the essential myosin-II. An intermediate layer (80–160 nm) consists of a network of cytokinesis accessory proteins as well as multiple signaling components which influence cell division. Farthest from the membrane (160–350 nm) we find F-actin, the motor domains of myosins, and a major F-actin crosslinker. Circumferentially within the ring, multiple proteins proximal to the membrane form clusters of different sizes, while components farther from the membrane are uniformly distributed. This comprehensive organizational map provides a framework for understanding contractile ring function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Kathleen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Nathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Super-resolution microscopy reveals the nanoscale molecular architecture of 29 protein components of a eukaryotic contractile ring relative to the membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In many eukaryotes, including animals and fungi, cell division is accomplished by an actin- and myosin-based contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 2012</xref>). This complex structure is tightly linked to the plasma membrane and uses myosin motors to constrict an F-actin ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheffings et al., 2016</xref>), pulling opposing sides of the membrane together.</p><p>Studies in <italic>S. pombe</italic> have led the cytokinesis field in identifying components and regulators of the contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheffings et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pollard and Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rincon and Paoletti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Willet et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goyal et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic screens as well as genome-wide and targeted localization studies have determined a complete ‘parts list’ of protein components that comprise the ring, many of which are conserved in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nurse et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramanian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuyama et al., 2006</xref>). 318 proteins are annotated as localizing to the <italic>S. pombe</italic> division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wood et al., 2012</xref>), which includes both the contractile ring and the lining of the division septum formed during ring constriction. Only a subset of these proteins (38 according to PomBase annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wood et al., 2012</xref>]) make up the contractile ring itself.</p><p>Though the proteins that comprise the contractile ring have been identified, how these components are knit together into a functional division machine remains unclear despite several substantive efforts towards unraveling this complex question. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> contractile ring forms in the middle of the cell from precursor ‘nodes’, membrane-tethered protein foci that contain anillin Mid1, IQGAP Rng2, myosin-II heavy chain Myo2 and light chains Cdc4 and Rlc1, F-BAR Cdc15, and formin Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Precursor nodes coalesce into a contiguous ring over ~20 min that recruits many additional components over a further ~20 min before constriction after mitotic exit. The orientation of 5 components within these nodes has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>), and quantitative fluorescence studies have even been used to estimate the number of molecules of many proteins per node as well as in the fully-formed ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>). Knowledge from these studies has been incorporated into mathematical models which attempt to understand ring formation and constriction. A search-capture-pull-release model of node condensation was found to recapitulate basic ring formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ojkic et al., 2011</xref>), while biophysical tension measurements of the ring have been used to model ring constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stachowiak et al., 2014</xref>). Though these models are becoming increasingly complex and explanatory, the field is hampered by sparse information about the fundamental molecular architecture of the ring.</p><p>Ultimately, the resolution limit of conventional fluorescence microscopy (~250 nm) restrains the spatial information attainable by studies of <italic>S. pombe</italic> nodes and contractile rings, each only 100–200 nm in width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laplante et al., 2016</xref>). At higher resolution, one electron microscopy study revealed that the ring is composed of a dense array of 1000–2000 F-actin filaments with mixed directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamasaki et al., 2007</xref>); however, additional protein components could not be detected with this technique. New super-resolution microscopy technologies, based on the precise (&lt;50 nm) localization of single photoactivated fluorescent molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rust et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hess et al., 2006</xref>), have the potential to drive our understanding of the contractile ring to a truly molecular level.</p><p>Super-resolution methods have recently been effective at determining the molecular architecture and revealing the inner mechanics of multiple cellular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sydor et al., 2015</xref>). In focal adhesions, the plasma membrane and F-actin were found to be separated by distinct layers of proteins: an integrin signaling layer, a force transduction layer, and an actin regulatory layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>), revealing a potential mechanism of force-induced focal adhesion formation and maintenance. At centrosomes, the pericentriolar matrix (PCM) was found to organize into two structural layers: one directly apposed to the centriole wall and a second extending radially outward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>), scaffolded by the N- and C-termini of pericentrin-like protein, respectively. Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy has revealed previously unresolvable structures, such as actin-spectrin periodic repeats which coat the membranes of axons in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2016</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy has also recently been applied to <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis in a study that investigated 6 proteins’ orientations within precursor nodes relative to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laplante et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (fPALM) we approached the question of the molecular architecture of the contractile ring by comprehensively mapping 29 protein components’ spatial organization relative to the underlying plasma membrane. We determined that the contractile ring is composed of layers of protein components at distinct positions interior to the plasma membrane, similar to other membrane-tethered actin structures like focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>) and cadherin junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertocchi et al., 2017</xref>), a conclusion verified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. Moreover, we find certain components are uniformly distributed circumferentially within the ring, while others form clusters of various sizes and variable spacing. These data provide a structural framework for understanding the formation, mechanics, and regulation of the contractile ring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>fPALM strategy for determining the spatial organization of contractile ring components</title><p>To determine the molecular architecture of the contractile ring using fPALM, we measured the precise spatial distribution of 29 proteins endogenously tagged with mMaple3 relative to the plasma membrane marked with the membrane-binding probe mCling-ATTO647N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Revelo et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The photoactivatable mMaple3 fluorophore was chosen because it has multiple advantages over the commonly used mEos3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), most importantly a faster maturation time (49 versus 330 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The mMaple3 fluorophore is ~5 nm in size and was connected to protein termini with a short 11 amino acid linker, minimizing positional uncertainty. In many cases, the spatial distribution of both protein termini was interrogated to determine molecular orientations. We imaged the middle focal plane of cells and utilized optical astigmatism to precisely measure the Z positions of each photoactivated molecule in order to restrict our analysis to a 500 nm Z section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 2008a</xref>). This imaging scheme resulted in a significant increase in resolution from conventional fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to fPALM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

First, we verified that mCling-ATTO647N colocalizes with the FM4-64 membrane dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In fact, mCling is similarly trafficked into intracellular membrane compartments, confirming its membrane incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, at super-resolution the mCling-ATTO647N signal is wider than the ~10 nm plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that mCling-ATTO647N may also bind nonspecifically to the cell wall. Nevertheless, the interior edge of the mCling signal aligns extremely well with the edge of an Acyl-mMaple3 signal, validating the use of mCling to mark the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane (blue line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the spatial distribution of each protein component relative to the plasma membrane, we performed an analysis similar to that performed on focal adhesion and cadherin junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertocchi et al., 2017</xref>). The cytoplasmic edge of the plasma membrane was defined in an unbiased manner as the position where the mCling-ATTO647N signal dropped to 5%. The distance from the defined plasma membrane edge was then calculated for each individual protein localization in a contractile ring side-view ‘spot’. The average distance from the membrane (d<sub>center</sub>), a vertical width parameter (σ<sub>vert</sub>), and a horizontal width parameter (σ<sub>width</sub>) were determined as in Kanchanawong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanchanawong et al., 2010</xref>), and these values were then averaged across multiple rings. We restricted our analysis to fully formed, unconstricted contractile rings that are present in cells for 15–20 min. Cells containing rings of this stage were identified based on the absence of precursor nodes, the presence of a tightly concentrated ring absolutely perpendicular to the cell’s long axis, and the lack of any membrane ingression or septum formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spatial distribution of structural contractile ring components</title><p>We first determined the spatial distribution of 19 structural components of the contractile ring relative to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The membrane-binding F-BAR domain of Rga7 may also have a ring binding partner, Rng10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that F-BAR domains may scaffold additional ring components, linking their partners indirectly but closely to the membrane. It is not surprising that the integrity of this proximal layer of the contractile ring is critical for strong attachment to the plasma membrane. In fact, additional time is required to assemble the ring when Mid1 is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachet and Simanis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), while rings can slide and disassemble when Cdc15 abundance is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arasada and Pollard, 2014</xref>). It is surprising that the ring remains associated with the plasma membrane in the majority of cells lacking Mid1 or fully functional Cdc15 or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that other ring components important for establishing this tight plasma membrane-contractile ring linkage must exist, especially during constriction when Mid1 leaves the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>At 80–160 nm away from the membrane, we find the C-termini of Cdc15 and Imp2, which contain their SH3 domains. These domains are functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2015</xref>), but having one or the other is essential for cytokinesis and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>), demonstrating the importance of an SH3-scaffolded network within the contractile ring. Multiple binding partners of Cdc15's and Imp2’s SH3 domains including Pxl1, Fic1, Spa2, Rgf3, and Cyk3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>) concentrate in this intermediate zone. Cyk3 itself contains an SH3 domain, likely further strengthening this interaction network. Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains bind a K/RxLPxΦP motif that is found in a number of additional contractile ring proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2015</xref>) that may also be present in this zone. It is interesting to note that the functions of the majority of these proteins remains unclear, and that their functions are not strictly essential. However, given the multiple protein interaction domains present in these components and their spatial organization, we speculate that eliminating pairs or subsets of these elements would undermine the networking of this zone. This may result in weakening the linkage between the strata of the contractile ring ultimately leading to loss of ring integrity and cell viability, irrespective of any mechanistic contributions of these components to ring function. In support of this hypothesis, synthetic lethality has been observed in several cases when null alleles of these genes were combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed in the complete absence of Cdc15 and its SH3 interaction network, F-actin rings can still form but quickly disintegrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>), underscoring the stabilizing function of the intermediate zone.</p><p>Farthest from the membrane (160–350 nm), we find the center of F-actin localization. The elevated localization and ~200 nm thickness of F-actin matches the limited electron micrographs of <italic>S. pombe</italic> rings that are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamasaki et al., 2007</xref>). It is notable that classical electron microscopy studies of animal cells have also measured the contractile ring as 250–500 nm thick vertically from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schroeder, 1973</xref>). Interestingly, both termini of the formin Cdc12, which nucleates and elongates F-actin in the ring de novo, are significantly closer to the membrane. This localization suggests that F-actin may be nucleated and polymerized by Cdc12 close to the membrane, but filaments are pulled upward and incorporated into the main F-actin density by tension from myosin motors and actin crosslinkers. Indeed we found the head domains of all 3 contractile ring myosins and the actin crosslinker Fim1 at a high elevation apposed to F-actin. The essential myosin-II Myo2 is oriented with its tail close to the membrane and motor extended, an orientation also seen in precursor nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laplante et al., 2016</xref>). This implies a different organization than the canonical bipolar filaments that are observed in sarcomeres and mammalian cleavage furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>). Though bipolar filaments are not formed, an orientation with Myo2’s tail bound near the membrane would provide a critical anchor for force generation by its distal motor domain. Myo2 has additionally been implicated in ring formation independent of its motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palani et al., 2017</xref>), a function that may be contained within domains near the membrane and other early ring components. We find the tails of the non-essential myosins Myp2 and Myo51 at an intermediate layer. Myp2 and Myo51 are single-headed myosin motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezanilla and Pollard, 2000</xref>); embedding their tail domains in the intermediate layer may also aid in force generation upon the distal F-actin. It is likely that other components such as α-actinin and tropomyosin that depend on F-actin for ring localization are also present in the most interior layer.</p><p>We also quantified the geometry of each ring component within the ring, both in terms of ring width and in terms of strata width, e.g. spread from the center of the ring and distance from the membrane. Relative to the membrane, ring components tended to organize into similarly ‘thick’ strata of ~150–200 nm. In terms of width within the ring, components organized in widths between 120–220 nm, with Fim1-mMaple3 being widest and mMaple3-Imp2 being thinnest, though in general widths did not significantly correlate with components’ distance from the membrane. Clearly, the membrane proximal layer is no wider than the actin layer or vice versa.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Signaling within the contractile ring</title><p>The nanoscale spatial organization of signaling components of the contractile ring has not been studied previously, though we estimate that there are ~10 protein kinases, ~3 phosphatases, and &gt;20 GTPases and associated GAPs and GEFs in the contractile ring. Though some of these modulators have known binding partners that may help recruit them to the appropriate layer (e.g. the protein kinase Sid2 by Blt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goss et al., 2014</xref>), the GTPase exchange factor Gef2 by Nod1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), and the Rho1-exchange factor Rgf3 by Cdc15 and Imp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2015</xref>]), it is also possible that these enzymes accumulate in distinct zones due to more transient interactions with their substrates. We did find that most localized in the correct areas for modification of their reported substrates. Sid2 is localized at a low elevation (88 nm), properly placed to access its substrates Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bohnert et al., 2013</xref>), Spa2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>), and Clp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). The protein kinase Pom1 is in the intermediate layer (175 nm), overlapping with the localization of 3 known substrates: Imp2, Cdc15, and Rga7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kettenbach et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the Clp1 phosphatase is present at a low-to-intermediate level (136 nm), near its scaffold Mid1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clifford et al., 2008</xref>) and known and predicted ring substrates Cdc15, Blt1, Rng2, Cyk3, Myp2, and Orb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clifford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Protein clusters in the contractile ring</title><p>When we examined a circumferential view of the ring, we found that components adopted a range of spatial organizations. Mid1 and Rng2 form irregularly spaced 200 nm clusters, which resemble the size and shape of cytokinesis precursor nodes previously measured with different techniques (conventional microscopy and live cell fPALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>). The membrane-proximal termini of Myo2 and Cdc15 form smaller 70–100 nm diameter regularly-spaced clusters along the circumference of the ring. All four of these proteins are present in precursor nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), which have recently been suggested to be maintained in the fully developed contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laplante et al., 2016</xref>). However, the very different diameter and regularity of Cdc15 and Myo2 clusters from those of Mid1 and Rng2 argues that at the least, node structures change as the ring develops. This is perhaps to be expected since Mid1, responsible for setting up precursor nodes, dissociates from the ring as it constricts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>). Additionally, the relative stoichiometry of certain components in the ring change during constriction: Myo2 is concentrated during constriction while Cdc15, Rng2, and Cdc12 remain at a constant concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, reorganization of the membrane-proximal level within the ring must occur. Future two-color super-resolution imaging could determine if large clusters contain combinations of components that persist from precursor nodes as well as any additional novel clustering behavior in the fully formed ring.</p><p>Interestingly, we found components that are further away from the membrane are uniform in their distribution, even compared to their opposite termini. In particular, the F-actin signal from LifeAct-mMaple3 is uniform, in accord with electron microscopy studies of contractile ring F-actin which show a relatively even distribution in both <italic>S. pombe</italic> and animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamasaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to their membrane-proximal termini, the opposite termini of Myo2 and Cdc15 appear quite uniform. A long flexible region between Cdc15’s F-BAR and SH3 domains likely acts to eliminate any F-BAR-oligomerization-mediated clustering once the SH3 domain is reached. The even distribution of Myo2’s head domain suggests a generally even binding of actin throughout the ring. This distribution is in contrast to myosin-II ‘stacks’ formed in animal cells, where antiparallel myosin units are assembled into large-scale clusters parallel to F-actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fenix et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Building the ring bottom up</title><p>Together with prior knowledge of when proteins are recruited to the ring, the spatial architecture of the contractile ring determined here suggests possible mechanics of ring formation. In fact, the different layers seen in our analysis generally correlate with the order of assembly of their components. Of the earliest ring components which are recruited to precursor nodes (Mid1, Rng2, Myo2, Cdc15, and Cdc12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>), 4/5 contain termini present within the proximal membrane layer (0–80 nm), and 2/5 contain direct membrane binding domains. The precise order of assembly of Rng2, Myo2, and Cdc12 does not appear to matter for ring formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tao et al., 2014</xref>), but it seems likely that the initial setup of the ring involves the construction of a membrane-anchored scaffold. F-actin is formed de novo at nodes and the ring by Cdc12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>) as well as incorporated from longitudinal actin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). F-actin, though turning over quickly in the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2017</xref>), may be principally held in its elevated location by the tension from the motor activity of myosins. Circumferential tension due to myosin may produce force on F-actin and other components toward the center of the cell, as in ‘purse-string’ models of ring function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2017</xref>). Once a contiguous ring is formed, many additional components are recruited. Components that join the ring later are generally present within the intermediate layer. Many of these components, therefore, may ‘fill in’ between the membrane-bound proximal layer and F-actin to form a robust structure that withstands the forces of constriction, couples ring constriction with other events of mitosis, and connects the ring to cell wall formation that occurs coincidentally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast methods and strain construction</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were grown in yeast extract (YE) media at 25°C, with the exception of <italic>pnmt1-Acyl-mMaple3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and <italic>nmt1-Acyl-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) which were grown in Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) lacking thiamine to induce expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basi et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> transformations were performed with a lithium acetate method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keeney and Boeke, 1994</xref>). mMaple3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) was cloned into a pFA6a vector at AscI and PacI sites.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nanoscale architecture of the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombeS. pombe</italic> contractile ring&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The referees were impressed with the use of super-resolution approach to understand organization of the cytokinetic apparatus in fission yeast, which has become an excellent system to study cytokinesis. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>We request that you address the following issues (essential revisions), but you might also want to consider other points in the referee comments (nearly all of which are reasonable) in preparing your revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, the accuracy of your estimate of the location of cell membranes was called into question in points 3 and 4 of referee 1 and point 4 of referee 2. Please address these with alternative approaches suggested by the referees, or other approaches that may be available to you.</p><p>Second, and linked to the above point, it will be important to generate some double-tagged strains (e.g. Mid–mMaple3 Cdc15–mMaple3), and then to test for two separate gaussian peaks. If they showed 3-4 examples of double peaks for combined tags, then this would address these concerns (point 5 of referee 1).</p><p>Finally, please also address why the cell cycle stages you describe are reliable considering the caveats in the synchrony used.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>By using the super resolution localization microscopy technique fPALM, McDonald et al., measured the distances between cell membrane and various cytokinetic ring proteins in the fixed <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells. The authors further validated the proximity of the F–BAR protein Cdc15 to its interacting proteins using FRET technique. In addition, the authors also measured the distances of several regulatory proteins such as kinases and GTPases that participate in cytokinesis relative to cell membrane. Together, the authors provided a 2–dimensional architecture of the cytokinetic ring at the nanometer scale.</p><p>The cytokinetic ring is a complex contractile machinery, and how the ring proteins are organized to collectively executing cytokinesis is an important but not yet well studied question in the field. The question addressed by McDonald et al., is important towards the understanding of cytokinetic ring function, and fits the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, due to the technical caveats particularly the ambiguity of the cytokinesis stages and the labelling of cell membrane (major comments below), I am not very convinced by the accuracy of their findings. Since the relative molecular distances of ring proteins are at the nanometer scale, a good definition of cell membrane and the cytokinesis stages is essential to this study. Thus, these concerns should be addressed before further consideration for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors mentioned that they collected synchronized cells for their fPALM experiments (subsection “Sample preparation for fPALM imaging”). However, there is no supporting evidence for a good cell synchronization. The cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> do not seem to be at the same cell cycle stages (cells with different ring widths could be observed). Since the localizations of ring proteins may vary in early assembled rings, in matured rings, or in rings ready for constriction, a reliable indicator of cytokinesis stages will be required when performing the fPALM study.

Although we know the components of CR, lack of information regarding the nature of molecular arrangement and interaction has severely limited our understanding of the process. In S.pombe, a conserved actomyosin ring of 400nm thickness composed of 130 proteins drives constriction. Such molecular complexity is beyond the scope of diffraction limited optics. This paper (along with a recent work from Pollard lab) attempts at elucidating the structure of actomyosin ring using super-resolution microscopy.

Specifically, they measured the average distance of 29 ring proteins from the plasma membrane, revealing vertical zones of enrichment that make sense given the known functions and interactions of these proteins. For several factors, these positions are further confirmed by FRET. This work follows two previous studies that mapped a more limited set of proteins in cytokinetic ring precursors by SHREC (Laporte, 2011) and fPALM (Laplante, 2016). This McDonald et al., study is an impressive body of work that provides the most detailed account of protein organization in the cytokinetic ring, at least to my knowledge. It will be a reference point for future mechanistic studies. My main concern is that the work is entirely descriptive, it is strictly a localization study. Ideally, one would like to see the function of these localization results tested – what aspects of this vertical organization are important for cytokinesis? As such, it is more of a &quot;resource&quot; than a &quot;research article.&quot; Nonetheless, it represents a major step forward for the field, and is likely to draw broad interest.

Presumably, these data are readily available from the images, and the authors state in the text an overall ring width of 181nm, but I did not see how this number was calculated. Measurement for each component would further refine the molecular architecture of the ring by adding additional confinement for each protein.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The data suggest that ring proteins are clustered near the membrane, but not clustered in the more interior strata.

As the authors know, the Pollard lab published fPALM data showing that both termini of these same constructs are clustered in the ring. In fact, all 6 constructs (4 proteins, 2 of which were tagged at each terminus) examined in the Pollard study were clustered. One difference between the two studies is that the Pollard lab imaged live cells, while the McDonald study imaged fixed cells, raising the question of whether fixation affected clustering (there are other difference and possibilities as well). I wonder if the authors could address this discrepancy by imaging lateral organization in live cells. They could also consider imaging more examples of cortical versus interior proteins, to support further this general trend of clustered at the membrane but diffuse at the interior. Finally, measurements of horizontal spread in middle focal planes (previous comment) might show tight clusters at the cortex with broad spread at the interior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28865.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, the accuracy of your estimate of the location of cell membranes was called into question in points 3 and 4 of referee 1 and point 4 of referee 2.

In other words, only that fraction of rings corresponding to fully formed but unconstructed ring in any single field of view were analyzed. We have clarified the methodology in the manuscript and added examples to illustrate how appropriate rings were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). See our response to reviewer 1 point 1 and reviewer 2 point 5 below for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>By using the super resolution localization microscopy technique fPALM, McDonald et al., measured the distances between cell membrane and various cytokinetic ring proteins in the fixed S. pombe cells. The authors further validated the proximity of the F–BAR protein Cdc15 to its interacting proteins using FRET technique. In addition, the authors also measured the distances of several regulatory proteins such as kinases and GTPases that participate in cytokinesis relative to cell membrane. Together, the authors provided a 2–dimensional architecture of the cytokinetic ring at the nanometer scale.</p><p>The cytokinetic ring is a complex contractile machinery, and how the ring proteins are organized to collectively executing cytokinesis is an important but not yet well studied question in the field. The question addressed by McDonald et al., is important towards the understanding of cytokinetic ring function, and fits the scope of eLife. However, due to the technical caveats particularly the ambiguity of the cytokinesis stages and the labelling of cell membrane (major comments below), I am not very convinced by the accuracy of their findings. Since the relative molecular distances of ring proteins are at the nanometer scale, a good definition of cell membrane and the cytokinesis stages is essential to this study. Thus, these concerns should be addressed before further consideration for eLife.</p><p>1) The authors mentioned that they collected synchronized cells for their fPALM experiments (subsection “Sample preparation for fPALM imaging”). However, there is no supporting evidence for a good cell synchronization. The cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> do not seem to be at the same cell cycle stages (cells with different ring widths could be observed). Since the localizations of ring proteins may vary in early assembled rings, in matured rings, or in rings ready for constriction, a reliable indicator of cytokinesis stages will be required when performing the fPALM study. It would be useful to include mitotic markers such as SPB distance or spindle length for more precise indexing of cytokinesis progression.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment, also raised by reviewer 2, reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of the lactose gradient methodology in our study. We apologize for the confusion. The lactose gradient was used to simply <italic>enrich</italic> for cells in the same cell cycle phase but we did not analyze all cells obtained. This step simply allowed us to decrease the number of experiments required to image a sufficient number of cells at the appropriate stage in cytokinesis. We made no assumption about exact cell cycle stage based on the enrichment protocol.</p><p>Rather, cells and rings were individually selected for analysis based on criteria that place them within a short window between full ring formation and the beginning of constriction (which is generally considered 15-20 minutes (Wu and Pollard, 2003)). These visual criteria are: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1</xref>) a lack of precursor nodes, meaning the first cytokinesis proteins have condensed into a ring, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2</xref>) the presence of a fully formed and tightly concentrated ring absolutely perpendicular to the cell length, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">3</xref>) the absence of detectable ring constriction or membrane ingression. We have reworded the methods and main text to clarify our use of the lactose gradient, and added a panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> that explicitly lays out the criteria used for selecting mature pre-constriction rings with examples.</p><p>It is possible that certain early ring components reorganize during the short period between initial ring formation and ring constriction, which is on the order of a few minutes. One fact to note is that the majority of proteins we have analyzed are not present at the division site in nodes or during the initial stages of ring formation meaning that if they are present in rings, the rings are fully formed and ready to constrict. Furthermore, visualizing mitotic markers such as spindle pole bodies will not allow us to define any more precise temporal window post- anaphase B onset when the majority of proteins are assembled into the ring and constriction. We have gathered data on a large number of rings using our criteria; temporally these ring populations are either all mature for late-arriving proteins, or for some proteins span full assembly through to maturation. Therefore, the data represent an average across this very short time window. That no single protein has a large deviation from its mean and that the deviations from the mean are similar across all proteins suggests significant individual protein rearrangements do not occur.</p><p>We believe the criteria we have employed to analyze protein localization exclusively in fully formed but not yet constricting rings achieves excellent temporal resolution and the best accuracy currently technically feasible in fPALM fixed samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors only map the ring protein localization at one single time point (+90 minutes after synchronization).

However, we believe this is beyond the scope of the current study. For one, such experiments will require significant additional technical optimization because the mCling dye does not uniformly label the “ingressing” membrane, possibly because new membrane is added primarily from vesicular trafficking and would require much longer labelling with the dye to achieve uniform membrane labeling in the furrow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A reliable cell membrane marker is critical to the accuracy of measurements in this study.

We find that these two membrane probes colocalize strongly and both are trafficked into intracellular membrane compartments, leading us to conclude mCling is a bona fide membrane marker.

Though fixed cells are disadvantageous due to loss of the dynamics of the cytokinesis process, fixing is critical to allow superresolution fluorophores to be exhaustively photoconverted and excited over multiple minutes. Uneven conversion and excitation becomes quite possible with the fast and short acquisitions necessary in live cells, perhaps biasing the results of image analysis towards punctate patterns. We also note that the methodology reported in the Pollard study lacked any fiducial marking for drift correction which could also contribute to the development of punctate images.</p><p>To expand this analysis as suggested, we imaged and analyzed more ring components in the circumferential dimension. In the proximal layer, we added septin Spn3 and found a uniform distribution, and in the intermediate layer we have added Fic1 and the tail of Myp2, finding that both are uniform. The trend remains consistent that intermediate and distal components are uniformly distributed, while certain proximal components (generally those that were present in precursor nodes) cluster.</p></body></sub-article></article>
