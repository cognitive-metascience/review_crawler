arrhythmia. How specific mutations cause arrhythmia is largely unknown and there are no approved I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators for treatment of these arrhythmias. We find that several Long QT syndrome-associated I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations shift channel voltage dependence and accelerate channel closing. Voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments and kinetic modeling suggest that similar mutation-induced alterations in I<sub>Ks</sub> channel currents may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. Finally, we find that the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine restores channel gating of many different mutant channels, even though the mutations are in different domains of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and affect the channel by different molecular mechanisms. N-arachidonoyl taurine is therefore an interesting prototype compound that may inspire development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat Long QT syndrome caused by diverse I<sub>Ks</sub> channel mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20272.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20272.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20272.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every heartbeat relies on an electric wave that travels through the heart. This wave must reach different parts of the heart in a specific sequence to ensure that the heart muscle cells contract in a coordinated manner. Such coordinated contractions enable the heart to pump enough blood around the body. By allowing specific ions to flow into or out of the heart muscle cell, proteins called ion channels in the cell membrane generate the electric wave, keep it going and stop it. One such protein called the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel controls the flow of potassium ions, and in doing so stops the electric wave in heart muscle cells.</p><p>About 300 different mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel have been shown to cause abnormal heart rhythms in individuals with a disorder called long QT syndrome. People with this condition may suddenly black out because their heart develops prolonged electric waves that prevent blood from being pumped properly.</p><p>To investigate how mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel produce heart rhythm abnormalities, Liin et al. genetically engineered the egg cells of African clawed frogs to have one of eight mutant forms of the human I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. Studying these channels revealed that the mutations reduce how well the channels work in a wide variety of ways. However, treating the cells with a particular fatty acid helped to normalize how each of the mutant channels worked. Therefore, variants of the fatty acid could potentially form a useful treatment for people with heart rhythm problems caused by mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p><p>More studies are needed to confirm whether the fatty acid is as effective at combating the effects of the mutations in whole hearts and animals. As ion channels related to the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel are found in many types of cells, it is also important to investigate whether treatment with the fatty acid could cause any side effects that affect other organs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20272.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20272.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>polyunsaturated fatty acid</kwd><kwd>antiarrhythmic</kwd><kwd>KCNQ1</kwd><kwd>KCNE1</kwd><kwd>Kv7.1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM109762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16GRNT30990060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003748</institution-id><institution>Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>524-2011-6806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003208</institution-id><institution>Northwest Lions Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fatty acid analogues are interesting prototype compounds that may inspire the development of future I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators to treat patients with long QT syndrome caused by diverse arrhythmia-causing mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition of the heart which in most cases is caused by a mutation in cardiac ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morita et al., 2008</xref>). In LQTS, the action potential of the heart is prolonged, which is observed as a prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram. LQTS patients have an increased risk of developing ventricular tachyarrhythmias called <italic>torsades de pointes</italic> when exposed to triggers such as adrenergic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cerrone et al., 2012</xref>). These arrhythmias can cause palpitation, syncope or sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. To improve the clinical outcome of LQTS patients, it is therefore critical to prevent these LQTS-induced life-threatening arrhythmias.</p><p>Most mutations causing LQTS are located in the <italic>KCNQ1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>KCNQ1</italic> codes for the potassium channel K<sub>V</sub>7.1, which in the heart co-assembles with the beta-subunit KCNE1 to form the slowly-activating, voltage-dependent potassium channel I<sub>Ks </sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>). The I<sub>Ks</sub> channel provides one of the important delayed rectifier outward potassium currents that repolarizes the cardiomyocyte and terminates the cardiac action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>). Reduced I<sub>Ks</sub> function therefore tends to delay cardiomyocyte repolarization, thereby causing prolonged cardiac action potential durations and a prolonged QT interval. The cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel consists of four K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits and two to four KCNE1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakajo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Murray et al., 2016</xref>). Throughout this work, we will refer to the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel as K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1. K<sub>V</sub>7.1 has six transmembrane segments named S1-S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liin et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). S1-S4 of each K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunit forms a voltage-sensing domain where S4 is the voltage sensor with three positive gating charges. S5 and S6 from all four K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits form the pore domain with a putative gate in S6 that needs to move to open the ion-conducting pore of the channel. KCNE1 has a single-transmembrane segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and is proposed to be localized in the otherwise lipid-filled space between two voltage-sensing domains of neighbouring K<sub>V</sub>7.1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakajo and Kubo, 2015</xref>). Upon cardiomyocyte depolarization, the voltage sensor of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 moves outward in relation to the membrane. It has been proposed that this movement of the voltage sensor is transferred to the pore domain via the S4-S5 linker and induces channel opening by moving the S6 gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liin et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20272.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biophysical properties of LQTS and LQTS-like K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel mutants expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Topology of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1, and position of tested LQTS and LQTS-like mutants.

These mutations are distributed throughout the channel sequence and are therefore likely to cause channel dysfunction by different mechanisms, which are, however, largely unknown. Potential mechanisms for K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel loss of function by a mutation could, for example, be interference with voltage sensor movement, gate opening, or membrane expression. LQTS is today treated with drugs that prevent the triggering of arrhythmic activity, such as beta-blockers, or with arrhythmia-terminating implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>). A different treatment strategy for LQTS caused by loss-of-function mutations in the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel would be to pharmacologically augment the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel function of these LQTS mutants, thereby shortening the prolonged QT interval and lower the risk of arrhythmia development. However, there is currently no clinically approved K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel activator.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the biophysical properties and potential mechanism of action of LQTS-associated K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel mutations and test the ability of the fatty acid analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine (N-AT) to restore the function of these mutants.</p><p>We selected eight mutations of residues mutated in patients with LQTS located in different segments of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and that were previously shown to form active channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldstrom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henrion et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Splawski et al., 1997</xref>). We measure the movement of the S4 voltage sensor in selected mutants using voltage clamp fluorometry to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defects caused by the diverse mutations. We find that the eight LQTS-associated mutations affect the voltage dependence and/or closing kinetics, in some cases by different molecular mechanisms. Moreover, we find that N-AT restores much of the channel activity in these eight LQTS-associated K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 mutants. This suggests that N-AT may function as a general activator of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels with diverse mutational defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LQTS mutants show altered biophysical properties</title><p>We first study the biophysical properties of six point mutations in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (F193L, V215M, S225L, L251P, F351S, R583C), and two in KCNE1 (K70N, S74L) identified in patients with LQTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Splawski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Priori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Napolitano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

L251A and F351A will be referred to as 'LQTS-like mutants'.

S225L, L251A and F351A shift the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) towards positive voltages compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1. In contrast, R583C shifts the half-maximal activation, <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub>, ~10 mV towards negative voltages compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1. This apparent negative shift is likely caused by the pronounced inactivation of the R583C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>), which is seen to a considerable smaller extent in the other K<sub>V</sub>7.1 mutants and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). When a fraction of the channels are released from inactivation, by introducing a brief hyperpolarizing pulse between the test pulse and the tail pulse, R583C has a <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub> fairly comparable to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p><p>When the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 mutants are co-expressed with KCNE1, all K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants except K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F193L+KCNE1 have a <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) that is shifted towards positive voltages compared to the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A causes the most dramatic change by shifting V<sub>50</sub> more than +30 mV. We are therefore only able to record the foot of the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1, and a shift in V<sub>50</sub> of +30 mV is a lower estimate of the change in V<sub>50</sub> (ΔV<sub>50</sub>). One of the other mutants with dramatically shifted <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) is K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1. V<sub>50</sub> for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 is shifted almost +30 mV compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). S225L also slows down K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel opening kinetics (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All mutations, except for L251A, accelerate channel closing kinetics compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). K70N has the most dramatic effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel closing by accelerating the closing kinetics by approximately a factor of 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When comparing the amplitude of K<sup>+</sup> currents generated by these mutants with the current amplitude of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel in the same batch of oocytes, we note that all mutants generate smaller currents than wild-type over a large voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although defective trafficking may contribute to these reduced currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, the current amplitudes for most mutants matches fairly well with the predicted current amplitude from channels with <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves shifted towards positive voltages as observed for these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>), suggesting that the reduced current amplitudes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes are mainly a result of gating defects (and not trafficking defects).</p><p>To summarize, all mutations change channel function by altering the voltage dependence of opening and/or the kinetics of opening and/or closing. Reduced function of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel induced by these LQTS and LQTS-like mutations may largely be explained by the right-shifted <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) and the faster closing kinetics caused by these mutations.

Alternatively, for mutants with a <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) that is very shifted to positive voltages (e.g. F351A), it may be that channel complexes that contain the mutated subunits are largely out of the physiological voltage range and therefore do not contribute substantially to the recorded current. Also, for mutants with low membrane expression (e.g. possibly F193L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>]), it may be that channels containing the wild-type subunit are favoured so that in most K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel complexes the majority (or all) of the subunits will be wild-type subunits.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20272.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of homozygous and heterozygous expression of LQTS and LQTS-like mutants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>b</bold>) Representative example of kinetics (middle panel) and <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) (right panel) for homozygous expression and heterozygous expression of S225L (<bold>a</bold>) and K70N (<bold>b</bold>).

For instance, mutations located in S5 and S6 (e.g. F351A) may mainly affect gate movement, while mutations in S1–S4 (e.g. S225L) are more likely to affect voltage sensor movement. To explore whether different mutations interfere with different gating transitions, we use voltage clamp fluorometry, in which the movement of the voltage sensor in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 can be tracked by the fluorescence change from the fluorescent probe Alexa-488-maleimide attached to G219C in the S3-S4 loop (referred to as G219C*) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osteen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osteen et al., 2012</xref>). Voltage sensor movement (measured by fluorescence) and gate movement (measured by ionic currents) are then monitored under two-electrode voltage clamp.

One note of caution is that the interpretation of the mutational effects is dependent on the models used for the wild-type channels. Other models for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruscic et al., 2013</xref>), but these have not been as extensively tested or developed as our models. Although other alternative mechanisms for the effects of these mutations are possible, the different impacts of S225L and F351A on the fluorescence versus voltage relationships suggest that these mutations introduce distinct molecular defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>N-AT enhances the activity of all tested LQTS and LQTS-like mutants</title><p>We previously observed that the effect of regular polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid, on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 is impaired by co-expression with the KCNE1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we found that the PUFA analogue N-arachidonoyl taurine (N-AT, structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) retained its ability to activate the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel also in the presence of KCNE1.

The magnitude of this N-AT-induced shift is comparable to, but in the opposite direction, to the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) shifts observed for several of the LQTS and LQTS-like mutants. We therefore here test the ability of N-AT to enhance the function of the eight K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 mutant channels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref> shows representative effects of 7–70 µM N-AT on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1. 70 µM N-AT increases current amplitude by a factor of 16 at +20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and shifts the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve by about –50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Steady state of N-AT effects is reached within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We note a small instantaneous ‘leak’ component in the 70 µM N-AT trace of K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This leak component in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L+KCNE1 is observed also in the absence of N-AT, but at more positive voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We do not observe this leak component in wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 upon application of N-AT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), which suggests that this phenomenon is associated with the S225L mutation. The human ventricular action potential has a duration of about 300–400 ms and a systolic voltage range of about 0 to +40 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Hara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piacentino et al., 2003</xref>).

Thus, 70 µM N-AT completely corrects the positive <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) shifts induced by the mutations so that in the presence of N-AT the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) is similar to or shifted negative compared to the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, F351A homozygous expression was not included in this analysis because of the very shifted <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve of this mutant). The <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) of mutants is shifted about equally by N-AT for homozygous and heterozygous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). The slope of the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve varies slightly (10.4 to 16.3) among the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To correct for this difference in slope and to better compare the functional effect of N-AT-induced <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) shifts on the different mutants, we also calculate the change in Gibbs free energy for channel opening (ΔΔGo) that 70 µM N-AT induces. 70 µM N-AT reduces the energy required to open the channel by 5.3–9.0 kJ/mol depending on mutant (4.9 ± 0.7 kJ/mol (n = 5) for wild-type) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). To estimate the functional effect of N-AT on the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 current amplitude of each mutant, we calculate the ratio of the current amplitude at the end of the 5 s test pulse before and after application of N-AT at +20 and +40 mV. The 5 s voltage pulse to +20 mV (or + 40 mV) at room temperature was chosen to make the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel activate to a similar extent as during a ventricular action potential (300–400 ms) at body temperature (note that K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels have a relatively high Q<sub>10</sub> of around 5–7.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch and Lang, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seebohm et al., 2001</xref>]). 70 µM N-AT increases the current amplitude of all mutants at these voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a–b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). As expected, current amplitude is most increased for those mutants that have the most shifted <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve towards more positive voltages (e.g. V215M and S225L). This is because these mutants are still at the foot of their <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve at +20 and +40 mV and a N-AT-induced shift towards more negative voltages results in a relatively larger increase in the current amplitude. By multiplying these relative N-AT-induced increases in current amplitude with the relative current amplitude of each mutant (compared to wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c–d</xref>), we observe that 70 µM N-AT compensates fairly well (or overcompensates) for the mutation-induced reduction in current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Moreover, for all mutant and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, 70 µM N-AT speeds up the opening kinetics at +40 mV by a factor of 1.3–2.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). 70 µM N-AT also slows down the closing kinetics for most mutants and wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For F351A heterozygous expression and R583C homozygous expression, 70 µM N-AT restores the closing kinetics so that the closing kinetics is not statistically different (p&gt;0.05) from wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 closing kinetics (737 ± 62 ms and 833 ± 74 ms, respectively compared to 967 ± 47 ms for wild-type). In the presence of KCNE1, channels made with F193L heterozygous expression, L251A homozygous expression, and R583C heterozygous expression have wild-type like closing kinetics already before application of N-AT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>N-AT affects both S4 movement and gate opening in mutants</title><p>We next use voltage clamp fluorometry on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1 to explore the mechanism by which N-AT enhances the activity of two mechanistically different mutants. Surprisingly, N-AT caused a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In contrast, N-AT did not decrease the fluorescence from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C* channels nor did high concentrations of taurine decrease the fluorescence from unbound Alexa488 (even up to concentrations of 0.5 M taurine; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that N-AT is not a collisional quencher of Alexa488. The mechanism of the N-AT-induced decrease of fluorescence from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 channels is not clear, but could be due to N-AT inducing a conformational change in KCNE1 or K<sub>V</sub>7.1 that brings a quenching residue close to Alexa488.</p><p>Due to the dramatic decrease in the fluorescence signal from Alexa488-labeled K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 channels, we have to normalize the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves obtained in N-AT to the amplitude of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) in control solutions. With this normalization, voltage clamp fluorometry experiments on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 indicate that N-AT shifts both the voltage dependence of the first part (which represents <italic>F</italic>1) and the second part (which represents <italic>F</italic>2) of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve towards more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). However, due to the not completely saturating <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1, we are unable to reliably normalize the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves in the presence of N-AT to the control <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves. We instead explore the effect of N-AT on the kinetics of the two fluorescence components: <italic>F</italic>1, which is seen as a fast fluorescence change at negative voltages, and <italic>F</italic>2, which is seen as a slow fluorescence change on top of the <italic>F</italic>1 component at positive voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>F</italic>1 correlates with the measured gating currents in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (and the initial delay in the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 ionic currents), whereas <italic>F</italic>2 correlates with the opening of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>). For both mutants, 70 µM N-AT speeds up <italic>F</italic>1 kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,d</xref>, measured at –40 mV where virtually no channels open and the fluorescence is mainly composed of <italic>F</italic>1). Numeric values for N-AT effects on channel kinetics are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>. Moreover, N-AT accelerates the channel opening kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,e</xref>) and both the <italic>F</italic>1 and <italic>F</italic>2 fluorescence components at +80 mV for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The change in the <italic>F</italic>2 component is probably larger than what the fits of a double-exponential function suggest, because the slow part of the fluorescence, mainly <italic>F</italic>2, overlay nicely on the currents in both the presence and absence of 70 µM N-AT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, upper panel). As a control, we show that the fluorescence in N-AT does not, however, overlay the currents in control solutions and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, middle and lower panel). For K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1, the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve and the <italic>F</italic>2 component are so shifted towards depolarizing voltages that we cannot reliably quantify the <italic>F</italic>2 component in our fluorescence traces. 70 µM N-AT does, however, speed up K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1 current kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), which suggests that N-AT also speeds up <italic>F</italic>2 in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*/F351A+KCNE1.

This suggests that at least part of the mechanism underlying the reduced ability of these mutants to generate K<sup>+</sup> currents is by altering these biophysical properties of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel. Using voltage clamp fluorometry in combination with kinetic modeling, we further suggest that these altered biophysical properties in mutants may be caused by interference with different gating transitions. Our experimental data and kinetic modeling are consistent with a model in which K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L primarily causes the reduced channel function by altering the main voltage sensor movement, while K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A alters later gating transitions associated with pore opening. The different effects of S225L and F351A on the fluorescence <italic>versus</italic> voltage relationships in K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C* and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/G219C*+KCNE1 suggest that these mutations cause channel dysfunction via different molecular mechanisms. Note that we used the LQTS-like F351A mutant, because the LQTS mutant F351S did not generate any currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, during the review process of this manuscript a new LQTS mutation, F351L, was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyas et al., 2016</xref>). The current and fluorescence of this LQTS mutant is very similar to the current and fluorescence of F351A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that our conclusions on the LQTS-like F351A is also relevant for the LQTS mutant F351L.</p><p>One of the mutations, F193L, has only minor effects on the biophysical properties of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1. This mutant was previously reported to have reduced current amplitude compared to the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and a mild clinical phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi et al., 2003</xref>). The F193L mutation may therefore cause loss of function by faster deactivation kinetics and lower current density. Heterozygous expression of mutated subunits and wild-type subunits in equal molar ratios results in general in a milder biophysical phenotype (more close to the wild-type phenotype). This is in line with a milder clinical phenotype generally reported for heterozygous carriers of LQTS mutations compared to individuals with homozygous genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Priori et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, for different mutations different biophysical effects of the mutations could be dominant or recessive: For S225L and L251A, heterozygous expression in the presence of KCNE1 partially or completely restores wild-type like <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub>, whereas heterozygous expression does not improve closing kinetics compared to homozygous expression. For KCNE1/K70N and KCNE1/S74L, co-expression with wild-type KCNE1 subunits also restores wild-type like <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub>, whereas wild-type like closing kinetics is only partially restored. In contrast, for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/R583C, heterozygous expression restores wild-type like closing kinetics, but not wild-type like <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub>. However, because of uncertainties regarding the stoichiometry of mutant to wild-type subunits in assembled K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (as mentioned in the Results section), further studies will be required to understand the mechanisms underlying these apparent dominant or recessive effects and to evaluate possible physiological impact of these effects.</p><p>Our results show that all tested mutants respond to N-AT. This is in contrast to previously reported K<sub>V</sub>7 channel activators on disease-causing K<sub>V</sub>7 mutants, for which mutants show markedly different sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seebohm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leitner et al., 2012</xref>). 70 µM N-AT shifts the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve of the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and of all LQTS and LQTS-like mutants by approximately (–50)–(–30) mV, accelerates channel opening and slows down channel closing. In the presence of 70 µM N-AT, the <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub> of all LQTS and LQTS-like mutants are similar to or more negative than <italic>V</italic><sub>50</sub> for the wild-type K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel. For most mutants, 70 µM N-AT overcompensates for the shift in <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) and reduction in current amplitude caused by the mutations, indicating that a lower N-AT concentration or a less potent N-AT analogue could be used to restore wild-type like <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) and current amplitudes. Moreover, K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 opening and closing kinetics are partially or completely restored by N-AT. Also, although the disease aetiology of the F193L mutant is likely mainly reduced channel expression, the N-AT induced augmentation caused by a shift in <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) and increased currents may at least in part overcome the reduction in currents caused by the reduced channel expression. This general ability of N-AT to, at least partly, compensate for the reduced function of mutants with mutations in different parts of the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel complex and with seemingly different molecular defects, as long as a population of these mutant channels reaches the plasma membrane, suggests that N-AT is an interesting model compound for development of future anti-arrhythmics to treat LQTS caused by diverse K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 mutations.</p><p>Defective trafficking of mutant K<sub>V</sub>11.1 ion channels is a common cause of LQTS type 2. About 80-90% of LQTS type 2-associated hERG mutants are estimated to suffer from defective trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanguinetti, 2010</xref>). The corresponding number for LQTS-associated K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants is not known. Previous studies identify both trafficking defective and trafficking competent K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanguinetti, 2010</xref>). We are mainly interested in understanding the mechanism that underlies abnormal gating of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 mutants. To avoid mutants with severe trafficking defects, we therefore selected mutants that have previously been shown to localize abundantly enough to the cell membrane to generate detectable K<sup>+</sup> currents. Several of the selected mutants have been shown to traffic well in mammalian systems (K<sub>V</sub>7.1/V215M and KCNE1/S74L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldstrom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harmer et al., 2010</xref>]) or generate clearly detectable currents in mammalian cells (K<sub>V</sub>7.1/R583C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2002</xref>]). Our <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte experiments that compare mutant current amplitudes with wild-type current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) suggest that the reduced ability of the selected mutants to generate currents in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes may largely be explained by the shifted <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) of mutants. Trafficking defects could be disguised in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes that are cultured at low temperatures that may rescue some trafficking defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delisle et al., 2004</xref>). These current amplitude experiments should therefore be interpreted with caution until trafficking of specific K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 LQTS mutants in mammalian systems has been explored. Previous studies show that membrane expression of trafficking-defect channel mutants (e.g. for K<sub>V</sub>11.1 and CFTR) can be pharmacologically rescued using compounds that are suggested to stabilize channel conformation during folding and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delisle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 1996</xref>). However, rescue of membrane expression may only partially compensate for mutation-induced loss of function, if these mutants also suffer from defective gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2016</xref>). Our proposed N-AT model for pharmacological correction of ‘<italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>)’ LQTS mutants could therefore potentially complement pharmacological correction of trafficking-defect LQTS mutants to improve the outcome of patients suffering from LQTS.</p><p>We previously suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids and their analogues (such as N-AT) attract the voltage sensor S4 in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 by an electrostatic mechanism and thereby shift the <italic>G</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) towards more negative voltages and speed up channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore initially hypothesized that N-AT only would restore the function of those LQTS mutations with altered S4 movement. We were pleasantly surprised when N-AT seems to be able to restore the function of many LQTS and LQTS-like mutants, with diverse mutational defects (such as S225L and F351A). Using voltage clamp fluorometry, we have previously shown that both the main gating charge movement and the gate opening of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels are accompanied by fluorescence signals from fluorophores attached to S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that S4 moves both during the main gating charge movement and during the subsequent channel opening in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>), which is similar to observations in Shaker K<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Börjesson and Elinder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pathak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phillips and Swartz, 2010</xref>). Therefore, N-AT could affect both the main gating charge movement and gate opening by acting on the S4 voltage sensor, as has been shown for hanatoxin which targets the voltage-sensing domain in the Shaker K<sub>V</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milescu et al., 2013</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by our voltage-clamp fluorometry experiments using K<sub>V</sub>7.1/S225L and K<sub>V</sub>7.1/F351A in which N-AT accelerates the fluorescence components associated with both the main S4 movement (<italic>F</italic>1) and gate opening (<italic>F</italic>2), as well as accelerates the kinetics of channel opening. This proposed mechanism would explain why N-AT can restore the function of mutations that mainly target either the main S4 movement or gate opening. However, the dramatic decrease in the fluorescence signal caused by N-AT makes it hard for us to completely determine the effect of N-AT on the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) of mutants. Therefore, the complete mechanism of N-AT in the different mutations is not clear.</p><p>Future studies are required to assess the clinical utility of PUFA analogues in cardiomyocytes and animal models. We see channel specificity of PUFA analogues as one major challenge and recognize the need to improve PUFA analogue affinity to K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 to reduce required therapeutic concentrations and minimize potential adverse effects. Despite these challenges, our data show that the magnitude of the N-AT-induced voltage shifts are in a similar range as the shifts induced by several LQTS mutations, thereby serving as proof of concept that this PUFA analogue, at least partly, restores channel function in diverse LQTS and LQTS-like mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experiments were approved by The Linköping Animal Ethics Committee at Linköping University and The Animal Experiments Inspectorate under the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries (University of Copenhagen).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiments on <italic>Xenopus</italic> laevis oocytes</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Expression plasmids human K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (GenBank Acc.No. NM_000218) in pXOOM and KCNE1 (NM_000219) in pGEM have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jespersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmitt et al., 2007</xref>).

To make this point, the authors focus on two mutations, S225L and F351A, drawing the conclusion that the S225L mutation produces a rightward shift in voltage-sensor activation while the F351A mutation largely results in less effective channel opening once voltage-sensors are activated. The results are nicely supported by a comparison of fluorescence-voltage and conductance-voltage curves for each construct with for K<sub>v</sub>7.1 expressed alone or when coexpressed with KCNE1. To validate the idea that each mutation does reduce activation in mechanistically distinct ways, the authors use previously developed models of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 activation +/- KCNE1 to show that a 50 mV rightward shift in VSD activation nicely accounts for both the FV and GV shifts for the S225L mutation, while the F351A mutations can be approximated by a +140 mV shift in the voltage-dependence of channel opening. Although this approach to validate the idea that the two mutations inhibit K<sub>v</sub>7.1 activation by distinct mechanism might be viewed as somewhat dependent on the validity of the activation models (which remains a bit uncertain), the fact that changes in largely a single parameter accounts for the FV and GV relationships both in the absence and presence of KCNE1 is satisfying.</p><p>The authors make the argument that, with appropriate development of compounds of greater specificity and affinity, this may be a plausible strategy for treatment of various LQTS diseases. A number of arguments can be made against the idea that this approach could ever work, such as:</p><p>1) Deficits in expression may underlie the effects of many LQTS mutations;</p><p>2) Fatty acid analogues are likely to have effects on many targets;</p><p>3) Concentrations of any potentially effective compound may have to be adjusted for any given LQTS mutation.</p><p>However, overall, we felt that the authors did a good job of discussing many of these challenges and providing perspective about what would have to be done before this approach might be of benefit. As a proof of principle that an activator of K<sub>v</sub>7.1/KCNE channels can rescue function, irrespective of the nature of the functional deficit, this paper accomplishes that goal. The idea that an activator may qualitatively restore a channel's function irrespective of the origins of the original gating deficit is intriguing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>More data needs to be included to show the effects of the PUFA on fluorescence signals. The text states that the compound greatly diminishes fluorescence but otherwise little is shown or explained. Do the authors understand the mechanism? Is N-AT a collisional quencher? Is there any voltage-dependence to quenching? If not, why not show F-V relations unscaled and then scaled so the reader can appreciate what is going on? Given the large effects of N-AT on fluorescence, should we be concerned about interpreting small changes in kinetics? Were the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> normalized to allow comparison of the temporal properties? Although the authors would like to conclude that N-AT has generalized effects that affect both the VSD activation and channel opening, it seems like it could still be the case that effects on channel opening are primary. As such, the FV and GV data might help put this issue on firmer foundation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher J Lingle (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers found your work to be interesting because it attempts to understand disease causing mutations at a mechanistic level and provides proof of concept evidence that PFU could potentially be used to correct the deficit. Although the reviewers were somewhat divergent in their initial enthusiasm for the manuscript, after discussion there was consensus that the study would need substantial work to be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. All three reviewers offer specific suggestions, which you should consider carefully in going forward with publication. These include 1) clarification of the mechanism by which the two studied mutants affect gating, 2) examination of the impact of mutations on surface levels of the KCNQ channel in order to assess whether restoring the gating properties with PUFs would be sufficient to correct the deficits produced by the mutants, and 3) clarification of the impact of PUFs on other ion channels, cardiac action potentials and EKGs. The overarching concern was that insufficient evidence was presented to support the potential therapeutic utility of PUFs. Our policy is to reject manuscripts requiring the amount of effort that we feel yours would require, but we hope that the reviews will be helpful in revising your manuscript for publication elsewhere. If you feel that you can address the concerns of the reviewers, we would be willing to reconsider the manuscript as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors investigate a series of mutations in the KCNQ channel that cause long QT syndrome in humans and use voltage-clamp fluorimetry with a fluorescent probes attached to the voltage sensors to track conformational changes while measuring channel activation. They see that the mutants alter the voltage-activation relations to varying degrees, but typically shifting activation to positive voltages, slowing activation and speeding deactivation. From comparisons of the F-V and G-V relations in the absence and presence of KCNE, the authors propose that the one mutant located in S4 alters voltage-sensor activation while another located in S6 alters pore opening. They then show that a polyunsaturated fatty (PFU) acid can correct the effects of the mutants, and do proof of concept experiments in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and guinea pig hears where a KCNQ inhibitor is used to induce LQT and show that the PUF can restore normal LQT. This is an interesting study because it attempts to understand disease causing mutations at a mechanistic level and provides proof of concept evidence that PFU could potentially be used to correct the deficit. Although the authors' interpretations are plausible, the data are not always so clean and I can imagine more complex mechanisms may be involved.</p><p>1) The discussion of the combined F-V and G-V data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the subsection “K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel dysfunction is caused by different underlying mechanisms” needs some work and it is not clear to me that S225L affects voltage-sensor activation and F351A affects pore opening. The data to me seem much more complex than the authors acknowledge. I would like to see a clearer presentation of the evidence supporting the key conclusions and a more nuanced discussion of the underlying complexity. The authors may be correct, but I am not sure we understand why the F-V and G-V overlap for KCNQ alone and what KCNE is doing to those relations, which makes interpretation of what is seen with the mutants less than straightforward.</p><p>2) What is the logic of using N-AT instead of other PUFs the authors have previously studied? Given those studies, I would imagine N-AT might have substantial effects on other K<sub>v</sub> channels, and possibly even Nav and Cav channels. What makes the authors think that N-AT will have any selectivity for KCNQ? This feels like a stretch to imagine using these in humans at high μM concentrations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper investigates a selection of Long QT syndrome Type 1 and Type 5 mutations that shift the voltage-dependence of channel opening. Like others, they have found that such mutants have altered voltage-dependence of channel opening, and changed closing kinetics, that can be partially normalized by &quot;heterozygous&quot; expression. N-AT moves activation back to more negative potentials in the LQT mutants, as the authors have previously shown for I<sub>Ks</sub>, and N-AT accelerates all components of fluorescence movement from the mutant channels incorporating G219C. In addition, it is shown that N-AT can affect action potential duration in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and intact guinea-pig hearts, although these data are less convincing. The significance of this work is that N-AT is an activator of both wild type K<sub>v</sub>7.1 +KCNE1 and LQTS mutants. It does not seem so surprising, or indeed particularly significant that N-AT affects LQT mutants in the same way as WT channels. The authors have already reported that PUFA analogues shift the activation gating of K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, so it is to be expected that the LQT mutants have their activation affected as well, as simple missense mutants. Given that, most of the biophysics presented is logical and seems to suggest that N-AT acts non-specifically on the channels (unlike their previous suggestion that WT channels are affected by an &quot;electrostatic mechanism&quot; affecting the VSD). For most in the field, interest in this work is lessened as it is generally accepted that about 2/3 of LQT phenotypes come about as a result of lowered expression at the cell surface from misfolding and other events during synthesis and trafficking.</p><p>1) Expression in oocytes bypasses these problems due to the low incubation temperatures, so it is unclear whether these gating effects are relevant in the greater scheme of increasing overall current density at the mammalian cell surface. Do the authors know what the expression and biophysical characteristics are for these LQT mutants at physiological temperature compared with wild type to understand how N-AT may alter the abnormal functioning of these mutants?</p><p>2) There is a little bit of mixture of models in this study. Most experiments are carried out at room temperature in oocytes, but sometimes CHO cells are used for hKv11.1, derived cardiomyocytes and intact hearts are used for action potential and QT studies. Some data that could tie together studies in the different models would support the potential translational importance of the idea.</p><p>3) The data from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and intact guinea-pig hearts are unconvincing. In the intact hearts it looks like other changes affect the early action potential to shorten it in the presence of N-AT. Changes in the isoelectric region of the EKG suggest a dispersion of action potential effects by N-AT. In intact hearts, the slope of phase 3 repolarization in the HMR+N-AT trace is shallower than in control or with HMR1556 alone. This suggests less net outward current when N-AT is added, the opposite of what is contended. Perhaps this is because N-AT blocks many other cardiac currents.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that PUFAs could provide a treatment option for LQTS, but there is a large literature on the effects of PUFAs on humans, in animal models and also on individual ion currents in heart showing that almost all ion currents, inward and outward, including I<sub>Kr</sub>, are decreased by PUFAs. The well-established exception is I<sub>Ks</sub>, but the overall effect on the QT interval duration could be pro- or antiarrhythmic depending on the physiology of the tissue and the pathology affecting the heart.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The main point of this paper is that LQTS deficits regulating from diverse loss-of-function mutations in K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNME1 channels can potentially be rescued by the polyunsaturated fatty acid analogue, N-arachidonyl taurine (N-AT). This is an exciting and interesting conclusion. The paper is clearly written and the results are straight forwards and support the conclusions. A particularly compelling aspect of the paper is that the authors show that N-AT can rescue function in two mechanistically distinct types of LQTS mutants, those likely to affect voltage sensor function and those affecting channel opening equilibria. This provides some assurance that this sort of pharmacological strategy might have general applicability for a number of different categories of LQTS mutations.</p><p>1) One topic that probably requires some additional clarification concerns the presentation of GVs and how the <italic>V</italic>50's and z values were generated. For many of the mutant GV curves, a saturating level of activation is never obtained, but the plotted GV curves are simply normalized to the maximum level of conductance. I think for some (many) readers this may give a misleading impression of what the relative conductances as a function of voltage may be among different constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, and others) or in response to N-AT application (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), since the assumption may be made that the voltage of the half maximal conductance after normalization corresponds to the true <italic>V</italic>50. Although sometimes it is natural to not trust the extrapolated gmax from a Boltzmann fit, plotting the GVs normalized to the fitted Gmax may be a better proxy for the true channel behavior. In such cases, the observed 0.5 level of conductance directly informs a reader of the approximate Vh, and it also informs the reader regarding changes in the slope, which may otherwise be obscured. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the normalization used by the authors probably tends to minimize the effects at the lower concentrations, while normalizing to the fitted gmax might avoid this. One might also ask in regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, since the control and N-AT tails are all measured in the same patches, why not use the maximal conductance with 70 μM N-AT as the basis for normalization? My concern regarding the GV displays and the estimates of Vh and z become most critical in regards to the DDG estimates (I think, as the process is described in the methods, this was done appropriately, but some clarifications about this might help).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20272.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>More data needs to be included to show the effects of the PUFA on fluorescence signals.

As such, the FV and GV data might help put this issue on firmer foundation.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the previous description of N-AT-induced reduction in overall fluorescence intensity was minimal. To test whether N-AT is a collisional quencher, we monitored the fluorescence from unbound Alexa488 in control solution and in N-AT-supplemented control solution (up to 0.5 M N-AT). In these experiments where no oocytes or channels were present, we did not see any quenching effect of N-AT on Alexa488 fluorescence, suggesting that N-AT is not a collisional quencher of Alexa488. N-AT actually slightly increases the Alexa488 fluorescence by 10-20% (in 0.5 M N-AT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although further experiments will be required to fully understand how N-AT decreases the fluorescence from Alexa-488 bound to K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channels, these experiments suggest that the reduced fluorescence observed in our voltage clamp fluorometry experiments are not caused by direct N-AT quenching of the fluorophore. Instead, it is possible that N-AT induces some rearrangement in the channel that brings some unknown K<sub>v</sub>7.1 or KCNE1 residue, such as a trp, close to Alexa488 and thereby N-AT indirectly quenches the fluorescence.</p><p>Due to the slow kinetics of the K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel and the wide voltage range over which it activates, it takes about 7 minutes to record a full <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve on K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1. During this time course, roughly 50% of the fluorescence signal disappears (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a consequence, the voltage-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity caused by the S4 movement will be underestimated at more positive voltages compared to negative voltages (we run the protocol from negative to positive test voltages). In addition, the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves for WT K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 and K<sub>v</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1 channels are hard to normalize (especially when N-AT has reduced the fluorescence signal to noise), due to not complete saturation at either the negative or positive end of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve. We therefore feel that we presently are unable to reliably quantify N-AT-induced shifts in the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve for WT K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 and K<sub>v</sub>7.1/F351A+KCNE1. However, we now include a normalized <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve of K<sub>v</sub>7.1/G219C*/S225L+KCNE1 (which shows better saturation at both ends of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve) in the presence of N-AT, to compare to the corresponding <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) in control solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This normalized <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve indicates that N-AT shifts both the first part of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve (which represents the main outward S4 movement, i.e. VSD activation) and the second part of the <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curve (which represents S4 rearrangements associated with channel opening) towards more negative voltages.</p><p>We now clarify in the figure legend that fluorescence traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref> are normalized to allow kinetic comparison.</p><p>To fully understand the mechanism by which N-AT and other PUFA analogues activate the K<sub>v</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel, we need to develop means to reliably measure complete <italic>F</italic>(<italic>V</italic>) curves in future studies.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The discussion of the combined F-V and G-V data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the subsection “K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 channel dysfunction is caused by different underlying mechanisms” needs some work and it is not clear to me that S225L affects voltage-sensor activation and F351A affects pore opening.

We have now included some more discussion and added kinetic modeling to show that our proposed mechanisms for these two mutations are plausible. In this kinetic modeling, we have used the two models that our group has previously developed for wild type K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> channels (Osteen et al., 2012; Barro-Soria et al., 2014). These models are based on extensive data from many types of experiments (ionic currents, gating currents, fluorescence, linked constructs, complex voltage protocols). We feel that we have earlier extensively shown that the main reason for why the GV and FV overlap are that K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels open after only a subset of S4s are activated (Osteen et al., 2012). In contrast, I<sub>Ks</sub> channels need all four S4s to be activated before they open (Osteen et al., 2012; Barro-Soria et al., 2014). The main result supporting these two activation mechanisms is our data from linked K<sub>v</sub>7.1 subunits with different numbers of permanently activated S4s (Osteen et al. 2012). Linked K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels with two permanently activated S4s are open even at hyperpolarized potentials where the two wt S4s have clearly deactivated, showing that K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels open even with a subset of S4s activated. In contrast, the same linked construct co-expressed with KCNE1 is closed at hyperpolarized voltages, showing that I<sub>Ks</sub> channels don’t open after only a subset of S4s have activated. Using these two models, we can show that S225L can be explained in both models by just shifting the voltage dependence of the main S4 movement, whereas F351A can be explained in both models by just shifting the voltage dependence of opening. That the effects of each mutation can be explained in both the K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> models by changing a single parameter (different in each mutation) by the same amount is a strong argument for the robustness of the models and the proposed hypothesized mechanisms of the two mutations. Of course, more complex mechanisms of action of these mutations could also generate the same effects on the currents and fluorescence, but we here present the mechanisms we feel are the most simple that can explain most of the phenotypes.</p><p>Other models for K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> have been proposed, but none of these have been as extensively tested as ours and, in reality, these models fail some of our previous experimental tests. The model that is most similar to ours is the model from Jianmin Cui’s group (Zaydman et al., 2014). In principle, Jianmin’s and our models are very similar: the main difference is that their models have more states and ours are simplified versions of their models. Unfortunately, they use parameters from the model by Rudy and Silva (e.g. a slow S4 and a fast gate), which we have shown is not compatible with more complex triple pulse voltage protocols (Barro-Soria et al., 2014). So the actual parameters in their model would have to be refitted to more complex voltage protocols before their models can be used. However, we now acknowledge that there are other models for K<sub>v</sub>7.1 and I<sub>Ks</sub> and that our conclusions about the mechanism of the mutations are model dependent. However, independent of what models are used to describe the channel, it is clear from the differences in their effects on the fluorescence that these two mutations affect the channels by different mechanisms and that N-AT restores most of the function in both mutations.</p><p><italic>2) What is the logic of using N-AT instead of other PUFs the authors have previously studied? Given those studies, I would imagine N-AT might have substantial effects on other K<sub>v</sub> channels, and possibly even Nav and Cav channels. What makes the authors think that N-AT will have any selectivity for KCNQ? This feels like a stretch to imagine using these in humans at high μM concentrations.</italic> </p><p>We have toned down the clinical utility of N-AT and instead termed it as a good starting compound for future drug development. We use N-AT because it gives large robust effects. However, its affinity is not ideal. We have recently been able to combine, in novel PUFA compounds, the robust effects of N-AT with the higher affinity effects of other PUFAs. These compounds need further testing and will be presented in future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Expression in oocytes bypasses these problems due to the low incubation temperatures, so it is unclear whether these gating effects are relevant in the greater scheme of increasing overall current density at the mammalian cell surface. Do the authors know what the expression and biophysical characteristics are for these LQT mutants at physiological temperature compared with wild type to understand how N-AT may alter the abnormal functioning of these mutants?</italic> </p><p>We agree that trafficking could be a problem for these mutations. However, we do show that for all of the mutations there are gating defects that would be in addition to any putative trafficking effects. Our goal with N-AT is to restore the gating defects, not to restore any trafficking defects per se. We show in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> that N-AT can restore the function of all mutants, as measured by the current amplitude of wt channels in control solutions compared to mutant channels in N-AT solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In addition, in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, most reductions in current amplitude (if not all) can be explained by the gating defects caused by the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). So, in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, we don’t see much of any trafficking defect in these mutants.</p><p>However, as the reviewer points out, there might be trafficking defects in mammalian cells that are not present in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>. Other studies on trafficking and mammalian cells are now referred to (Eldstrom et al., 2010; Harmer et al., 2010). For any mutation that displays trafficking defects, one has to find a cure for this trafficking defect. However, this is outside of the scope of our study. But even if the trafficking is corrected, these mutants would also need to be corrected for their gating defect. Otherwise, one would end up with surface-expressed, defective I<sub>Ks</sub> channels, which could still cause arrhythmia. We now clearly state all these caveats and what N-AT could do to these mutants in these possible cases.</p><p><italic>2) There is a little bit of mixture of models in this study. Most experiments are carried out at room temperature in oocytes, but sometimes CHO cells are used for hKv11.1, derived cardiomyocytes and intact hearts are used for action potential and QT studies. Some data that could tie together studies in the different models would support the potential translational importance of the idea.</italic> </p><p>The data from CHO, cardiomyocytes, and intact hearts have been removed.</p><p><italic>3) The data from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and intact guinea-pig hearts are unconvincing. In the intact hearts it looks like other changes affect the early action potential to shorten it in the presence of N-AT. Changes in the isoelectric region of the EKG suggest a dispersion of action potential effects by N-AT. In intact hearts, the slope of phase 3 repolarization in the HMR+N-AT trace is shallower than in control or with HMR1556 alone. This suggests less net outward current when N-AT is added, the opposite of what is contended. Perhaps this is because N-AT blocks many other cardiac currents.</italic> </p><p>This data has been removed.</p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that PUFAs could provide a treatment option for LQTS, but there is a large literature on the effects of PUFAs on humans, in animal models and also on individual ion currents in heart showing that almost all ion currents, inward and outward, including I<sub>Kr</sub>, are decreased by PUFAs. The well-established exception is I<sub>Ks</sub>, but the overall effect on the QT interval duration could be pro- or antiarrhythmic depending on the physiology of the tissue and the pathology affecting the heart.</italic> </p><p>We have removed the QT interval data on cardiomyocytes and intact heart. We have toned down the therapeutic effect of N-AT and instead focused on the biophysical effect of PUFA analogues on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One topic that probably requires some additional clarification concerns the presentation of GVs and how the</italic> V<italic>50's and z values were generated. For many of the mutant GV curves, a saturating level of activation is never obtained, but the plotted GV curves are simply normalized to the maximum level of conductance. I think for some (many) readers this may give a misleading impression of what the relative conductances as a function of voltage may be among different constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, and others) or in response to N-AT application (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), since the assumption may be made that the voltage of the half maximal conductance after normalization corresponds to the true V50. Although sometimes it is natural to not trust the extrapolated gmax from a Boltzmann fit, plotting the GVs normalized to the fitted Gmax may be a better proxy for the true channel behavior. In such cases, the observed 0.5 level of conductance directly informs a reader of the approximate Vh, and it also informs the reader regarding changes in the slope, which may otherwise be obscured. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the normalization used by the authors probably tends to minimize the effects at the lower concentrations, while normalizing to the fitted gmax might avoid this. One might also ask in regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, since the control and N-AT tails are all measured in the same patches, why not use the maximal conductance with 70 μM N-AT as the basis for normalization? My concern regarding the GV displays and the estimates of Vh and z become most critical in regards to the DDG estimates (I think, as the process is described in the methods, this was done appropriately, but some clarifications about this might help).</italic> </p><p>We have changed the normalization in all graphs. We also better explain in text how we estimate the <italic>V</italic>50. The <italic>V</italic>50 is always determined from the fit, as suggested by the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
