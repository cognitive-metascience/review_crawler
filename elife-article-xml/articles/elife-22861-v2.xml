pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22861.001</object-id><p>The visual system consists of two major subsystems, image-forming circuits that drive conscious vision and non-image-forming circuits for behaviors such as circadian photoentrainment. While historically considered non-overlapping, recent evidence has uncovered crosstalk between these subsystems. Here, we investigated shared developmental mechanisms. We revealed an unprecedented role for light in the maturation of the circadian clock and discovered that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are critical for this refinement process. In addition, ipRGCs regulate retinal waves independent of light, and developmental ablation of a subset of ipRGCs disrupts eye-specific segregation of retinogeniculate projections. Specifically, a subset of ipRGCs, comprising ~200 cells and which project intraretinally and to circadian centers in the brain, are sufficient to mediate both of these developmental processes. Thus, this subset of ipRGCs constitute a shared node in the neural networks that mediate light-dependent maturation of the circadian clock and light-independent refinement of retinogeniculate projections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22861.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22861.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>melanopsin</kwd><kwd>circadian</kwd><kwd>suprachiasmatic nucleus</kwd><kwd>axonal refinement</kwd><kwd>lateral geniculate nucleus</kwd><kwd>ipRGC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM076430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattar</surname><given-names>Samer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY019053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattar</surname><given-names>Samer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattar</surname><given-names>Samer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

These diverse visual functions, both image- and non-image-forming, require the retina for the detection and the initial processing of light signals, which are then relayed to the brain via the output neurons of the eye, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The majority of RGCs project to image-forming centers in the brain, such as the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and the superior colliculus (SC). A subset of RGCs, however, is intrinsically photosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hattar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Provencio et al., 1998</xref>), in addition to receiving indirect light signals from the classical photoreceptors, rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lucas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mrosovsky and Hattar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). These intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) constitute the sole conduit of light information to non-image-forming centers in the brain, such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Güler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hattar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panda et al., 2003</xref>). ipRGCs drive non-image-forming behaviors even in the absence of rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Czeisler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Foster et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freedman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lucas et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1999</xref>). Early reports envisioned a strict separation between the image- and non-image-forming visual networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dreher and Robinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moore, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Young and Lund, 1994</xref>), but this view has begun to be challenged by recent evidence for functional crosstalk between the two systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Estevez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>During development, all RGCs must achieve precise central connections in the brain that are necessary for the generation of visual behaviors. Precise visual circuits emerge in a multistep process: axon guidance pathways establish a coarse level of organization, which are then refined in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo and Feller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oster and Sretavan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osterhout et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong, 1999</xref>). The image-forming visual system has been a classic model of activity-dependent refinement of neuronal circuits, and both light-dependent and independent mechanisms play critical roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubel et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meister et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shatz and Stryker, 1988</xref>). Refinement of the coarse projections of the RGCs to the dLGN is dependent on spontaneously generated neural activity, termed retinal waves. These retinal waves, with defined properties, sweep across the retina to instruct segregation of eye-specific projections to the dLGN and SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandrasekaran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feller, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Firth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLaughlin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meister et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mrsic-Flogel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Muir-Robinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shatz and Stryker, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, light detection through ipRGCs influences retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renna et al., 2011</xref>), although, eye-specific segregation still proceeds normally in the absence of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demas et al., 2006</xref>). In turn, retinal waves have been shown to modulate the intraretinal gap junction network of ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, light detection by ipRGCs has also been implicated in regulating developmental vascularization in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rao et al., 2013</xref>). However, it has not been determined whether ipRGCs have light-independent developmental roles or whether the developmental roles of ipRGCs have permanent functional consequences.</p><p>ipRGCs are best known for their ability to synchronize the circadian clock in the SCN to the solar day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Güler et al., 2008</xref>), a process known as circadian photoentrainment. The circadian clock contains an intrinsic genetic program that, in the absence of environmental light input, produces molecular and physiological rhythms with periods close to, but not exactly, 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Menaker et al., 1978</xref>). Due to the autonomous nature of the circadian clock, the prevailing view has been that the fundamental features of the clock in the SCN, such as period length, do not require environmental input for maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Menaker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis and Gorski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jud and Albrecht, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pittendrigh, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richter, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vallone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamazaki et al., 2002</xref>).

Since melanopsin is the only known marker for all ipRGCs, either an allele of Cre or LacZ is required at the melanopsin locus in order for ipRGCs to be labeled and quantified. Neither an anti-melanopsin antibody nor <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with a melanopsin probe can be utilized because Cre, LacZ, aDTA, and DTA replace the melanopsin gene and thus result in a knockout for melanopsin. However, retinal innervation of the SCN originates exclusively from ipRGCs and thus the extent of innervation can be used as a proxy for ipRGC loss. To determine whether two copies of DTA (<italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) would produce further ablation of ipRGCs, we therefore examined retinal innervation of the SCN as an indirect measure of ipRGC loss. We labeled all retinal projections by injecting fluorescently labeled cholera toxin subunitβ (CTB, a neuronal tracer) into the eyes and compared SCN innervation in 6-month-old wild-type, heterozygous (<italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic>), homozygous attenuated-DTA (<italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic>), and homozygous DTA (<italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Sparse retinal fibers were found in the SCN of heterozygous DTA mice (<italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic>) as observed in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/DTA</sup>; Z/AP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but these retinal fibers were entirely absent in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) suggesting that <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice have more extensive ipRGC loss than <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic> mice. The more substantial and earlier ipRGC loss in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice was also confirmed by examining SCN innervation using CTB injections in P7 wild-type, <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic>, and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Given the strength of DTA as a toxin, we assessed <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice for off-target effects. General retinal structure was evaluated by staining retinal sections from wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice with hematoxylin and eosin stains and additionally fluorescent staining for various retinal cell types, including cones, ON bipolar cells, calretinin-positive amacrine and ganglion cells, and Brn3a positive ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E–F</xref>). Wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice appeared similar by these stains, and quantification of total retinal thickness, as well as the thickness of each of the retinal layers, based on hematoxylin and eosin staining showed no difference between wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also counted the number of SMI-32-positive ganglion cells, Brn3a-positive ganglion cells, cones, and starburst amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>). When we compared wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice, there was no difference in cell number of any of these cell types. It is relevant to mention that about 50% of SMI-32 positive ganglion cells are actually M4 ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Estevez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>), which express lower levels of melanopsin compared to M1 ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sexton et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, expression of two copies of DTA from the melanopsin locus does not even succeed in killing all ipRGCs. Nonetheless, since we lack specific molecular markers for the other non-M1 ipRGC subtypes, we have no means of knowing the exact time course and extent of ablation for each of those subtypes. To assess potential off target effects in relevant brain regions, we counted the total number of nuclei (based on DAPI staining) and the total number of neurons (identified by antibody staining for Hu) in the SCN of wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice. There was no difference between wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice in the number of nuclei or neurons when compared in total or section by section through the SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the total size of the dLGN was also not different between wild-type and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice or among any other tested mouse lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4E</xref>).

In the <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/LacZ</sup></italic> mice, the ~500 remaining ipRGCs (~75 M1 ipRGCs) in heterozygous DTA animals, further lose their intrinsic photoresponses due to the loss of both melanopsin alleles and thus can only relay rod/cone input to the brain. In these mice, circadian responses to light were highly attenuated, with inconsistent entrainment and phase-shifting, and exhibited a free-running period comparable to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar to <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice did not photoentrain; however, they free-ran with an abnormally lengthened period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because full-strength DTA, but not aDTA, kills ipRGCs during early development, these findings suggested the hypothesis that ipRGCs act during early postnatal ages to establish a normal circadian period length.

Thus, loss of ipRGC innervation does not drastically alter SCN development, and it is possible the lengthened period stems from a loss of direct ipRGC-dependent regulation of SCN neurons. Alternatively, this effect could be due to altered input from the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), which also receives innervation by ipRGCs.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22861.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Developmental ablation of ipRGCs results in a lengthened circadian period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative actograms of wild-type, <italic>Opn4<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup>, Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/LacZ</sup></italic>, <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> and <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic> mice under 12:12-LD cycle and constant darkness (DD).

Our work reveals the unprecedented role that light plays in setting the circadian period and identified a regulatory component of the neural networks that regulate refinement of RGC projections to the thalamus.</p><p>The methods we used to ablate ipRGCs involve some inherent uncertainties. We used two different versions of diphtheria toxin subunit A with different potencies. As expected, the full-strength DTA was more efficient than was the attenuated form at killing ipRGCs, but it also ablated ipRGCs earlier in development. One concern of using two copies of the toxin gene is that even low leaky expression could lead to off-target cell death. We think this is unlikely since the toxin failed to ablate at least one ipRGC subtypes with low levels of melanopsin expression—the M4 cells. Moreover, loss of cells in the retina and retinofugal projections in the brain were consistent with selective loss of ipRGCs. However, it is always possible that DTA expression from the melanopsin locus causes a reduction in cell populations that we did not examine. Further, because DTA blocks protein translation, it could disrupt the function of some cells without actually killing them; the assays we performed do not distinguish between these forms of toxin action. In addition, technical limitations precluded full assessment the degree of cell loss for many ipRGC subtypes. We currently lack specific molecular markers for M2, M3, and M5 cells. Furthermore, dendritic stratification is key to distinguishing ipRGC subtypes, but DTA-dependent ipRGC loss occurs before dendritic arborizations are mature (between P10-P15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coombs et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is clear that, in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>Z-DTA/+</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Pou4f2</italic>-positive ipRGCs, which include all non-M1 ipRGCs, die early during development and yet, their death does not affect the circadian period or the segregation of RGC projections in the dLGN. Thus, despite some uncertainty about which ipRGCs types die in these mouse lines and when they do so, taken together our data support the view that early ablation of <italic>Pou4f2</italic>-negative M1 ipRGCs are sufficient to induce the effects reported here.</p><p>Our study indicates that contrary to the prevailing view that the circadian clock develops independent of environmental input, light is necessary for setting the intrinsic period of the circadian clock. When wild-type animals were raised in constant darkness, they exhibited a lengthened circadian period as was observed when mice were enucleated at P0 and when ipRGCs were ablated at early postnatal ages (<italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic>) but not when mice were enucleated at P60 or when ipRGCs were only ablated during adulthood (<italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Remarkably, when dark-reared mice were exposed to light for the first time during adulthood, their period length became indistinguishable from mice reared under a 12:12 LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This rescue indicates there is no critical developmental window during which the intrinsic properties of the circadian clock must be set by light. Moreover, once animals are exposed to light, the circadian period is irreversibly set. It will be of interest to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the lengthened period in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic>, P0 enucleates, and dark reared mice, and how light detection by ipRGCs induces a permanent change in the period length of the circadian clock.</p><p>We noticed that the phenotype exhibited by dark-reared animals was less penetrant than that of <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> and P0 enucleates. Though a majority of dark-reared animals (9 of 16) exhibited a lengthened period, the remainder did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, virtually all <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice and P0 enucleates exhibited lengthened circadian periods. One possible interpretation of this variability could be that the process of setting the circadian period is highly sensitive to light. This is supported by the fact that merely 3 hr of light exposure is sufficient to set the circadian period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Alternatively, some dark-reared animals could have been exposed to, say, very weak light occasionally leaking from night vision goggles or it is possible that, since ipRGCs depolarize during retinal waves, spontaneously derived activity can partially suffice for period setting. It would be interesting, in future studies, to dark rear mice that lack retinal waves and determine whether a higher proportion exhibit a lengthened period than dark-reared wild-type mice.</p><p>A surprising finding was that early genetic ablation of ipRGCs led to disrupted eye-specific segregation in the dLGN and reduced visual acuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). Even more surprisingly, our data implicated <italic>Pou4f2</italic>-negative M1 ipRGCs, which have been viewed as circadian photoreceptors, as being involved in the development of the image-forming visual system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>).

These results also suggested that the defects observed in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice are not due to the loss of direct ipRGC innervation of the dLGN, nor to a generalized reduction in the total number of RGCs.</p><p>It is possible that the segregation deficits observed in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA</sup></italic> mice are due to the altered spontaneous retinal activity that occurs in P6 <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice. The salient features of retinal waves appear to be comprised of correlated, patterned activity sweeping across the retina, instructive for the formation of retinofugal circuits in the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al. 2011</xref>), whereas the individual spiking properties of ganglion cells drive eye-specific segregation within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Speer et al., 2014</xref>). Many previous studies have examined mice with genetically or pharmacologically disrupted spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankenship et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stellwagen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Torborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al. 2011</xref>), yet, <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice are a unique instance of a manipulation that caused an increase in non-WAB firing while WAB activity remains highly correlated between pairs of RGCs. Connexin36/45 double knockouts, which have disrupted eye-specific segregation, exhibit increased tonic firing in RGCs, although correlated firing between RGCs is also highly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankenship et al., 2011</xref>). In ferret, disruption of patterned activity by the ablation of starburst amacrine cells altered correlated activity and a number of WAB bursting properties, yet eye-specific segregation proceeded normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Speer et al., 2014</xref>). Our data are consistent with this study, suggesting changes in spiking activity outside of WABs is critical for eye specific sectors within the dLGN.</p><p>The contribution of disrupted eye-specific segregation to reduced visual acuity has yet to be thoroughly investigated likely because many mutations or manipulations that cause disrupted eye-specific segregation also disrupt other functions of the visual system. For example, no b-wave (<italic>nob</italic>) mice have disrupted eye-specific segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Demas et al., 2006</xref>) and have behavioral deficits in visual acuity, but this more likely explained by their substantially altered ERG responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neuillé et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly eye injections of TTX or epibatidine would disrupt acuity for reasons other than disrupting eye-specific segregation. Nonetheless, β2 KO mice, which have eye-specific segregation deficits at P8 but not at P28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feller, 2002</xref>), have a substantial deficit in visual acuity in the optomotor response and by recordings of visually evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>), but exhibit no deficit in the Y-maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that the disrupted eye-specific segregation in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic> causes the reduction in visual acuity, but as discussed above, we cannot rule out the contribution of other roles for ipRGCs in retina.</p><p><italic>Pou4f2-</italic>negative M1 ipRGCs project intra-retinal axonal collaterals that synapse onto dopaminergic amacrine cells, and these projections are present by P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prigge et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also showed that ipRGCs are necessary for refinement of eye-specific axonal segregation in the LGN as well as normal visual acuity.

We were blind to genotype until data were processed and analyzed, as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renna et al., 2011</xref>). For this quantification method, 15 sections from the middle of the LGN were analyzed per adult mouse, per dLGN hemisphere. R-values were calculated for all pixels within each dLGN. This was done by selecting a region of interest that was maximally innervated by the contralateral eye and a region of interest that was maximally innervated by the ipsilateral eye. The R-distribution for maximally ipsilateral segregated pixels and maximally contralateral pixels were calculated and averaged across all 15 dLGN sections. Pixels with an R-value less than 99.9% of the maximally contra segregated pixels and more than 99.9% of all maximally ipsilateral segregated pixels were termed unsegregated pixels.</p><p>Similar to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Renna et al., 2011</xref>), we calculated the variance for each dLGN R-distribution.

In order to determine the number of neurons being sampled by each electrode, we filtered the raw digitized data using a 125 Hz high-pass filter. A threshold of 5 standard deviations from the baseline voltage was used as the criterion for a spike.

Firing properties were calculated from these data files using custom Visual Basic for Applications macros. Our calculations proceeded as follows, for each unit. First, units from invalid channels (as defined above) were excluded from further analysis. Second, bursts shorter than 0.75 s or longer than 15 s were also excluded, although their constituent spikes were kept for later firing rate calculations. Third, bursts that started less than half of the maximum burst duration (7.5 s) after the recording started or that ended less than that duration before the recording ended were excluded from further analysis. This ensured that interrupted WABs—WABs that occurred while the recording was being started or stopped—were not analyzed. The constituent spike timestamps of these bursts were also kept for later firing rate calculations.</p><p>WABs were identified as follows. All bursts were divided into 10 bins of equal duration. For a given burst, if the start of at least one of its bins was within a time interval Δt of the start of any bin of a different burst, then those two bursts were said to be ‘associated’. The interval Δt was equal to half of the sum of the two bursts’ bin-durations. If a burst was associated with a burst on at least two neighboring channels, then it was classified as a WAB, where a channel’s ‘neighboring channels’ were any of the eight channels physically surrounding it on the MEA grid. Bursts could not be associated with bursts on the same unit or the same channel, and a burst could not be associated with a burst from multiple units on a single neighboring channel. Finally, spiking property values for an entire retina were taken as the average over all of its units’ values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>For spiking properties, we employed two-tailed Student’s T-tests assuming unequal variance for each property, with a significance level of α = 0.05.

At the end of one arm, a gray panel in displayed and in the other arm, sine wave grating is displayed. Mice were trained, using gratings with a low SF, to associate the gratings with a hidden platform that allows them to escape from the water. The location of the grey panel and gratings with the hidden platform were moved between the arms in a pseudorandom pattern that mice cannot memorize. Any entrances into the arm containing the grey panel were recorded as incorrect, after the mice could reliably swim to the platform with greater that 90% accuracy, the SF of the gratings was increased. An animal’s threshold was considered to have been reached once they failed to have better than 70% accuracy out of 10 trials. This threshold was confirmed by retesting the previous SF, which is 0.02cycles/degree lower, and then retesting the spatial frequency that the mice initially failed. If the mouse’s behavior repeated where they could see the lower SF, but not one increment higher, then the visual acuity of that mouse was recorded as the last spatial frequency where they had better than 70% accuracy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Marnie Halpern, Carla Shatz, Rejji Kuruvilla, Tiffany Schmidt, and Alan Rupp for their critical reading and advice on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents evidence that a small number of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) regulate development of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and eye specific segregation of projections to the geniculate in early development with consequences for the period of circadian clock and visual acuity. The primary evidence for this conclusion comes from comparisons between a number of transgenic mice using different versions of the diphtheria toxin cytotoxic lesion of ipRGCs. They present a new model – opn4DTA – and associated evidence that it has a more complete and earlier onset deletion of ipRGCs than is the case for opn4aDTA animals. In other respects, the phenotype of these two animals as hemizygotes is broadly similar but when homozygous for the toxin, DTA mice have longer circadian period and disrupted segregation of LGN projections compared to aDTA mice. The authors attribute these findings to an early loss of all ipRGCs in the DTA mice. Another model used (<italic>Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3b<sup>zDTA</sup></italic>) allows 200 M1 ipRGCs targeting the SCN to survive. This animal has normal period and a normal thalamic projection. The authors conclude that these few ipRGCs can control development. They show that dark rearing (and early enucleation) also lengthens circadian period but does not phenocopy effects of ipRGC loss on the thalamic projection.</p><p>The differences in phenotype between the mouse lines appear robust and the authors are to be complimented on the care taken in their documentation and description. The demonstration that circadian period is impacted by dark rearing and that this effect is so readily reversed is very interesting in itself.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Enthusiasm for this work is constrained by the limited description of the phenotype of the DTA/DTA mouse. The manuscript is built around a comparison of this mouse with other transgenic lines yet we do not know how complete the lesion of ipRGCs is in this genotype, the developmental time course of their loss, or how specific the lesion is to ipRGCs. Without answers to these questions it is hard to draw definitive conclusions. The authors attribute differences reported between DTA/DTA and aDTA/aDTA or DTA mice to a more complete loss of ipRGCs. This may be a reasonable supposition but we do not know for sure either that there is a more complete loss early in development or that the DTA/DTA does not have off target effects on other important cell types. As the only marker of ipRGCs is melanopsin, there is no way of identifying ipRGCs in the DTA/DTA mice. The only way of measuring ipRGC loss in this genotype is by looking at projections to the SCN. These are lost at 6 months showing that lesion of this projection in adults is more complete, but we do not know whether that is true for other ipRGC types (which express less melanopsin and might therefore be more resistant) or whether the lesion is more complete also at early stages of development. More importantly, this method is also not appropriate for looking at off target effects. It is common for transgenes to have some 'leaky' expression in cells other than those targeted. How confident can the authors be that DTA is not also killing other cells? If it were then this could provide an alternative explanation for the observations.</p><p>2) Another important question is whether the DTA mice have the same strain background as other lines? This is not clear from the methods.</p><p>3) There are a couple of other instances of over interpretation. The evidence that 200 ipRGCs are sufficient to support development comes from lack of phenotype in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3b<sup>zDTA</sup></italic>. To interpret that observation, we need to know the time course of ipRGC loss in this genotype and in DTA/DTA. If brn3b+ve ipRGCs survive longer in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3b<sup>zDTA</sup></italic> than in DTA/DTA that would provide an alternative explanation for this effect.</p><p>4) The authors show deficits in acuity by optomotor and swim maze tests in DTA/DTA mice compared to wild type and <italic>Opn4<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic>mice. They interpret this as an impact of poor eye segregation. That is not the only possible explanation for those data. Loss of ipRGCs could impact acuity because lack of entrainment means that animals were tested at different circadian phases, the pupil is more dilated, direct influences of ipRGCs on retinal function are lost, or some as yet undefined impact of ipRGCs on vision is absent.</p><p>5) The authors encourage the reader to pull together the circadian and visual effects as instances of convergence between image-forming (IF) and non-image-forming (NIF) visual systems in development. Are effects on the clock and thalamic projections in any mechanistic sense linked? They both occur in DTA/DTA mice, but while the projection phenotype is clearly an error in optic nerve development, that seems not to be the case for the SCN. The SCN, but not LGN, effect can be phenocopied by dark rearing (unlike the projection deficit) and disappears immediately upon light exposure. As it is rapidly reversible, this not an error in development of anatomy or connectivity (authors present additional evidence that these are normal). If these are two quite separate effects on development how does presenting these in the IF vs NIF dichotomy help the reader to interpret?</p><p>6) The Introduction and Abstract present the logic for the study in terms of the growing evidence of blurred distinction between NIF and IF vision in adults and the need to ask whether this also the case in development? This leads the reader to link effects on the clock and thalamus in ways that may not be appropriate (see above). A much more direct motivation for the study is the growing reports that melanopsin and/or ipRGCs regulate retinal development (see papers by Copenhagen/Lang and Berson groups). Building from that literature would better place this work in context of the current state of knowledge.</p><p>7) It seems from the data presented that overlap of projections from 2 eyes is reduced in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3b<sup>zDTA</sup></italic> compared to wild types. Is this true?</p><p>8) The requirement for very few (200) ipRGCs to assist eye-specific segregation may not be very surprising given the dendritic coverage of these cells (big) and the fact that they are a &quot;net&quot;, for photoreception, not a high acuity system for detailed analysis. The original &quot;splash&quot; regarding ipRGCs impacting eye-specific segregation (and retinal waves) was published by Renna et al., 2011. The results presented here are different but the novelty resides in the &quot;200&quot; aspect which, while interesting, is hard to set in context. What if it had been 300 or 500? Is the number past 1 relevant?</p><p>9) Given the retinal wave phenotype in the Renna et al., 2011 paper, do the authors have any evidence relevant to this phenotype?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A subset of ipRGCs regulates both maturation of the circadian clock and segregation of retinogeniculate projections in mice&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>This revision is much improved by additional data dealing with the major issues with the original submission and some changes in presentation. Phenotypes for the various mouse lines are clear and well described. We reiterate however that a weakness of the study design is that two important bits of information for interpreting the data are fundamentally unknowable – what happens to ipRGCs of all types in the DTA/DTA and aDTA/aDTA animals, and whether there are off target effects on other cells in the retina and/or brain of these transgenes. The authors have addressed these questions with more data that are consistent with their preferred interpretation, that the DTA/DTA ablation of ipRGCs occurs earlier and is more extensive than in aDTA/aDTA, and that there is no off target effect. We would prefer a more balanced coverage of these critical questions, the authors present the positive evidence for their interpretation but do not give the limitations of their data appropriate coverage. A paragraph in the Discussion describing what they cannot know and what alternative explanations for their data this allows would be helpful for the reader.</p><p>One note to authors: the reply to other reviews has in several places, a &quot;we told you before, in the previous version&quot; tone. This is a source of opaqueness in the paper too; we suggest the authors consider the possibility that the reviewers misunderstood in part because the presentation was not clear and/or there are a lot of conditional mutants. This is not a simple and straightforward study, which requires like any challenging conversation, more clarity, not less. We recommend they consider how the reader will interpret their findings and think hard about striving for more clarity about novelty and methodology for the non-expert.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22861.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Enthusiasm for this work is constrained by the limited description of the phenotype of the DTA/DTA mouse.</italic> </p><p>This is a surprising comment since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> of the original manuscript included a thorough description of the <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mouse.

It is true that we have not specifically tested the <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice, but we have tested the heterozygous mice extensively and across developmental timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). In fact, in the original submission we included data documenting ipRGC loss in mice that expressed, from the melanopsin locus, one copy of the toxin (either aDTA or DTA) and one copy of a marker to identify ipRGCs and their projections (either Cre combined with an alkaline phosphatase reporter, or tau-LacZ). We used mice heterozygous for either aDTA or DTA to establish the extent and timing of ipRGC ablation, which in mice homozygous for the toxin should be either the same or faster and/or more extensive than in mice heterozygous for toxin. However, now, we have added data that directly assess the effect on the homozygous animals. As suggested, we injected CTB in P4 pups, harvested brain tissue at P7, and imaged retinal innervation of the SCN in WT, <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic>, and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice. These new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (new panel B), and clearly show the earlier, more substantial ablation of SCN projecting ipRGCs in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice compared to both WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic>.</p><p> <italic>As the only marker of ipRGCs is melanopsin, there is no way of identifying ipRGCs in the DTA/DTA mice. The only way of measuring ipRGC loss in this genotype is by looking at projections to the SCN. These are lost at 6 months showing that lesion of this projection in adults is more complete, but we do not know whether that is true for other ipRGC types (which express less melanopsin and might therefore be more resistant) or whether the lesion is more complete also at early stages of development.</italic> </p><p>As described above, to specifically answer the early stages of development loss, we have now carried out the experiment examining SCN innervation in postnatal Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> new panel B).</p><p>In terms of examining loss of specific ipRGCs subtypes, it is important to note that the reviewers are correct that assessment of ipRGC projections to the SCN specifically provides information regarding ablation of M1 ipRGCs. Determining the timeline of ablation of specific ipRGC subtypes during development is not possible since the subtypes cannot be accurately identified until dendrite arborization is complete, which is between P10-P15 (Coombs, Van Der List and Chalupa, 2007) and after cell loss is complete in Opn4<sup>DTA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We can make inferences about the proportion M1 and non-M1 ipRGC subtypes that persist based on adult cell counts that were performed in mice heterozygous for toxin and included in the original submission. In mice with one copy of a toxin and one copy of Cre combined with an alkaline phosphatase reporter, we counted the total number of ipRGCs that survive toxin expression (~1500 cells in <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic> mice and ~500 cells <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice). We also counted the number of M1 cells that survive, which is ~150 in aDTA mice and ~75 in DTA mice. Thus, about ~1350 non-M1 ipRGCs persist in mice with one copy of aDTA, and about ~425 non-M1 ipRGCs persist in mice with one of copy DTA. This is consistent with the knowledge that M1 ipRGCs express the most melanopsin and therefore express the most toxin and undergo the most substantial ablation.</p><p>However, the reviewers, of course, are asking about loss of specific non-M1 ipRGC subtypes in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> animals. Without a copy of melanopsin (or a reporter for melanopsin expression), we have no way of labeling the ipRGCs and their dendrites in order to identify the number of remaining ipRGCs of each subtype. Thus, to address this question, we must use molecular markers for ipRGCs subtypes. While the field has been attempting to discover molecular markers for each ipRGC subtype for many years now, there has been minimal success. However, one marker, which identifies the M4 subtype, has been discovered: a protein called SMI-32. SMI-32 was historically a marker of ON and OFF α ganglion cells. With the realization that ON α cells are one and the same as M4 ipRGCs, a marker for M4 ipRGC was identified (Estevez et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2014). It is worth noting that all M4 cells are SMI-32 positive, but since SMI-32 also labels OFF α cells, about 50% of SMI-32 positive ganglion cells are melanopsin expressing (Schmidt et al., 2014). We actually included SMI-32 staining in WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice in the original submission, but did not highlight that it was also labeling M4 ipRGCs. We have done so now. We detected no difference in the number of SMI-32 positive cells in DTA/DTA compared to WT controls. Thus, many, if not all, M4 ipRGCs persist in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice, which is consistent with there still being AP positive ipRGCs in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/DTA</sup></italic>; Z/AP mice and M4 ipRGCs expressing less melanopsin than M1s (Sexton and Van Gelder 2015). We have included a new section in the Results to describe this point.</p><p>The major contribution of our data is the demonstration that Brn3b negative M1 ipRGCs are important for both the maturation of the circadian clock and eye-specific segregation. We now have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that these cells are ablated in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice. Thus, we feel that an exhaustive assessment of which non-M1 ipRGCs die in the <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA</sup></italic> and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA</sup></italic> lines does not further augment the conclusions of this of study.</p><p><italic>More importantly, this method is also not appropriate for looking at off target effects. It is common for transgenes to have some 'leaky' expression in cells other than those targeted. How confident can the authors be that DTA is not also killing other cells? If it were then this could provide an alternative explanation for the observations.</italic> </p><p>Off-target cell loss due to leaky expression of DTA was initially also a major concern for us, and thus, we conducted a myriad of experiments to prove to ourselves, and hopefully future readers, that this concern is unwarranted. We actually included much of this data in the original submission (shown in current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, E-J</xref>). We have now include additional data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also expanded our description of these data in the main text of the manuscript. Since it is obviously not possible to account for every individual cell in the whole organism, we can most generally report that the <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice are viable, fertile, and do not exhibit any gross abnormalities in size. This information has been added to the paper. More specifically, we focused on evaluating the retina and the brain regions most relevant to this study. General retinal structure was assessed by staining retinal sections from WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice with H&amp;E stain and additionally fluorescent staining for various retinal cells type, including cones, ON bipolar cells, calretinin positive amacrine and ganglion cells, and Brn3a positive ganglion cells. We have now quantified the total retinal thickness as well as the thickness of each of the retinal layers of WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> based on H&amp;E staining (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Comparison of WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> retinas showed no difference in total retinal thickness or the thickness of any of the individual retinal layers. We also counted the number of SMI-32 positive ganglion cells, Brn3a positive ganglion cells, cones, and starburst amacrine cells. When we compared WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice, there was no difference in cell number of any of these cell types. Also, as mentioned above, about 50% of SMI-32 positive ganglion cells are actually M4 ipRGCs, which means that expression of two copies of DTA from the melanopsin locus does not even ablate all ipRGCs. This fact helped convince us that there is no off-target killing of non-ipRGC cells. Nonetheless, we did further tests to verify there were no off-target effects outside the retina. We counted the total number of nuclei (based on DAPI staining) and the total number of neurons (identified by antibody staining for Hu) in the SCN of WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice. There was no difference between WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> in the number of nuclei or neurons when compared in total or section by section through the SCN. These new data are in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. We have now also measured the total size of the dLGN, which was also not different between WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice, or between any other tested mouse line. These new data are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> new panel E. We hope the reviewers agree that the combination of the data presented in the original submission and our new measurements thoroughly and rigorously demonstrates there is no off-target killing of non-ipRGCs in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice.</p><p><italic>2) Another important question is whether the DTA mice have the same strain background as other lines? This is not clear from the methods.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that this is an important point. We apologize for not including this information in the original submission. We strived to have all the mice on similar strain backgrounds as possible; although, it is challenging to have identical backgrounds considering the number of crosses performed for this study. All mice were either on C56BL/6J or a C56BL/6J – 129/J hybrid background. This information has been added to mouse strain table in the supplementary information (See updated table of mouse lines). We would like to stress that we always strain matched the control group and the most meaningful comparisons (for example WT, <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA</sup></italic>, dark reared, and enucleated mice were all on the pure B6 background). In terms of circadian biology the C56BL/6 and 129/J strains are very similar (Schwartz and Zimmerman 1990), and there have been no reported differences in eye specific segregation nor did we observe any differences between pure C56BL/6J and mice on a mixed background.</p><p><italic>3) There are a couple of other instances of over interpretation. The evidence that 200 ipRGCs are sufficient to support development comes from lack of phenotype in Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3b<sup>zDTA</sup>. To interpret that observation, we need to know the time course of ipRGC loss in this genotype and in DTA/DTA. If brn3b+ve ipRGCs survive longer in Opn4<sup>Cre</sup> Brn3bzDTA than in DTA/DTA that would provide an alternative explanation for this effect.</italic> </p><p>We actually included the developmental timecourse of ablation in the <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Brn3b<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> (now called <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> in the revised manuscript) animals in the original submission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and showed that ipRGC ablation is already complete by P7. Thus, the timing brn3b positive ipRGCs cell loss is comparable in DTA and <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> mice. ipRGC ablation may even be a bit faster in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> mice and is also known to include ablation of the M4 population (Schmidt et al., 2014). In fact, more ipRGCs are ablated in these animals than the DTA line and yet no segregation deficits are observed in the <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> animals.</p><p><italic>4) The authors show deficits in acuity by optomotor and swim maze tests in DTA/DTA mice compared to wild type and Opn4<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup>mice. They interpret this as an impact of poor eye segregation. That is not the only possible explanation for those data. Loss of ipRGCs could impact acuity because lack of entrainment means that animals were tested at different circadian phases, the pupil is more dilated, direct influences of ipRGCs on retinal function are lost, or some as yet undefined impact of ipRGCs on vision is absent.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers make a good point here, and thus, we have added a discussion of alternative explanations regarding the reduction in acuity. However, the loss of acuity in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice cannot be explained by a loss of photoentrainment because <italic>Opn4<sup>aDTA/aDTA</sup></italic> mice, which also free run, do not exhibit such a substantial reduction in acuity. <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic> mice, which do photoentrain also exhibited deficits in visual acuity. Furthermore, when the pupil is fully dilated with Carbocal there is only a minor reduction in acuity and it is not comparable to the substantial deficits that we observed in <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/+</sup></italic> mice. Nonetheless, direct effects of ipRGCs on retinal functions, including the role of M1 ipRGCs in regulating dopamine in the retina, could contribute. We have now discussed these points in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors encourage the reader to pull together the circadian and visual effects as instances of convergence between image-forming (IF) and non-image-forming (NIF) visual systems in development. Are effects on the clock and thalamic projections in any mechanistic sense linked? They both occur in DTA/DTA mice, but while the projection phenotype is clearly an error in optic nerve development, that seems not to be the case for the SCN. The SCN, but not LGN, effect can be phenocopied by dark rearing (unlike the projection deficit) and disappears immediately upon light exposure. As it is rapidly reversible, this not an error in development of anatomy or connectivity (authors present additional evidence that these are normal). If these are two quite separate effects on development how does presenting these in the IF vs NIF dichotomy help the reader to interpret?</italic> </p><p>We presented the IF vs NIF dichotomy because we were very surprised that the population of ipRGCs (the Brn3b negative M1 ipRGCs), which project exclusively to NIF brain regions, are also sufficient for the refinement of retinal ganglion cell projections the LGN. This single population appears to have both light dependent functions (circadian period setting) and light independent functions (modulation of spontaneous retinal activity; see point 9). We feel this is a critical point from our work; however, we agree that we could make this much clearer and that our presentation in the original submission could mislead readers. We do not want readers to think there is mechanistic overlap between circadian period setting and refinement of eye-specific segregation, but rather that a single cell type acts through very different mechanisms (light dependent and light independent) to affect the development of both the NIF and IF systems. We think that the addition of retinal wave recordings (see point 9) will help make this clearer, but we have also modified the Introduction and Discussion to hopefully better highlight the conclusions that we aim to make.</p><p><italic>6) The Introduction and Abstract present the logic for the study in terms of the growing evidence of blurred distinction between NIF and IF vision in adults and the need to ask whether this also the case in development? This leads the reader to link effects on the clock and thalamus in ways that may not be appropriate (see above). A much more direct motivation for the study is the growing reports that melanopsin and/or ipRGCs regulate retinal development (see papers by Copenhagen/Lang and Berson groups). Building from that literature would better place this work in context of the current state of knowledge.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point, and we now have modified the Introduction with the established roles for ipRGCs in retinal development in mind.</p><p><italic>7) It seems from the data presented that overlap of projections from 2 eyes is reduced in opn4cre brn3bzdta compared to wild types. Is this true?</italic> </p><p>There is no statistical difference by a one-way ANOVA and this is now stated in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>8) The requirement for very few (200) ipRGCs to assist eye-specific segregation may not be very surprising given the dendritic coverage of these cells (big) and the fact that they are a &quot;net&quot;, for photoreception, not a high acuity system for detailed analysis. The original &quot;splash&quot; regarding ipRGCs impacting eye-specific segregation (and retinal waves) was published by Renna et al., 2011. The results presented here are different but the novelty resides in the &quot;200&quot; aspect which, while interesting, is hard to set in context. What if it had been 300 or 500? Is the number past 1 relevant?</italic> </p><p>Our point is not that 200 cells is a magic number, but rather that the subset of ipRGCs, which project exclusively to circadian brain regions (the SCN and the IGL) and have intraretinal axonal collaterals, is sufficient to mediate circadian clock maturation and refinement of retinal ganglion cell projections to the LGN. The role of light in the maturation of the circadian clock is surprising; however, the role of this subset of ipRGCs in that process is logical, since they obviously project to the SCN. Yet, the experiments with <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Pou4f2<sup>zDTA/+</sup></italic> mice are critical to show that ipRGCs are not functioning within the LGN to mediate eye-specific segregation (see point 9 below). In the original submission, we implied that this subset must be acting within the retina to mediate eye-specific segregation. With the addition of recordings of retinal waves in WT and <italic>Opn4<sup>DTA/DTA</sup></italic> mice (see next point) we have corroborated this conclusion. We have also modified the text to better emphasize that 200 cells is not the key point, but rather one specialized subset mediates both of these seemingly distinct development processes.</p><p><italic>9) Given the retinal wave phenotype in the Renna et al., 2011 paper, do the authors have any evidence relevant to this phenotype?</italic> </p><p>Renna et al. demonstrated that light (detect by melanopsin) alters duration of bursting during retinal waves. However, independent of light ipRGCs also depolarized during retinal waves. Thus, we have now included an assessment of retinal wave in darkness in P6 WT and DTA/DTA mice using multielectrode recordings. These data are now presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-H</xref> and raw numbers and p values are shown in new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Spiking properties of RGCs during waves were significantly altered in DTA/DTA mice. Wave-associated bursts were significantly longer in duration, and had higher firing rates, more total spikes and shorter inter-burst intervals than they did in wild-type controls. There were also significantly more spikes outside of bursts. Correlated spiking activity between neurons was very similar between the genotypes, as measured by the spike time tiling. These data indicate that ipRGCs are critical for normal retinal wave activity, even in darkness, and together with our anatomical findings, allow us to suggest that ipRGCs mediate eye-specific segregation of RGC projections to the dLGN by regulating the spiking properties of conventional RGCs during retinal waves.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>This revision is much improved by additional data dealing with the major issues with the original submission and some changes in presentation. Phenotypes for the various mouse lines are clear and well described. We reiterate however that a weakness of the study design is that two important bits of information for interpreting the data are fundamentally unknowable – what happens to ipRGCs of all types in the DTA/DTA and aDTA/aDTA animals, and whether there are off target effects on other cells in the retina and/or brain of these transgenes. The authors have addressed these questions with more data that are consistent with their preferred interpretation, that the DTA/DTA ablation of ipRGCs occurs earlier and is more extensive than in aDTA/aDTA, and that there is no off target effect. We would prefer a more balanced coverage of these critical questions, the authors present the positive evidence for their interpretation but do not give the limitations of their data appropriate coverage. A paragraph in the Discussion describing what they cannot know and what alternative explanations for their data this allows would be helpful for the reader.</italic> </p><p>We have accepted the suggestion and have added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“A key method in this study was the use of two different versions of diphtheria toxin subunit A that have different potencies, the attenuated versus the full strength forms. [...] Together, although we cannot fully eliminate the possibility of off target effects of the DTA line, we believe this is unlikely.”</p><p><italic>One note to authors: the reply to other reviews has in several places, a &quot;we told you before, in the previous version&quot; tone. This is a source of opaqueness in the paper too; we suggest the authors consider the possibility that the reviewers misunderstood in part because the presentation was not clear and/or there are a lot of conditional mutants. This is not a simple and straightforward study, which requires like any challenging conversation, more clarity, not less. We recommend they consider how the reader will interpret their findings and think hard about striving for more clarity about novelty and methodology for the non-expert.</italic> </p><p>We truly apologize if we presented our responses as “we told you before.” We agree that this is a large study with many different mutant lines and manipulations, in addition to covering two different areas, circadian and vision. In our previous response, we aimed to highlight the areas where the concerns raised by the reviewers have been addressed in our original submission. We certainly strive to improve the clarity of our publications. Therefore, we have made several changes throughout the manuscript, which we hope improve the clarity of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
