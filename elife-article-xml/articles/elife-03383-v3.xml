A key downstream component of Ft signaling is the atypical myosin Dachs (D). Multiple regions of the intracellular domain of Ft have been implicated in regulating growth and PCP but how Ft regulates D is not known. Mutations in <italic>Fbxl7</italic>, which encodes an F-box protein, result in tissue overgrowth and abnormalities in proximodistal patterning that phenocopy deleting a specific portion of the intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft that regulates both growth and PCP. Fbxl7 binds to this same portion of the Ft ICD, co-localizes with Ft to the proximal edge of cells and regulates the levels and asymmetry of D at the apical membrane. Fbxl7 can also regulate the trafficking of proteins between the apical membrane and intracellular vesicles. Thus Fbxl7 functions in a subset of pathways downstream of Ft and links Ft to D localization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03383.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03383.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03383.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Multi-cellular organisms are made up of cells that are organized into tissues and organs that reach a predictable size and shape at the end of their development. To do this, cells must be able to sense their position and orientation within the body and know when to stop growing.</p><p>Epithelial cells—which make up the outer surface of an animal's body and line the cavities of its internal organs—connect to each other to form flat sheets. These sheets of cells contain structures that are oriented along the plane of the sheet. However, how this so-called ‘planar cell polarity’ coordinates with cell growth in order to build complex tissues and organs remains to be discovered.</p><p>A protein called Fat is a major player in both planar cell polarity and the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls cell growth. As such, the Fat protein appears to be crucial for controlling the size and shape of organs. Mutations in the Fat protein cause massive tissue overgrowth, prevent planar cell polarity being established correctly, and stop the legs and wings of fruit flies developing normally.</p><p>The Fat protein also plays a role in distributing another protein called Dachs—which is also part of the Hippo signaling pathway. In epithelial cells of the developing wing, Dachs is mostly located on the side of the cell that is closest to the tip of the developing wing (the so-called ‘distal surface’). How Fat and Dachs work together is not understood, but it is known that they do not bind to each other directly.</p><p>Now, Bosch et al. show that in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Fat protein binds to another protein called Fbxl7. Flies that cannot produce working Fbxl7 have defects in some aspects of planar cell polarity and a modest increase in tissue growth. Fbxl7 seems to account for part, but not all, of the ability of Fat to restrict tissue growth. Furthermore, a lack of the Fbxl7 protein results in a spreading of Dachs protein across the apical surface—which faces out of the epithelial sheet—of epithelial cells. On the other hand, if Fbxl7 is over-expressed, Dachs is driven to the interior of each cell. Hence, a normal level of Fbxl7 protein restricts the Dachs protein to the correct parts of the cell surface.</p><p>Together, the findings of Bosch et al. show that the Fbxl7 protein is a key link between the Fat and Dachs proteins. These results also provide an understanding of how growth and planar cell polarity—two processes that are essential for normal development of all multi-cellular organisms—are coordinated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03383.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03383.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>cadherin</kwd><kwd>vesicle</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM61672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>120366-RP-11-078-01-DDC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosch</surname><given-names>Justin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The F-box protein Fbxl7 is a direct effector of the protocadherin Fat and functions in downstream pathways that regulate tissue shape and size.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An important goal for developmental biologists is to understand how organs achieve a predictable size and shape at the end of their development. The Hippo signaling pathway has emerged as a key regulator of organ size (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halder and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tapon and Harvey, 2012</xref>). While most components of this pathway were originally discovered using genetic screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mammalian orthologs of those genes perform similar functions. Additionally, mutations in several components of the pathway have been described in human cancers. An exciting aspect of the Hippo pathway is that its growth-regulating activity can be modulated by cell-surface proteins that are capable of binding to ligands expressed on adjacent cells. Such interactions may be especially important for achieving precise control of growth at a local level that is necessary for generating the detailed features of an organ.</p><p>Of the proteins that regulate the Hippo pathway, much research has focused on the protocadherin Fat (Ft). In addition to regulating growth, Ft also regulates planar cell polarity (PCP), oriented cell division and proximodistal patterning of appendages (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomas and Strutt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</xref>) and its regulated activity therefore impacts the size and shape of organs. The Ft protein localizes to the cell membrane just apical to the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). It has a large extracellular domain composed of 34 cadherin domains as well as 4 EGF-like domains and 2 laminin G domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahoney et al., 1991</xref>) that binds to another large cadherin, Dachsous (Ds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 1995</xref>), on adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>). Ft–Ds interactions are modulated by the kinase Four-Jointed (Fj), which resides in the Golgi and phosphorylates the extracellular domains of both Ft and Ds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brittle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simon et al., 2010</xref>). Both Ds and Fj are expressed in gradients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs where they function in patterning the disc along a major axis (e.g., equatorial to polar or proximodistal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>While cadherins are known to have important functions in cell–cell adhesion, a key aspect of Ft function is its role as a signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</xref>). Ft regulates the Hippo pathway in two ways. First, Ft influences the protein levels of Warts (Wts), a kinase that regulates the activity and subcellular location of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rauskolb et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, mutations in <italic>ft</italic> disrupt the localization of Expanded (Ex), a FERM-domain protein that functions upstream of Hippo (Hpo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willecke et al., 2006</xref>), though other studies suggest Ft and Ex act in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng and Irvine, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A key downstream target of Ft is the atypical myosin Dachs (D). The strong overgrowth elicited by <italic>ft</italic> mutations can be completely suppressed by loss of D function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, PCP defects in <italic>ft</italic> mutants are partially rescued by loss of D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). D localizes to the apical membrane where, in cells of the wing disc, it localizes preferentially to the distal edge of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambegaonkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>ft</italic> mutants, increased levels of D are observed apically and D is redistributed around the entire perimeter of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). However, the overall levels of D protein are not obviously changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). It has been proposed that Ft restricts growth by negatively regulating the levels of D at the apical membrane and that it regulates the D-dependent PCP functions by maintaining D asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>An important gap in our current understanding of Ft function is how Ft regulates the levels and localization of D at the apical membrane. Ft does not bind to D itself, indicating that there must be one or more proteins that bind to Ft and mediate its regulation of D localization at the membrane. In an attempt to identify signaling pathways downstream of Ft, several recent studies have made systematic deletions in the intracellular domain (ICD) of Ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bossuyt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). These deletion studies implicate multiple non-overlapping regions in the ICD that differentially affect growth, PCP and organ shape, suggesting that Ft signals via multiple effector pathways. Additionally, several proteins have been shown to bind to the Ft ICD including the transcriptional repressor Atrophin/Grunge which regulates PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanto et al., 2003</xref>), the novel protein Lowfat that regulates Ft protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2009</xref>), and the casein kinase I protein Discs overgrown (Dco) that phosphorylates the Ft ICD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng and Irvine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sopko et al., 2009</xref>). Also, the palmitoyltransferase approximated (App) is needed for D localization to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</xref>). However, for each of these proteins, their role in mediating the regulation of D levels or asymmetry by Ft is not well understood.</p><p>Here we describe the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the <italic>Fbxl7</italic> gene, which encodes an F-box protein and is a novel component of the Ft signaling pathway. Inactivation of <italic>Fbxl7</italic> results in increased tissue growth via the Hippo pathway and abnormalities in wing shape and proximodistal patterning of appendages. Fbxl7 localizes preferentially to the proximal edge of cells in the wing pouch where it binds to and co-localizes with Ft. We find a role for Fbxl7 in one of the growth-suppressing signaling pathways downstream of Ft and also demonstrate a role for Fbxl7 in regulating the amount of D at the apical membrane as well as its distribution around the edge of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fbxl7 functions as a negative regulator of tissue growth and modulates signaling via the Hippo pathway</title><p>In two different genetic screens, one for mutations that caused cells to outgrow their neighbors (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tapon et al., 2001</xref>) and another for mutations that enabled cells to promote the elimination of their slower-growing neighbors by cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hafezi et al., 2012</xref>), we identified mutant alleles of the <italic>Drosophila Fbxl7</italic> gene (<italic>CG4221</italic>), which encodes a protein with an F-box and 11 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Fbxl7 has a conserved human ortholog (FBXL7<italic>)</italic> that shares 49% amino acid identity over the region spanning the F-box and the LRRs. Most proteins with these motifs function as part of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase, a protein complex which polyubiquitylates substrate proteins and targets them for degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). A third allele was identified fortuitously in an unrelated stock. Mutant clones of all three alleles were overrepresented in the adult eye when compared to clones of the parental <italic>FRT82B</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that these <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutations cause increased tissue growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Two of the mutations generate premature stop codons upstream of all conserved domains, while the third causes a cysteine-to-tyrosine change in a conserved residue in one of the LRRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) that likely interferes with the normal function of the protein, indicating that all three alleles reduce or eliminate <italic>Fbxl7</italic> function.

FatICD co-immunoprecipitates with FLAG-Fbxl7, whereas association of FatICD with FLAG-Fbxl7<sup>C616Y</sup> is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also examined the ability of truncated Fbxl7 proteins to interact with Ft and find that Fbxl7 interacts with Ft mostly via its LRRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). A weaker interaction is also observed between Ft and the N-terminal portion of Fbxl7. Thus wild-type Fbxl7 can associate, either directly or indirectly, with the intracellular domain of Ft and this interaction mostly occurs via the LRRs of Fbxl7.</p><p>The apical localization of Fbxl7 was absent in <italic>ft</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–D‴</xref>). However, an increase in diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–E‴</xref>). Thus the localization of Fbxl7 to the apical region is dependent upon Ft and in the absence of Ft, Fbxl7 re-localizes to the cytoplasm. Since Ft and Fbxl7 also co-localize to cytoplasmic puncta or vesicles, we examined whether this localization of Fbxl7 also depends on Ft. Surprisingly, unlike the apical localization, punctate localization of FLAG-Fbxl7 was still observed in <italic>ft</italic> clones indicating that the localization of Fbxl7 in these cytoplasmic puncta is independent of Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–F″</xref>).</p><p>Since proteins similar to Fbxl7 often bind to their substrates via their LRRs and promote their polyubiquitylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>), we tested the effect of changes in Fbxl7 on the levels and localization of Ft. Increasing Fbxl7 levels resulted in clearly increased levels of apical Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–G′</xref>) and slightly increased cytoplasmic staining of Ft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Surprisingly, a slight elevation of apical Ft levels was also observed in <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–H″</xref>). The overall levels of Ft protein in imaginal discs, as assessed by Western blotting, were not obviously changed in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results are inconsistent with Fbxl7 promoting Ft degradation and instead suggest that Fbxl7 regulates Ft localization. In support of this, we do not observe an obvious increase in Ft ubiquitylation from expressing Fbxl7 in S2 cells (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The apical localization of Fbxl7 does not require Ds or Dco</title><p>Since the phenotypic abnormalities of <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutants resemble those of hypomorphic alleles of <italic>ft</italic>, and the recruitment of Fbxl7 to the apical region of the cell is dependent upon Ft, we explored the relationship between Fbxl7 and proteins known to regulate Ft in more detail.

Given that Ds can be drawn toward cells with greater levels of Ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2003</xref>), Ds may be drawn toward Fbxl7-overexpressing cells due to the increased Ft levels. Furthermore, the puncta of Ds in adjacent wild-type cells are in register with Fbxl7 puncta, consistent with the coupling of Ds in wild-type cells to Fbxl7-bound Ft within the clone. In <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutant clones, there is, at best, a very slight elevation of Ds levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–F″</xref>). Thus, the effects of Fbxl7 on Ds levels are minor compared to the effects on Ft levels. Additionally, we could not detect Ds in immunoprecipitates of Fbxl7 when the two proteins were co-expressed in S2 cells (not shown). Together, these findings suggest that Fbxl7 binds to and functions with Ft rather than Ds. Despite this, we did observe co-localization of Fbxl7 and Ds at apical membranes and in more basally located cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–G″</xref>). In the absence of evidence for direct interactions between Fbxl7 and Ds, their co-localization, at least at the cell surface, may result from Fbxl7 bound to Ft that is in turn bound to Ds.</p><p>Ds binding to Ft induces the phosphorylation of the ICD of Ft, which requires the protein kinase, Dco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng and Irvine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sopko et al., 2009</xref>).

Indeed, Ft<sup>61</sup> and FtΔF proteins co-immunoprecipitated at levels comparable to wild-type Ft. However, the level of FtΔD in FLAG-Fbxl7 immunoprecipitates was greatly reduced, as was that of Ft<sup>mutV</sup>, a mutant Ft protein in which a cluster of 10 serine/threonine residues overlapping the D domain was mutated to alanines. These sites were identified as candidates for phosphorylation by Dco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). However, since Fbxl7 localizes normally in <italic>dco</italic> mutant clones, the inability of Fbxl7 to bind to Ft<sup>mutV</sup> might be caused by a change in its conformation that does not depend on phosphorylation by Dco.

To determine whether Fbxl7 has a role in generating or maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of D, we examined the distribution of D in <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutant wing discs. In these experiments, the distal edge of one cell cannot be distinguished from the proximal edge of its neighbor. However, in wild-type cells, endogenous D is preferentially observed on the proximal/distal edges and is found at lower levels at the other edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,G</xref>).

This likely resulted from the elevated levels of Ft in <italic>Fbxl7</italic>-overexpressing clones, which would cause an enrichment of Ds (and hence D) on the surface of wild-type cells contacting the clone. In z-sections, we observed subtle changes in the localization of D within the clone itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–I‴</xref>).

In addition, increasing doses of transfected FLAG-Fbxl7 in S2 cells does not affect total levels of Dachs-V5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). If at all, a slight increase in Dachs-V5 levels was observed. Since Fbxl7 is localized apically and preferentially localizes to the proximal edge of the cell, Fbxl7 could promote D degradation locally and this may not be reflected in the overall levels of D.</p><p>We therefore tested whether Fbxl7 was capable of promoting D ubiquitylation. These experiments were conducted in both S2 cells and imaginal discs. Ubiquitylated D was readily detected. However, the level of ubiquitylation was unchanged when Fbxl7 was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we reduced Fbxl7 in S2 cells by RNAi-mediated knockdown using two different dsRNAs and still observed no change in D ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Importantly, we observe knockdown of Fbxl7 protein in S2 cells using these dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Furthermore, expressing a dominant negative version of Cul1 (Cul1<sup>DN</sup>) does not impair D ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), implying that the SCF complex may not be involved. Thus we have no evidence that Fbxl7 influences D ubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Fbxl7 co-localizes with Cindr and displaces it from the apical membrane</title><p>If Fbxl7 negatively regulates the accumulation of D at the apical membrane, it may do so by promoting the trafficking of D into intracellular vesicles. Indeed, we observed a population of intracellular puncta, likely vesicles, that contain both Fbxl7 and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–I″</xref>). Moreover Fbxl7 overexpression can cause an overall shift in D from the apical membrane to the interior of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I‴</xref>). To further characterize the population of vesicles that contain Fbxl7, we examined the localization of FLAG-Fbxl7 with 59 different markers that each labeled a subpopulation of vesicles and with several proteins that have been identified as interactors of Ft in proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). No co-localization was observed with most of these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E–G</xref> as examples) and partial co-localization was seen with two markers of the retromer pathway, Snx3 and Vps35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H–I″</xref>). However, strong co-localization was seen with a protein-trap insertion of GFP in the <italic>cindr</italic> locus. Cindr is thought to be an adapter protein that links membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (‘Discussion’). In basal sections, there is almost complete overlap between GFP-Cindr and FLAG-Fbxl7 in puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–E″</xref>). GFP-Cindr is normally localized to the subapical membrane, apical to E-cadherin, but its localization there is less punctate and more diffuse than that of FLAG-Fbxl7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). When tagged versions of both proteins were expressed in S2 cells, Cindr co-immunoprecipitated with full length Fbxl7 or with a version containing only the LRRs (Fbxl7Δ2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Fbxl7 could influence the cellular localization of GFP-Cindr, we overexpressed FLAG-Fbxl7 in clones in <italic>GFP-Cindr</italic> animals. In these clones, we observed a dramatic re-localization of GFP-Cindr. GFP-Cindr is almost entirely eliminated from the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–H″</xref>) and increased numbers of basally located vesicles are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–I″</xref>). Thus, Fbxl7 is capable of displacing a protein associated with the apical membrane into intracellular vesicles. Importantly, this is unlikely to be a consequence of increased Ft in the apical membranes of Fbxl7-ovexpressing cells, since increasing Ft levels has no effect on the apical localization of GFP-Cindr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J–J″</xref>). We next tested whether changes in Cindr levels are capable of modifying Fbxl7 phenotypes. Indeed we find that the reduction in wing size from overexpression of Fbxl7 was suppressed by co-expression of GFP-Cindr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Overexpression of GFP-Cindr alone causes slightly rounder wings with closer crossveins, though these wings were not significantly overgrown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L–O</xref>).</p><p>Under conditions of Fbxl7 overexpression, we did not observe any increase in Cindr ubiquitylation indicating that Cindr is unlikely to be a direct target of Fbxl7 (not shown). Moreover, reducing Cindr levels by RNAi did not elicit phenotypic abnormalities in wings suggestive of defects in Ft or D (not shown). However, the ability of Fbxl7 to cause changes in the localization of Cindr and Ft indicates that it can regulate trafficking of proteins between the apical membrane and the interior of the cell in either direction, and the pathways that regulate the trafficking of these proteins and D might share common components. Some of these shared components could potentially be direct targets of Fbxl7 ubiquitylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The protocadherin Ft lies at the apex of multiple pathways that together regulate growth, several aspects of PCP, and proximodistal patterning. The mechanism by which Ft functions as a signaling molecule remains poorly understood. We have now identified the F-box protein Fbxl7 as an immediate effector of Ft, that functions to restrict the levels of the atypical myosin D at the apical membrane as well as its distribution around the perimeter of the cell. In addition, Fbxl7 can regulate levels of Ft at the apical membrane.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multiple effector pathways downstream of fat</title><p>Recent studies have revealed that Ft's effects on distinct pathways may be genetically separated, and that multiple effector domains can contribute to the same function. Indeed, the growth-suppressing function of Ft may occur via at least two regions of the Ft ICD. One or more regions between amino acids 4834 and 4899 in full-length Ft appear responsible for Ft’s ability to regulate Hippo signaling (labeled HM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bossuyt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Several mutations within this region compromise this function of Ft and cause massive tissue overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bossuyt et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, an allele of <italic>ft</italic>, <italic>ft</italic><sup><italic>61</italic></sup>, which harbors such a mutation, showed neither an effect on the recruitment of Fbxl7 to the apical membrane nor on the binding of Ft to Fbxl7. Thus, signaling via this region of the ICD appears to be independent of Fbxl7. A second, more C-terminal region of the Ft ICD (Region D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>) that extends between amino acids 4975 and 4993 of full-length Ft, is removed by the <italic>ftΔD</italic> deletion and also has a growth-suppressive function albeit weaker than that of HM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). This second growth-suppressive pathway requires the function of Fbxl7, as the protein generated by the <italic>ftΔD</italic> allele cannot bind to Fbxl7 nor can it localize Fbxl7 to the apical membrane. Additionally, the phenotypic abnormalities of null alleles of <italic>ft</italic> rescued by <italic>ftΔD</italic> are very similar, if not identical to those of <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutants. Furthermore, like <italic>ftΔD, Fbxl7</italic> mutations do not display overt abnormalities of hair orientation in the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–J</xref>), or abdomen (not shown).</p><p>We have shown that hyperactivation of the “weaker” Fbxl7-dependent pathway can overcome the absence of the ‘stronger’ Fbxl7-independent pathway; overexpression of Fbxl7 can suppress the overgrowth of <italic>ft</italic><sup><italic>61</italic></sup>. Thus, while these two pathways can be dissociated at the level of the Ft ICD, they nevertheless seem to converge further downstream. This point of convergence likely involves D since the overgrowth of <italic>ft</italic> mutant tissue can be suppressed completely by eliminating D function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, it has previously been suggested that Ft regulates growth by restricting the levels of apical D, and regulates PCP by influencing the planar asymmetry of apical D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding in our experiments is that <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutations perturb the distribution of D around the perimeter of the apical region of the cell. D is normally biased towards the distal edge of the cell; in <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutants, D is more evenly distributed around the cell perimeter. The asymmetric localization of D depends on at least two different regions of Ft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). One is the region that binds to Fbxl7 (Region D) and the other is composed of the last three amino acids at the C-terminus of the protein (Region F in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>), which is not necessary for Fbxl7 localization to the apical membrane. Thus, for the regulation of D asymmetry as well, there appears to be an Fbxl7-independent pathway. The existence of multiple downstream effector pathways that converge on common biological outcomes suggests that these pathways might function redundantly to some extent and thus provide robustness. This might also explain why the phenotypes elicited by overexpression of Fbxl7 are, in general, more severe than those observed in loss-of-function mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Fbxl7 as a regulator of protein localization</title><p>Previous observations of the localization of Ft, Ds, and D to vesicles are suggestive of trafficking events being involved in Ft signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). We have demonstrated that, in addition to the apical membrane, Fbxl7 localizes to vesicles. Moreover, FLAG-Fbxl7 vesicles can contain Ft, Ds and D, and these may be related to the apical puncta observed on cell edges. This localization is likely specific, since we do not see Fbxl7 co-localization with other cell surface proteins such as Crumbs, Notch, and E-cadherin (not shown). Currently very little is known about the role of each of these proteins in vesicles. However, there is an increasing appreciation that most transmembrane proteins, and even proteins that are associated with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane are maintained at the plasma membrane by a dynamic process involving endocytosis and vesicle recycling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmick et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We provide evidence that Fbxl7 regulates Ft apical localization, but how this regulation relates to the Fbxl7 phenotypes is not clear. Since Fbxl7 overexpression increases Fat signaling, and rescues the overgrowth-inducing Ft<sup>61</sup> allele, perhaps this is due to the increased levels of Ft protein at the apical membrane. However, Ft levels are slightly elevated in <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutants, which display mild overgrowth. Therefore the mutant phenotype cannot be explained by the effect on Ft. Another known regulator of apical Ft levels is <italic>lowfat</italic> (<italic>lft</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Fbxl7 and Lft appear to regulate Ft in different ways. Lft overexpression, like Fbxl7, increases Ft levels. However, while Ft levels are decreased in <italic>lft</italic> mutant cells, Ft levels are increased in <italic>Fbxl7</italic> mutant cells, though less so compared to <italic>Fbxl7</italic> overexpression. Interestingly, for many proteins that regulate cellular trafficking, similar phenotypic abnormalities are observed with gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations, since the normal execution of the process requires the protein to shuttle efficiently between two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 1993</xref>). Thus dynamic aspects of the localization of Ft, Ds and D clearly merit more attention.</p><p>The interactions we have observed between Fbxl7 and the adapter protein Cindr may provide clues for how Fbxl7 regulates D localization. Fbxl7-associated vesicles show almost complete overlap with GFP-Cindr and Fbxl7 can re-localize Cindr from the apical membrane to the interior of the cell. This finding, together with the observed increase in basal levels of D upon Fbxl7 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–I‴</xref>), suggests that Fbxl7 may function to regulate D trafficking in a similar manner. Cindr and its mammalian orthologues Cin85 and CD2AP are thought to regulate interactions between membrane proteins and actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haglund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petrelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soubeyran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2012</xref>). D is an atypical myosin with a predicted actin binding domain in its conserved head domain. Therefore, the vesicles which Fbxl7 associates with D and Cindr may be linked to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, our finding of partial colocalization of Fbxl7 with retromer components further supports the possibility that Fbxl7 may have a role in protein trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fbxl7 as a ubiquitin-ligase component</title><p>Many F-box proteins associate with Skp1 and Cul1 to form an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). Recruitment of specific substrates results in their poly-ubiquitylation and degradation, or mono-ubiquitylation, which can have non-degradative signaling roles. In addition, some F-box proteins have SCF-independent roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). Fbxl proteins are thought to recruit substrates to the SCF complex through the interaction with their LRR domains, and substrates have been identified for several Fbxls such as Skp2 (Fbxl1), which degrades p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sutterluty et al., 1999</xref>). However many, like Fbxl7, are still uncharacterized as ‘orphan’ F-box proteins with no known substrates.</p><p>Since we find that Fbxl7 associates with Skp1 and Cul1, its potential substrates may be involved in Ft signaling. Fbxl7 has one described substrate in mice, Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coon et al., 2012</xref>). However we do not believe Aurora A is a relevant substrate in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as we do not observe Ft signaling defects when Aurora A is knocked down or overexpressed (not shown). The identification of F-box protein substrates has mainly been accomplished by unbiased approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, a combination of unbiased approaches, involving proteomics, genetic interaction screens, and identifying proteins that co-localize with Fbxl7 in vesicles could be used to identify Fbxl7 substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p><italic>Fbxl7</italic><sup><italic>C616Y</italic></sup> and <italic>Fbxl7</italic><sup><italic>Q201X</italic></sup> alleles were isolated in two EMS screens, <italic>Fbxl7</italic><sup><italic>W389X</italic></sup> was found fortuitously in a separate fly stock, and <italic>Fbxl7</italic><sup><italic>MI04292</italic></sup> (BL37813) is a <italic>MI{MIC}</italic> insertion in the first intron of <italic>Fbxl7</italic>.

Cell edge data were measured using a 1 pixel width line. Mean fluorescence of cell edges oriented in the P-D orientation (45°–135°) or the A-P orientation (0°–45°; 135°–180°) was isolated into two different lists, which were each averaged. The ratio of mean fluorescence of the A-P orientation to P-D orientation gives the P-D/A-P localization.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>This manuscript describe Fbxl7 as a new component of the Hippo signalling pathway downstream of Fat, thus providing important insights into how this transmembrane protein signals to control growth. They investigate relationships between several proteins including Fat, Dachsous, Dachs, Dco and vesicle trafficking proteins such as Cindr. The experiments are very rigorous and thorough, employing multiple mutant alleles, RNAi lines, transgenes, antibodies and biochemical reagents. It seems quite clear that Fbxl7 functions downstream of Fat to regulate growth and controls the apical localization and abundance of Dachs, although its mechanistic links to Dco and Cindr are not entirely clear. The manuscript represents a huge amount of work and while there are some loose ends mechanistically, substantial efforts have been made to make conclusions without over-interpreting data or forcing results.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the work described in this paper was novel, important and appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers had a few experimental points that they felt would strengthen the paper, and several points that they felt could be improved/clarified in the Discussion before publication.</p><p>Experimental/image issues:</p><p>1) The Western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> are not great quality. The reviewers appreciate that there might be some technical issues with the Dachs antibody but if it can be improved it will make this result clearer and add value to the manuscript. At present, these Western blots look like they have been over-modified with software such as Adobe Photoshop.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The staining of loss of Fbxl7 in <italic>ft</italic><sup><italic>GrV</italic></sup><italic>/ft</italic><sup><italic>8</italic></sup><italic>; ftΔD</italic> is not very clear compared to controls in D. Can this be improved?</p><p>3) Can fat loss upregulate and mislocalize Dachs in the absence of Fbxl7? The authors suggest that Fbxl7 has a role mediating some of Fat's effects on Dachs levels and asymmetry, likely by binding Fat's D domain. They also argue that the F domain's effects on Dachs asymmetry are not mediated by Fbxl7, but this is only based on the finding that removing the F domain does not detectably change Fbxl7 binding. However, it is still possible that the F domain's effects are mediated by Fbxl7, especially since Fbxl7 has residual binding to Fat lacking the D domain. It would be helpful if they tested how important Fbxl7 is for Fat's effects on Dachs. Can a form of Fat deficient in Fbxl7 binding, such as ΔD, still improve Dachs in a fat mutant?</p><p>4) The authors do not present any evidence that the D domain is required for Fbxl7's effects on Fat levels. Does Fbxl7 (gain or loss) affect the apical levels of FatΔD?</p><p>DISCUSSION POINTS</p><p>1) Fat localization: The authors show a very strong (although complex) role of Fbxl7 controlling Fat localization. However, this role hardly gets mentioned in the Discussion, and so it is not at all clear how and if it connects to the Fbxl7 phenotype. In the Results, in contrast, the authors suggest that some of the effects of Fbxl7 are “amplified” by changing Fat levels, and that this effect is likely mediated through the D domain. More Discussion should be devoted to the alterations in Fat levels. A brief comparison to Lowfat is also probably in order, as Lowfat also regulates Fat levels.</p><p>2) Fbxl2 overexpression: This causes a phenotype very similar to that of Dachs mutants, but only causes very subtle effects on Dachs localization. If much or all of Fbxl2's effects are mediated via Dachs, as the authors suggest, this requires a little explanation.</p><p>3) I don't think we can conclude that Fbxl7 function is not related to the growth-suppressive function that is perturbed in <italic>ft</italic><sup><italic>61</italic></sup> alleles, just that its localization is not affected by the ft61 mutation. Indeed Fbxl7 function could be disrupted in ft61 alleles; perhaps a more likely scenario is that Fat61 protein binds to Fbxl7 but cannot modulate its activity because it fails to recruit an accessory protein that either modulates Fbxl7 activity or that is regulated by Fbxl7.</p><p>4) The text relating to the blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref> states that Dachs levels do not go up when Fbxl7 is increased but they actually do look higher. This also seems to hold true in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, Fbxl7 RNAi does not seem to affect Dachs levels.</p><p>5) The final model figure is not useful, and is at times misleading. Particularly, the labeling of the regions 1,2 and 3 is not helpful, as it adds yet another unmatching set of designations to the Ft cytoplasmic domain. It would be more useful if the authors adapted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to their final model. Also, the arrows to Dachs might be better if they were dotted, or via question marks, or possibly across cell membranes to Ds, as all the data in their paper indicates that the link to Dachs is indirect.</p><p>6) The manuscript gets a bit bogged down with the negative data about the possible type of vesicles, possible functions of Dachs and the inclusion of the Cindr data. The manuscript would be improved if this section of the paper was reduced, as it is largely negative data. Similarly, it would be more useful if the Discussion addressed what the authors have shown and their model, and reduce the discussion of vesicles and Cindr, as the link to the title and the Abstract is not carried through.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03383.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Experimental/image issues:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The Western blots in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6J</italic></xref> <italic>are not great quality.

At present, these Western blots look like they have been over-modified with software such as Adobe Photoshop</italic>.</p><p>The signals obtained in Western blots using the anti-Dachs antibody are always weak. We have done the experiment many times to satisfy ourselves that the results are consistent – we never see a change in Dachs protein levels in Fbxl7 mutant discs, though the blots are never pretty because of the poor level of signal above background. We have replaced the blot used in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> with another one. That original blot is now in the supplemental figure (with less modification of brightness and contrast), we have retained it in the supplemental figure because it shows discs of additional genotypes as well.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: The staining of loss of Fbxl7 in</italic> ft<sup>GrV</sup>/ft<sup>8</sup>; ftΔD <italic>is not very clear compared to controls in D.

The authors suggest that Fbxl7 has a role mediating some of Fat's effects on Dachs levels and asymmetry, likely by binding Fat's D domain.

Can a form of Fat deficient in Fbxl7 binding, such as ΔD, still improve Dachs in a fat mutant?</italic></p><p>We are confused by the first sentence of this comment since loss of either Fbxl7 or loss of Fat already results in Dachs mislocalization. If the reviewers were wondering whether overexpression of Fbxl7 can rescue some of the Dachs defects in <italic>ft</italic> mutants, we have now added data to show that the increased Dachs levels in <italic>ft</italic><sup><italic>61</italic></sup> clones are suppressed by increasing Fbxl7 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Please note that the Ft<sup>61</sup> protein can still bind to and apically localize Fbxl7.</p><p>The reviewers also point out that the D-deletion does not completely abolish Fbxl7 binding to Ft and suggest that there might be residual binding via the F-domain. We have included additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>) that show that overexpression of Fbxl7 increases the apical levels of wild-type Ft and FtΔF but not FtΔD suggesting that Fbxl7 needs to bind to Ft via the D domain but not the F domain (at least by this assay). We think the presence of a low level of binding in the ΔD mutant may simply be that the D deletion only partially removes the site that binds Ft and may therefore reduce the binding affinity substantially. In the absence of structural information, this issue cannot be fully resolved.</p><p><italic>It would be helpful if they tested how important Fbxl7 is for Fat's effects on Dachs. Can a form of Fat deficient in Fbxl7 binding, such as deltaD, still improve Dachs in a fat mutant?</italic></p><p>Work published by the Irvine lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2013</xref>) shows that the FtΔD mutant provides partial rescue of the Dachs localization defect. We have cited this work.</p><p><italic>4) The authors do not present any evidence that the D domain is required for Fbxl7's effects on Fat levels. Does Fbxl7 (gain or loss) affect the apical levels of FatΔD?</italic></p><p>Thank you for suggesting this experiment. We have included additional data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>) that show very clearly that the D domain is necessary for observing an increase in apical Ft levels upon Fbxl7 overexpression and that the F domain is not.</p><p><italic>DISCUSSION POINTS</italic></p><p><italic>1) Fat localization: The authors show a very strong (although complex) role of Fbxl7 controlling Fat localization.

A brief comparison to Lowfat is also probably in order, as Lowfat also regulates Fat levels</italic>.</p><p>We have added discussion of this issue. We emphasize that some of the effects of Fbxl7 overexpression could be mediated by an increase in the levels of apical Ft. However, the phenotypic abnormalities observed in Fbxl7 loss-of-function mutants are not likely to result from the small increase in apical Ft levels. We have included a comparison to Lowfat as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>2) Fbxl2 overexpression: This causes a phenotype very similar to that of Dachs mutants, but only causes very subtle effects on Dachs localization. If much or all of Fbxl2's effects are mediated via Dachs, as the authors suggest, this requires a little explanation</italic>.</p><p>We have included additional data using a Dachs-GFP, which in combination with the images using the anti-Dachs antibody, shows very clearly that Dachs levels at the apical membrane are reduced when Fbxl7 levels are increased.</p><p><italic>3) I don't think we can conclude that Fbxl7 function is not related to the growth-suppressive function that is perturbed in</italic> ft<sup>61</sup> <italic>alleles, just that its localization is not affected by the ft61 mutation.

However, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref><italic>, Fbxl7 RNAi does not seem to affect Dachs levels</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that Dachs levels go up slightly when Fbxl7 is overexpressed in S2 cells.

By showing these data, we hope that other scientists who work on vesicle trafficking will take notice of the localization of Fbxl7 and make connections with other observations that might point to candidate targets. We therefore think that it is important that these results are retained in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
