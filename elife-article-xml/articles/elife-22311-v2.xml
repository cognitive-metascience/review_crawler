chlamydial pathogens form an intracellular membrane-bound replicative niche termed the inclusion, which is enriched with bacterial transmembrane proteins called Incs. Incs bind and manipulate host cell proteins to promote inclusion expansion and provide camouflage against innate immune responses. Sorting nexin (SNX) proteins that normally function in endosomal membrane trafficking are a major class of inclusion-associated host proteins, and are recruited by IncE/CT116. Crystal structures of the SNX5 phox-homology (PX) domain in complex with IncE define the precise molecular basis for these interactions. The binding site is unique to SNX5 and related family members SNX6 and SNX32. Intriguingly the site is also conserved in SNX5 homologues throughout evolution, suggesting that IncE captures SNX5-related proteins by mimicking a native host protein interaction. These findings thus provide the first mechanistic insights both into how chlamydial Incs hijack host proteins, and how SNX5-related PX domains function as scaffolds in protein complex assembly.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22311.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22311.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22311.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bacterium <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, commonly known as chlamydia, is a frequent cause of sexually transmitted infections, and a leading cause of blindness due to infection. The bacteria must directly enter the cells of its human host to grow and multiply. Inside a human cell, the bacteria form and then develop within specialized compartments called inclusions that are surrounded by membrane. The outside of the inclusion membrane becomes coated with dozens of unique bacterial proteins. The major role of these bacterial proteins is to hijack other proteins in the human cell to generate and maintain the membrane of the inclusion compartments.</p><p>One bacterial protein in particular, called IncE, is able to bind to specific host proteins called sorting nexins. These host proteins normally control the formation of tube-like membrane structures, which transport fatty molecules and proteins throughout the cell. The IncE protein is thought to recruit sorting nexins to help shape the inclusion membrane and perhaps control which types of proteins and fatty molecules associate with it. However, until now it was unknown how IncE, or any similar protein for that matter, could specifically hijack a host cell protein.</p><p>Now, Paul et al. have revealed the three-dimensional structure of a human sorting nexin protein, called SNX5, bound to a small fragment of the IncE protein from chlamydia. The structure shows that the part of SNX5 that associates with IncE is the part of the protein normally thought to interact with specific fatty molecules rather than proteins. Further experiments showed that SNX5 was still recruited to the inclusion compartment when the amount of these fatty molecules in human cells was reduced. However, this was not the case if SNX5 was prevented from interaction with the IncE protein.</p><p>Paul et al. also observed that the site on SNX5 where IncE binds is almost identical in related proteins from many other species, including zebrafish and worms, most of which are not hosts for chlamydia. This lead them to suspect that IncE hijacks the sorting nexin proteins by mimicking an important host protein that is yet to be discovered.</p><p>Proteins in the inclusion membrane play many important roles, and so this work on IncE only provides the first glimpse at how these proteins are able to manipulate the machinery of the host cell to their own ends. Further studies will therefore be needed to understand how these proteins exploit their host environment at the molecular level, and might be targeted in new antibacterial approaches. The findings also show how studying bacteria that live within host cells, like chlamydia, can provide insight into how other molecules are normally transported within cells: a process that is fundamental to all living cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22311.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22311.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Chlamydia trachomatis</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>sorting nexin</kwd><kwd>chlamydial inclusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1058734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Brett M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>606788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teasdale</surname><given-names>Rohan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1041929</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Brett M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1061574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teasdale</surname><given-names>Rohan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP0985029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Brett M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP150100364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Brett M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE120102321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>Markus C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chlamydia hijacks membrane trafficking proteins of the human host via the cytoplasmic domain of a secreted transmembrane protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To counter host defence mechanisms intracellular bacterial pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to evade immune detection, replicate and cause infection. Many pathogens manipulate endocytic pathways to gain entry into host cells and generate a membrane-enclosed replicative niche. This frequently involves hijacking or inhibiting the host cell trafficking machinery, first to generate the pathogen containing vacuole (PCV) and subsequently to prevent fusion with lysosomal degradative compartments. Concomitantly the pathogen often endeavors to decorate the PCV with host proteins and lipids that mimic other host cell organelles in order to circumvent innate immune detection, expand the replicative niche and acquire nutrients to support intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Russo Case and Samuel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Personnic et al., 2016</xref>). This process is often orchestrated through the action of molecular syringe-like secretion systems that deliver bacterial effector proteins directly into the host cell cytoplasm.</p><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is arguably one of the most successful human bacterial pathogens by virtue of its capacity to hijack host cell intracellular trafficking and lipid transport pathways to promote infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastidas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DerrÃ©, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>). <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> causes nearly 100 million sexually transmitted infections annually worldwide, and if left unchecked leads to various human diseases including infection-induced blindness, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aral et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman et al., 2015</xref>). Even though chlamydial infections can generally be treated with antibiotics, persistent infections remain a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohlhoff and Hammerschlag, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mpiga and Ravaoarinoro, 2006</xref>).</p><p>All <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> share a common dimorphic life cycle, where the bacteria alternates between the infectious but non-dividing elementary body (EB) form, and the non-infectious but replicative reticulate body (RB) form. Following internalization of EBs through a poorly defined endocytic process, the bacteria reside in a membrane-bound vacuole termed the inclusion, where they convert into RBs and replication occurs over 24â72 hr. RBs eventually redifferentiate back to EBs in an asynchronous manner, and are then released to infect neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Russo Case and Samuel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hybiske, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ward, 1983</xref>). The encapsulating inclusion membrane provides the primary interface between the bacteria and the host cellâs cytoplasm and organelles. From the initial stages of invasion until eventual bacterial egress the chlamydial inclusion is extensively modified by insertion of numerous Type-III secreted bacterial effector proteins called inclusion membrane proteins or âIncsâ. The Incs modulate host trafficking and signaling pathways to promote bacterial survival at different stages, including cell invasion, inclusion membrane remodeling, avoidance of the host cell innate immune defense system, nutrient acquisition and interactions with other host cell organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rockey et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p><italic>Chlamydiae</italic> secrete more than fifty different Inc proteins. While Incs possess little sequence similarity, they share a common membrane topology with cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains, separated by two closely spaced transmembrane regions with a short intra-vacuolar loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dehoux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kostriukova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lutter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rockey et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Both reports confirmed that membrane trafficking proteins are major components of the inclusion proteome; and in particular members of the endosomal sorting nexin (SNX) family are highly enriched. Specifically it was shown that the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> IncE/CT116 protein could recruit SNX proteins containing bin-amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domains SNX1, SNX2, SNX5 and SNX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). SNX1 and SNX2 are highly homologous and form heterodimeric assemblies with either SNX5 or SNX6 to promote endosomal membrane tubulation and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). A fifth protein SNX32 is highly similar to SNX5 and SNX6 but is almost exclusively expressed in the brain and has not yet been characterized. SNX recruitment to the inclusion occurs via the C-terminal region of IncE interacting with the phox-homology (PX) domains of SNX5 or SNX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, RNAi-mediated depletion of SNX5/SNX6 does not slow infection but rather increases the production of infectious <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> progeny suggesting that the SNX recruitment is not done to enable bacterial infection. Instead it was proposed that because SNX proteins regulate endocytic and lysosomal degradation, the manipulation by IncE could be an attempt to circumvent SNX-enhanced bacterial destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we use X-ray crystallographic structure determination to define the molecular mechanism of SNX5-IncE interaction, and confirm this mechanism using mutagenesis both in vitro and in cells. When bound to SNX5, IncE adopts an elongated Î²-hairpin structure, with key hydrophobic residues docked into a complementary binding groove encompassing a helix-turn-helix structural extension that is unique to SNX5, SNX6, and the brain-specific homologue SNX32. A striking degree of evolutionary conservation in the IncE-binding groove suggests that IncE co-opts the SNX5-related molecules by displacing a host protein (as yet unidentified) that normally binds to this site. Our work thus provides both the first mechanistic insights into how protein hijacking is mediated by inclusion membrane proteins, and also sheds light on the functional role of the SNX5-related PX domains as scaffolds for protein complex assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IncE specifically binds and recruits SNX5, SNX6 and SNX32 to <italic>C.Â trachomatis</italic> inclusions</title><p>It was previously shown that the sorting nexins SNX1, SNX2, SNX5 and SNX6 are recruited to the inclusion membrane in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>).

We also observed localization of the SNX proteins to extensive inclusion-associated membrane tubules in a subset of infected cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, when infected cells are treated with wortmannin, a pan-specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, we see a loss of the SNX proteins from punctate endosomes, but not from the inclusion membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). A similar result is seen for specific inhibition of PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> production by Vps34 using Vps34-IN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This offers two possibilities; that either SNX recruitment to the inclusion occurs via protein-protein interactions, and does not depend on the presence of 3-phosphoinositide lipids that typically recruit SNX proteins to endosomal membranes, or alternatively that PI3Ks are not present at the inclusion and therefore wortmannin treatment has no effect at this particular compartment. Given our structural and mutagenesis studies below we favor the former explanation.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22311-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22311.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Movie showing that wortmannin disrupts SNX5 recruitment to endosomes but not the chlamydial inclusion.</title><p>HeLa cells stably expressing mCherry-Rab25 (red) were transfected transiently with GFP-SNX5 (green) and infected with <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> L2 for 24 hr.

The Î²-hairpin structure of IncE (N-terminal Î²A and C-terminal Î²B strands) is directly incorporated as a Î²-sheet augmentation of the Î²1, Î²2 and Î²3 strands of SNX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The N-terminal Î²A strand of the IncE sequence (Gly111-Lys118) forms the primary interface with SNX5, making main-chain hydrogen bonds with the Î²1 strand of the SNX5 PX domain for the stable positioning of the IncE structure. The two anti-parallel Î²-strands of IncE are connected by a short loop (Gly119-Ala124) that makes no direct contact with the SNX5 protein, and the C-terminal IncE Î²B strand (Asp125-Val130) forms an interface with the extended Î±-helical region of the SNX5 PX domain.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22311-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22311.014</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Animation highlighting the mechanism of interaction between SNX5 and IncE.</title><p>The SNX5 PX domain is shown in yellow ribbons and the IncE peptide is shown in magenta.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22311.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22311.014</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Detailed views of the SNX5-IncE interface are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D and E</xref>. Aside from main-chain hydrogen bonding to form the extended Î²-sheet, IncE engages in several critical side-chain interactions with the relatively hydrophobic SNX5 binding groove. At the N-terminus of the Î²A strand Val114 of IncE inserts into a pocket formed primarily by Tyr132 and Phe136 on the SNX5 Î±ââ helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A major contribution comes from IncE Phe116, with Ï-stacking occurring with the Phe136 side-chain and hydrophobic docking with Val140 of SNX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Adjacent to IncE Phe116 at the end of the Î²A strand Lys118 makes an electrostatic contact with SNX5 Glu144. Finally, at the C-terminal end of the IncE Î²B strand Val127 and Leu129 contact an extended SNX5 surface composed of Leu133, Tyr132 and Met106 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutations in the SNX5-IncE interface disrupt complex formation in vitro and in cells</title><p>To verify the crystal structure we mutated residues from both SNX5 and IncE and measured their affinities using ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). At the interface between SNX5 and IncE several side chains make key contributions to peptide recognition. Because Leu133 and Phe136 residues in SNX5 are located at the core of the IncE-binding interface, and also due to the structural rearrangements these residues make on binding (see below), we reasoned that L133D and F136A mutations would inhibit the interaction. Indeed these mutants abolished association with the IncE peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The reciprocal mutations in IncE residues F116A and V127D also abolished binding to the SNX5 PX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and the SNX6 and SNX32 PX domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating the importance of these hydrophobic and Ï-stacking interactions for stable complex formation. In contrast mutations predicted to disrupt an observed electrostatic contact (IncE K118A or SNX5 E144A) had little effect on binding. Thus the core hydrophobic interactions are critical for IncE binding but the peripheral electrostatic contact is not essential.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22311.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutations in the SNX5 and IncE proteins prevent complex formation in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ITC experiments testing the effect of SNX5 mutations on IncE binding.

Cells expressing the GFP-SNX5 protein showed clear and uniform recruitment to the limiting membrane of the inclusion as defined by mCherry-Rab25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which is consistent with the localisation observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the GFP-SNX5 (F136A) mutant protein showed no recruitment to the chlamydial inclusion. The change in relative distribution of these GFP-SNX5 proteins on the inclusion was quantified for wildtype SNX5 (Manderâs coefficient 0.67Â Â±Â 0.14) and GFP-SNX5 (F136A) (0.041Â Â±Â 0.051) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Like wild-type GFP-SNX5 the GFP-SNX5 (F136A) mutant was recruited to punctate endosomal structures throughout the cytoplasm of these cells, and in addition was able to co-immunoprecipate endogenous SNX1 in heterodimeric complexes identically to the wild-type GFP-SNX5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This implies that BAR-domain mediated heterodimer formation with SNX1 or SNX2 is required for endosomal recruitment, and is not perturbed by the IncE-binding mutation in the PX domain. Lastly, we tested the importance of IncE residues for SNX interaction in situ by expressing the GFP-tagged IncE C-terminal domain. The wild-type GFP-IncE(91-132) was recruited to endosomal structures via its interaction with SNX5-related proteins in both uninfected and infected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Recent studies reported retrograde trafficking proteins as significant components of the inclusion, with sorting nexin family members being particularly enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we present the first reported crystal structure of a chlamydial inclusion protein (IncE) binding to its host effector protein (SNX5). While the detailed mechanism of IncE-mediated protein recruitment will be specific to this family member, the principle of extended cytoplasmic Inc sequences engaging with cellular host proteins on the inclusion is certain to be a general one. A simple analogy would be to consider the Inc proteins as being like a molecular âvelcroâ that recognises and attaches host machinery needed for bacterial replication and survival.</p><p>The manipulation of endocytic transport machinery is clearly critical for the obligate intracellular survival of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore and Ouellette, 2014</xref>). In addition to <italic>C. trachomatis,</italic> SNX1, SNX2, SNX5, SNX6 and the associated retromer complex have also been directly implicated in the cellular pathogenesis of <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McDonough et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Salmonella</italic> enterica serovar <italic>Typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bujny et al., 2008</xref>), hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yin et al., 2016</xref>), human papilloma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Popa et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finsel et al., 2013</xref>). Broadly then the manipulation of SNX proteins and endosomal trafficking machinery by viral and bacterial pathogens is a common occurrence during intracellular infection, and points to a wide-ranging role in host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Typically PX domains of sorting nexins, including SNX1 and SNX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cozier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2005</xref>), play an important role in endosomal membrane recruitment by binding the endosome-enriched lipid PtdIns3<italic>P</italic> through four conserved residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teasdale and Collins, 2012</xref>). These residues are conserved in most PX domains including in SNX1 and SNX2, but are entirely absent in SNX5, SNX6 and SNX32. Although there is evidence for the weak association of the SNX5 PX domain with the lipid PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koharudin et al., 2009</xref>), the crystal structure does not point to a clear binding mechanism. A second feature that sets SNX5-related proteins apart from the rest of the SNX family is the presence of an extended Î±-helical insertion. Our work confirms the central importance of this unique insert for the binding of the IncE inclusion protein, and provides the first clear description of how a PX domain can function as a protein-protein interaction scaffold as opposed to a lipid-binding domain.</p><p>The high degree of conservation in the IncE binding surface of SNX5 implies that this site is critical for the normal function of SNX5 and its homologs. Previously, the expression of a GFP-tagged IncE C-terminal domain was shown to interfere with the SNX5/SNX6-dependent retrograde trafficking of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). Combined with our structural data, this infers that IncE is mimicking and interfering with SNX5/SNX6-mediated protein interactions, with a ligand(s) required for normal endosomal trafficking that remains to be discovered. Once recruited to the inclusion, SNX-BAR proteins are localized to the bulk membrane and dynamic tubules. While it is logical to imagine they could play a positive role in the sculpting of the inclusion, this is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the effect of SNX5 and SNX6 knockdown, which results in an increased production of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infectious progeny. Alternatively, although a pool of SNX5/SNX6 and associated SNX1/SNX2 proteins remain on endosomes in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infected cells, their sequestering by the chlamydial inclusion may interfere with normal endosomal trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). It was thus proposed that the role of IncE could be to compete for SNX-retromer endosomal interactions, resulting in the breakdown of normal trafficking of the CI-MPR and lysosomal hydrolases and hence perturbation of the endolysosomal systemâs capacity for bacterial destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>). Defining the precise role of SNX proteins and other endocytic machinery in chlamydial infection will clearly require further study.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides novel molecular insights into the mechanism of SNX protein coercion by the IncE chlamydial effector, and presents a blueprint for future studies of other inclusion protein activities. In addition, our results provide a possible clue to understanding how SNX5-related molecules mediate protein interactions required for canonical cell trafficking pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptides</title><p>All synthetic peptides used for isothermal titration were purchased from Genscript (USA).

You will be pleased to learn that your article has been favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Suzanna Pfeffer, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The other following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Oliver Daumke and Volker Haucke.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Using quantitative proteomics, Heuer and colleagues previously found that SNX 5 and certain other SNX proteins are enriched on <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusions; in particular, SNX5 controls the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection and retrograde trafficking is essential for infectious progeny formation. Engel and colleagues reported similar findings and more specifically, that the C-terminal portion of IncE binds to sorting nexins (SNXs) 5/6 of the retromer. Both reports showed that depletion of retromer components enhances progeny production, indicating that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> may hijack retromer to avoid degradative trafficking.</p><p>This manuscript reports the crystal structure of IncE C-terminal residues in complex with the PX domain of SNX5; in addition, it presents a protein binding interface for a PX domain in a subfamily of PX domain proteins that does not contain a functional phosphoinositide binding domain. Comparable binding affinity is seen for SNX 5, 6 and 32 PX domains but not that of SNX1. The story is compact and of high quality; it is an interesting variation on a theme of Chlamydial hijacking and the reviewers support presentation in <italic>eLife</italic> because it highlights an interesting biological interaction of medical importance: the elucidation of the molecular basis for hijacking of endosomal SNX5/6 and possibly 32 by bacterial IncE is important and of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. Overall, the data support the main conclusions of the paper, however a few aspects should be strengthened by a few straightforward, additional experiments.</p><p>1) The authors provide qualitative data (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) from overexpression experiments in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infected HeLa cells as an assay for IncE-mediated GFP-SNX5 recruitment. The staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is hard to see and quantitative image analysis from multiple experiments will greatly strengthen the present story. The presence of endogenous endosomal SNX proteins that may interfere with recruitment and result in additional effects (e.g. as they may heterodimerize) that make the results difficult to interpret. Thus it would be worth testing IncE-mediated recruitment of SNX5 to bacterial inclusions using quantitative image analysis in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous SNX5/6/32 that express wt or mutant versions of SNX5 to verify the conclusions from transient overexpression and qualitative imaging. Moreover, do the mutations in the IncE binding interface equally hamper recruitment of SNX6 and SNX32, similar to what is seen for SNX5? Are other endogenous SNX proteins co-recruited to the inclusion in this case?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> would benefit from rearrangement and clearer labels. The authors may consider splitting panel C into three separate panels that are the easier to refer to in the main text. Moreover, critical amino acids delineating the SNX5 interface for IncE binding should be highlighted: Yellow labels of amino acids are difficult to see. Moreover, a different view of the interface from another angle may help to bring the message across. In 3C, maybe remove the non-relevant background and shades. The orientation of the magnifications relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is not clear; for better orientation, indicate the deduced membrane binding site of the PX domain.</p><p>3) Regarding the role of PI3P in SNX5 recruitment: The text in the Results section refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, which is missing from the PDF. As for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> please re-investigate the role of endosomal PI3P by quantitative image analysis and application of available selective Vps34 inhibitors (e.g. Vps34-IN1). Finally, split and merged channels as well as blow-ups should be shown in the actual figure to bring across this important point.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref><italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>s are given as Î¼m concentrations, whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> molar concentrations are plotted.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Although <italic>eLife</italic> tries very hard not to ask for extra, unnecessary experiments, the reviewers did not feel that you had adequately address their concerns about the presentation and quantification of the images as described below. We would like to be able to publish this story when you are able to address these issues satisfactorily and will welcome one last round of revision before we reach a binding decision.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors have really not adequately improved the quality or the quantification of the micrographs. I strongly suggest that the micrographs be shown as individual figures with larger images, and we need to know how many cells were counted and how the analyses were carried out before we can publish the story.

All they have done is adding some Mander's colocalization coefficient, but it is unclear from how many cells and how many independent experiments these are derived. More importantly, I would still like to see formal proof that the F136A mutation does not impair SNX5-SNX1 (or 2) heterodimer formation in vitro and its localization at endosomes in mammalian cells assayed quantitatively. This in my view is required to support the corresponding statement in the text. Also, some better high mag colocalization images illustrating SNX5 WT and mutant targeting to endosomes would help to convince readers of the paper.</p><p>Likewise, my comment (#5 in the original review) regarding quantitative image analysis regarding effects of PI3K inhibition has not been addressed really.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural basis for the hijacking of endosomal sorting nexin proteins by <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and an additional reviewer. You will be pleased to learn that the reviewers found the revised manuscript to be much improved, and if you are able to make the following minor corrections, they have recommended in favor of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, are as follows:</p><p>It appears that the statistical analysis of protein co-localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> is based on the number of cells analyzed: 10 cells per condition â a fairly low number â which the authors say to derive from 2 independent experiments. According to convention in experimental biology individual cells from a cell line cannot be considered n for statistical analysis. Hence, n in fact equals &quot;2&quot; in this case, which does not allow for statistical testing by either parametric or non-parametric tests. However, as the phenotypes are clear-cut and in the interest of timely publication we recommend simply eliminating the statistical test from the figure, legend, and the text and simply leave the bar diagrams including error bars as a means of quantitation.</p><p>A last minor point: The heading of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> should read &quot;Mutations [â¦] formation in vitro&quot; (e.g. delete &quot;and in cells&quot;) as no cell data are contained in the respective figure. Provided these small changes we recommend acceptance and congratulate the authors on this nice piece of work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22311.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This manuscript reports the crystal structure of IncE C-terminal residues in complex with the PX domain of SNX5; in addition, it presents a protein binding interface for a PX domain in a subfamily of PX domain proteins that does not contain a functional phosphoinositide binding domain.

The staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is hard to see and quantitative image analysis from multiple experiments will greatly strengthen the present story.</italic> </p><p>We have provided Manderâs coefficients to measure the relative distribution of the GFP-SNX5 and mutant to the inclusion membrane as defined by mCherry-Rab25. This data has been added to the manuscript. With respect to âquantificationâ of the changes that occurs in the localization of IncE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref> we do not consider any of the correlative methods appropriate for the following reasons. Firstly, the correlation of the IF signal for EEA1 and IncE is relatively low. They tend to be proximal to each other presumably as they are located on distinct subdomains of same endosomes (EEA1 â body; IncE/SNX5 â tubular domains). Secondly, the dramatic change of the mutant proteins to the cytoplasm results in a low level of correlation between endosome-associated proteins and the surrounding cytoplasm. We did calculate the number of punctate structures/per cell positive for GFP-IncE in an attempt to quantify any change in endosome association. For example, 29.556 +/- 4.558 punctate structures per cell were observed for IncE 91-132 while 0 +/- 0 for IncE 91-132 (F116D). However, as the analysis of the mutant proteins showed no punctate structures we felt documentation of this obvious difference provided little additional insight.</p><p><italic>The presence of endogenous endosomal SNX proteins that may interfere with recruitment and result in additional effects (e.g. as they may heterodimerize) that make the results difficult to interpret.

If the authors have other ways of addressing this point and are able to provide more quantitative data regarding the recruitment behavior of mutant SNX5 in cells this is fine.â</p><p>Our interpretation then is that the referees are concerned the mutant SNX5 (F136A) may also impact the folding and normal heterodimerisation of the SNX5 protein with either SNX1 or SNX2 Note that SNX5 does not homodimerise with itself, nor heterodimerise with SNX6 and SNX32 is not expressed endogenously in HeLa cells. We believe this concern is addressed by the fact that the SNX5 (F136A) mutant is recruited normally to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As this will only occur in a heterodimeric complex with either SNX1 or SNX2 we therefore conclude that the mutant is properly folded and otherwise functional.</p><p>Because we are not performing a rescue experiment to determine if mutation results in recovery of a ânormalâ SNX5 function, we believe that performing the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusion recruitment experiment in a knockout background would not be informative. Here we are simply assessing if the binding deficient mutants are capable of being recruited to the chlamydial inclusion (SNX5) or endosome (GFP-IncE) through reciprocal interactions. As they are clearly not recruited (and see additional quantitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), it is not clear what additional information would be gained by also knocking out the endogenous proteins</p><p><italic>Moreover, do the mutations in the IncE binding interface equally hamper recruitment of SNX6 and SNX32, similar to what is seen for SNX5? Are other endogenous SNX proteins co-recruited to the inclusion in this case?</italic> </p><p>To determine if mutation to the IncE binding interface also prevents interaction with SNX6 or SNX32 we performed additional in vitro experiments. Two new pieces of data clearly show that the IncE binding mechanism is identical in the three related SNX proteins. In new ITC data we find that mutation of the key Phe116 side chain in the IncE peptide blocks binding to both the SNX6 and SNX32 PX domains (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), similarly to the interaction with SNX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, in unpublished results we recently determined a crystal structure of the SNX32 PX domain in complex with the peptide from IncE (see image showing an overlay of SNX32 and SNX5 complexes). In this case the structure was solved with a co-complex including a synthetic peptide rather than a fusion protein as done for SNX5 (resolution, 2.3 Ã; <italic>R/R<sub>free</sub></italic> 0.19/0.23). We have not included this data in the manuscript, but it clearly confirms for the referees that the binding site is essentially identical in both proteins. In summary the IncE binding interface is highly conserved and we are certain that mutation of the strictly conserved Phe136 side- chain in all three SNX proteins would perturb IncE binding and inclusion recruitment.</p><p>Within cells we did not provide any experimental data that expression of the fragment of IncE âhampered recruitmentâ of SNX proteins to the bacterial inclusion. In fact, expression of these fragments does not have any impact on recruitment of endogenous SNX5 to the inclusion as the full-length membrane anchored bacterially synthesized IncE is still present on the outer membrane of the inclusion.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> would benefit from rearrangement and clearer labels. The authors may consider splitting panel C into three separate panels that are the easier to refer to in the main text. Moreover, critical amino acids delineating the SNX5 interface for IncE binding should be highlighted: Yellow labels of amino acids are difficult to see. Moreover, a different view of the interface from another angle may help to bring the message across. In 3C, maybe remove the non-relevant background and shades. The orientation of the magnifications relative to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is not clear; for better orientation, indicate the deduced membrane binding site of the PX domain.</italic> </p><p>This figure has now been adjusted to improve clarity as requested. The three panels have been separated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, 3D and 3E</xref> and referred to separately in the text and figure legend. The background shading in these close up images has been reduced and the yellow text has been changed to orange to make it easier to see. The two side chains critical for binding in SNX5 (Phe136) and IncE (Phe116) have been highlighted for the reader. We have decided not to indicate where the putative membrane-binding site is located in these images, as we feel this is better addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and would be confusing to include in this figure.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the role of PI3P in SNX5 recruitment: The text in the Results section refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>, which is missing from the PDF. As for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> please re-investigate the role of endosomal PI3P by quantitative image analysis and application of available selective Vps34 inhibitors (e.g. Vps34-IN1). Finally, split and merged channels as well as blow-ups should be shown in the actual figure to bring across this important point.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> has been renamed as <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> to avoid confusion. It is not a PDF but an attached video showing the disruption of endosomal recruitment of GFP-SNX5 following wortmannin treatment in HeLa cells, while recruitment to the inclusion membrane is not affected. We have added an additional sentence to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> in order to clarify this. The figure panels have been split into separate channels with merged images shown alongside.</p><p>In the current study we have blocked formation of all 3-phosphoinositide species using the pan-specific PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. As <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusion recruitment of SNX- BAR proteins is not perturbed this indicates that the inclusion recruitment of SNX5 is likely driven by a protein-protein interaction (later shown to be IncE by SNX5 mutagenesis), rather than via 3- phosphoinositides including both the early and late-endosome enriched PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2. We altered the text to emphasise wortmanninâs broad inhibitory effect to avoid confusion: âInterestingly, when infected cells are treated with wortmannin, a pan-specific inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) activity, we see a loss of the SNX proteins from punctate endosomes, but not from the inclusion membraneâ. The reviewers suggest that we perform additional experiments using a specific inhibitor such as the Class III PI3K inhibitor Vps34-IN1, which will block specific formation of PtdIns3P. As wortmannin has no effect on inclusion recruitment, Vps34-IN1 is unlikely to provide additional insights.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> K<sub>d</sub>s are given as Î¼m concentrations, whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> molar concentrations are plotted.
