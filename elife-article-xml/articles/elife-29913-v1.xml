animal behavior. In many organisms, chains of neural oscillators underlie the generation of these rhythms. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, locomotor wave generation has been poorly understood; in particular, it is unclear where in the circuit rhythms are generated, and whether there exists more than one such generator. We used optogenetic and ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of secondary rhythms to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation, we demonstrate bidirectional entrainment of oscillations between different body regions. These results show that, as in many other vertebrates and invertebrates, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that coordinate activity to generate behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>motor circuit</kwd><kwd>rhythm generator</kwd><kwd>CPG</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS-084835-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fouad</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Hongfei</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Abraham Noordergraaf Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Shelly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Littlejohn Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Shelly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Holtz Undergraduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Julian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Asuka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009160</institution-id><institution>Lawrence Ellison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Scholar in Aging Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Rhythm generating units are sometimes functional in isolated spinal cord and invertebrate nerve cord preparations, producing fictive rhythmic motor outputs that resemble in vivo patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marder and Calabrese, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grillner and El Manira, 2015</xref>). At the same time, sensory feedback and reflex loops have also been found to be important for motor rhythm coordination and modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wendler, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu and Friesen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>How do cellular pacemakers, network oscillators, and sensory feedback interact to enable rhythmic motor generation and coordination? The identification and study of locomotor Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in the mammalian spinal cord has been complicated by the systemâs complexity and the large numbers of neurons that are potentially involved. As a result, many components of the mammalian locomotor rhythm generator remain unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). However, work on vertebrate and invertebrate models, such as swimming leeches and lampreys, has allowed the basic principles and components of neural oscillators to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Electrophysiological studies on the leech isolated ventral nerve cord (VNC) have found that individual ganglia distributed along the body can generate oscillatory patterns that mimic those of normal swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weeks, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder et al., 2005</xref>). Stretch sensation and central control couple the oscillatory units in both the ascending and descending directions, such that the intact animalâs entire circuit functions in synchrony during swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the lamprey, excitatory interneurons proposed to be rhythm generators are also found throughout the approximately 100 spinal segments, which can generate oscillations when isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). The distributed nature of rhythm generation in swimming models bears some resemblance to that found in hindlimb locomotion in limbed vertebrates, for which rhythm generating capability is distributed along the caudal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2006</xref>). Moreover, analogues of many of the key neuronal classes underlying these behaviors in lampreys and zebrafish are also found in the mouse spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goulding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, a clear understanding of how motor systems generate locomotory oscillations at the network, cellular, and molecular levels remains elusive. In both the leech and lamprey, identification of the neurons responsible for rhythm generation remains incomplete, and the mechanism(s) by which these neurons generate swim rhythms are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>). In the lamprey, proposed oscillator neurons have not been directly shown to generate the swimming rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). Moreover, the paucity of genetic manipulations available in these organisms makes it difficult to describe molecular mechanisms that contribute to rhythm generation.</p><p>The roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a promising model for achieving an integrated behavioral, circuit, and molecular understanding of how locomotion is generated and coordinated. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a compact nervous system containing a few hundred neurons, for which a nearly complete wiring diagram of synaptic connectivity has been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varshney et al., 2011</xref>). Wormsâ optical transparency allows researchers to monitor neural activity with genetically encoded calcium and voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kerr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kerr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flytzanis et al., 2014</xref>), and manipulate neurons and muscles using optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stirman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Husson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kocabas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang-Yen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> is readily amenable to a powerful set of genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahringer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans, 2006</xref>) and shares extensive genetic homology with humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lai et al., 2000</xref>). Classical neurotransmitters involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion include acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rand, 2007</xref>), GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen, 2005</xref>), glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockie and Maricq, 2006</xref>), and the biogenic amines dopamine and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> moves forward by generating sinusoidal dorso-ventral bending waves that propagate from anterior to posterior. The circuit for locomotion consists of interneurons, excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons, and body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">White et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2011</xref>). The majority of motor neuron cell bodies are located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), which runs along the ventral side of the body from head to tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2011</xref>). The VNC motor neurons include A, B, VC, D, and AS cell types. Laser ablation studies have shown that the A-type neurons are essential for reverse locomotion, whereas the B-type are required for forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). The D-type (GABAergic) motor neurons are required for a normal amplitude of body bending waves but are not essential for locomotion itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McIntire et al., 1993b</xref>). The function of the AS neurons is unknown. The VC neurons are involved in egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). These classes all form neuromuscular junctions with body wall muscles (BWMs).</p><p>While the basic architecture of the motor circuitry has been delineated by laser ablation studies, much less is understood about how its components interact to generate coordinated locomotory behavior. Perhaps most notably, it is not known which elements generate the wormâs dorso-ventral oscillations during forward movement, nor how many such rhythm generators exist. Worms are capable of limited movement despite ablation of most premotor interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wicks and Rankin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). When all premotor interneurons are removed, animals did not generate directional movement, but retained the ability to generate local body bends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). However, forward locomotion was observed after ablation of all premotor interneurons and A motor neurons (Gao et al,Â 2017), suggesting that periodic bending during forward locomotion may be organized at the level of the non-A motor neurons and/or the body wall muscles.</p><p>Sensory feedback has been shown to play an important role in coordinating <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor behavior. The frequency of <italic>C. elegans</italic> undulation depends continuously on mechanical loading by its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>), and computational models based on proprioceptive feedback and coupling have recapitulated key aspects of locomotory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). Experiments in which the wormâs body was partially immobilized in a microfluidic device showed that the posterior B-type motor neurons mediate anterior-to-posterior proprioceptive couplingÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). B-type motor neurons sense the body curvature and induce bending in the same direction (ventral or dorsal) posterior to the sensed bending.</p><p>These findings suggested a model for forward locomotion, similar to one proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karbowski et al., 2008</xref>), in which a single rhythm generator generates bending undulations in the head, and these undulations propagate through the body from anterior to posterior via proprioceptive coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). This model successfully reproduced the continuous variation in locomotory characteristics observed in varied mechanical environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>). This work, while demonstrating how a wave can be propagated along the body, did not directly address the identity of the rhythmic generator(s). Furthermore, it focused on coupling in the posterior of the worm and did not determine whether head and neck proprioception is similarly essential for bending wave propagation.</p><p>How might the locomotory circuit be organized? The circuit contains one or more oscillators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A model including a single oscillator with proprioceptive coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) predicts that a disruption in body bending at any location will inhibit posterior bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Alternative possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhen and Samuel, 2015</xref>) include the presence of multiple oscillators distributed along the motor circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as in the vertebrate spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>) and in the VNC of some invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). These oscillatory units could be capable of generating undulations in the posterior of the worm even if anterior neural activity or physical bending is interrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29913.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of curvature analysis and models of rhythm generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dark field image of aÂ worm shown with curvature segmentation.

The finding that most premotor interneurons are not necessary for forward locomotion and 2FU suggests that high-frequency tail undulations during 2FU may originate from the motor neurons themselves. We asked, in the presence of all premotor interneurons, whether any classes of motor neurons are required for 2FU.</p><p>We first examined the A-type motor neurons. While the A class motor neurons are preferentially active during reverse locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haspel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>) and are required for reverse locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>), it is conceivable that they play a role in 2FU. We found that ablating the A- and VC-type motor neurons with a genetically targeted ROS generator (P<italic>unc-4::miniSOG</italic>) did not prevent 2FU induced by neck paralysis during forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C,E</xref>).

We sought to determine whether any individual or small group of these neurons is essential for 2FU. We ablated groups of 2â6 B-type motor neurons at a time using our pulsed infrared laser system. 2FU was observed very rarely after ablating DB3, VB3, and VB4 or VB8 and VB9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>), although in both conditions there were additional instances of 2FU that occurred outside the time 3 s window used for frequency analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouad et al., 2017</xref>). 2FU occurred repeatedly, although not commonly, in all other conditions.

In nearly all cases, ablation of a DB motor neuron resulted in the disappearance of its commissural process, but we could not determine whether ablated VB neuronal processes were similarly removed. Therefore, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that a specific neuronal process can generate rhythms for 2FU in the absence of its associated cell body.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that in the presence of premotor interneurons, the B class motor neurons contribute to neck-paralysis induced 2FU, but no single member is essential for generating high-frequency tail rhythms during 2FU. The A, VC and D motor neurons are not required for 2FU. The AS motor neurons were not investigated. Our results are consistent with a model in which posterior rhythm generation can arise from multiple subsets of B or AS motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>B-type motor neurons, as a class, are essential for 2FU</title><p>We next asked whether the B motor neurons as a class are required for 2FU.

Animals treated with these three lesions are henceforth referred to as âVNC-lesionedâ worms. These worms exhibited very little movement in the head.

To test this possibility directly, we cut the VNC and DNC in two locations: in the neck (anterior to VB3) and in the tail (posterior to VB8). We again thermally lesioned the head neurons to suppress head movement. Under these conditions, the VNC motor neurons between VB3 and VB8 are isolated from circuitry in both the head and tail, and the VNC motor neurons posterior to VB8 are isolated from both the head circuits and the anterior VNC motor neurons.

The latterÂ hypothesis may be supported by our earlier observation that strong decoupling of head and tail oscillations by muscle ablation (i.e. <italic>without</italic> lesioning the nerve cord or parallel tracts) resulted in similarly slow head oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), while weak decoupling resulted in moderately slower head oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Worms subjected to this procedure exhibited a head bending frequency approximately one half that of the imposed frequency. The factor of one half is likely due to the presence of two phases during the rhythmic locomotory cycle of any single part of the body during which the curvature is close to zero (i.e. muscles are relaxed).

Pulsing at frequencies below 1 Hz generally led to head oscillations near the imposed frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>(ii)). These results show that a mid-body rhythmic signal can entrain head bending, and point to the presence of an anteriorward coupling mechanism within the motor circuit.</p><p>We asked whether the anteriorward coupling occurs via the VNC cholinergic neurons, which are electrically coupled to each other, the muscle-to-muscle gap junctions, or through another mechanism.

When isolated from the rest of the cord, groups of lamprey spinal segments do not exhibit identical preferred frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen, 1987</xref>). In the swimming intact animal, oscillations in all segments are phase and frequency-locked by intersegmental coupling that spans broad swaths of the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The motor system of the leech, an invertebrate, also shows a distributed rhythm generating architecture. Individual ganglia of the leech VNC can generate crude bursting patterns that resemble their firing patterns during swimming. The most robustly oscillating ganglia are towards the middle of the leechâs body, and isolated midbody ganglia also have a higher frequency than isolated ganglia near either the head or tail. In the intact animal, extensive, bidirectional intersegmental coupling drives the system to adopt a single locomotor frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearce and Friesen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our results reveal a picture of forward locomotor control in <italic>C. elegans</italic> similar to that found in theÂ lamprey and leech. We found that rhythmogenic capability in the worm is distributed along the VNC motor circuit. As in other swimming models, the rhythm-generating capability of posterior circuits is only detectable when coupling is disrupted. The rhythm-generating capability of posterior circuits was demonstrated in several ways: optogenetic inhibition of anterior neurons, optogenetic inhibition of anterior muscles, an inhomogeneous mechanical environment, or a lesion to the nerve cords. The incomplete nature of our optogenetic decoupling method yielded evidence that an anterior rhythm can entrain the higherÂ frequency posterior rhythms. For example, we found that during 2FU, some but not all waves in the tail were continuous with waves in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Even in these cases, the difference in locomotory frequency between the two body regions is inconsistent with single oscillator models.</p><p>We found that neither the head nor tail frequency during 2FU matched the natural (unperturbed) frequency of locomotion. Instead, the normal locomotory frequency in the environment of the assay was generally intermediate between the head and tail frequencies exhibited during 2FU. This finding shows another key similarity with models of swimming in other vertebrates and invertebrates: during locomotion, multiple rhythm generating units, each with different rhythmic properties, are combined by strong inter-unit coupling to form one functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friesen and Hocker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kiehn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>). Such a whole-body oscillating unit will generally have rhythmic properties different from that of any subunit in isolation. Indeed, modeling studies of the leech swim CPG have suggested that the overall fictive locomotor frequency of a 17-ganglion portion of the VNC lies within the range of frequencies of the individual ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>). The gradient in intrinsic frequencies appears to set the wavelength during fictive swimming. The variation in rhythmic properties between different parts of the body may play a similar role in <italic>C. elegans.</italic></p><p>During forward locomotion, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> motor circuit is coupled by posteriorward proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>), and additional anteriorward and posteriorward coupling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This bidirectional coupling appears to allow the entire circuit to operate as one unit. This picture is similar to descriptions of leech and lamprey motor circuits. In the leech, oscillatory interneurons that comprise the swim CPG send axons along the anterior-posterior axis of the animal, and mediate bidirectional coupling between midbody ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friesen and Hocker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). The coupling between ganglia appears to result from a mixture of proprioceptive feedback and central control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). Injection of sinusoidally varying current into the leech stretch receptor cells was sufficient to entrain swimming activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu and Friesen, 2004</xref>) at the injection frequency. Imposed rhythmic movements are also capable of entraining fictive swimming in isolated preparations of the lamprey spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grillner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McClellan and Sigvardt, 1988</xref>) and several other vertebrate and invertebrate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wendler, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robertson and Pearson, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Our results include several lines of evidence implicating the cholinergic B and AS motor neurons as a likely source of posterior rhythmogenesis during <italic>C. elegans</italic> forward locomotion. First, disruption or removal of most or all B motor neurons virtually abolished independent tail undulations induced either optogenetically or by severing the nerve cords, but elimination of other motor neurons and premotor interneurons did not eliminate the ability of the posterior to oscillate independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Second, stimulation of select B and AS neurons after paralyzing most of the body led to local, high-frequency oscillations in the tail that mimicked 2FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Third, imposing a rhythmic signal on mid-body B motor neurons sufficed to entrain whole-body locomotor frequency, as did imposing rhythms on the broader class of cholinergic neurons and the body wall musclesÂ (FigureÂ 8). Changes in body posture are sensed by the B motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>), providing a likely explanation for how theÂ BWM manipulation was able to entrain locomotion. The latter argument is somewhat comparable to one of the key criteria used to classify leech interneurons as part of the swim CPG; that injection of a pulse of current resets the phase of the locomotor rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>). In our experiments, the swimming frequency, and thus phase, was reset almost immediately after the first inhibitory stimulus, suggesting that the B motor neurons share the phase shifting property with oscillatory interneurons in the leech. Lastly, the B motor neurons are rhythmically active in phase with locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2012</xref>), satisfying another key criterion set for candidate oscillator neurons in the leech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Descriptions of swimming CPGs in vertebrates have tended to exclude motor neurons as members of the CPG, with most oscillatory function attributed to interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). Leech excitatory motor neurons have not been shown to be members of the swim CPG, as injection of a pulse of current fails to reset the cycle phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). However, leech inhibitory motor neurons are ascribed a role in swimming rhythm generation using the phase-resetting criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mullins et al., 2011</xref>), motor neurons comprise the crab stomatogastric CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>), and recent work has shown that motor neurons are key components of several locomotory pattern generators. In leech crawling, which consists of cyclic elongation and contraction phases, current pulses to the CV elongation motor neurons do indeed reset the phase of fictive crawling. However, the CV neurons were not concluded to be necessary components of the CPG because tonic hyperpolarization failed to abolish the crawling rhythm. Anatomical removal, arguably the more relevant test of necessity, was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rotstein et al., 2017</xref>). In zebrafish, motor neurons for swimming are bidirectionally coupled to locomotion-driving interneurons by gap junctions, and influence their recruitment, synaptic transmission, and firing frequency during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, there is a growing recognition that motor neurons are not limited to conveying oscillatory signals from interneurons, but may themselves participate in rhythm generation.</p><p>One difference between our results and previous findings in leeches is in the effect of severing the VNC. When we severed the VNC and DNC of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found that independent, generally higher frequency undulations occurred posterior to the severed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Disruption of the leech VNC, by contrast, was not sufficient to prevent wave propagation from head to tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that proprioceptive information suffices to propagate the wave. However, severing the VNC intersegmental coordinating neurons in in vitro preparations induced uncoordinated fictive swim oscillations at different frequencies occurring on either side of the cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weeks, 1981</xref>). This difference in results may arise due to differences between our thermal ablation method in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and physical severing of the leech VNC, or the relative span of proprioceptive signals in each system.</p><p>Our laser lesioning of the VNC likely did not remove the severed processes of premotor interneurons, nor did it prevent nonsynaptic neurotransmission, for example through neuropeptides, from potentially regulating rhythm generation across the lesion. These possibilities may account for the apparent difference in posterior rhythmogenic capability between worms in which AVB had been ablated versus severed. When the ventral nerve cord was isolated from the head ganglia, including the soma of AVB, rhythmic tail undulation was reliably evoked by a mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, independent tail undulations were observed only rarely after ablating AVB, even when the mechanical stimulus was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The AVB processes that likely remain in the severed VNC segments may continue to provide excitation to the B motor neurons to promote rhythm generation. The other apparent discrepancy, between disrupting AVB-B gap junctions by <italic>unc-7</italic> or <italic>unc-9</italic> genetic mutations and ablating AVB, may be a consequence of other effects of the mutation, including changes in other connections between the premotor interneurons and the B motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Starich et al., 2009</xref>), that may compensate for the loss of AVB:B gap junctions to activate the forward circuit. In any case, the observation that tail undulation was reliably evoked after eliminating all synaptic inputs from the head is inconsistent with the notion that independent oscillations from the tail require synaptic input from head circuitry.</p><p>Taken together, our results point to a new working model of <italic>C. elegans</italic> forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Three oscillator units are depicted: an unknown head CPG, the VNC motor neurons between VB3 and AS7, and the VNC motor neurons between VB9 and AS11. The two VNC units are justified by our data from worms in which the VNC and DNC were cut in multiple locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We include AS in the model because it is the only class of VNC motor neurons that we have not directly investigated, and could be important for rhythm generation in the tail. The premotor interneurons, especially AVB, are important for activating the oscillatory circuit and may have additional unexplained roles in posterior rhythm generation. These are not the only circuit units capable of generating oscillations; when we severed the VNC and DNC at arbitrary locations, we found that oscillations resume closely posterior to each cut over a wide range of circuit sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that even smaller circuit units, perhaps even individual motor neurons, can generate rhythmic outputs.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29913.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model for <italic>C. elegans</italic> forward locomotion.</title><p>Two units of the VNC motor neurons (and potentially more subsections) are capable of independent rhythm generation.

Dark-field illumination was provided by red LEDs and worms were imaged with a sCMOS camera (QImaging optiMOS). Custom written C++Â software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouad et al., 2017</xref>) performs image segmentation of the worm and allows the user to select a region of the worm to illuminate. The illumination region is sent to a digital micromirror device (DMD), which then projects the laser onto only the desired portion of the worm through a 10X objective. The entire cycle runs at 40 Hz. A green laser (Shanghai Laser and Optics Century GL532T3-300, 532 nm wavelength, irradiance 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at focal plane) was used for all activations of NpHR or Arch, and a blue laser (Shanghai Laser and Optics Century BL473T3-150, 473 nm wavelength, irradiance 4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at focal plane) was used for activation of ChR2. Worms were placed in a solution of 17% dextran in NGMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>) in an 80-Âµm-thick chamber between a microscope slide and cover glass, separated by glass beads. NGMB is identical to NGM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) but without agar, peptone, or cholesterol.</p><p>To determine the accuracy of our illumination system, we studied worms expressing the excitatory opsin ChR2 under the control of the <italic>aptf-1</italic> promoter. These worms were reported to quickly become quiescent when the RIS head neuron is illuminated with blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turek et al., 2013</xref>). We targeted a thin band of blue light to various locations along the centerline of each worm, and measured the amplitude of head bending waves as an output (data not shown). The distance between the region where most slowing occurred (body coordinate 14) and the nearest region with no slowing (body coordinate 20) suggests that our optogenetic targeting system has a resolution of about 6% of an adult wormâs body length, similar to that reported for a previous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optogenetic inhibition and stimulation</title><p>For head and neck optogenetic inhibition experiments, YX9 (Muscle::NpHR), ZM5016 (Cholinergic Neurons::NpHR), WEN001 (B::Arch), YX127 (Cholinergic Neurons::NpHR&amp;ChR2, A/VC::miniSOG), YX119 (Muscle::NpHR, <italic>unc-49</italic>(<italic>e407</italic>)), YX135 (Muscle::NpHR, <italic>vab-7(e1562),</italic> YX137 (Muscle::NpHR, <italic>unc-7</italic>(<italic>e5</italic>)), or YX140 (Muscle::NpHR, <italic>unc-9</italic>(<italic>fc16</italic>)) larvae were transferred to ATR plates and allow to grow to first day of adulthood. Up to 20 adult worms were mounted at a time on our optogenetic targeting system. Worms were sampled with replacement from the dextran chamber, and illuminated with a green (532 nm wavelength) laser a total of one to three times in the indicated region, with at least 10 s between successive illuminations of the same animal.</p><p>For activation of posterior B and AS motor neurons, YX127 (Cholinergic neurons::NpHR and ChR2, A/VC::miniSOG) worms were allowed to grow to the second larval stage on ATR plates, and then illuminated <italic>en masse</italic> with blue light (470Â Â±Â 17 nm wavelength) at 3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for 20 min to ablate the A-type motor neurons. Worms were transferred to a fresh ATR plate to grow for two more days. To confirm a loss of reversal capability in each day one adult, worms were individually prodded with a platinum wire worm pick. All worms tested failed to move backwards during this assay. Worms were then mounted on the optogenetic targeting system as before. Global amber (580Â Â±Â 15 nm wavelength) illumination was applied through the transmitted light port of the microscope and varied in irradiance until just strong enough to paralyze the worm, presumably through the action of P<italic>unc-17::NpHR</italic>. Once paralyzed or nearly paralyzed, 473 nm laser light was applied to the indicated region of the tail using the DMD.</p><p>For rhythmic inhibition of muscles or cholinergic neurons, synchronized YX148 (Muscle::NpHR, AB::RFP) L4 larvae, YX139 (Muscle::NpHR, BWM gap junctions disrupted) L4 larvae, YX127 day 1 adults, or WEN001, day 1 adults grown on ATR plates were mounted on the optogenetic targeting system and illuminated periodically at the indicated frequency and location through our custom software. For this experiment, L4 <italic>qhIs1</italic> larvae were used because expression of <italic>myo-3::NpHR::ECFP</italic> in the BWMs appeared to be weaker in adults. YX127 animals were not exposed to blue light prior to this experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuron and muscle photoablation using miniSOG</title><p>For optogenetic 2FU experiments, YX126 (Muscle::NpHR, A/VC::miniSOG) larvae were allowed to grow for 2 days on OP50 plates until the L4 stage, at which RFP was visible in the both the A- and VC-type motor neurons. Worms were bulk illuminated with blue light (wavelength 470Â Â±Â 17 nm) at 3.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for 20 min of total illumination time using 0.5 s on/1.5 s off pulse train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qi et al., 2012</xref>) from a Leica EL6000 light source. After illumination, the larvae were transferred to OP50+Â ATR plates and incubated for two additional days, but did not appear to grow past the L4 stage. During the optogenetic experiments, worms were observed swimming forward and stopping, but never in reverse. In addition, worms were handled individually and recovered from the dextran chamber for fluorescence imaging. We mounted each worm on a separate 4% agar pad and acquired RFP images on a compound fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000B). In control worms, which grew into adults, RFP was visible in the VC-type motor neurons, some A-type motor neurons (RFP was visible in all A-type motor neurons at the L2-L4 stages), and the posterior intestine. The normal RFP expression pattern in A- and VC-type motor neuron was absent in all illuminated worms. However, neurons in the tail corresponding to VA12, DA8, or DA9 were usually visible (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>For VNC/DNC cauterization experiments, YX177 (AB::RFP, A/VC::miniSOG) worms were exposed to blue light at the L2 stage using 0.5 s on/1.5 s off pulsing and surgically manipulated at the day 2 adult stage as described below. Ablation of the A motor neurons was assessed by recording GFP fluorescence images of each animal after behavioral imaging. In all animals, only B and AS motor neurons were visible along most of the VNC, with the exception of the three posterior A motor neurons noted above.</p><p>For body wall muscle ablation experiments, YX203 (BWM::miniSOG) adults were immobilized on agar pads using polystyrene beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and the indicated region of the body was exposed to light with wavelength 470Â Â±Â 20 nm at an irradiance of 75 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> through a 40x objective on a Leica DMI6000B or DMI4000B microscope for 5.5 min with a 0.5 s on/0.5 s off pulse protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu and Chisholm, 2016</xref>). Spatial selectivity was achieved by restricting the diameter of illumination by adjusting the microscopeâs epifluorescence field diaphragm. After illumination, worms were recovered to an unseeded plate and immediately transferred to a 17% dextran chamber for behavioral imaging.</p><p>For B ablation experiments using P<italic>unc-17Î²::PH::miniSOG</italic> (YX223), we found that illumination at any larval stage preferentially killed the DA and DB motor neurons, but left most VA and VB alive, as determined by the loss of all dorsal commissures and DNC labeling by P<italic>acr-2::wCherry</italic> (not shown). Hence, we illuminated all YX223 animals at the L1 stage for 20 min with 0.25 s on/0.25 s off pulsing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu and Chisholm, 2016</xref>) to kill DB. Worms were recovered to ATR (for optogenetic 2FU) or regular seeded (for VNC surgery) plates. Additional laser ablation of VB neurons was performed at the L4 stage, and lesioning of the VNC and DNC was performed at the day 2Â adult stage (both described below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ablation of premotor interneurons by ICE</title><p>Prior to conducting optogenetic experiments, we generated strains YX152 (P<italic>nmr-1::ICE</italic>; P<italic>glr-1::ChR2::YFP</italic>) and YX153 (P<italic>glr-1::ICE</italic>; P<italic>glr-1::ChR2::YFP</italic>) to test whether the interneurons were appropriately ablated. Control ZM4624 (P<italic>glr-1</italic>::ChR2::YFP) L1 larvae and adults showed bright YFP labeling of many neurons, including many head neurons and PVC, the only pair of labeled neurons in the tail.</p><p>In L1 arrested YX152 and YX153 worms, many neurons were also easily visualized by YFP, although normal locomotion was impaired. By the adult stage, YFP signals in all head and tail neurons had nearly vanished in all YX153 worms (NÂ =Â 18); some small and faint fluorescent puncta, similar in appearance to intestinal birefringent granules, were visible in the nerve ring and tail. These dim puncta did not have visible processes, and we were unable to identify any head neurons or PVC in any of these worms. In YX152 adults, PVC was similarly not identifiable in any worm (NÂ =Â 10), although many brightly YFP-labeled neurons were visible in the nerve ring. These results suggest that all or most P<italic>glr-1</italic> positive interneurons are ablated in P<italic>glr-1</italic>::ICE worms and that PVC (and likely other P<italic>nmr-1</italic> positive neurons) are ablated in P<italic>nmr-1::ICE</italic> worms.

Each pad was mounted on a pulsed infrared laser system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churgin et al., 2013</xref>) that had been modified with increased power to deliberately kill cells. Each neuron, visualized by RFP or GFP fluorescence optics, was irradiated with a single 0.8 to 1.6 ms pulse of the 400 mW laser through a 63X oil immersion objective. We determined that a single 0.8 ms pulse reliably kills a targeted VNC motor neuron, has a 50% chance of killing a VNC neighbor within 2.5 Î¼m, and has a 10% chance of killing a VNC neighbor within 5 Î¼m from the target (A. D. F. and C. F.-Y., unpublished data). After ablation, worms were recovered and transferred to a fresh ATR plate to resume development for one additional day. During optogenetic experiments, worms were handled individually and recovered to agar pads after illumination.</p><p>To sever the VNC and DNC, day 2 adult YX148 or LX929 (Cholinergic neuron::GFP) worms were immobilized with polystyrene beads and mounted on our infrared laser system as before, and the indicated area of the wCherry- or GFP-labeled cord was illuminated with a train of 10â25 IR laser pulses with 2 ms duration. Worms were transferred to fresh unseeded plates and allowed to recover for at least 4Â hr before behavioral and fluorescence imaging. For behavioral imaging, worms were mounted individually in 17% dextran chambers and recorded swimming for at least 1 min under dark-field illumination. Most worms were inactive 4 hr after surgery, especially when the VNC and DNC were lesioned in two locations (not shown).</p><p>In many other systems, mechanical, electrical, or chemical stimuli can be applied to induce swimming or fictive swimming in an otherwise quiescent preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>). To agitate <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we mechanically vibrated each worm using a 200 Hz cell phone motor for periods of 10â20 s to induce locomotion at least twice during each recording. After behavioral imaging, each worm was transferred to a pad and imaged for red or green fluorescence imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence imaging and identification of neurons and nerve cord lesions</title><p>For all neuron ablation or nerve cord lesioning experiments, we acquired RFP or GFP fluorescence images of each animal through a 40X objective on a compound fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B). Through examination of images, A and B type motor neurons or AVB interneurons were labeled as present or missing based on the location, stereotypic ordering, commissural orientation, and the presence or absence of commissures from dorsal A- or B-type motor neurons. In ablation conditions labeled âmost VBâ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>, we only used data from animals in which at most three out of the nine VB neurons between VB3 and VB11 inclusive were visible. In DB ablation conditions in the same two figures, all DB motor neurons appeared to be missing, and occasionally some VA/VB were missing as well. However, we generally could not identify B motor neurons anterior to VB3 because of clustering and the presence of very bright AIY::RFP in <italic>qhIs9</italic>Â worms. In each category in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, we included only worms for which all indicated B motor neurons were missing. Some individuals in each category had additional missing neurons. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>, all ablated B motor neurons are indicated for each individual worm example. In AVB ablation conditions, we only analyzed data from worms in which both AVB cell bodies and their associated processes were removed. Because cell killing occurs over aÂ ~Â 3 Î¼m radius volume in our system, it is highly likely that other head neurons were also damaged or killed by this procedure. For nerve cord lesioning experiments, we only analyzed data from animals in which all indicated VNC/DNC targets were clearly severed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Head lesions using a heated wire</title><p>To broadly lesion the head and inhibit anterior bending, four freely crawling adult N2 worms were gently touched on or near the head with a platinum wire attached to a soldering iron. The worms appeared to crawl backwards after the initial touch, so we applied a second touch to the agar near the tail to induce forward locomotion. We recorded behavior immediately after lesioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Heterogenous mechanical environment experiments</title><p>Day 1 adult N2 worms were transferred to a slide containing 3 to 5 ÂµL islands of solutions of high viscosity 3% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC, Ashland Benecel K200M) in NGMB, surrounded by NGMB without HPMC. A second slide, spaced by 125 Âµm thick plastic spacers, was placed on top to form a two-dimensional chamber similar to those used for optogenetics experiments, but with an inhomogeneous mechanical environment. We imaged each slide under dark field illumination on a Nikon TE2000-S microscope and recorded worms transitioning from low-viscosity to high-viscosity regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Curvature segmentation, analysis, and statistics</title><p>For experiments with our optogenetic targeting system, the real-time segmentation for body targeting was recorded to disk along with each video frame. We wrote custom MATLAB codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouad et al., 2017</xref>) to compute the curvature of the worm in each frame using the recorded centerline coordinates. All analysis codes, codes for the optogenetic targeting system, and source data for figures are freely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fouad et al., 2017</xref>). Frequencies and amplitudes in optogenetic experiments were measured over either a 3 s non-illuminated interval ending at the start of illumination, or a 3 s illuminated interval beginning at the start of illumination. Trials were excluded if, during the period of analysis, (1) the worm showed reverse locomotion at any time, or (2) the segmentation algorithm was disrupted, for example if the worm touched a bubble, another worm, or the edge of the chamber.</p><p>For all other experiments, worm segmentations were generated from dark-field videos using WormLab software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). The centerline coordinates were exported and curvature maps constructed as before. To identify bouts of forward locomotion in 1â2 min worm recordings, we computed the activity level and wave direction in the kymogram as a function of time and body coordinate. Bouts of forward locomotion in body segments were identified when the activity level was higher than a fixed threshold and the local direction of wave propagation was anterior-to-posterior for longer than the amount of time specified (typically 2â3 s).</p><p>To measure frequencies of undulation at any body coordinate, we computed the Fourier transform of time derivative of the curvature, and identified the frequency corresponding to the maximum amplitude within a 0 to 2.5 Hz window. For trials in which no clear peak emerged (i.e. the maximum amplitude was less than a fixed threshold), no undulations were considered to have occurred and the frequency was treated as zero. The same threshold was used for every frequency measurement presented. In ratiometric measurements, a small number (&lt;2%) of ratios with infinite values were excluded. Bending amplitudes were calculated as the root mean square of time differentiated curvature. Changes in the mean frequency, frequency ratio, or bending amplitude of all paired data were evaluated using a paired t-test.</p><p>For blinded, randomized scoring of trials shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>, kymograms were scored manually without prior examination of the data. Trials were scored as â2FUâ or âoscillatingâ if the following criteria were met: (1) bending waves were visible in the tail that did not appear to arise from the head, and (2) at least two complete undulatory cycles occurred in the tail, in any portion of the optogenetic inhibition or vibration stimulus time windows, which were 8 and 20 s, respectively. Trials were marked for exclusion if the windows contained exclusively reversal or incorrectly segmented behavior. The manual scoring method allowed detection of 2FU occurring outside the 3 s window used for quantitative analysis, which is why more 2FU trials were found in the DB ablation condition by manual scoring than by quantitative frequency analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mei Zhen, Quan Wen, Min Wu, Michelle Po, Yishi Jin, Andres Villu Mariq, and Alexander Gottschalk for providing strains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David M Miller III (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript that is very important for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model system, and has general interest as well. It dissects the motor system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> by targeted optogenetic manipulation, laser ablation experiments, and mutant analysis and uses behavior as assays to identify and define the forward locomotion &quot;CPG&quot;. While CPG may not be the right term in the minds of many, the authors do indeed identify sources of oscillation in motor neurons that underlie rhythmic forward locomotion.</p><p>Multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry (VNC) are capable of independently generating undulatory body rhythms. The driver of these multiple rhythm generators is localized to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody, mainly B-MNs dedicated to forward locomotion. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation, bidirectional entrainment between different sections of the body was revealed. The distributed nature of the network and the bidirectional nature of the coordination mechanisms make the system analogous to swimming in vertebrates such as lamprey and zebra fish which broadens interest. The work is very careful and systematic with appropriate controls, and the data analyzed appropriately. Necessary data appear in figures in an easily accessible form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion and Introduction need major reconsideration. The concept of CPG is not well articulated and its meaning is stretched, and is not actually consistent with much of the literature in other animals. You are defining units of &quot;oscillation&quot; which map to some extent onto B-MNs. You are at the beginning of getting down to the oscillators and networks such as may exist. Equating the structure of the forward locomotion circuit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with mammalian spinal cord in limbed mammals seems unwarranted. You may be dealing with something reminiscent of vertebrates like lamprey and fish which use axial locomotion (swimming) or invertebrate networks like that for leech swimming and crawling <italic>but</italic> you have not identified the role of the basic antagonisms at all. What causes dorsal-ventral alternation and can one rhythm exist without the other? You should drop the insistent comparison to limbed mammals (or at least read the literature of the past decade); each limb has its own CPG and there are two limb enlargements in the SC where these reside. Phasing between the limb CPGs is variable (gaits). You should read up on zebra fish and lamprey and also other inverts. Leech crawling (Szczupak) has some things in common with what you have discovered as does leech swimming. You have a tremendous quantity of high quality data that advances work in your area strongly but overselling it to the mammalian community does not serve you well.</p><p>2) In a related preprint released by some of the same authors, &quot;A descending pathway facilitates undulatory wave propagation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> through gap junctions&quot; (https://doi.org/10.1101/131490), there appear to be discrepancies in the results which would be useful to clarify. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> of the preprint, inhibition of mid-body B-type motor neurons appears to disrupt both head and tail oscillators while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> of the manuscript show disruption only of the tail. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> of the preprint also appears to show different results.</p><p>3) Subsection âSeveral classes of motor neurons are not required for forward locomotion or 2FUâ. The conclusion that B and/or AS type cholinergic neurons are required for rhythmic oscillations depends on the finding that direct ablation of other classes of ventral cord motor neurons (A, D, VC) does not. Could this question be addressed in part by ablating all B-neurons with <italic>acr-5::mini::SOG</italic>? Similarly, the <italic>unc-55</italic> promoter is selectively expressed in VD and AS neurons and could therefore be used to determine if AS neurons are required since DD + VD function is not. The <italic>unc-53</italic> promoter, expressed in DA + AS neurons, could also be used for this experiment since DA neurons are not required. The authors should consider these new experiments, which may be quite manageable in a short time, or provide a strong rationale for why they are not appropriate.</p><p>4) Experiments described here either silence potential local sources of oscillation or sever physical connections between motor neurons and distal potential oscillators to conclude that motor circuit oscillations likely originate from distributed foci in the axial nerve cord. These experiments do not rule out the possibility, however, of &quot;wireless&quot; regulators potentially involving neuropeptide signals. The authors should address this point in the Discussion.</p><p>5) Subsection âPremotor interneurons are not essential for forward movement or 2FUâ, last paragraph uses genetic mutants to eliminate gap junctions composed of the innexins UNC-7 and UNC-9 between AVB and B-type motor neurons to argue that the loss of AVB to B-type motor neuron electrical synapses does not prevent independent oscillations of anterior vs posterior body regions. This result is over-interpreted because <italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> mutants would not eliminate other potential AVB B-motor neuron gap junctions composed of other innexins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29913.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Discussion and Introduction need major reconsideration.

We found that inhibition of mid-body cholinergic or specifically mid-body B-type motor neurons can have local or global disruptive effects on locomotory behavior, depending on the strength of inhibition. The strength of the optogenetic inhibition depends on laser power, laser wavelength (to our knowledge, the preprint cited above used a yellow laser which activates Arch more efficiently than our green laser), concentration and freshness of the all-trans-retinal cofactor, size of the region illuminated, and other conditions.</p><p>We are in agreement with results by Xu et al. that strong inhibition of the mid-body motor circuit can disrupt head movement, but we did not focus on this point because (1) it is a central point of the Xu et al. paper, and (2) we showed such anteriorward coupling via our bidirectional entrainment experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection âSeveral classes of motor neurons are not required for forward locomotion or 2FUâ.

The authors should consider these new experiments, which may be quite manageable in a short time, or provide a strong rationale for why they are not appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these excellent suggestions. The conclusion that B/AS motor neurons are involved in rhythm generation does not rely entirely on the results of ablating other neuron types, but is also supported by two additional findings. First, we showed that optogenetic stimulation of B and AS in a tail paralyzed worm induces high frequency local undulations similar to 2FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript). Second, we showed that rhythmic hyperpolarization of the B motor neurons (P<italic>acr-5::Arch</italic>) suffices to reset and entrain the whole body undulatory rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the B motor neurons are essential for rhythm generation.</p><p>As suggested, we have conducted further experiments to investigate the requirement of the B-type motor neurons in posterior rhythm generation.</p><p>We generated a strain incorporating <italic>Punc-17beta::PH::miniSOG</italic>, which was reported to specifically kill the A and B motor neurons. We found, however, that in our hands it preferentially kills DA and DB over VA and VB. We therefore combined <italic>Punc17beta::PH::miniSOG</italic> with our infrared laser ablation method to kill all B type motor neurons.</p><p>We found that ablation of DB and VB together resulted in tail paralysis and virtually eliminated optogenetically induced 2-frequency undulation (2FU) and undulations posterior to a nerve cord cut. Ablation of the DB motor neurons alone sharply reduced, but did not eliminate, incidence optogenetically induced 2-frequency undulation (2FU) and undulations posterior to a nerve cord cut. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p><p>In addition, we studied <italic>vab-7</italic> mutant worms, in which the DB motor neuron processes are aberrantly directed toward the head (opposite the normal direction). These worms exhibited a paralyzed tail and did not generate the high frequency undulation in 2FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> in the revised manuscript). The results further support the claim that B motor neurons are essential for rhythm generation.</p><p>With regard to AS, our experiments do not rule out a role or requirement for AS in generating the high frequency tail rhythms. We decided not to delve into this previously neglected class of motor neurons because we are aware that another group has undertaken a detailed study of AS. We leave open the possibility that AS has a role in rhythm generation.</p><p>All the results described above have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. In addition, a summary of the arguments in support of the B and/or AS neuronsâ involvement in rhythm generation is now included in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Experiments described here either silence potential local sources of oscillation or sever physical connections between motor neurons and distal potential oscillators to conclude that motor circuit oscillations likely originate from distributed foci in the axial nerve cord.

This result is over-interpreted because unc-7 and unc-9 mutants would not eliminate other potential AVB B-motor neuron gap junctions composed of other innexins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the original manuscript may have over-interpreted the results of the <italic>unc7/unc-9</italic> mutant experiments. We have revised the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>To clarify whether any AVBâB or other connections are required for 2FU, we performed new experiments in which we ablated AVB. We found that 2FU occurred only very rarely when AVB was removed. This was somewhat surprising because undulations occur readily when the VNC (and hence AVBâs process) is severed. However, we noted that AVBâs process disappeared when the cell body was ablated at the L4 stage, but when we severed the nerve cords directly the process was likely still present, and possibly functional, in each isolated circuit segment. This difference in residual AVB function may explain the observed behavioral differences. Although high frequency oscillations were rare after complete ablation of AVB, they were still occasionally possible, suggesting that AVB is important for but not strictly required for generation of these rhythms. These results were broadly consistent with AVB ablation experiments described in the preprint by Xu et al. These results are now included in the manuscript In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
