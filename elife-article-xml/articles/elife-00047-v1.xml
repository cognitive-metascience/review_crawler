During virus infection detection of nucleic acids is crucial for the inflammatory response. Here we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a DNA sensor that activates innate immunity. We show that DNA-PK acts as a pattern recognition receptor, binding cytoplasmic DNA and triggering the transcription of type I interferon (IFN), cytokine and chemokine genes in a manner dependent on IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Both cells and mice lacking DNA-PKcs show attenuated cytokine responses to both DNA and DNA viruses but not to RNA or RNA virus infection. DNA-PK has well-established functions in the DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, hence loss of DNA-PK leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, we now define a novel anti-microbial function for DNA-PK, a finding with implications for host defence, vaccine development and autoimmunity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00047.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00047.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00047.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For multicellular organisms, the innate immune system is the first immunological defence against infection, rapidly recognizing and responding to the presence of any pathogen. Many different cell types contribute to the innate immunity, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages. Once alerted to injury or infection, these cells release proteins called cytokines, interferons and chemokines into the blood or directly into tissue. These proteins act as messengers and interact with receptors on the surfaces of other cells in the immune system, stimulating them to join the battle against the infection.</p><p>Detecting nucleic acids such as DNA is an important part of recognizing pathogens and infectious agents, particularly viruses, and activating the innate immune system. However, while the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm is known to initiate an innate immune response, we do not fully understand how this foreign DNA is sensed, or how the innate immune system is activated once foreign DNA has been detected.</p><p>Here Ferguson et al. report that a well-known complex of three proteins, collectively called DNA-dependent protein kinase, is able to activate an innate immune response when it detects foreign DNA. This enzyme, called DNA-PK for short, is best known for its ability to repair broken DNA inside the nucleus. Now Ferguson et al. have found that it is also present at high levels within fibroblasts, cells that are often primary targets of viral infection, and they go on to explain how the detection of DNA by DNA-PK triggers a sequence of events that leads to the innate immune response being activated. These events include the transcription of type I interferon, chemokines and cytokines in a manner that depends on the presence IRF-3, a transcription factor that has a central role in the response of the immune system to viral infection.</p><p>By identifying a role for DNA-PK in the cytoplasm as a DNA sensor, the work of Ferguson et al. increases our understanding of innate immunity. It may also, in the future, lead to an improved understanding of autoimmunity, and might also assist in the development of more immunogenic vaccines based on DNA or microbes that contain DNA.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00047.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00047.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA-PK</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>pattern recognition</kwd><kwd>vaccinia virus</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Geoffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G1000207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Geoffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0800101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>Nicholas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Imperial College London Junior Research Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JRF2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Brian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conselho nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, CNPq/Brasil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210239/2006-9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mansur</surname><given-names>Daniel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments in mice have shown than an enzyme that repairs broken DNA inside the nucleus also has a central role in the innate immune system because it is able to detect foreign DNA outside the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune response is mediated by the production of cytokines, including type I interferons (IFNs), and chemokines following the detection of pathogen-specific molecules by host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). Detection of nucleic acids is crucial in triggering the innate immune to pathogens, particularly in response to viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>). Various double and single stranded RNA substrates are recognised directly by the DExD/H box RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5) in the cytoplasm and by the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>). The engagement of such RNA receptors leads to the rapid transcription of genes encoding anti-viral proteins via the activation of transcription factors belonging to the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) families. It has been recognised for some time that intracellular DNA can activate a similar IRF-3-dependent innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>) and it is known that this signalling pathway depends on both the IRF-3-activating kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishii et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2008</xref>) and the adaptor protein stimulator of IFN genes (STING—also known as MITA, ERIS and TMEM173) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Only more recently, however, have some candidate receptors for these pathways been identified. DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takaoka et al., 2007</xref>), RNA polymerase III (RNA-Pol III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablasser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu et al., 2009</xref>), IFN inducible gene 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Unterholzner et al., 2010</xref>) and DDX41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011b</xref>) have been described as cytoplasmic DNA sensors that activate IRF-3. Nonetheless, the in vivo relevance of these sensors remains unknown and the normal immune response to DNA stimulation of <italic>Dai</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> and <italic>Ips1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) and sensing of plasmodium DNA independent of these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2011</xref>) indicates other IRF-3-activating cytoplasmic DNA sensors exist. In addition, although TBK1 and STING are essential for activation of IRF-3 following DNA stimulation, the molecular details of this signalling pathway are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paludan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The presence of unidentified DNA sensors in fibroblasts is especially pertinent to virus infection since these cells are often a primary target of virus infection in vivo. These cells should have sentinel innate immune receptors in place to detect the presence of foreign nucleic acid and respond by producing IFN, cytokines and chemokines to initiate the anti-viral state in the surrounding tissue as well as to attract immune cells to the site of infection. In this study we identify DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as a novel DNA sensor in fibroblasts where it is present at high levels enabling it to respond to incoming infection without the need for prior stimulation. DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of three proteins, Ku70, Ku80 (also known as Ku86) and the catalytic subunit DNA-PKcs (encoded by the <italic>xrcc6</italic>, <italic>xrcc5</italic> and <italic>prkcd</italic> genes respectively). Ku70 and Ku80 themselves form a heterodimer and the absence of one subunit de-stabilises the expression of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nussenzweig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 1997</xref>). Both the Ku heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walker et al., 2001</xref>) and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammarsten and Chu, 1998</xref>) can bind directly to DNA but, in the absence of Ku the affinity of DNA-PKcs for DNA is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yaneva et al., 1997</xref>). DNA-PK has a well described role in the nucleus where it is necessary for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and so has a key role in repairing double-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lieber et al., 2003</xref>). DNA-PK has also been detected in the cytoplasm by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balazs et al., 2012</xref>), although prior to this study no function has been assigned to DNA-PK in this localisation. Here we found that, in the cytoplasm, DNA-PK signals via IRF-3 to activate an anti-microbial innate immune response to DNA mediated by the production of IFN, cytokines and chemokines. We show that DNA-PK co-localises with sites of viral DNA replication during VACV infection and the innate immune response to DNA and to infection with vaccinia virus (VACV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) was impaired in both cells and mice which lack components of DNA-PK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA-PK binds DNA in the cytoplasm</title><p>To identify novel cytoplasmic DNA sensors, we transfected biotinylated dsDNA composed of a concatenated 45-bp oligonucleotide (called immunostimulatory DNA, ISD, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>)) into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and isolated DNA/protein complexes from the cytoplasm by affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The three abundant proteins that bound specifically to DNA, and not to biotinylated lipoprotein pam-3-cys, were unequivocally identified as Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed by subcellular fractionation that DNA-PK is present in the cytoplasm of resting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balazs et al., 2012</xref>) and that this cytoplasmic localisation was not due to nuclear contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The DNA pull-down was reproduced from murine fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), showing the cross-species conservation of this interaction. Additionally, in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Ku80 (<italic>Xrcc5</italic><sup>−/−</sup>), the remaining DNA-PK components did not interact with cytoplasmic DNA under the conditions tested, whereas in <italic>Prkdc</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs, Ku80 was still recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In this study we show that the three proteins which constitute the DNA-PK complex; Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, bind in significant amounts to DNA transfected into the cytoplasm of resting cells leading to an IRF-3-dependent innate immune response. Consistent with this, we found DNA-PK and TBK1 localised to sites of DNA replication during virus infection. Previous studies have ruled out a role for DNA-PK in the production of <italic>Ifnb</italic> in response to DNA in monocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>) and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>). However, although DNA-PK components are expressed at high levels in a wide range of tissues and cell types, they are absent in primary macrophages ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moll et al., 1999</xref>) and data not shown), and we now show that in fibroblasts and in mice the innate immune response to DNA and DNA viruses is dependent on DNA-PKcs. The in vivo deficiency in DNA sensing in the absence of DNA-PKcs is observed despite the presumed presence of other DNA sensors. The observation that this defect is not extended to RNA, LPS or to RNA viruses shows that DNA-PK loss does not confer a general defect on intracellular innate immune signalling, and the same is true in cultured <italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> MEFs which respond normally to RNA. It was noticed that the defect in the innate immune response to DNA was greater in cells lacking DNA-PKcs than in cells lacking Ku, even though Ku can still bind DNA in the absence of DNA-PKcs. This suggests that signalling can progress with DNA-PKcs interacting with DNA in the absence of Ku but that Ku enhances the signalling process by increasing the affinity of the protein complex for DNA. The phenotypic defect in DNA sensing was consistent in cells from four separate genotypes, ruling out the possibility that it was caused by a second site mutation. Consistent with this reintroduction of Ku80 into <italic>Xrcc5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells restored DNA sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>The well-studied <italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>SCID</italic></sup> mutation kills the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs via the introduction of a premature stop codon that results in expression of a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blunt et al., 1996</xref>). Although kinase activity is essential for DNA-PKcs to function in DNA repair, and therefore V(D)J recombination, this mutation did not affect the ability of DNA-PK to function as an innate immune DNA sensor. The functional significance of the interaction of DNA-PK with IRF-3 and its subsequent N-terminal phosphorylation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karpova et al. (2002)</xref> remains unknown. However, we show here that Ku interacts with STING in resting cells and that this interaction is abrogated upon DNA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In the future, further work is necessary to understand how TBK-1 and STING contribute to the full activation of IRF-3 following binding of DNA to DNA-PK to allow IRF-3 translocation to occur.</p><p>DNA can act as a powerful immunostimulatory agent in many contexts. DNA vaccination relies on DNA sensing to invoke a powerful innate immune response that, in turn, assists the adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding how to optimise such vaccines, therefore, relies on understanding the mechanisms of detection of DNA by the immune system. Furthermore, one of the most common vaccine adjuvants, alum, acts by stimulating the release of DNA from neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2011b</xref>). Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) consist of webs of DNA with globular proteins, are released by a specific form of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>) and function as antimicrobial traps, thereby contributing to the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Outside the context of infection, DNA can act as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), accelerating inflammatory responses following its release from dying or damaged cells directly contributing to the pathogenesis of various diseases such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oka et al., 2012</xref>) and deep vein thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brill et al., 2012</xref>). The ability of DNA to act as a DAMP may also link nucleic acid sensing to several autoimmune disorders. In general, autoimmune conditions are characterised by immune responses against host molecules and tissues and are frequently associated with inflammation. Although the causative factors of many such conditions are incompletely understood, it is clear that deregulation of immune signalling may lead to autoinflammation and autoimmunity in some instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rioux and Abbas, 2005</xref>). Indeed, the accumulation of DNA and its subsequent detection by DNA sensing pathways can result in the initiation of autoimmune diseases. Mice which lack either of two enzymes responsible for degradation of DNA, 3′ repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1) and DNaseII, develop spontaneous autoimmune disorders associated with the initiation of IRF-3-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stetson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okabe et al., 2008</xref>). The absence of DNaseII results in chronic polyarthritis which is thought to be a result of the inflammation caused by a lack of clearance of DNA from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okabe et al., 2008</xref>). Trex1 deficiency or mutation, on the other hand, is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chilblain lupus and the human disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee-Kirsch et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stetson et al., 2008</xref>) and in this case inflammation is initiated from non-haematopoietic cells via a STING-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gall et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, defects in the clearance of NETs have also been suggested to contribute to the initiation of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hakkim et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the up-regulation of the inflammasome-activating DNA sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) in a mouse model of lupus and in patients with SLE-associated nephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimkong et al., 2009</xref>) and the presence of anti-DNA-PK and anti-RNA-Pol III antibodies in patients with SLE and systemic sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavazzana et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2009</xref>) makes the link between DNA sensing and autoimmune disorders worthy of further investigation.</p><p>The identification of several candidate DNA sensors in multiple cells types in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hornung and Latz, 2010</xref>) suggests the evolution of redundancy in this system. This redundancy is not surprising given the tendency of pathogens to evolve escape-mechanisms for evading host immune mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Versteeg and García-Sastre, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardoel and Strijp, 2011</xref>) in turn inducing the host to evolve further pathogen recognition mechanisms. In the context of DNA sensing this is exemplified by the relatively recent evolution of the PYHIN domain proteins, such AIM2 and IFI16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schattgen and Fitzgerald, 2011</xref>), which are a mammalian addition to the ancient innate immune system. Furthermore, a function of DAI was recently uncovered by identifying murine cytomegalovirus protein, vIRA, which interacts with DAI and inhibits its ability to initiate DNA-induced necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Upton et al., 2012</xref>). The biological function for DAI may therefore be in the initiation of a cell death pathway, rather than an IRF-3 dependent inflammatory response. This indicates there are at least three outcomes to cytosolic DNA sensing, the induction of cytokine expression via IRF-3 and NF-kB activation, the secretion of IL-1β via the AIM 2 inflammasome and the induction of necroptosis by DAI. What is not clear though, is how these different responses contribute to the overall immune response to infection by DNA pathogens and to what extent they are cell and tissue-type dependent. Further work is necessary to uncover the relative contributions of these different DNA sensing mechanisms in specific cell types and to different DNA structures as well as to understand how these sensors co-ordinate with STING and other adaptor proteins to activate TBK1 and IRF-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paludan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Overall these findings provide a novel function for DNA-PK in the innate immune response, beyond its roles in DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, and increase our understanding of the innate immune response to cytoplasmic DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice on a 129 background were a kind gift from Dr Fred Alt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 1998</xref>) and <italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>SCID</italic></sup> and Balb/c mice were from Harlan laboratories.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 2 reviewers, 1 of whom is on the board of reviewing editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. While the reviewers found your work to be potentially interesting, there are some significant technical concerns. Specifically, more than one MEF line needs to be used to avoid MEF specific artifacts, and complementation experiments need to be performed to rule out contribution of cell transformation status and other possible effects specific to the MEF lines used. In addition, the mechanism of kinase activity independent effect of DNA-PK needs to be clarified – if it does function as a scaffolding protein, there should be some evidence provided to substantiate this hypothesis. The full comments follow:</p><p>1) Studies that are based on MEFs can sometimes be misleading due to MEF heterogeneity. Different preps of MEFs are not identical in their gene expression and behavior, and therefore it is critically important A) to test more than one preparation of MEFs to confirm all the key results and B) to perform complementation experiments by re-introducing the gene of interest, in this case DNA-PK, Ku70 and Ku80. It may be technically difficult to transfect DNA-PK because if its size, but Ku70 and Ku80 can be transfected to test recovery of the response to DNA and the virus. These experiments are particularly important because some of the innate immune responses to DNA are not present in transformed cells. Since transformed MEFs were used in this study, and the degree of transformation may be greater in the knockouts, it is important to perform careful complementation studies.</p><p>2) It is also surprising that the catalytic activity of DNA-PK is not required for the anti-viral response. The authors suggest that DNA-PK may function as a scaffold for signaling complex assembly. However, no evidence is provided here.</p><p>3) Finally, DNA-PK deficiency appears to affect some but not all DNA induced genes. Full gene expression analysis using microarray comparing WT and DNA-PK deficient cells would be very informative. In addition, comparison of gene expression in unstimulated WT and DNA-PK deficient MEFs (which would be part of a control for a microarray study) would help to address the issue of MEF heterogeneity and transformative state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00047.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Studies that are based on MEFs can sometimes be misleading due to MEF heterogeneity.

These experiments are particularly important because some of the innate immune responses to DNA are not present in transformed cells</italic>.</p><p>The importance of using non-transformed (primary) cells was recognised and our study design reflected this. We stated in our submission that <italic>primary</italic> DNA-PKcs <sup>-/-</sup> cells were used. With the exception of Figure 2D, all data for DNA-PKcs <sup>-/-</sup> cells were from primary (passage 1) cells. In addition, we obtained DNA-PKcs <sup>-/-</sup> cells from 2 different external laboratories, as well as making our own primary cells multiple times. All these cells gave the same phenotype. So these data cannot be attributed either to “cell specific artifacts” or due to a “transformed status”.</p><p>In addition, the experiments were performed with 4 different mutant cells types with defects in DNA-PK components. These all gave the same defect in DNA-sensing to IRF3. So there is close to zero chance that these observations are due to second site mutations. The signalling defect observed is also highly specific and not general. The mutant cells do not activate IRF3 in response to DNA, but they do respond normally to DNA to activate NF-kB, normally to RNA stimulation, normally to LPS, and normally to RNA virus infection. The suggestion that the defect observed in DNA sensing leading to an IRF3 dependent innate immunity might be due to a general signalling defect is refuted by the data submitted.</p><p><italic>Since transformed MEFs were used in this study, and the degree of transformation may be greater in the knockouts, it is important to perform careful complementation studies</italic>.</p><p>The great majority of data used primary (not transformed) cells, and the signalling defect is highly specific rather than general. Therefore, the basis for doing a complementation experiment is lacking. Nevertheless we have done a Ku80 complementation experiment as requested and show that this restores DNA sensing to IRF3 (Figure 2). This is now mentioned in the text. We have also made explicit that the MEFs were from multiple labs including our own and that primary means passage 1.</p><p><italic>2) It is also surprising that the catalytic activity of DNA-PK is not required for the anti-viral response. The authors suggest that DNA-PK may function as a scaffold for signaling complex assembly. However, no evidence is provided here</italic>.</p><p>To address this we have created a cell line (based on HEK293 cells) in which STING is expressed inducibly upon addition of doxycycline. HEK293 cells are defective in responding to DNA and this is shown to be overcome by inducible expression of STING (Figure 5E). Using this inducible cell line we show that STING interacts with Ku, and when the pathway is activated by transfection of DNA, the interaction with STING is lost (Figure 5F). This provides additional insight into how DNA-PK components engage the STING / TBK1 / IRF3 pathway, but the full elucidation of how this works is outside the scope of this paper.</p><p><italic>3) Finally, DNA-PK deficiency appears to affect some but not all DNA induced genes. Full gene expression analysis using microarray comparing WT and DNA-PK deficient cells would be very informative. In addition, comparison of gene expression in unstimulated WT and DNA-PK deficient MEFs (which would be part of a control for a microarray study) would help to address the issue of MEF heterogeneity and transformative state</italic>.</p><p>Data showing the readout of several inflammatory mediators is presented in this paper. Since DNA-PK is required for IRF3 but not NF-kB activation (as we show), it is evident that some, but not all, DNA-induced genes will be affected, and these are predictable based on the requirement of genes for these different transcription factors. Therefore, we believe that a microarray experiment is unnecessary for this manuscript reporting this novel DNA sensor and showing its in vivo importance.</p></body></sub-article></article>
