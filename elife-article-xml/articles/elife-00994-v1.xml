The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and its natural pathogen, the positive-strand RNA virus Orsay, have recently emerged as a new animal model of host-virus interaction. Using a genome-wide association study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild populations and quantitative trait locus mapping, we identify a 159 base-pair deletion in the conserved <italic>drh-1</italic> gene (encoding a RIG-I-like helicase) as a major determinant of viral sensitivity. We show that DRH-1 is required for the initiation of an antiviral RNAi pathway and the generation of virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs). In mammals, RIG-I-domain containing proteins trigger an interferon-based innate immunity pathway in response to RNA virus infection. Our work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> demonstrates that the RIG-I domain has an ancient role in viral recognition. We propose that RIG-I acts as modular viral recognition factor that couples viral recognition to different effector pathways including RNAi and interferon responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00994.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00994.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00994.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms—from bacteria to mammals—have at least a rudimentary immune system that can detect and defend against pathogens, particularly viruses. This defense mechanism, which is known as the innate immune system, uses sensor proteins to recognize viral RNA, and then mobilizes other immune components to attack the invaders.</p><p>The specific mechanisms used to destroy viruses differ between species. In mammals, a protein called RIG-1 binds to viral RNA and activates a signaling pathway that leads to the production of interferons: immune proteins named after their ability to ‘interfere’ with viral replication. Plants and insects do not use interferons, but instead use a mechanism called RNA interference, in which long double-stranded RNAs are cleaved into shorter fragments.</p><p>The nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> also deploys RNA interference against viruses but, in contrast to insects and plants, worms do not possess a specific set of RNA interference enzymes that participate solely in the antiviral response. They do, however, express a protein called DRH-1 that is related to the RIG-I protein found in mammals.</p><p>To investigate whether DRH-1 contributes to innate immunity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Ashe et al. infected 97 strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> from around the world with a virus, and showed that some strains were more sensitive to the virus than others, with certain strains showing complete resistance. By comparing a sensitive strain with a resistant one, Ashe et al. revealed that viral sensitivity was caused by a mutation in the gene encoding DRH-1.</p><p>Further experiments showed that DRH-1 is required for the first step in RNA interference. Ashe et al. have thus identified a conserved role for RIG-1 in initiating antiviral responses, and propose that the protein couples virus recognition to distinct defense mechanisms in different evolutionary groups.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00994.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00994.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Pen</surname><given-names>Jérémie</given-names></name><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG57329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG58558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miska</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Félix</surname><given-names>Marie-Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Bélicard</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agence Nationale pour la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR 11 BSV3 01301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Félix</surname><given-names>Marie-Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Frézal</surname><given-names>Lise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Coup d’Elan de la Fondation Bettencourt-Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Félix</surname><given-names>Marie-Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ecole Normale Supérieure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Félix</surname><given-names>Marie-Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals use homologous versions of the same protein (RIG-1) to activate antiviral defense mechanisms suggests that RIG-1 may have a conserved role in coupling virus recognition to virus destruction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The arms races between pathogens and their hosts have led to the evolution of sophisticated mechanisms to provide immunity against infection. Whilst adaptive immunity is specific to vertebrates, innate mechanisms are present in all multicellular organisms, allowing cells to recognize specific pathogens and instigate appropriate responses. RNA viruses are important pathogens of many multicellular organisms, which replicate without a DNA intermediate using RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Successful neutralization of invading RNA viruses by cells thus requires the viral genome to be recognized within the sea of endogenous RNA.</p><p>The primary innate immune sensors for RNA viruses in mammals are RIG-I and its homolog MDA-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schlee, 2013</xref>). Viral recognition by RIG-I and MDA-5 triggers activation of downstream signaling, mediated by the proteins’ N-terminal CARD domains, and results in the activation of the interferon pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>). Initial recognition of viral RNA is likely to be mediated by the DExD/H-box helicase domain and the C-terminal RIG-I domain. Though the precise ligands that activate RIG-I family proteins are not fully defined, MDA-5 appears to bind long dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gitlin et al., 2006</xref>), whilst RIG-I seems to recognize the 5′ end of double stranded RNA, but only if it has a 5′ triphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>). As all known RNA polymerases leave a triphosphate at the 5′ end of newly synthesized RNA, the presence of a 5′ triphosphate is likely to be a signature of RNA virus replication and thus allow viral replication intermediates to be distinguished from endogenous mRNA, which will predominantly display a 5′ cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rehwinkel and Reis e Sousa, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In plants and insects, interferon signaling is not involved in antiviral defense. Instead, the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway provides robust defense against RNA viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding and Voinnet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding, 2010</xref>). The initial step in protection against positive strand RNA virus infection in plants and insects is detection and subsequent cleavage of the double-stranded replication intermediate by members of the Dicer family of endonucleases. Insects and plants possess dedicated Dicer enzymes responsible specifically for this antiviral response, Dicer-like 4 (and to a lesser extent Dicer-like 1) in plants, and Dicer2 in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouché et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deleris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fusaro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galiana-Arnoux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Rij et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaz-Pendon et al., 2007</xref>). The small RNAs thus generated feed into the canonical RNAi machinery and can be used to silence the viral genome.</p><p>In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the RNAi pathway is best characterized as a response to artificial introduction of dsRNA by feeding or injection. However, exposing <italic>C. elegans</italic> to virus-derived dsRNA using transgenes or infection with mammalian viruses also triggers an RNAi response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, we have shown previously that this response is also initiated upon infection with a positive strand RNA virus, named the Orsay virus, which infects <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the wild through horizontal transmission. Disruption of this pathway through mutation of the core components of the RNAi machinery results in greatly increased viral infection levels. Interestingly, the Orsay virus infects a wild isolate named JU1580 (from which the Orsay virus was isolated) to much higher levels than the N2 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Félix et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advances, our understanding of how RNAi-mediated antiviral defense in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is orchestrated is still limited. One major unsolved problem is how viral dsRNA within the cell is recognized in order to initiate the antiviral response. In contrast to the situation in both plants and insects, <italic>C. elegans</italic> only has one Dicer enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knight and Bass, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>); it is expected therefore that the activity of Dicer in different small RNA pathways will be controlled by different partner proteins within distinct complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this regard it is intriguing that <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes three homologues of the mammalian viral recognition protein RIG-I: DRH-1, DRH-2 and DRH-3. The three RIG-I family members do not contain the CARD domains required for interferon induction; consistently they have yet to be implicated in signaling pathways. However, they do possess the RIG-I C-terminal domain and the helicase domains, potentially enabling them to recognize viral RNA. So far study of these genes has connected them to the RNA interference response. DRH-1 was initially characterized as a protein interacting with DCR-1, RDE-1 and RDE-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tabara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sijen et al., 2007</xref>). RNAi of <italic>drh-1</italic> was not found to be required for RNAi per se but result in a defect in RNAi of a second gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tabara et al., 2002</xref>), however it remains unclear whether this effect was solely due to knockdown of <italic>drh-1</italic>. More recent studies did not observe defects in endogenous or exogenous small RNA pathways in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). However, <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants were found to be defective in the silencing of a flockhouse virus-derived replicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>drh-1</italic> and <italic>drh-2</italic> are the result of a recent gene duplication event that occurred after the last common ancestor of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its closest known sister clade including <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stein et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>drh-2</italic> is the upstream gene in an operon containing <italic>drh-1</italic>. <italic>drh-2</italic> has lost some of its functional domains due to frame-shift mutations and its function remains unclear, although it has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). DRH-3 is required for endogenous small RNA pathways in the germline and efficient exogenous RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), and is found in at least two distinct protein complexes including the <underline>ERI</underline> <underline>C</underline>omplex (ERIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that RIG-I family genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> initiate RNAi rather than the interferon response.</p><p>Here we discover a naturally occurring deletion in the gene <italic>drh-1</italic> that is widespread in <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations despite predisposing individuals to viral sensitivity. We show that the increased viral sensitivity caused by this deletion results from a failure of the RNAi pathway. Mutations in <italic>drh-1</italic> almost completely abolish the production of primary siRNAs, allowing us to place DRH-1 at the top of a hierarchical RNAi response. Our data supports a model whereby the conserved RNA virus recognition capability of <italic>drh-1</italic> allows it to recruit the RNAi machinery to defend <italic>C. elegans</italic> from viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A natural <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion is a major determinant of viral sensitivity in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>To explore intraspecific variation in viral resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we assayed a worldwide set of 97 wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates that had previously been genotyped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>).

We first assayed viral sensitivity in 110 F2 recombinant families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Whole-genome sequencing of a pool of the 20 most sensitive families revealed linkage to chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To narrow down the candidate region, we introgressed the center of chromosome IV (IV:3,329,219 to IV:11,083,410) of JU1580 into N2 animals (yielding strain JU2170). As expected, JU2170 showed similar viral load to JU1580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then screened for recombinants in this region after crossing JU2170 with N2. This allowed us to restrict the candidate region to a 155 kb interval carried by a virus-sensitive recombinant strain named JU2196 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Genome sequencing of the JU1580 isolate and alignment to the N2 reference strain revealed 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one non-synonymous SNP, and one 159 base indel in the 155 kb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 159 base deletion in the JU1580 genome, named <italic>niDf250</italic> (IV:6,607,635-6,607,793), lies within the <italic>drh-1</italic> gene locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>drh-1</italic> is a homolog of the mammalian <italic>RIG-I</italic> family genes, whose products bind virus-derived RNAs, acting as pattern recognition receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parameswaran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2010</xref>), and trigger antiviral innate immune responses in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> expresses three RIG-I-like proteins: DRH-1, DRH-2 and DRH-3. The <italic>niDf250</italic> deletion covers most of <italic>drh-1</italic> exon 19 and part of exon 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and was confirmed using genomic PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>drh-1</italic> mRNA levels are unchanged in JU1580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and the resulting transcript is predicted to encode a truncated protein of 987 amino acids, identical to the N2 form of DRH-1 up to amino acid 973 but with a novel C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, this truncates the RIG-I C-terminal domain (amino acids 885–1014), thought to be required for RNA recognition specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>To establish a potential role for DRH-1 in Orsay antiviral resistance we tested whether a <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion in the N2 background was sufficient to impart viral sensitivity, as assayed by viral load.

Conversely, transgenic JU1580 animals carrying a fosmid containing the N2 allele of <italic>drh-1</italic> were resistant to Orsay infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, variation at the <italic>drh-1</italic> locus explains the difference in viral load between N2 and JU1580.</p><p>An inactivating mutation in a pathogen-resistance gene could be expected to be a rare deleterious variant in natural populations, yet the wild <italic>niDf250</italic> allele is found at an intermediate frequency at the global level, in 22/97 (23%) of the tested wild isolates.

However, in laboratory conditions, we found that viral infection leads to delayed and decreased total progeny of JU1580 and <italic>drh-1(ok3495)</italic> mutant animals relative to uninfected animals, whilst infection of N2 had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we performed a competition experiment between N2 and JU2196, which contains the <italic>drh-1</italic> region from JU1580 introgressed into the N2 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). N2 rapidly outcompetes JU2196 in the presence of viral infection, but not its absence, confirming that the increased viral infection resulting from the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion is indeed detrimental for fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the absence of viral infection, we could not detect in standard laboratory conditions over 10 generations of competition any positive or negative effect of the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion and the introgressed surrounding region. Thus the natural <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion impairs fitness only in the presence of viral infection.</p><p>To characterize the evolutionary history of the <italic>drh-1</italic> region, we first focused on the 6 Mb region detected by genome-wide association. This region presents three main haplotypes among the 97 wild isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>): the N2 haplotype, the JU1580 haplotype and a distant haplotypic group (including RW7000 and QX1211), as well as a few recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The <italic>drh-1(niDf250</italic>) allele is exclusively found in isolates carrying the JU1580 haplotype in the 6 Mb region and in a few recombinants with either the N2 or distant haplotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The JU1580 and N2 haplotypes show fewer fixed differences in RAD polymorphic sites between them (24 SNPs) than with the divergent haplotype group (63 and 57 SNPs, respectively). In addition, from our whole-genome JU1580 sequencing data, N2 and JU1580 display a very low level of molecular diversity in the central region of chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, we observe a strong decrease in molecular diversity between IV:4529464 to IV:6662701 in isolates carrying the <italic>niDf250</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lines), but not in those carrying the <italic>drh-1</italic> (N2) allele. Thus, the divergence between the N2 and JU1580 haplotypes in this region, including the <italic>niDf250</italic> deletion, appears recent relative to much of the species’ genetic diversity. Furthermore, the <italic>niDf250</italic> allele is in high or even full linkage disequilibrium with a large region of chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, dots). This lack of diversity and the high linkage disequilibrium around <italic>niDf250</italic> suggest a partial sweep of the haplotype linked to <italic>niDf250</italic>. They also imply that the sensitive <italic>drh-1</italic> allele may have spread by hitch-hiking with a favorable allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DRH-1 initiates an antiviral small RNA response</title><p>Having established the major role of <italic>drh-1</italic> allelic variation in natural variation of antiviral defense in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we wished to understand the molecular mechanisms of DRH-1 action in the antiviral response. We previously showed that disruption of small RNA pathway genes such as <italic>rde-1</italic>, which encodes an Argonaute protein essential for RNAi in response to exogenous dsRNA (RDE-1), renders N2 animals as sensitive to the Orsay virus as JU1580 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Félix et al., 2011</xref>). DRH-1 interacts with the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein RDE-4 and the dsRNA-specific endonuclease Dicer (DCR-1), both of which act upstream of RDE-1 in exogenous RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parrish and Fire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2010</xref>) However, DRH-1 is dispensable for exogenous RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore wondered if DRH-1 could act specifically to promote DCR-1 processing of long dsRNA that is produced during viral RNA replication. Indeed, we find that DCR-1 is required for viral resistance in the N2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Long dsRNA is processed by DCR-1 to generate a primary siRNA duplex ∼23 nucleotides (nt) in length with 5′ monophosphates and 2 nt 3′ overhangs. By examining libraries derived solely from small RNAs with 5′ monophosphates (5′ dependent libraries), we could interrogate the primary siRNA response specifically. In wild-type N2 animals, infection with virus leads to generation of predominantly 23 nt small RNAs with no first nucleotide bias, mapping both sense and antisense to the viral genome in equal proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These small RNAs are likely primary DCR-1 products generated from the double-stranded intermediate of viral replication, consistent with the small RNA response against single-strand RNA viruses in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flynt et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, overlapping RNAs mapping to complementary strands of the viral genome showed the 2 nt 3′ overhang characteristic of Dicer products (p&lt;10<sup>−9</sup>, χ<sup>2</sup> test against a uniform distribution of overhang length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The same viRNA pattern was observed in <italic>rde-1</italic> mutants lacking the primary siRNA Argonaute protein RDE-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus <italic>rde-1</italic> mutants are proficient in primary viRNA formation despite being sensitive to viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Félix et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, JU1580 animals showed a markedly different pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). First, a much higher proportion of small RNAs derived from the sense strand than the antisense strand (88% vs 49% in N2). Second, the size distribution of viRNAs was flattened, with a greatly reduced proportion of 23 nt RNAs and an increased proportion of 15–20 nt RNAs. These shorter viRNAs were not present in libraries prepared from uninfected JU1580 or N2 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and appeared to be derived from regions of strong secondary structure within the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The <italic>drh-1</italic> mutant (in an N2 strain background) displayed an identical viRNA pattern to JU1580 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus JU1580 and <italic>drh-1</italic> mutant strains are deficient in primary siRNA generation against the virus.</p><p>Primary siRNAs act upstream of an amplification step by triggering the synthesis of secondary siRNAs antisense to targeted RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sijen et al., 2001</xref>).

Secondary siRNAs have a modal length of 22 nt, are 5′ triphosphorylated, have a strong preference for a 5′ guanine (G), and are referred to as 22G siRNAs (22Gs). Small RNAs can be enzymatically treated prior to adaptor ligation to allow sequencing (5′ independent) of both primary and secondary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pak and Fire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sijen et al., 2007</xref>).

Mutants deficient in the adjacent gene <italic>drh-2</italic> have a viRNA profile similar to N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) and are as resistant to viral infection as N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), implying that this gene is not involved in the antiviral siRNA pathway. Moreover transgenic JU1580 animals carrying the <italic>drh-1</italic> gene from N2 showed the same overall viRNA profile as N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), further supporting the conclusion that <italic>drh-1</italic> deficiency is primarily responsible for the defective siRNA synthesis and virus sensitivity in JU1580. Importantly however, there were residual antisense 22G siRNAs present in both JU1580 and <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants. This suggests that the few DCR-1 products with the correct length in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants can still be used to generate secondary siRNAs as in N2, implying that <italic>drh-1</italic> is not essential for the secondary siRNA pathway. Consistent with this interpretation, the reduced 23 nucleotide long primary siRNA products in JU1580 still displayed a 2 nucleotide 3′ overhang characteristic of DCR-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, residual 22G siRNAs are also present in mutants deficient in the DCR-1 accessory factor RDE-4, which is required for efficient DCR-1 activity in the exogenous RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parrish and Fire, 2001</xref>). Additionally, <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants displayed no difference in endogenous 22G siRNAs mapping antisense to protein-coding genes, whilst, in agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>drh-3</italic> mutants showed markedly reduced levels of endogenous siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together with our observation that <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants are deficient in primary viRNA production, this suggests that DRH-1 acts early in the antiviral siRNA pathway and is not required for downstream amplification steps. These observations are in contrast to earlier work describing a role for DRH-1 downstream of secondary siRNA production in a flockhouse virus replicon model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To further test this interpretation, we examined double mutant strains. The prominent 23 nt peak for sense and antisense viRNAs attributed to DCR-1 activity present in <italic>drh-3</italic> and <italic>rde-1</italic> single mutants was absent in both <italic>drh-3</italic>; <italic>drh-1</italic> and <italic>drh-1; rde-1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that DRH-1 acts upstream of DRH-3 and RDE-1 in the antiviral siRNA pathway and acts in concert with DCR-1. The <italic>rde-4; drh-1</italic> double mutant showed a further reduction in primary 23 nucleotide long Dicer products compared to the <italic>drh-1</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, residual antisense 22G siRNAs in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) were mostly absent in <italic>rde-4</italic>; <italic>drh-1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). These data support the conclusion that residual DCR-1 activity on viral dsRNA in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants is dependent on RDE-4. Thus, the double mutant data confirms the position of DRH-1 as an upstream factor essential for the generation of robust levels of antiviral siRNA in response to infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall our data support a key and unique role for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> RIG-I-like protein DRH-1 in primary siRNA synthesis by either guiding DCR-1 activity to the viral genome or assisting DCR-1 processing of the double-stranded viral RNA. We suggest that the physical interaction between DRH-1 and DCR-1, and the potential for DRH-1 to recognize the viral genome as foreign, possibly through its well-conserved RIG-I domain, may enable DRH-1 to recruit DCR-1 to the double-stranded replicating viral genome and instigate a hierarchical antiviral siRNA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our data also show that the role of DRH-1 in viral recognition is distinct from that of its paralogs. Given the sequence and domain similarities between DRH-1, DRH-2 and DRH-3, it will be of interest to determine the mode of RNA recognition by DRH-2 and DRH-3 in the future.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00994.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model: DRH-1 triggers a hierarchical antiviral RNAi pathway.</title><p>Upon infection of the N2 <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain by the Orsay virus, DRH-1 recruits DCR-1 and its partner RDE-4 to the viral dsRNA replication intermediate. DCR-1 cleaves the viral genome into 23 nt viRNA duplexes with a 2 nt 3′ overhang. Duplex viRNAs are incorporated into the Argonaute protein RDE-1 and one strand is lost to give rise to primary viral siRNAs (primary viRNAs). Primary viRNAs and RDE-1 recruit an RdRP complex to the viral genome to synthesize secondary viral siRNAs, which act to silence viral transcripts or inhibit virus replication. The antiviral RNAi pathway is dependent on the SAGO-2 secondary Argonaute protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The antiviral RNAi pathway has parallels to the exogenous RNAi pathway and the endogenous RNAi pathway thought to recognize aberrant endogenous transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). A complex of DRH-1, DCR-1 and RDE-4 has previously been observed in whole animal lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tabara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>).

It is interesting therefore that DRH-1 is found in a protein complex with DCR-1 and RDE-4 even in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>). This might suggest that this complex limits the availability of DCR-1 for exo-RNAi. However, <italic>drh-1</italic> and N2 worms respond equally to exo-RNAi, suggesting that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). The constitutive nature of the DCR/DRH-1 complex may allow cells to respond much more rapidly to the presence of viral replication intermediates. Recent observations from Rui Lu and colleagues are in agreement with our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23a">Guo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Antiviral small RNAs generated by Dicer are an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for fighting infection by positive-strand RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliyari and Ding, 2009</xref>). However, there must be some mechanism to distinguish between the viral genome and cellular RNAs. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and plants have a dedicated Dicer enzyme responsible for viral dsRNA recognition. We suggest that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> DRH-1 may perform this function. The absence of a role for <italic>drh-1</italic> in the endogenous small RNA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2009</xref>) supports the idea that it encodes a viral-specific recognition factor. In mammals, the C-terminal domain of the DRH-1 ortholog RIG-I is able to recognize the 5′ triphosphate on viral genomes in the context of the double-stranded replication intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</xref>). The C-terminal domain is conserved in DRH-1, thus suggesting that DRH-1 might use a recognition mechanism analogous to RIG-I to recruit DCR-1 to the Orsay virus RNA. In support of this, 5′ RACE experiments from total RNA from infected animals using Orsay virus specific primers fail to detect product unless the 5′ triphosphate is removed prior to adaptor ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that the majority of Orsay genomic RNA molecules are indeed phosphorylated at the 5′ end.</p><p>It is interesting that the recognition function of DRH-1 may be conserved with mammalian RIG-I whilst the effector pathways are apparently distinct. It will therefore be intriguing to examine whether any part of the function of DRH-1 in antiviral RNAi might be conserved in mammals. As yet, although small RNA responses have been analyzed in mammalian cells infected with viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parameswaran et al., 2010</xref>) it is not clear whether these have a significant role in the defense of viral infection or whether they display any similarities to antiviral RNAi pathway in plants or nematodes. Examining whether cells deficient in RIG-I show alterations in small RNA pathways upon viral infection may help to address this question. Equally, it will be interesting to identify whether DRH-1 has a signaling role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> upon viral infection. Such studies might indicate whether the gene expression or the RNAi function is the ancestral role of RIG-I-like genes.</p><p>RIG-I and MDA-5 respond to viral infection with changes in cytoplasmic localization that result in the activation of the interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakhaei et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, <italic>RIG-I</italic> and <italic>MDA-5</italic> are themselves interferon-induced genes. It will therefore be of great interest to explore the behavior of DRH-1 upon viral infection. A recent genome-wide analysis of gene expression upon Orsay virus infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> did not detect any significant changes in <italic>drh-1</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarkies et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, a GFP-DRH-1 fusion protein did not show marked alterations in expression levels or subcellular localization upon infection with the Orsay virus (our unpublished observations). It will be important to analyze the behavior of the endogenous DRH-1 protein upon infection in future studies.</p><p>Our discovery of an inactivating deletion in <italic>drh-1</italic> carried by many wild isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> is consistent with the rapid evolution under strong selection known to characterize proteins involved in immunity, including antiviral RNAi defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obbard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vasseur et al., 2011</xref>). Yet it is puzzling that a derived allele with deleterious consequences in the presence of viral infection is found at intermediate frequency. One possible explanation might be the low natural occurrence of infecting viruses, meaning that the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion is effectively neutral. In support of this argument we have not been able to detect similar intestinal symptoms of viral infection in our extensive <italic>C. elegans</italic> sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16a">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>), including in other years of sampling in the Orsay orchard. Alternatively the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion may have hitch-hiked to fixation with a closely linked beneficial mutation. Such a phenomenon is likely to be common in <italic>C. elegans</italic> natural populations due to the low effective outcrossing rate, which results in high linkage disequilibrium, especially when associated with a positive selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cutter et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed we find that the natural <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion allele is in high linkage disequilibrium with the surrounding region of chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A related possibility is that the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion itself might have a positive fitness effect in some natural conditions. Although we did not detect a fitness advantage for the region surrounding the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion under laboratory conditions, we cannot test all possible natural conditions, thus a beneficial effect for the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion or its surrounding region remains a possibility. Interestingly, RIG-I appears to have been lost in several clades, including chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which might explain the increased sensitivity of chickens to avian influenza virus when compared to ducks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2010</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00994.019</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Evolution of Dicer and RIG-I family proteins</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00994.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00994.019</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th/><th/><th>helicase + RIG-I structures in species</th><th>Dicer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cnidaria</td><td/><td/><td><italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">2</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="13">Bilateria</td><td rowspan="8">Protostomia</td><td>Polyzoa</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Platyzoa</td><td><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></td><td align="char" char="."><underline>0</underline></td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td>Kryptochozoa</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Mollusca</td><td><italic>Aplysia californica</italic></td><td align="char" char="."><underline>0</underline></td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td>Annelida</td><td><italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic></td><td align="char" char="."><underline>0</underline></td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Ecdysozoa</td><td><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></td><td align="char" char="."><underline>0</underline></td><td align="char" char=".">2</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">2</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">3</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Deuterostomia</td><td/><td><italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">2</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>Meleagris gallopavo</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">3</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">3</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>Gallus gallus</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">2</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr><tr><td/><td><italic>Homo sapiens</italic></td><td align="char" char=".">3</td><td align="char" char=".">1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Presence of Dicer and RIG-I family proteins in selected animals.

Fastq files generated by the machine had adaptors removed using the program Cutadapt v1, and were converted into Fasta files using a custom Perl script. For alignment to the viral genome, Fasta files were trimmed to leave only reads of between 15 and 30 nucleotides using a custom Perl script and were aligned using Bowtie (version 0.12.7) to RNA1 and RNA2 of the Orsay virus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Félix et al., 2011</xref>), reporting only the best single alignment with up to one mismatch allowed.

Bed files were read into the R environment and plots of the length and first nucleotide as well as read distribution along RNA2 were generated using custom scripts written in R. The level of virus as measured by qRT-PCR was observed to correlate non-linearly with the total level of sense small RNAs in different N2 wild-type samples, thus data were normalized to all viral siRNAs or all sense viRNAs to illustrate differences in read distribution between different samples. Analysis of the overlap to identify potential DCR-1 signatures was carried out by selecting reads of the same length coming from opposite strands on the viral genome, which overlapped by at least one nucleotide. The number of reads overlapping by every possible length either 3′ or 5′ was compared to that expected were the entire distribution uniform using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. Only one overlap was statistically significantly enriched with a cut-off of p&lt;0.05 as indicated in the text. For alignment to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome to analyze any potential changes in 22G levels, fasta files were trimmed to leave only reads of between 18 and 30 nucleotides, and the fasta files were collapsed using the FastX Toolkit. Reads matching to microRNA precursors downloaded from miRbase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</xref>) were removed using a custom Perl script, and the remaining reads were aligned to the Ce6 genome (WS190) using Bowtie, reporting the best match with no mismatches (parameters—best–k 1–v 0). After converting bam files to bed files as above, 22Gs mapping antisense to the Ce6/WS190 UCSC annotations of genes (sangerGene.txt) downloaded from the UCSC genome browser website, were then selected from the alignments using a custom Perl script. Genes with abundant 22G reads in N2 wild-type worms were further selected by setting a cut-off of at least five reads in at least one of the N2 wild-type samples and duplicate or overlapping annotations were removed. Comparison of mutants to N2 wild-type was carried out after normalizing to the total number of aligned reads in each library. Secondary structure analysis of the viral genome was performed using RNA-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCaskill, 1990</xref>) on a 50 bp window sliding by increments of 20 bp.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel) and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Senior editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Ashe and colleagues use an appealing mix of quantitative and molecular genetics to identify and characterize a natural polymorphism in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DRH-1 gene that affects production of viral-derived primary siRNAs. The gene emerged from an analysis of natural variation in sensitivity to the Orsay virus, and by a combination of GWAS, introgression mapping, and whole-genome sequencing, the authors managed to pin down a small deletion as a major-effect locus. Using mostly if not exclusively genetics, the authors provide evidence that DRH-1 is likely to specifically recruit the Dicer protein DCR-1 to viral dsRNA substrates. This clearly is a new finding, especially in an organism with a single Dicer. While we find the work very interesting, a minimal set of additional experiments would help support the inferences of the genetic analyses by answering the following questions: 1) Does viral infection affect the expression and subcellular location of DRH-1 protein, as assayed with a GFP fusion?</p><p>2) Is there evidence that EXO RNAi is enhanced in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants because absence of DRH-1-bound Dicer would increase Dicer pools? That DRH-1 is not involved in endosiRNA production is consistent with a specific role for SRH-3 in bringing Dicer onto endosiRNA substrates. If the answer to the initial question is yes, this could support the scenario for the possible benefit of the <italic>drh-1</italic> deletion in a significant fraction of the wild accessions because of enhanced environmental RNAi (which may confer unknown fitness advantages).</p><p>3) A critical experiment for supporting the proposed model would be whether the naturally found truncated form of DRH-1 indeed fails to interact with DCR-1 and RDE-4. We understand that antibodies are not available to test this. Thus, mechanistic inferences about DRH-1 action should be toned down in the revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00994.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does viral infection affect the expression and subcellular location of DRH-1 protein, as assayed with a GFP fusion</italic>?</p><p>With regard to changes in <italic>drh-1</italic> mRNA levels we have recently published a study analysing gene expression changes upon Orsay virus infection (Sarkies et al., Genome Research 2013). We observed no statistically significant changes in <italic>drh-1</italic> transcript levels upon infection in wild-type (N2) animals. Thus <italic>drh-1</italic> is unlikely to be transcriptionally regulated upon viral infection.</p><p>With regards to the subcellular localization of DRH-1 protein, we agree with the reviewers that the cell biology of viral infection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is of great interest, including changes in the subcellular localization of DRH-1 before and after viral infection. However, we do not agree that this analysis relates directly to the manuscript that we have submitted: any change or lack of change in subcellular localization would neither strengthen nor contradict our model. Furthermore, we believe that a thorough analysis of DRH-1 behaviour upon infection would have to include analysis of the subcellular dynamics of the Orsay virus in order to be meaningful. Since we do not fully understand this yet, a combined analysis should be the focus of an independent future study. Nevertheless, we have generated a transgenic line expressing a DRH-1-GFP fusion protein. We found that these transgenic animals localize GFP diffusely in the cytoplasm of intestinal and other cells (Author response image 1 below, transgene driven by a “ubiquitous” promoter, <italic>sur-5</italic>). We observed that the cytoplasmic localization of GFP does not change in response to infection with the Orsay virus. However, in the absence of a suitable antibody that works in immunofluorescence, we are unable to assess the localization of the endogenous protein, thus we cannot rule out that changes in DRH-1 subcellular localization occur upon infection. We should therefore be cautious about the interpretation of such a negative result and we would prefer not to include these data in the manuscript. We have therefore added a paragraph to the Discussion referencing the gene expression paper, and we have referred to the results of the DRH-1GFP fusion protein analysis as data not shown.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Assessing the subcellular localization of GFP in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutant animals carrying a <italic>sur-5::drh-1::gfp</italic> transgene as an extra-chromosomal array.</title><p>Infections were carried out as described in Materials and methods.

We therefore performed RNAi experiments using a dilution series of <italic>unc-22</italic> RNAi (see Materials and methods) and found that exo-RNAi is not enhanced in <italic>drh-1</italic> mutants, while it is enhanced in <italic>eri-1</italic> mutants. We conclude that there is no evidence that DCR-1 interaction with RDE-4 and DRH-1 limits its availability for exo-RNAi.

By analogy to RIG-I we suggest that DRH-1 (<italic>niDf250</italic>) fails to recognize the Orsay RNA. However, we agree with the reviewers: we have toned down our mechanistic inferences by suggesting that DRH-1 may be necessary for either recognition of viral RNA or correct Dicer processing “assisting DCR-1 processing of the double-stranded viral RNA.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
