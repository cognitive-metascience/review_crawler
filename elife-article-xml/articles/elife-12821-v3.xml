Yet, mutations in apoptosis regulators cause only minor defects in vertebrate development, suggesting that another developmental cell death mechanism exists. While some non-apoptotic programs have been molecularly characterized, none appear to control developmental cell culling. Linker-cell-type death (LCD) is a morphologically conserved non-apoptotic cell death process operating in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and vertebrate development, and is therefore a compelling candidate process complementing apoptosis. However, the details of LCD execution are not known. Here we delineate a molecular-genetic pathway governing LCD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Redundant activities of antagonistic Wnt signals, a temporal control pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase signaling control heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), a conserved stress-activated transcription factor. Rather than protecting cells, HSF-1 promotes their demise by activating components of the ubiquitin proteasome system, including the E2 ligase LET-70/UBE2D2 functioning with E3 components CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1. Our studies uncover design similarities between LCD and developmental apoptosis, and provide testable predictions for analyzing LCD in vertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12821.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12821.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12821.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryos make numerous new cells as they develop, but also destroy many cells to remove the faulty ones and to ensure that tissues grow to the right size and shape. This deliberate form of cell death must be precisely regulated to prevent too many cells or healthy cells, from being destroyed. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern cell death is therefore important for understanding normal development and also human disease.</p><p>One well-studied process that leads to cell death is called apoptosis. This process carefully dismantles and breaks down the components of a cell, but does not seem to account for all cell death that occurs during animal development. Recently another developmental cell-death pathway, called the linker-cell-type death, was discovered in a small roundworm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. This pathway appears to work in mammalian cells as well, and may help to break down nerve fibers that are not needed. However, many of this pathway’s component parts remained unknown.</p><p>Kinet, Malin et al. have now used a combination of genetics and cell biology in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to uncover the components of linker-cell-type death and to investigate how they interact. The results of these studies revealed a hierarchy of genetic interactions that governs this pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. One protein called HSF-1 plays a particularly important role. This protein is a transcription factor and it binds to, and regulates, the activities of various genes. HSF-1 usually works in cells to protect them from stress, but Kinet, Malin et al. showed that it instead promotes linker-cell-type death by activating a molecular machine, called the proteasome, that breaks down proteins. The experiments also revealed two proteins (called BTBD-2 and SIAH-1) that may be important for shuttling specific proteins for degradation by the proteasome.</p><p>Three signalling pathways that regulate important developmental processes also regulate the activation of linker-cell-type death. Kinet, Malin et al. propose that these signalling pathways do so by working together to activate HSF-1, which in turn activates the genes that lead to the destruction of cells by the proteasome.</p><p>A future challenge is to understand in more detail how the more recently discovered cell death pathway actually kills cells. Further work could also explore how HSF-1, a protein that normally protects cells, is transformed into a cell-killing protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12821.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12821.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>linker cell death</kwd><kwd>hsf-1</kwd><kwd>UPS</kwd><kwd>BTBD2</kwd><kwd>UBE2D2</kwd><kwd>let-70</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD078703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaham</surname><given-names>Shai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaham</surname><given-names>Shai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pathway controlling non-apoptotic developmental cell death engages non-canonical death-promoting activities of the stress factor HSF-1, which, in turn, activates specific components of the ubiquitin-mediated degradation machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal development and homeostasis are carefully tuned to balance cell proliferation and death. Cell death not only counters cell production, but also supports morphogenesis and tissue sculpting, and destroys cells that could be harmful, such as autoreactive cells in the immune system or genetically abnormal cells that may promote tumorigenesis. Developmental and homeostatic cell elimination are not passive processes but rather follow a highly coordinated, genetically encoded program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Green, 2011</xref>). A major goal has been to identify the molecular basis of the programs controlling regulated cell demise in development. One such program, apoptosis, has been studied extensively over the past four decades. Some proteins that promote apoptosis, such as BCL2 and FAS, are mutated in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rieux-Laucat et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsujimoto et al., 1985</xref>), indicating that apoptosis contributes to normal human physiology.</p><p>Nonetheless, caspase-dependent apoptosis does not account for many cell death events that take place during normal animal development. For example, in the moth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, salivary gland and body muscle remodeling is apparently caspase-independent and the ultrastructural morphology acquired by dying cells is non-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 1995</xref>). Similarly, mice homozygous for knockout alleles of key apoptotic genes, including caspase-3, caspase-9, Apaf-1, or Bax and Bak, can survive to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honarpour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuida et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lindsten et al., 2000</xref>), a surprising observation given the prevalence of cell death in murine development. Indeed, nearly half of spinal cord motor neurons generated during vertebrate development are normally deleted, and this process occurs unabated in the absence of caspase-3 or caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oppenheim et al., 2001</xref>). While caspase-independent non-apoptotic processes may play key roles in developmental cell death, little is known about their molecular underpinnings. To date, none of the non-apoptotic cell death pathways that have been described have a role in normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou and Yuan, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> linker cell provides direct evidence that caspase-independent non-apoptotic cell death pathways operate during animal development. This male-specific gonadal leader cell guides the elongation of the gonad and <italic>vas deferens</italic> during development, and then dies near the cloaca, presumably to facilitate fusion of the <italic>vas deferens</italic> with the cloacal sperm-exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimble and Hirsh, 1979</xref>). Linker cell death still occurs in the absence of the main apoptotic caspase, CED-3, and even in animals lacking all four <italic>C. elegans</italic> caspase-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denning et al., 2013</xref>). Other canonical apoptosis genes are also not required, nor are genes implicated in autophagy or necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with these genetic observations, the morphology of a dying linker cell, characterized by lack of chromatin condensation, a crenellated nucleus, and swelling of cytoplasmic organelles, differs from the morphology of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, cell death with similar features (linker cell-type death [LCD]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2012</xref>) has been documented in a number of developmental settings in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pilar and Landmesser, 1976</xref>) and is characteristic of neuronal degeneration in patients with and mouse models of polyglutamine disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A molecular understanding of LCD is necessary to determine the prevalence and importance of this process in development. Genetic studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> linker cell death have identified genes that promote this process, including <italic>pqn-41</italic>, which encodes a glutamine-rich protein of unknown function, and <italic>tir-1</italic>/TIR-domain and <italic>sek-1</italic>/MAPKK, which may function in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate homologs of TIR-1 promote distal axon degeneration following axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>), supporting a conserved role for this protein in cell and process culling. The <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA and its indirect target, the Zn-finger transcription factor LIN-29, also promote LCD, and may act early in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blum et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the molecular logic of LCD is not understood.</p><p>Here, we describe a molecular-genetic framework governing LCD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our studies represent the first such framework for a non-apoptotic cell death program regulating developmental physiology. We demonstrate that LCD is controlled by two Wnt signals, one pro-death and one pro-survival, that function in parallel, and partially redundantly with the LIN-29, and SEK-1/MAPKK pathways to control non-canonical activity of HSF-1, a conserved transcription factor that mediates heat-shock and other stress responses. Our functional, genetic, and molecular studies demonstrate that HSF-1 adopts a specific role, distinct from its well-described protective role in the heat-shock response, to promote LCD. We show that <italic>let-70</italic>, encoding a conserved E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is an important transcriptional target of this pro-death developmental activity of HSF-1, but not of the HSF-1 stress-response function. LET-70 expression, as well as expression of ubiquitin and some proteasome components, increases just before LCD onset, and this increase requires the Wnt, LIN-29, SEK-1/MAPKK pathways, and HSF-1. CUL-3/cullin, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1 E3-ubiquitin ligase components function in the same pathway as LET-70 and promote LCD.</p><p>Our studies reveal design similarities between LCD and apoptosis. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, cell lineage specifies the initiation of developmental apoptosis by transcriptional induction of the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thellmann et al., 2003</xref>), encoding a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, or the <italic>ced-3</italic> gene, encoding the key executioner caspase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurer et al., 2007</xref>). Pathways linking cell lineage specification to transcriptional initiation of apoptosis have been described for some cells and appear to consist of multiple coordinated inputs. Thus, in both LCD and apoptosis diverse signals control specific transcriptional inputs that, in turn, control protein degradation machinery.</p><p>The molecular conservation of all the elements comprising the LCD program, together with the characteristic cell death ultrastructure, suggest that this program may be broadly conserved and provide an opportunity for probing the process in other settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An EGL-20/Wnt pathway promotes linker cell death</title><p>To determine how LCD is initiated, we noted that mutations in the gene <italic>him-4</italic>, encoding the secreted protein hemicentin, prevent posterior migration of the linker cell, and result in low-level (~15%) linker cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, linker cell position might, in part, dictate cell death onset. We considered the possibility that secreted ligands of the Wnt pathway, which are expressed in restricted spatial domains in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, contribute to LCD. We examined animals carrying lesions in each of the five <italic>C. elegans</italic> Wnt genes and found that in <italic>egl-20</italic>/Wnt mutants, the linker cell survives inappropriately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), and surviving cells are not engulfed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, linker cell migration, a complex multi-step process dependent on many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>), is unaffected in <italic>egl-20</italic> single mutants. Likewise, expression of reporter genes, including <italic>lag-2</italic> promoter::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), appears unaffected. Thus, <italic>egl-20</italic> mutations do not generally perturb linker cell fate, suggesting that the gene has a specific role in LCD control.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12821.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An <italic>egl-20/</italic>Wnt pathway promotes Llnker cell death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Linker cell survival in indicated genotypes.

This raises the possibility that the role of HSF-1 in LCD may be different from its role in the canonical heat-shock response. To test this idea directly, we examined expression of GFP reporters for HSF-1 target genes normally induced during heat shock and found that they are not induced in the linker cell during LCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Supporting this conclusion, the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> gene is a target of HSF-1 in the heat-shock response, and LCD is restored to <italic>bar-1</italic> mutants by the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> promoter::ΔN-<italic>bar-1</italic> transgene following a heat shock. However, no rescue is evident without heat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> promoter is not normally induced during LCD. Similarly, while nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling does not control HSF-1 activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton and Lamitina, 2013</xref>), HSF-1 does form nuclear aggregates in all cells following stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton and Lamitina, 2013</xref>). While aggregates can be seen in dying linker cells in stressed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), no aggregates are evident in the dying linker cell, or the surrounding cells, of unstressed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), supporting a novel role for HSF-1 in LCD.</p><p>In addition to functional differences between the role of HSF-1 in the heat-shock response and LCD, we also found distinct genetic requirements. The HSF-1(R145A) protein contains a mutation in the putative HSF-1 DNA binding domain. Previous studies demonstrated that expression of this protein restores the heat-shock response to <italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>) mutants lacking the distal portion of the HSF-1 transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morton and Lamitina, 2013</xref>). Trans-complementation in the active HSF-1 trimer likely explains how these two loss-of-function lesions can, together, promote a normal heat-shock response. However, instead of rescuing the LCD defect of <italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>) mutants, we found that a single copy <italic>hsf-1</italic>(R145A) transgene enhanced inappropriate linker cell survival from 29% to 61% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results show that the role of HSF-1 in LCD is functionally and genetically distinct from its role in the heat-shock response. A prediction arising from these data is that the LCD and heat-shock functions of HSF-1 might compete with each other. To test this, we first observed that while the linker cell of wild-type males raised at 20°C always dies, some wild-type adult males raised at 25°C harbor a surviving linker cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that the heat-shock role of HSF-1 might compete with its LCD role. To test this more directly, we subjected males to a 37°C heat shock 4 hr prior to LCD onset and found that these animals also exhibit a surviving linker cell. Importantly, males heat-shocked 6 hr before LCD onset exhibit fewer surviving linker cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that heat-shock functionally sequesters HSF-1 away from its LCD role, and that activity of HSF-1 just before the cell dies is required to promote LCD. These results also explain why we were able to rescue <italic>bar-1</italic> mutants with the <italic>hsp-16.2</italic> promoter::ΔN-<italic>bar-1</italic> transgene, as heat shock was performed 10 hr before LCD onset, well before the activity of HSF-1 is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HSF-1 promotes death downstream of known LCD regulators</title><p>An examination of males carrying the <italic>hsf-1</italic>(R145A) transgene in an otherwise wild-type background revealed that LCD progressed to completion in all animals even at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result suggests that in a wild-type <italic>hsf-1</italic> background, <italic>hsf-1</italic>(R145A) functions as a gain-of-function allele, promoting LCD. One possibility for how this might occur is that the allele preferentially disrupts HSF-1 complexes promoting the heat-shock response, thereby promoting LCD. Regardless of the precise mode of action, our serendipitous discovery of the gain-of-function nature of the R145A protein allowed us to dissect the functional relationships between HSF-1 and the parallel pathways controlling LCD onset. Strikingly, we found that three independent <italic>hsf-1</italic>(R145A) single-copy transgene isolates restored LCD to <italic>egl-20</italic>/Wnt and <italic>bar-1</italic>/β-catenin mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The antagonistic Wnt pathways we describe may provide positional information to the linker cell, as the relevant ligands are expressed only near the region where the linker cell dies. The LIN-29 pathway, which controls timing decisions during the L4-adult molt, may ensure that LCD takes place only at the right time. Finally, while the TIR-1/SEK-1 pathway could act constitutively in the linker cell, it may also respond to specific cues from neighboring cells. Indeed, MAPK pathways are often induced by extracellular ligands. We propose that these three pathways, together, trigger activation of HSF-1. Our data support a model in which HSF-1 is present in two forms, HSF-1<sup>LC</sup>, promoting LCD, and HSF-1<sup>HS</sup>, protecting cells from stresses, including heat shock. We postulate that the redundant LCD initiation pathways tip the balance in favor of HSF-1<sup>LC</sup>, allowing this activity to bind to promoters and induce transcription of key LCD effectors, including LET-70/UBE2D2 and other components of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), functioning through E3 ligase complexes consisting of CUL-3, RBX-1, BTBD-2, and SIAH-1.</p><p>Importantly, the molecular identification of LCD components and their interactions opens the door to testing the impact of this cell death pathway on vertebrate development.

While <italic>C. elegans</italic> caspases are dispensible for LCD, it remains possible that they participate in linker cell dismantling or serve as a backup in case the LCD program fails.</p><p>Finally, the proteasome contains catalytic domains with target cleavage specificity reminiscent of caspases; however, inactivation of the caspase-like sites does not, alone, result in overt cellular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britton et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that this activity may be needed to degrade only specific substrates. Although the proteasome generally promotes proteolysis to short peptides, site-specific cleavage of proteins by the proteasome has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1999</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate, therefore, that caspases and the proteasome may have common, and specific, targets in apoptosis and LCD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A pro-death developmental function for HSF-1</title><p>Our discovery that <italic>C. elegans</italic> heat-shock factor, HSF-1, promotes cell death is surprising. Heat-shock factors are thought to be protective proteins, orchestrating the response to protein misfolding induced by a variety of stressors, including elevated temperature. Although a role for HSF1 has been proposed in promoting apoptosis of mouse spermatocytes following elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakai et al., 2000</xref>), it is not clear whether this function is physiological. In this context, HSF1 induces expression of the gene Tdag51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashida et al., 2006</xref>). Both pro- and anti-apoptotic activities have been attributed to Tdag51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Toyoshima et al., 2004</xref>), and which is activated in sperm is not clear. Recently, pathological roles for HSF1 in cancer have been detailed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendillo et al., 2012</xref>), but in these capacities HSF1 still supports cell survival.</p><p>Developmental functions for HSF1 have been suggested in which HSF1 appears to act through transcriptional targets different from those of the heat-shock response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jedlicka et al., 1997</xref>), although target identity remains obscure. Here, we have shown that HSF-1 has at least partially non-overlapping sets of stress-induced and developmental targets. Indeed, typical stress targets of HSF-1, such as the small heat-shock gene <italic>hsp-16.49</italic> as well as genes encoding larger chaperones, like <italic>hsp-1</italic>, are not expressed during LCD, whereas <italic>let-70</italic>, a direct transcriptional target for LCD, is not induced by heat shock. Interestingly, the yeast <italic>let-70</italic> homologs <italic>ubc4</italic> and <italic>ubc5</italic> are induced by heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seufert and Jentsch, 1990</xref>), supporting a conserved connection between HSF and UBE2D2-family proteins. However, the distinction between developmental and stress functions is clearly absent in this single-celled organism, raising the possibility that this separation of function may be a metazoan innovation.</p><p>What distinguishes the stress-related and developmental forms of HSF-1? One possibility is that whereas the stress response appears to be mediated by HSF-1 trimerization, HSF-1 monomers or dimers might promote LCD roles. Although this model would nicely account for the differential activities in stress responses and LCD of the HSF-1(R145A) transgenic protein, which would be predicted to favor inactivation of a larger proportion of higher order HSF-1 complexes, the identification of conserved tripartite HSEs in the <italic>let-70</italic> and <italic>rpn-3</italic> regulatory regions argues against this possibility. Alternatively, selective post-translational modification of HSF-1 could account for these differences. In mammals, HSF1 undergoes a variety of modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), which, depending on the site and modification, stimulate or repress HSF1 activity. In this context, it is of note that p38/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of HSF1 represses its stress-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 1996</xref>), and the LCD regulator SEK-1 encodes a MAPKK. However, no single MAPK has been identified that promotes LCD (E.S.B., M.J.K. unpublished results), suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play.</p><p>Our finding that POP-1/TCF does not play a significant role in LCD raises the possibility that Wnt signaling exerts direct control over HSF-1 through interactions with β-catenin. However, we have not been able to demonstrate physical interactions between these proteins to date (M.J.K, unpublished results).</p><p>Finally, a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>) demonstrated that in young adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>, around the time of LCD, global binding of HSF-1 to its stress-induced targets is reduced through changes in chromatin modification. Remarkably, we showed that chromatin regulators play a key role in <italic>let-70</italic> induction and LCD (J.A.M., M.J.K and S.S., manuscript in preparation), suggesting, perhaps, that differences in HSF-1 access to different loci may play a role in distinguishing its two functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>LCD and neurodegeneration</title><p>Previous studies from our lab raised the possibility that LCD may be related to degenerative processes that promote vertebrate neuronal death. Nuclear crenellation is evident in dying linker cells and in degenerating cells in polyQ disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2007</xref>) and the TIR-1/Sarm adapter protein promotes LCD in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as well as degeneration of distal axonal segments following axotomy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). The studies we present here, implicating the UPS and heat-shock factor in LCD, also support a connection with neurodegeneration. Indeed, protein aggregates found in cells of patients with polyQ diseases are heavily ubiquitylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalchman et al., 1996</xref>). Chaperones also colocalize with protein aggregates in brain slices from SCA patients, and HSF1 has been shown to alleviate polyQ aggregation and cellular demise in both polyQ-overexpressing flies and in neuronal precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neef et al., 2010</xref>). While the failure of proteostatic mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases is generally thought to be a secondary event in their pathogenesis, it is possible that this failure reflects the involvement of a LCD-like process, in which attempts to engage protective measures instead result in activation of a specific cell death program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>C. <italic>elegans</italic> strains were cultured using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>) and were grown at 20°C unless otherwise indicated.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;HSF-1 Activates the UPS to Promote Non-Apoptotic Developmental Cell Death in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Oliver Hobert as a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The importance of the description of mechanistic aspects of linker cell death was appreciated. However, there was a general sense that much more clarity and caution needs to be applied to the description of experiments, results and, most importantly, conclusions. These concerns can be addressed by some significant re-writing of a number of the conclusions. No further experiments are required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the implication of a number of interesting genes in this pathway was appreciated, there was a substantial concern about the interpretation of the genetic interaction data. Throughout the manuscript, in a number of cases, genetic interaction arguments were based on examining the enhancement of phenotypes based on the combination of non-null alleles (or RNAi). Observed enhancements, even if synergistic in nature, do not prove that genes act in the same pathway; they are equally consistent with genes acting in separate pathways. The interpretation of all these genetic interaction tests needs to be more correctly, and carefully, phrased.</p><p>2) The evidence that <italic>hsf-1</italic> controls <italic>let-70</italic> expression is very preliminary and this should be made explicitly clear and conclusions be toned down accordingly.</p><p>3) The authors try to describe a molecular-genetic framework governing the initiation and execution of LCD. The initiation and execution process should be more clearly defined and genes be more clearly categorized.</p><p>4) In the Introduction, the authors claimed that &quot;our studies reveal intriguing design similarities between LCD and apoptosis&quot; This is overstated. How similar are these two pathways? Depending on transcriptional factors and protein degradation? The <italic>hsf-1</italic>/transcriptional evidence is weak and the involvement of protein degradation relies on the implication of components of the proteasome pathway but those can play roles in protein-degradation independent processes. While it is interesting to speculate on difference, the conclusions need to be significantly toned down.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12821.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) While the implication of a number of interesting genes in this pathway was appreciated, there was a substantial concern about the interpretation of the genetic interaction data.

The following specific changes were made:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“as would be predicted if HSF-1 functions” changed to “as might be predicted if HSF-1 functions”.</p><p>“indicating that these genes likely function together to promote LCD” changed to “indicating that these genes likely function together, in sequence or in parallel, to promote LCD”.</p><p>“We conclude that SIAH-1, CUL-3, and RBX-1 likely function together to promote LCD and likely do so downstream of LET-70” changed to “We conclude that SIAH-1, CUL-3, and RBX-1 all function to promote LCD and likely do so downstream of LET-70”.</p><p>“consistent with the two genes acting in the same pathway” was removed.</p><p><italic>2) The evidence that hsf-1 controls let-70 expression is very preliminary and this should be made explicitly clear and conclusions be toned down accordingly.</italic> </p><p>Our data demonstrate that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) both <italic>hsf1</italic> and <italic>let-70</italic> are required for linker cell death, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) that <italic>let-70</italic>::GFP expression is induced upon cell death onset, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) that <italic>hsf-1</italic> is required for this transcriptional induction, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) that a conserved HSF-1 binding site is present upstream of <italic>let-70</italic> coding sequences, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) that deletion of these upstream sequences inhibits induction of <italic>let-70</italic>::GFP expression, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) that unlike all previously described LCD genes, <italic>let70</italic> lesions cannot be rescued by an hsf-1 gain of function allele. We therefore feel that the conclusion that <italic>HSF-1</italic> controls let-70 expression is reasonably well substantiated.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer comment in the sense that we have not demonstrated that HSF-1 directly binds regulatory sequences upstream of the <italic>let-70</italic> gene in vivo. However, this is a very tall order, as the experiment would require performing chromatin IP from single linker cells, which is currently a major technical challenge.</p><p>To avoid confusion about our claims, we have introduced the following changes:</p><p>Results section: “Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LET-70 functions downstream of a linker-cell-specific non-canonical function of HSF-1 to promote LCD” changed to “Taken together, our results suggest that LET-70 functions downstream of a linker-cell-‐specific non-canonical function of HSF-1 to promote LCD. Our data also suggest that other HSF-1 targets are likely relevant, and that let- 70 may be under the control of additional regulators.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors try to describe a molecular-genetic framework governing the initiation and execution of LCD. The initiation and execution process should be more clearly defined and genes be more clearly categorized.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, as we were indeed not consistent in our use of these terms, and, in addition, the figure legend for our model had an error in color assignment. We have now made several changes to the text, and have reserved use of the terms “initiation” and “execution” only as they refer to the upstream or downstream pathway components, respectively. The following specific changes have been made:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> legend: Pathway color designations changed to reflect the actual colors.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“Here we describe a molecular-genetic framework governing the initiation and execution of LCD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>” changed to “Here we describe a molecular-genetic framework governing LCD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”.</p><p>“We demonstrate that LCD initiation is controlled” changed to “We demonstrate that LCD is controlled”.</p><p>“increases just before LCD initiation” changed to “increases just before LCD onset”.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“dictate cell death initiation” changed to “dictate cell death onset”.</p><p>“in which organelle changes accompanying cell death initiation are evident” changed to “in which organelle changes accompanying cell death are evident”.</p><p>“the parallel pathways controlling LCD initiation” changed to “the parallel pathways controlling LCD onset”.</p><p>“<italic>let-70</italic> likely acts in the execution of LCD” changed to “<italic>let70</italic> likely acts in promoting LCD”.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“the molecular identification of a LCD execution machinery” changed to “the molecular identification of LCD components and their interactions”.</p><p>“may lead to a block in cell death execution” changed to “may lead to a block in cell death”.</p><p><italic>4) In the Introduction, the authors claimed that &quot;our studies reveal intriguing design similarities between LCD and apoptosis&quot; This is overstated. How similar are these two pathways? Depending on transcriptional factors and protein degradation? The hsf-1/transcriptional evidence is weak and the involvement of protein degradation relies on the implication of components of the proteasome pathway but those can play roles in protein-degradation independent processes. While it is interesting to speculate on difference, the conclusions need to be significantly toned down.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we may have been too exuberant about the similarities in our use of language. Nonetheless, the similarities we point out are apparent, and worth noting, in our opinion. We have made the following changes in the text to tone down the conclusions:</p><p>Introduction: “Our studies reveal intriguing design similarities” changed to “Our studies reveal design similarities”.</p><p>Discussion: “The logic of the LCD pathway is strikingly similar” changed to “The logic of the LCD pathway may be similar”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
