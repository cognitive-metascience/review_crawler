have supported a primordial biology. However, RNA catalysis is dependent upon RNA folding, and this yields structures that can block replication of such RNAs. To address this apparent paradox, we have re-examined the building blocks used for RNA replication. We report RNA-catalysed RNA synthesis on structured templates when using trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) as substrates, catalysed by a general and accurate triplet polymerase ribozyme that emerged from in vitro evolution as a mutualistic RNA heterodimer. The triplets cooperatively invaded and unraveled even highly stable RNA secondary structures, and support non-canonical primer-free and bidirectional modes of RNA synthesis and replication. Triplet substrates thus resolve a central incongruity of RNA replication, and here allow the ribozyme to synthesise its own catalytic subunit ‘+’ and ‘–’ strands in segments and assemble them into a new active ribozyme.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35255.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life as we know it relies on three types of molecules: DNA, which stores genetic information; proteins that carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life; and RNA, which relays information between the two. However, some scientists think that before life adopted DNA and proteins, it relied primarily on RNA.</p><p>Like DNA, strands of RNA contain genetic data. Yet, some RNA strands can also fold to form ribozymes, 3D structures that could have guided life’s chemical processes the way proteins do now. For early life to be built on RNA, though, this molecule must have had the ability to make copies of itself.</p><p>This duplication is a chemical reaction that could be driven by an ‘RNA replicase’ ribozyme. RNA strands are made of four different letters attached to each other in a specific order. When RNA is copied, one strand acts as a template, and a replicase ribozyme would accurately guide which letters are added to the strand under construction. However, no replicase ribozyme has been observed in existing life forms; this has led scientists to try to artificially create RNA replicase ribozymes that could copy themselves.</p><p>Until now, the best approaches have assumed that a replicase would add building blocks formed of a single letter one by one to grow a new strand. Yet, although ribozymes can be made to copy straight RNA templates this way, folded RNA templates – including the replicase ribozyme itself – impede copying. In this apparent paradox, a ribozyme needs to fold to copy RNA, but when folded, is itself copied poorly. Here, Attwater et al. wondered if choosing different building blocks might overcome this contradiction.</p><p>Biochemical techniques were used to engineer a ribozyme that copies RNA strands by adding letters not one-by-one, but three-by-three. Using three-letter ‘triplet’ building blocks, this new ribozyme can copy various folded RNA strands, including the active part of its own sequence.</p><p>This is because triplet building blocks have different, and sometimes unexpected, chemical properties compared to single-letter blocks. For example, these triplets work together to bind tightly to RNA strands and unravel structures that block RNA copying.</p><p>All life on Earth today uses a triplet RNA code to make proteins from DNA, and these experiments showed how RNA triplets might have helped RNA sustain early life forms. Further work is now needed to improve the ribozyme designed by Attwater et al. for efficient self-copying.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribozyme</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>origins of life</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105178804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holliger</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adopting RNA trinucleotides as substrates, ribozymes can catalyse the copying of structured RNA sequences, allowing self-synthesis by part of a newly evolved symbiotic ribozyme pair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The premise that some RNA sequences can catalyse and template their own replication - reciprocally synthesizing their own ‘+’ and ‘–’ strands - underpins current thinking about early genetic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crick, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orgel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Szostak et al., 2001</xref>). Any ancient ribozyme with such RNA replicase capability seems to be lost, but efforts are ongoing to recreate RNA self-replication in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martin et al., 2015</xref>) as a critical test of the ‘RNA world’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbert, 1986</xref>). Early on, derivatives of naturally occurring self-splicing introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doudna et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green and Szostak, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayden and Lehman, 2006</xref>) as well as later in vitro evolved ligase ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lincoln and Joyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014</xref>) were shown to be able to assemble one of their own strands from cognate constituent RNA segments. However, a critical drawback of such systems is their need for specific preformed building blocks of at least eight nucleotides (nt) average length, limiting their potential for open-ended evolution, and precluding their replication from pools of random-sequence oligonucleotide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green and Szostak, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doudna et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>In a contrasting approach, RNA polymerase ribozymes (RPRs) have been developed that can use general monomer building blocks (ribonucleoside 5’ triphosphates (NTPs)) in RNA-templated RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zaher and Unrau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwater et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>), akin to the activity of modern proteinaceous polymerases. However, even the most highly-evolved RPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>) are substantially impeded by template secondary structures. Such structures are ubiquitous in larger, functional RNAs (including the RPRs themselves) and generally indispensable for function. The strong inhibitory role of this central feature of RNA leads to an antagonism between the degree to which an RNA sequence is able to fold into a defined three-dimensional structure to encode function (such as catalysis) and the ease with which it can be replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boza et al., 2014</xref>). This ostensible ‘structure vs. replication’ paradox would have placed stringent probability constraints on the emergence of an RNA replicase and generally impeded the ability of RNA to function as an early genetic polymer.</p><p>We wondered whether this paradox might be avoided through a re-consideration of plausible building blocks for early RNA replication. Models of non-enzymatic polymerisation of all four activated ribonucleotides – the presumed source of the first RNA sequences – yield pools of di-, tri- and tetranucleotide etc. length oligonucleotides (in decreasing abundance) dominating the population alongside longer products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monnard et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we have examined whether substrates of such lengths can support RNA-catalyzed RNA replication, by developing a ribozyme capable of iterative templated ligation of 5’-triphosphorylated RNA trinucleotides (henceforth called triplets). This heterodimeric triplet polymerase ribozyme demonstrated a striking capacity to copy a wide range of RNA sequences, including highly structured, previously intractable RNA templates, as well as its own catalytic domain and encoding template in segments. Its characterization revealed emergent properties of triplet-based RNA synthesis, including cooperative invasion and unraveling of stable RNA structures by triplet substrates, bi-directional (both 5’−3’ and 3’−5’) and primer-free (triplet-initiated) RNA synthesis, and fidelity augmented by systemic properties of the random triplet pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro evolution of triplet polymerase activity</title><p>We set out to explore the potential of short RNA oligonucleotides as substrates for RNA-catalyzed RNA replication.

Previously-described RNA polymerase ribozymes such as the ‘Z’ RPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>) can use NTPs to iteratively extend a primer hybridized to an RNA template, but do not accommodate oligonucleotides bound downstream of the primer or accept them as substrates.

Centre, an example selection construct is shown comprising Zcore with a 3’ 30 nt random domain followed by a fixed hairpin-forming reverse transcription site (1). This construct is flexibly tethered at its 5’ in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tagami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwater et al., 2010</xref>) (via L repeats (3-8) of a flexible AACA linker) to a template region (grey) bound to 5’-dual biotin modified primer (tan). This construct requires successive polymerisation of two <sup>ppp</sup>UCG triplet substrates (red) in −7˚C ice followed by self-ligation to its triphosphorylated 5’ terminus to attach itself to the biotinylated primer (2). Active triplet polymerases are then identified and size-purified by denaturing PAGE to deplete unreacted ribozymes and primer (3), then captured on streptavidin beads and subjected to a denaturing wash to ensure covalent linkage to primer. Remaining dual-purified bead-linked ribozymes were then reverse transcribed (4). cDNAs were eluted with NaOH and neutralised, before acting as templates for ‘+’ strand DNA synthesis from 5’ biotinylated ‘rescue’ oligonucleotides that only prime correctly on the complete synthesised sequence (5), ensuring that constructs that deviated from the specified templated triplet polymerization fail to prime on cDNA preventing their ‘+’ strand synthesis. ‘+’ strands were then captured on fresh streptavidin beads, stripped of cDNAs, reamplified and diversified to generate selection construct for a new round of selection (6).

We devised a selection strategy that required iterative templated triplet ligation by ribozymes to achieve their covalent linkage to a tagged primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This enables their recovery, amplification and mutagenesis before further rounds of selection to enrich the selection pool in improved triplet polymerase ribozyme variants.</p><p>We initiated selections from a library of 1.5 × 10<sup>15</sup> Zcore variants with a new random 3’ N<sub>30</sub> region under eutectic phase conditions that increase RNA half-life and enhance ribozyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwater et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">;Attwater et al., 2013b</xref>). After 7 rounds of in-ice evolution, one-quarter of the selection pool comprised an improved ribozyme (type 0). Its core domain (0core, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) could catalyse the iterative polymerization of multiple triplets allowing us to begin to investigate the properties of triplet-based RNA replication.</p><p>Significantly, we found that 0core could catalyze triplet polymerisation on a series of structured templates, which had proven intractable to the parental Z RPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Here, primer extension exhibited a steep sigmoidal dependence upon triplet concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggestive of a cooperative invasion and unraveling of template secondary structures by the triplet substrates themselves. Although still inefficient, the fact that the nascent activity of the 0core ribozyme could already copy templates that had confounded an established RPR encouraged us to continue to seek improved triplet polymerase ribozymes to leverage this substrate behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Emergence of cooperativity and characterisation of a ribozyme heterodimer</title><p>We continued selections for a further 14 rounds.

In particular, some specific oligonucleotide substrates were required for efficient synthesis of α+ and ε+ segments to compete out inhibitory mutual hybridisation between ‘−’ strand template and corresponding ‘+’ strand unstructured elements in the t5 ribozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In vitro selections that stabilise the ribozyme tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) may contribute to attenuating this requirement.

Investigating the fidelity contributions of different t5<sup>+1</sup> ribozyme components, we found that the type 1 RNA cofactor did not contribute; rather, fidelity gains appeared to be mediated by the newly-evolved t5 ‘ε’ 3’-domain, as its deletion (yielding the truncated ‘αβγδ’ ribozyme) reverted the fidelity profile towards that of Zcore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Presence of the ε domain did not uniformly increase fidelity, but selectively reduced the most acute errors at the second and third triplet positions (with over 10-fold reductions for some errors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall error rates at the second and third triplet positions were reduced by 4-fold and 9-fold compared to Zcore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), though increased (1.3-fold) at the first triplet position due to a localised asymmetric tolerance of G:U wobble pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).

Modification at the third triplet position reverts ε’s divergent effects on fidelity at the adjacent second and the distal first triplet positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>); disruption of this minor groove contact site thus abolishes overall ε fidelity domain operation. ε sensitivity to minor groove composition may be critical to its recognition of cognate Watson-Crick base pairs, reminiscent of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> group I intron folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle and Doudna, 2002</xref>) and the decoding centre of the ribosome (which also tolerates wobble pairing at the analogous (5’) triplet position) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogle et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Systems-level properties of triplet pools</title><p>An important contribution to triplet fidelity also appears to arise from unexpected behaviours of the triplet substrates themselves.

Diverse patterns were observed in the concentration dependence of individual triplet positional errors, of which a selection are displayed here (×) coloured according to whether they raise (red-yellow) or lower (blue) the GC content of the expected triplet, and coloured more intensely for higher GC content triplets.

Unusually, this triplet polymerase ribozyme comprises a heterodimer of a catalytic triplet polymerase subunit (t5) and a non-catalytic RNA cofactor (type 1), which enhances triplet polymerase activity and abrogates the need for template tethering. Such a quaternary structure - involving a heterodimer of a full-length and a truncated subunit - is reminiscent of the processivity factors of some proteinaceous polymerases such as the heterodimeric p66/p51 HIV reverse transcriptase holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 1992</xref>). There are multiple examples of dimerization in RNA evolution - such as the VS ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Suslov et al., 2015</xref>), retroviral RNA genome dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paillart et al., 2004</xref>), in vitro evolved heterodimeric RNA liposome binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vlassov et al., 2001</xref>), and recently the homodimeric CORN fluorescent RNA aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warner et al., 2017</xref>). However, the spontaneous emergence of a general, mutualistic RNA cofactor has not previously been observed for ribozymes and may suggest an underappreciated dimension to the evolutionary dynamics of ribozyme pools under stringent adaptive pressures. Indeed, the extinction of previously dominant species in the selection that were unable to benefit from type 1 enhancement (e.g. type 0, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and succession with cooperative RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vaidya et al., 2012</xref>) illustrates the potential for such symbioses to shape RNA molecular ecologies.</p><p>The t5<sup>+1</sup> ribozyme’s principal current shortcoming is its low catalytic efficiency. In the optimal context for mononucleotide polymerase ribozymes, this triplet polymerase heterodimer yields ~4 fold more unligated junctions than the RPR tC19Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwater et al., 2013b</xref>), which itself is 240-fold slower than the currently most advanced RPR 24–3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>). Yet despite this modest catalytic power, t5<sup>+1</sup> displays much enhanced generality in RNA synthesis and now achieves both copying of previously intractable structured RNA templates, and templated synthesis and assembly of an active ‘+’ strand copy of its catalytic domain, suggesting key contributions of the triplet substrates themselves.</p><p>Indeed, one of the main findings of our work are the compelling advantages that triplet substrates appear to offer for sequence general RNA replication. For instance, when binding templates, triplets incur a lower entropic cost per position compared to canonical mononucleotides (thus aiding copying of sequences rich in weakly pairing A and U bases), with particularly helpful stability contributions from intra-triplet base stacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eigen, 1971</xref>). Furthermore, energetically favourable inter-triplet stacking interactions appear to instigate cooperative binding and unfolding of even highly stable RNA template structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>) upon reaching the required substrate concentration threshold. In our work, this process is aided by the cold temperature and solute concentration effects of eutectic ice phase formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwater et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mutschler et al., 2015</xref>). Counterintuitively, a general solution to the copying of structured RNAs arises not from conditions that disfavour base-pairing (which would also hinder substrate binding), but rather from conditions that promote it.</p><p>Together these favourable molecular traits serve to pre-organize the template towards a double-stranded RNA duplex with triplet junctions poised for ligation. A triplet/template duplex presents a more ordered, regular target for sequence-general ribozyme docking (by e.g. the ε domain) than a single stranded template (variably prone to secondary structure formation or sequence-specific interactions with the ribozyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>]). Such general duplex interactions also underlie other notable features observed in our triplet-based RNA synthesis such as in trans template binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) as well as the capacity for bidirectional (5’−3’/3’−5’) and primer-free RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to expectations RNA-catalyzed triplet polymerisation can proceed with a fidelity matching or exceeding even the best mononucleotide RNA polymerase ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwater et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horning and Joyce, 2016</xref>). t5<sup>+1</sup> ribozyme fidelity is due to both a readout of cognate minor groove interactions by the ribozyme ε domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and an unanticipated fidelity boost arising from systems-level properties of triplet pools, that appear to normalize the availability of free triplet (and potentially longer oligonucleotide) substrates against their base-pairing strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Though further work will be required to characterize triplet pool properties, they likely involve formation of cognate or near-cognate triplet:anti-triplet interaction networks, as formation of tRNA dimers via cognate anticodon:anticodon interactions has been observed in a similar concentration range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisinger and Gross, 1975</xref>).</p><p>While phylogenetically unrelated, mechanistic analogies between the triplet polymerase ribozyme and the ribosome are apparent. Both are RNA heterodimers that operate in a triplet register along a single-stranded RNA template, whilst enforcing a minor-groove mediated pattern of triplet or anticodon readout (including tolerance of 5’ wobble pairing), suggestive of convergent adaptive solutions to the challenges of replication and decoding. It has long been speculated that the decoding centre of the small ribosomal subunit might have had its origins in an ancestral RNA replicase, but the implied triplet-based character of such a replicase was conspicuously discordant with modern mononucleotide-based replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss and Cherry, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noller, 2012</xref>). The utility of triplets as substrates for RNA synthesis and self-synthesis described herein suggests that these early ideas deserve to be reconsidered. In the context of initial uncorrelated evolution of the small and large ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petrov et al., 2015</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that an early reliance upon triplets in RNA replication could have inadvertently supplied a decoding center for translation.</p><p>In conclusion, the unexpected emergent properties of triplets – including cooperative binding and unfolding of structured RNA templates, enhanced incorporation of AU-rich substrates, and error attenuation (resulting from triplet pool interaction networks) – argue that short RNA oligonucleotides may represent predisposed substrates for RNA-catalyzed RNA replication. Some of these benefits might also extend to codon/anticodon dynamics in early translation, and to the non-enzymatic replication of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szostak, 2012</xref>), where downstream trinucleotides have recently been shown to enhance incorporation of preceding activated mononucleotides both through stacking and positioning effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vogel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and the formation of a highly reactive intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prywes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Flaherty et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, the interaction of triplet substrate pools with RNA templates promotes uncoupling of an RNA’s sequence (i.e. information content, and associated folding tendencies) from its replicability, thereby enhancing RNA’s capacity to serve as an informational polymer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Templated RNA-catalysed RNA synthesis</title><p>Standard ribozyme activity assays (modified where specified) comprise 5 pmol of each ribozyme annealed in 2.5 μl water (80˚C 2 min, 17˚C 10 min), with 2 μl of 1 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 μl of 1 M tris•HCl pH 8.3 (at 25˚C, pH raised to 9.2 at −7˚C) then added on ice, and left for &gt;5 min to ensure folding.

Variations in upstream primer sequences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) allowed the partner template to be identified for each sequenced product; the triplet incorporated after the first CCC was counted. Separately, 10 μl extensions by t5<sup>+1</sup> of each primer/template alone with its encoded triplet and <sup>ppp</sup>CCC (and <sup>ppp</sup>UCC for the ACC pair) were combined for purification and sequencing as above, to allow isolation of the ribozyme-mediated errors resulting from inclusion of the other 62 (61 for ACC) triplets in the reaction (versus errors from sequencing, recombination etc.). The counts of cognate triplet (C) and each error triplet (E) in the positive control (p) reduced error counts in the experimental samples (x) to yield ribozyme-mediated error counts (E<sub>r</sub>) thusly: E<sub>r</sub> = E<sub>x</sub> - E<sub>p</sub>*(C<sub>x</sub>/C<sub>p</sub>) (not reducing E<sub>x</sub> below 0, and reallocating all reductions to C<sub>r</sub>; <sup>ppp</sup>CCC counts (and <sup>ppp</sup>UCC for the ACC template) remained uncorrected).</p><p>For each template, counts were then collated at the first/second/third positions to yield base-specific mutation rates for each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>).

In most cases, the 5’ overhang encoded (was the reverse complement of) the desired oligonucleotide. These oligonucleotides were short enough to synthesise during the abortive initiation stage of transcription, attenuating sequence constraints on the first bases of the transcript. However, T7 RNA polymerase exhibited tendencies to skip the first (or even second) base (most severe for U &gt; C &gt; A &gt; G before second position purines: encoding CGU yielded some <sup>ppp</sup>GU, encoding UAC yielded just <sup>ppp</sup>AC) or use oligonucleotides generated during transcription to re-initiate (e.g. encoding GAG yielded <sup>ppp</sup>GAGAG, encoding AAA yielded <sup>ppp</sup>A<sub>6-9</sub>, encoding UCC yielded <sup>ppp</sup>CCC, encoding CGC yielded some <sup>ppp</sup>GCGC; this tendency was most severe when the oligonucleotide could be accommodated opposite the final template bases of the promoter).</p><p>These tendencies could be subverted by encoding additional first bases (usually without providing the corresponding NTP). This initiated the oligonucleotide at the second position where skipping tendencies were lower (e.g. encoding CUAG without CTP yielded <sup>ppp</sup>UAG, encoding UUAC yielded some <sup>ppp</sup>UAC), and reduced recruitment as initiators of products with bases not complementary to the introduced first position template base (e.g. encoding CGAG without CTP yielded <sup>ppp</sup>GAG, encoding CAA without CTP yielded <sup>ppp</sup>AA and <sup>ppp</sup>AAA, encoding AUCC without ATP yielded <sup>ppp</sup>UCC, encoding UCGC without UTP yielded <sup>ppp</sup>CGC).</p><p>Each 30 μl transcription reaction contained 72 nmol of each desired product base as an NTP (Roche) (e.g. for <sup>ppp</sup>UCC, 72 nmol UTP, 144 nmol CTP) in 1 × MegaShortScript kit buffer with 1.5 μl MegaShortScript T7 enzyme (ThermoFisher). Also present were 15 pmol of each DNA oligonucleotide forming the transcription duplex target (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Nebojsa Janjic (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The most important thing to improve is the written clarity of the manuscript. There was a lot of agreement between the reviewers' comments so we attach their full reviews below for your attention. All their concerns should be attended to.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Attwater et al. report an advance in efforts to develop a robust self-replicating RNA by presenting an example of an RNA polymerase ribozyme (RPR) capable of transcribing RNA from structured RNA templates of substantial length with fairly good fidelity. This RPR uses a trinucleotide building block (in contrast to NTPs used by standard polymerases), that the authors speculate could have implications in the evolution of mRNA decoding by the ribosome.</p><p>The major findings from this work are as follows:</p><p>1) The authors exploit the ligase activity in the catalytic core of their previously reported RPR Z and evolve a suite of catalytic sequences capable of extending an RNA primer using RNA triplets as substrates. Through further iterations of in-vitro selection for triplet dependent RPRs, an RNA sequence emerged without any catalytic activity itself, but it enhanced triplet extension by these newly evolved RPR sequences (named t2 through t6) through a bimolecular interaction between the catalytically proficient sequence. Further rounds of selection using the cofactor t1 resulted in the most efficient triplet RPR, t5<sup>+1</sup> which was used for downstream studies. This RPR could use structured hairpins as templates, even those with Tm &gt;90oC that were intractable to previous RPRs that use NTPs as substrates. The authors demonstrate the efficiency of this RPR by transcribing both + and – strands of the Broccoli aptamer, a structured and fluorescent RNA.</p><p>2) The authors used t5<sup>+1</sup> RPR to replicate fragments of itself (both + and – strands), using triplet building blocks (and in some cases hexamers). The complete active RPR could be reconstituted from the five individual components of the RPR transcribed by the same RPR. Although this replicase ribozyme is still not able to replicate itself in its entirely, it does give rise to a functioning replicase by using building blocks as small as trimers, Previous efforts had primarily used the ligase activity of the RPRs to assemble oligonucleotides representing their sequence to assemble a 'replica' of itself. Considering the challenges of self-replication, even incremental advances in the right direction are significant.</p><p>Overall this work introduces a new RPR system that brings the field closer to a self-replicating system, which is one of the cornerstones of Origin of life research. The authors explore properties of this replicase including fidelity and catalytic efficiency and explain the molecular basis for these properties. This work also introduces trinucleotides as plausible substrates on which ancient RNA-based replicases could have acted. Considering the relative ease of non-enzymatic polymerization of monomers into triplets, the presence of these triplets in a prebiotic setting seems plausible. The current work is detailed and the authors have explored multiple facets of the new system they have setup. This new RPR presents a major advance in terms of its ability to create a fully functional copy of itself (albeit in fragments). As such, this would be a great addition to the current understanding of RNA-based self-replication systems.</p><p>1) Overall, the manuscript was very difficult to follow. It is up to the authors to make their presentation as simple and direct as possible. Given the availability of supporting information, there is no reason why the authors could not add schemes where appropriate to clarify their presentation, logic, and workflow.</p><p>2) Regarding the dimerization, it is not clear how the authors implicated the 5'-hairpin to begin with, leading to the experiment that showing that a single mutation in that loop inhibits dimerization.</p><p>3) The assertion that the two RNAs form a 1:1 complex is not quantitatively substantiated from Figure 3B.</p><p>4) Considering their success in replicating structured hairpins and achieving primer free synthesis of an 18 nt strand (β+), it would be interesting (though not necessary for publication) to see how much of the Broccoli RNA could be transcribed without the addition of a primer sequence. If this is not possible, the authors could demonstrate the complete replication of a functional RNA of tractable length, like the Hammerhead ribozyme, to illustrate the ability of their trinucleotide RPR to replicate entire sequences of functional RNAs by exclusively using triplets as substrates.</p><p>5) The fidelity analysis is based on testing 12 of the possible 64 trinucleotides, so one cannot be convinced of the generality of their observations and inferences. The authors need to underscore this in the discussion of fidelity. The authors show that increased concentrations of triplets help fidelity, however in the absence of the 'correct' triplet, it is likely that RPR will incorporate 'mismatch' triplets. The authors should comment on this aspect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) In this paper, the authors demonstrate interesting and novel results that provide further evidence for RNA's capacity to act as prebiotic genetic material. The key feature associated with this study involved using trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) rather than NTPs as substrates for a novel RNA polymerase ribozyme. The use of triplets allowed structured templates to be unfolded and in some cases avoided the need for primers, circumventing an ongoing obstacle to RNA self-replication. This study thus makes some significant steps towards identifying a truly self-replicating prebiotic biopolymer. Literature precedents are well-discussed, and the results are interpreted in a detailed and convincing manner. I would nonetheless encourage the authors to try to make these important results as accessible as possible to readers who are unfamiliar with in vitro evolution.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>2) Subsection “in vitro evolution of triplet polymerase activity”, last paragraph. The use of &quot;in-ice evolution&quot; (a technique developed by the authors) is reported. A sentence could be added describing why this technique is being used / why it is necessary.</p><p>3) For certain experiments (e.g. subsection “Fidelity of triplet-based RNA synthesis”), random triplet pools were used. What kind of triplet pools were used in other sequence-copying experiments? Were they non-random? This needs to be more clearly articulated.</p><p>4) &quot;… we found that using modified substrates with a disrupted minor groove hydrogen bond acceptor at the 3rd position…&quot; – What is the modification? This should be stated in the body-text.</p><p>5) What is the scope of substrates for the t5<sup>+1</sup> ribozyme? Triplets reportedly incur a lower entropic cost than NTPs (Discussion, third paragraph), but what would happen when a mixture of the two were used? Would both the NTPs and triplets be incorporated?</p><p>If these points are satisfactorily addressed, then I am in favour of acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Attwater et al. used an in vitro evolution method to enhance the trace amount of ligase activity with short (3-nucleotide) substrates inherent in the truncated version of the Z RPR ribozyme (called &quot;Zcore&quot;). This was achieved by adding a random region of 30 nucleotides at the 3' end of Zcore and a template at the 5' end, followed by selection for variants able to extend a primer hybridized to the 5' template with two 5'-triphosphate triplets and ultimately ligate the extended primer to the 5' terminal triphosphate. After 7 rounds of activity enrichment, the authors identified a sequence that represented 25% of the activity-enriched pool called &quot;type 0&quot; that, upon truncation to its minimal active sequence (&quot;0core&quot;), was able to catalyze multiple cycles of templated ligation with triplet substrates, including the ability to extend thought double-stranded regions of the template by cooperative invasion through the secondary structure of the template (this was not achievable with monomer substrates, NTPs).</p><p>After additional 14 rounds selection, the composition of the pool showed considerable changes: type 0 sequence had disappeared and was replaced by six new types of sequences, types 1-7. Remarkably, the most prevalent type 1 sequence (50% of the pool) was completely inactive and types 2-6 were less active than the activity enriched pool. This mystery was solved by the observation that a truncated version of the type 1 sequence, while being inactive, can form augment the activity of type 2-6 ribozymes by forming heterodimeric complexes. In the presence of type 1 sequence, the best stand-alone ribozyme, type 5, no longer required the template to be tethered to the 5' end of the type 5 ribosome, in a remarkable example of an intermolecular complex between the dimeric type 1:type5 ribozyme, the untethered primer template, and the triplet substrates. Further optimization of the type 5 ribozyme by re-randomization of the previously fixed 3' end sequences and reselection in the presence of minimal type 1 sequence (called &quot;1&quot;) resulted in the final heterodimeric holoenzyme called &quot;t5<sup>+1</sup>. t5<sup>+1</sup> was able to catalyze the extension through templates with Tm values of 93 ⁰C, and was capable of generating both the functionally active Broccoli RNA aptamer and its complementary template. Finally, t5<sup>+1</sup> was able to replicate its own t5 sequence split into five segments, mostly from triplets, with some help from longer substrates (hexamers) needed for two of the segments, thus falling short of having the capacity for a full replication cycle, but nonetheless, exhibiting impressive catalytic efficiency.</p><p>The surprising observation that t5<sup>+1</sup> can extend primers in both the canonical 5'-3' as well as the reverse 3'-5' direction raises the potential for primer extension from short sequences in a primer-free manner, therefore potentially solving the &quot;primer problem&quot; (depletion of longer but presumably sparse primers needed for replication in prebiotic conditions). Impressive overall positional fidelity of more than 97% was achieved by counter-selection for mispairing triplets with a clever inclusion of excess 3'-deoxy terminator triplets during late rounds of selection. Attwater et al. mapped the region responsible for fidelity to the 3' domain of t5. Further reduction in mis-incorporation comes from cognate triplet-triplet interactions have a self-correcting feature of countering the effect of triplets with strong base-pairing tendency.</p><p>The authors make a strong case that triplets represent relatively short and yet powerful substrates able to invade highly stable structural features in RNA templates. The evolution of a heterodimeric ribozyme capable of generating functional RNAs with triplet substrates represents a major accomplishment that advances the plausibility of RNA-catalyzed RNA replication in prebiotic environment. Despite its considerable length, as well as its remarkable breadth and scope, the manuscript reads like a riveting novel. It is a tour de force scientific accomplishment, and as such, it will be of considerable interested to a wide audience of readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is up to the authors to make their presentation as simple and direct as possible. Given the availability of supporting information, there is no reason why the authors could not add schemes where appropriate to clarify their presentation, logic, and workflow.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor presentation and have made several changes to enhance clarity. These include textual changes to reduce ambiguity and lay out our reasoning more thoroughly as well as explanatory schemes of ribozyme activity in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Furthermore, we have redesigned Figures 3 and 7, and now provide an additional dataset presenting substrate concentration-dependent error rates in a more straightforward manner in Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The manuscript structure is complicated by the multiple stages of RNA evolution and characterization involved in the project, and to help navigate the progress of our ribozyme development, we now provide the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 detailing all the stages of evolution and engineering of the different triplet polymerase ribozymes to provide a “roadmap”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding the dimerization, it is not clear how the authors implicated the 5'-hairpin to begin with, leading to the experiment that showing that a single mutation in that loop inhibits dimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome the opportunity to clarify this. We had originally noticed the ‘cap-’ mutation in the most abundant isolated type 1 clones, and when testing this in different constructs observed that it quenched type 1 enhancement pointing towards the 5’ hairpin region as the critical interaction site. We now refer to this in the manuscript text.</p><p>Our knowledge about this dimerization interface is currently limited and we have therefore generally refrained from speculation. However, it seems possible that the ‘cap-’ mutation was enriched in these type 1 sequences to diminish homodimerisation of type 1 that may interfere with heterodimerisation with active triplet polymerase in the selection pool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The assertion that the two RNAs form a 1:1 complex is not quantitatively substantiated from Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include quantitative data on the stoichiometry of the complex as observed by gel shift (EMSA) titration in Figure 3B, and activity tests in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. These support a 1:1 stoichiometric complex in the active ribozyme as expected from the final selection pool composition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Considering their success in replicating structured hairpins and achieving primer free synthesis of an 18 nt strand (β+), it would be interesting (though not necessary for publication) to see how much of the Broccoli RNA could be transcribed without the addition of a primer sequence. If this is not possible, the authors could demonstrate the complete replication of a functional RNA of tractable length, like the Hammerhead ribozyme, to illustrate the ability of their trinucleotide RPR to replicate entire sequences of functional RNAs by exclusively using triplets as substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer highlights an important challenge that such ribozymes must ultimately face – copying without primers both strands of functional RNAs to achieve their complete replication using only short oligonucleotide substrates. With the current triplet polymerase ribozyme, while primer-initiated synthesis is almost general (as we show by synthesizing both + and – strands of the Broccoli RNA aptamer), we cannot currently achieve primer-free synthesis of all sequences. The latter includes Broccoli where yields of full-length RNA are poor using triplets alone. This may reflect inefficient initiation of synthesis or poor upstream inclusion of some 5’ terminal triplets.</p><p>Nevertheless, the current triplet polymerase ribozyme can achieve this for some functional sequences, most relevantly from t5 itself. To demonstrate this, we have now included data on the primer-free synthesis and replication of the Υ segment. Specifically, we describe primer-free synthesis using triplets alone of the γ+ strand segment with sufficient yield to use this ribozyme-synthesized RNA as the template for primer-free γ- strand synthesis, demonstrating complete primer-free sequence replication using only triplets. These new data are now included as Figure 7C, replacing the (now in our view redundant) primer-free γ+ syntheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fidelity analysis is based on testing 12 of the possible 64 trinucleotides, so one cannot be convinced of the generality of their observations and inferences. The authors need to underscore this in the discussion of fidelity. The authors show that increased concentrations of triplets help fidelity, however in the absence of the 'correct' triplet, it is likely that RPR will incorporate 'mismatch' triplets. The authors should comment on this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured fidelity of triplet incorporation with all64 triplet substrates present but in the context of 12 defined template triplet sequences flanked by conserved CCC incorporation sites. These were chosen to be compositionally balanced, including both GC-rich and AU-rich template triplets, to provide fair estimates of ribozyme fidelity, as well as an effective tool to compare the fidelities of different ribozymes.</p><p>This assay was designed to allow us to separate incorporation fidelity (i.e. discrimination among 64 triplets for decoding a defined anti-triplet) from each ribozyme’s extension capabilities by providing a uniform, tractable sequence context.</p><p>The important qualification regarding this assay, we feel, is therefore that while it provides an accurate representation of fidelity in a defined sequence context (triplet-triplet junction), it may not provide a comprehensive picture of triplet polymerase fidelity performance in all sequence contexts. We now provide this caveat in the text.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) In this paper, the authors demonstrate interesting and novel results that provide further evidence for RNA's capacity to act as prebiotic genetic material. The key feature associated with this study involved using trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) rather than NTPs as substrates for a novel RNA polymerase ribozyme. The use of triplets allowed structured templates to be unfolded and in some cases avoided the need for primers, circumventing an ongoing obstacle to RNA self-replication. This study thus makes some significant steps towards identifying a truly self-replicating prebiotic biopolymer. Literature precedents are well-discussed, and the results are interpreted in a detailed and convincing manner. I would nonetheless encourage the authors to try to make these important results as accessible as possible to readers who are unfamiliar with</italic> in vitro <italic>evolution.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, we have made a significant number of changes to the manuscript in order to present our results more clearly.</p><p>These include textual changes to improve clarity and remove ambiguities. We have also made an effort to lay out our experimental progress and reasoning more thoroughly, using explanatory schemes of ribozyme activity in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1, redesigning Figures 3 and 7, and providing an additional more straightforward dataset in Figure 9—figure supplement 1. We hope this will make the manuscript easier to read and more accessible to the general reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>2) Subsection “in vitro evolution of triplet polymerase activity”, last paragraph. The use of &quot;in-ice evolution&quot; (a technique developed by the authors) is reported. A sentence could be added describing why this technique is being used / why it is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our description of the mechanisms of in vitro evolution and discuss in more detail the reasoning behind our use of eutectic ice phases and in-ice evolution. As the properties of ice as a medium for RNA-catalyzed RNA synthesis, replication and evolution are discussed at length in the cited references, a fairly brief discussion must suffice. We hope nevertheless that this will now clearly illustrate our rationale in using this technique in our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For certain experiments (e.g. subsection “Fidelity of triplet-based RNA synthesis”), random triplet pools were used. What kind of triplet pools were used in other sequence-copying experiments? Were they non-random? This needs to be more clearly articulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We generally list the triplet substrates used for different experiments but apologise for any ambiguity.</p><p>In general for preparative syntheses we have avoided using pools of random triplets, providing instead a set of defined triplets as specified by the template sequence to minimise substrate consumption. We have however verified that random triplet pools can be used for key triplet based RNA synthesis experiments including hairpin invasion (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and ribozyme segment synthesis (see Figure 6—figure supplements 4 and 5), as well as in experiments on ribozyme fidelity (see e.g. Figure 8). We now explicitly state the substrate composition in the text and figure legends for all experiments described.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;… we found that using modified substrates with a disrupted minor groove hydrogen bond acceptor at the 3rd position…&quot; – What is the modification? This should be stated in the body-text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission and have amended this. We now state in the text that uracil was replaced by 2-thio uracil in the triplets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What is the scope of substrates for the t5<sup>+1</sup> ribozyme? Triplets reportedly incur a lower entropic cost than NTPs (Discussion, third paragraph), but what would happen when a mixture of the two were used? Would both the NTPs and triplets be incorporated?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion considering that abiotically-generated substrate pools would likely include a mixture of different length substrates including mono- and dinucleotides. We have performed additional experiments to explore this and now include data on their incorporation during segment synthesis in Figure 6—figure supplement 5.</p><p>In summary, t5<sup>+1</sup> does incorporate both dinucleotide triphosphates and NTPs, but with reduced efficiency. Furthermore, they appear to serve as poor substrates for segment synthesis with triplets incorporated much more efficiently. Increasing amounts of NTP and dinucleotide substrates vs. triplets (up to a total 4:2:1 ratio) do lead to diversification of extension products outside the initial triplet register, but do not notably affect the total amount of ligation performed.</p><p>As seen in Figure 6—figure supplement 2, more length-heterogenous substrate pools (including longer oligomers) may offer both advantages and disadvantages, but we feel that a more systematic investigation of diverse substrate pools and their effect on yield and fidelity of RNA-catalyzed RNA replication goes beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
