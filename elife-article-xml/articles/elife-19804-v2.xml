the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Derived primarily from the liver, it inhibits the iron exporter ferroportin in the gut and spleen, the sites of iron absorption and recycling respectively. Recently, we demonstrated that ferroportin is also found in cardiomyocytes, and that its cardiac-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload. Hepcidin is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, where its function remains unknown. To define the function of cardiomyocyte hepcidin, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of hepcidin, or knock-in of hepcidin-resistant ferroportin. We find that while both models maintain normal systemic iron homeostasis, they nonetheless develop fatal contractile and metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency. These findings are the first demonstration of a cell-autonomous role for hepcidin in iron homeostasis. They raise the possibility that such function may also be important in other tissues that express both hepcidin and ferroportin, such as the kidney and the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19804.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19804.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19804.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins inside cells require iron to work properly, and so this mineral is an essential part of the diets of most mammals. However, because too much iron in the body is also bad for health, mammals possess several proteins whose role is to maintain the balance of iron. Two proteins in particular, called hepcidin and ferroportin, are thought to be important in this process. Some ferroportin is found in the cells that line the gut (where iron is absorbed into the body) and is required to release this iron into the bloodstream. It is also found in the spleen, which is where iron is removed from old red blood cells so that it can be recycled. The liver produces hepcidin to control when ferroportin is active in the gut and spleen.</p><p>Both hepcidin and ferroportin are also found in heart cells. In 2015, a study reported that that heart ferroportin plays an important role in heart activity. However, it was not clear what role hepcidin plays in this organ.</p><p>Now, Lakhal-Littleton et al. – including many of the researchers from the previous work – have genetically engineered mice such that they specifically lacked heart hepcidin, or had a version of ferroportin in their heart that does not respond to hepcidin. The experiments show that these changes caused fatal heart failure in the mice because ferroportin releases iron from heart cells in an uncontrolled manner. Lakhal-Littleton et al. were able to prevent heart failure by injecting the animals with iron directly into the bloodstream. These findings show that hepcidin produced outside the liver has a role in controlling the levels of iron in the body’s organs.</p><p>Other organs such as the brain, kidney and placenta all have their own forms of hepcidin and ferroportin; further work could investigate the roles of these proteins. Finally, another challenge for the future will be to test whether new drugs that are being developed to block or mimic hepcidin from the liver have the potential to treat heart conditions in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19804.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19804.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>hepcidin</kwd><kwd>ferroportin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/12/63/29895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lakhal-Littleton</surname><given-names>Samira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090532/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lakhal-Littleton</surname><given-names>Samira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006484</institution-id><institution>Vifor Pharma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R19874-CN004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolna</surname><given-names>Magda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders funded the salary and research expenses relating to this work for two of the authors, as described above.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The novel role of hepcidin in cell-autonomous iron regulation changes our understanding of tissue-specific iron control, and of its interplay with systemic iron homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As a constituent of hemoproteins, iron-sulphur proteins and other functional groups, iron is essential for cellular functions. Conversely, excess iron participates in cytotoxic Fenton-type chemical reactions. Thus, both iron deficiency and iron overload are detrimental to the cell. Therefore, the healthy functioning of tissues requires tight control of intracellular iron levels. These in turn are dependent both on cellular homeostatic pathways controlling iron uptake, usage, and storage, and on systemic pathways controlling iron levels in the plasma. In mammals, cellular iron homeostasis is controlled by the Iron Regulatory Proteins IRPs. Intracellular iron levels control the degradation of IRP2 and the conformational switch that confers the RNA-binding function of IRP1. IRPs in turn control the levels of iron uptake proteins such as transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter (DMT1), and the iron storage protein ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rouault and Klausner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rouault, 2006</xref>). Systemic iron homeostasis is controlled by the hepcidin/ferroportin axis at the sites of iron entry into the circulation. Ferroportin (FPN), which is encoded by the Solute Carrier Family 40 Member 1 (<italic>Slc40a1</italic>), is the only known mammalian iron export protein and mediates iron release into the circulation from duodenal enterocytes, splenic reticuloendothelial macrophages and hepatocytes, the sites of iron absorption, recycling and storage respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donovan et al., 2005</xref>). FPN-mediated iron release is antagonized by the hormone hepcidin, also known as hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP). Produced primarily in the liver, hepcidin binds to and induces internalization of FPN, thereby limiting iron release into the circulation and its availability to peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiao et al., 2012</xref>). The importance of the HAMP/FPN axis is illustrated by diseases of systemic iron overload such as hemochromatosis and β-thalassaemia, where hepcidin production is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camaschella, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Musallam et al., 2012</xref>), and in anaemia of chronic disease where hepcidin production is inappropriately elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Falco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nemeth and Ganz, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Other than the liver, hepcidin is also found in tissues with no recognized role in systemic iron homeostasis, including the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merle et al., 2007</xref>), the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarthy and Kosman, 2014</xref>), the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulaksiz, 2005</xref>) and the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2011</xref>). The function of this extra-hepatic hepcidin remains unknown, but one hypothesis is that it is involved in local iron control. Relevant to this hypothesis are our recent findings that FPN is also present in the heart, that it is essential for cardiomyocyte iron homeostasis and that its cardiomyocyte-specific deletion leads to fatal cardiac iron overload in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that cardiac HAMP regulates cardiac FPN, and that such regulation is important for local iron control and for cardiac function.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we generated two novel mouse models; the first with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the <italic>Hamp</italic> gene, and the second, with cardiomyocyte-specific knock-in of <italic>Slc40a1 C326Y</italic>, that encodes a FPN with intact iron export function but impaired HAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schimanski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drakesmith et al., 2005</xref>). We studied cardiac function and iron homeostasis longitudinally in both models and report that both develop fatal cardiac dysfunction and metabolic derangement as a consequence of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency. This occurs against a background of otherwise normal systemic iron homeostasis. Both cardiac dysfunction and metabolic derangement are prevented by intravenous iron supplementation.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that, at least in the cardiomyocyte, endogenously-derived HAMP plays an essential role in cellular, rather than systemic iron homeostasis. It does this through the autocrine regulation of cardiomyocyte FPN. Disruption of this cardiac HAMP/FPN leads to fatal cardiac dysfunction.</p><p>Currently, there is considerable clinical interest in strategies that target the HAMP/FPN axis for the treatment of systemic iron overload and iron deficiency. Our findings suggest that these strategies may additionally alter cardiac iron homeostasis and function. Other than the heart, both HAMP and FPN are also found in the brain, kidney and placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarthy and Kosman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulaksiz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rouault, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moos and Rosengren Nielsen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolff et al., 2011</xref>). A pertinent question is the extent to which our findings in the heart extend to those tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hamp expression and regulation in the heart</title><p>Hamp mRNA levels were approximately 30 fold lower in the adult mouse heart than in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Under control conditions, Hamp mRNA was upregulated following addition of fresh cardiomyocyte culture medium (cardiomyocytes are cultured for 2 hr in serum-free medium prior to this). Relative to control cardiomyocytes at the respective timepoint, Hamp mRNA was increased by FAC from 4 hr of treatment, and decreased by DFO at 4, 8 and 16 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). HAMP protein, measured by ELISA in supernatants was also increased following addition of fresh medium. Relative to control cardiomyocytes at the respective timepoint, HAMP protein in supernatants was increased by DFO as early as 2 hr, but remained unchanged by FAC at all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, the direction of response of the Hamp mRNA and HAMP protein to iron levels in vitro mirrored the responses seen in vivo.</p><p>Next, we aimed to understand the mechanisms underlying increased HAMP secretion in DFO-treated cardiomyocytes. To this end, we investigated the role of the prohormone convertase Furin, which in hepatocytes, is required for cleavage of the propeptide and the release of the mature HAMP peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valore and Ganz, 2008</xref>). Furin expression has been reported in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaubien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichiki et al., 2013</xref>), and we also found that its expression was upregulated in the hearts of mice provided an iron-deficient diet and in cardiomyocytes treated with DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we measured HAMP in supernatants of cardiomyocytes treated with the Furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (CMK), we found no increase in HAMP release following DFO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We confirmed that Hamp mRNA levels in cardiomyocytes were not altered by CMK treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Furin upregulation mediates increased HAMP secretion from iron-deficient cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Having established that hepcidin is found in cardiomyocytes, we then aimed to define its function. To this end, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Hamp</italic> knockout mice <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> by crossing in-house conditional <italic>Hamp</italic> floxed (fl) mice with mice transgenic for Cre recombinase under the control of cardiomyocyte-specific promoter Myosin Heavy Chain 6 (<italic>Myh6.Cre+</italic>). Hamp mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and HAMP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in the hearts of <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice were significantly reduced compared to the hearts of <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls. Furthermore, compared to <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> cardiomyocytes, levels of HAMP protein in the supernatants of cardiomyocytes from <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice were either greatly reduced or undetectable, both under baseline conditions and following treatment with DFO or FAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Near complete ablation of the cardiac Hamp mRNA and HAMP protein in <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice confirmed that cardiomyocytes were the primary site of hepcidin expression in the heart. Liver Hamp mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and HAMP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) were not different between <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> and <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls, consistent with the cardiac-specific nature of <italic>Hamp</italic> gene deletion.</p><p>Also consistent with this cardiac-specific deletion, <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice had normal levels of liver iron stores and circulating markers of iron homeostasis when compared to <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls, demonstrating that loss of cardiac hepcidin did not affect systemic iron homeostasis.

Iron is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sono et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solomon et al., 2003</xref>), and metabolic derangement is a well-recognized precursor to cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kakinuma et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashrafian et al., 2007</xref>). Iron deficiency has been reported to reduce the levels and/or activities of key metabolic iron-containing enzymes, in cell lines, in the hearts of mice with impaired cardiac iron uptake (cardiac-specific <italic>TfR1</italic> knockouts) and in the hearts of mice fed an iron-deficient diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dallman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhur et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oexle et al., 1999</xref>). Based on those studies, we postulated that iron deficiency in the cardiomyocytes of <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice would also result in reduction in the activities of key metabolic iron-containing enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the activities of the iron-sulphur containing enzyme Aconitase I as well as electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in cardiac lysates from <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> hearts at 3 months and 6 months of age. We found that Aconitase I, Complex I and Complex IV activities were significantly reduced in <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> hearts compared to <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls at 3 months and 6 months of age, and that this reduction in activity was prevented in iron-treated 6-month old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). As ETC activity is essential to mitochondrial function, we examined whether <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> hearts had signs of mitochondrial failure, and whether such mitochondrial failure was prevented by intravenous iron supplementation. By electron microscopy (EM), dilation of mitochondrial cristae was seen in <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> hearts as early as 3 months of age and progressed further at 6 months of age. However, this was prevented in iron-treated <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice, which had healthy-looking mitochondria at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Similar changes in mitochondrial morphology were seen in the hearts of 3 month old <italic>Slc40a1 C326Y<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice (data not shown).</p><p>Impairment of electron transport is known to drive glycolysis, as an alternative route of ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schönekess et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kato et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we examined the expression of a number of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. We found that expression of genes encoding Hexokinase 2 (<italic>Hk2</italic>) which catalyses the first step of glycolysis, Enolase (<italic>Eno</italic>), which catalyses the penultimate step of glycolysis and of Lactate dehydrogenase A (<italic>Ldha)</italic> which catalyses the ultimate step of glycolysis were all significantly increased at 3 months and 6 months of age in hearts of untreated <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice. This upregulation of glycolytic genes was not seen in iron-treated <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–L</xref>). These results demonstrate that reduction in the activities of key iron-containing metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial failure and upregulated glycolysis precede the development of cardiac dysfunction in <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> hearts, and are prevented by intravenous iron treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major finding of this study is that cardiomyocyte hepcidin is required for autonomous cellular iron homeostasis. Loss of hepcidin responsiveness specifically in cardiomyocytes engendered the same effects as loss of cardiac hepcidin, demonstrating that cardiac hepcidin operates in an autocrine fashion by regulating cardiomyocyte FPN. A role in cellular iron homeostasis, and an autocrine mode of action for the HAMP/FPN axis have not been described previously in any other tissue. Indeed, hepcidin and FPN are better known to interact in an endocrine fashion, at the level of the gut, spleen and liver, to regulate systemic iron homeostasis.</p><p>A second important finding is that this cardiac HAMP/FPN axis is essential for normal heart function, and that its disruption leads to ultimately fatal cardiac metabolic and contractile dysfunction, even against a background of intact systemic iron homeostasis. Metabolic and contractile dysfunction are preceded by cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and prevented by intravenous iron supplementation, indicating a causal relationship between cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and cardiac dysfunction. This causal relationship has previously been demonstrated in studies using mice lacking cardiac TfR1, in which cardiac iron deficiency also affects the heart against a background of otherwise intact systemic iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of metabolic derangement seen in our mouse models is also consistent with the findings in mice lacking the cardiacTfR1, and in mice and rats fed iron deficient diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhur et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walter et al., 2002</xref>). Correction of metabolic and contractile dysfunction by intravenous iron treatment likely involves not only increased iron availability for uptake into cardiomyocytes, but also the effects of increased circulating HAMP on cardiomyocyte FPN.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that, both in vitro and in vivo, cardiac HAMP protein responded differently from its transcript to changes in iron levels. The current understanding of hepcidin regulation is based on studies of hepatic hepcidin. In that setting, release of the active mature HAMP peptide is dependent on cleavage of the propeptide by Furin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valore and Ganz, 2008</xref>). We found that Furin inhibition increased iron export from <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> but not from <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), demonstrating that cardiomyocytes secrete an active HAMP peptide in a Furin-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that increased HAMP release from iron-deficient cardiomyocytes depended on Furin, and that cardiac Furin itself is upregulated by iron deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The latter finding is consistent with the reported regulation of Furin by iron deficiency through Hypoxia-Inducible Factors HIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silvestri et al., 2008</xref>). These data suggest that differential regulation of Furin by iron may explain the divergent effects of iron on Hamp transcript and HAMP protein. Comprehensive studies using cardiac-specific knockouts of putative regulators will be required to explore formally the regulation or otherwise, of cardiac hepcidin by pathways known to regulate hepatic hepcidin.</p><p>The upregulation of cardiac HAMP in mice fed an iron-deficient diet raises the possibility that it may be involved in protecting the heart in the setting of systemic iron deficiency. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that, when provided an iron-deficient diet, <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Myh6.Cre+</italic> mice exhibited a greater cardiac hypertrophic response than their <italic>Hamp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular iron levels are dependent both on cellular homeostatic pathways and on systemic iron availability in plasma. Therefore, the interplay between the cardiac and the systemic HAMP/FPN axes is important in determining cardiomyocyte iron levels. Some insight into this interplay is gained from comparing systemic and cardiac mouse models of disrupted iron homeostasis. It is interesting that ubiquitous <italic>Hamp</italic> knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</xref>) and ubiquitous <italic>Slc40a1 C326Y</italic> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), both models of systemic iron overload, do not develop the cardiac dysfunction seen in cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Hamp</italic> knockout and cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Slc40a1 C326Y</italic> knock-in mice. This suggests that, while upregulation of cardiomyocyte FPN under conditions of normal iron availability (cardiac-specific models described in this study) is detrimental to cardiac function, it is protective under conditions of increased systemic iron availability (systemic models). Previously, we also showed that deletion of cardiomyocyte FPN resulted in fatal cardiomyocyte iron overload, preventable by dietary iron restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2015</xref>). Together, our studies demonstrate that iron levels within cardiomyocytes are a balance between cellular iron efflux which is regulated by the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis, and systemic iron availability which is regulated by the systemic HAMP/FPN axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19804.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interplay between systemic and cardiac iron HAMP/FPN axes.</title><p>Cardiomyocyte iron content is determined by both systemic iron availability, which is regulated by liver HAMP, and by the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis, which regulates cardiomyocyte iron efflux. In the wild type heart, cardiac HAMP regulates the levels of cardiac FPN and iron release from cardiomyocytes. In this study, we have demonstrated that loss of cardiac HAMP (cardiac Hamp KO) or loss of cardiac HAMP responsiveness (cardiac Slc40a1 C326Y KI) result in cardiomyocyte iron deficiency due to increased cardiomyocyte FPN and iron release. Previously, we also demonstrated that loss of cardiomyocyte FPN caused cardiomyocyte iron overload. In these two sets of conditions, cardiomyocyte iron deficiency and cardiomyocyte iron overload cause cardiac dysfunction. We have also shown that upregulation of cardiac FPN occurs as a result of loss of either systemic HAMP or systemic HAMP responsiveness, and is protective against the otherwise detrimental effects of systemic iron overload.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19804.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19804.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-19804-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>Iron overload is detrimental to cardiac health, as demonstrated by iron overload cardiomyopathy in hemochromatosis and thalassemia major patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulati et al., 2014</xref>). Our model of cardiac iron homeostasis implies that the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis may have a modifying effect on the severity of iron-overload cardiomyopathy. Thus, it would be interesting to explore whether differences in the levels of cardiac FPN and HAMP, possibly due to different local stimulatory and suppressive signals (e.g local inflammation, local ischemia), explain the reported lack of concordance between the degrees of cardiac iron overload and liver iron overload in a significant proportion of hemochromatosis and thalassemia major patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noetzli et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Iron deficiency is also detrimental to cardiac health. Indeed, systemic iron deficiency correlates with functional and molecular markers of disease severity in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klip et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comín-Colet et al., 2013</xref>),and also appears to contribute to the risk of death after an episode of acute heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jankowska et al., 2014</xref>). Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, ranging between 30–50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klip et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nanas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ezekowitz et al., 2003</xref>), the European Society of Cardiology recently recommended the assessment of iron deficiency as a comorbidity in CHF. Furthermore, several clinical trials have now established the benefits of intravenous iron supplementation in CHF patients, with or without anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ponikowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avni et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the anaemia-independent effects of iron deficiency and the benefits of intravenous iron in CHF patients are not fully understood. In light of the direct effect of cardiomyocyte iron deficiency on heart function, demonstrated in this and other studies, it would interesting to explore whether systemic iron deficiency in CHF patients is accompanied by cardiomyocyte iron deficiency, and whether correction of the later underlies the benefits of intravenous iron supplementation in non-anaemic patients.</p><p>Another open question is whether disruption of the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis contributes to the pathophysiology of heart disease. It has been shown, in the rat model of myocardial infarction (MI), that Hamp mRNA and HAMP protein are elevated in the ischemic myocardium during the acute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simonis et al., 2010</xref>). In humans, circulating HAMP was shown to be elevated in the serum within 4 hr of MI, although the tissue source of this hepcidin was not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, decreased cardiac HAMP expression has been reported in a transgenic mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy, where the phenotype was ameliorated following transgenic overexpression of cardiac hepcidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, further studies are warranted in humans to explore formally the role of the cardiac HAMP/FPN axis in the aetiology of heart disease.</p><p>Currently, there is considerable interest in targeting the HAMP/FPN axis for the treatment of iron overload and iron deficiency. Our studies suggest that such strategies may also impinge on cardiac iron homeostasis and function. Other than the heart, both FPN and hepcidin are also found in the brain, kidney and placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarthy and Kosman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulaksiz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rouault, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moos and Rosengren Nielsen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolff et al., 2011</xref>).

<italic>Slc40a1</italic> C326Y<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice</bold></title><p>A C57BL/6J mouse genomic BAC clone (RP23-183-P22) encompassing the <italic>Slc40a1</italic> gene was used for the generation of the targeting vector. A 12 kb region of the RP23-183-P22 encompassing exons 6–8 and surrounding intronic regions was subcloned by gap-repair into a plasmid containing a diphtheria toxin A chain negative selection cassette. The required C326Y point mutation was introduced into this subclone by site directed mutagenesis. In parallel, a loxP flanked neomycin/kanamycin selection cassette (from PL452 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2003</xref>) was inserted into the BAC within <italic>Slc40a1</italic> intron six by recombineering and an approximately 5 kb ApaI/PmeI fragment encompassing this insertion together with exons 6 and 7 and flanking introns was subcloned into pBluescript. This plasmid was treated with Cre recombinase (NEB) in vitro to remove the selection cassette, resulting in a plasmid containing a single loxP and an additional SpeI site within <italic>Slc40a1</italic> intron 6. This loxP interrupted sequence was shuttled into the genomic subclone by exchanging an internal NcoI fragment. A portion of <italic>Slc40a1</italic> cDNA corresponding to the coding region encoded on exons 7 and 8, including the 3’ untranslated region was amplified by RT-PCR from cDNA prepared from embryonic mouse heart and inserted into a piece of synthetic DNA (Gene Art) corresponding to intronic and intergenic sequence lying immediately upstream of exon seven and downstream of exon 8, respectively. This minigene assembly was cloned upstream of an FRT-PGK-Neomycin-FRT-loxP selection cassette (from P451 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2003</xref>) and the two pieces together were inserted into the modified genomic subclone above via a unique SacII site, completing the final targeting vector. The completed targeting vector was linearised with AatII and electroporated into C57BL/6N JM8F6 embryonic stem cells. Following selection in 210 μg/ml G418, recombinant clones were screened by PCR to detect homologous recombination over the 3’ arm. A forward primer (5’- CAATAGCAGGCATGCTGGGGATG-3’) binding within the polyadenylation of the selection cassette was used together with a reverse primer (5’- GGCATCTGCTGTCTGTGAAA- 3’) binding downstream of the 3’ homology arm to amplify a 6.6 kb fragment from correctly recombined clones. Positive clones were examined for correct recombination at the 5’ end by long range PCR using a forward primer (5’- TGTACCATGGATGGGTCCTT-3’) binding upstream of the 5’ homology arm and a reverse primer (5’- TACCGGTGGATGTGGAATGTG- 3’) binding within the PGK promoter driving the neomycin selection. Correctly targeted clones yielded a 9.7 kb amplicon. Incorporation of the 5’ loxP site, was verified by digestion of this 5’ amplicon with SpeI which yielded a 7 kb and 2.7 kb cleavage products in correctly targeted clones. Both 5’ and 3’ screening amplicons were analysed by Sanger sequencing to confirm the junction sequence over the extremities of the homology arms using sequencing primers 5’-AAAGCCCAGGGGTATCTCTC-3’ and 5’- CTCAGCTTGGCTATGTGGTG-3’ for the 5’ and 3’ amplicons respectively. The presence of the 5’ loxP site within the 5’ amplicon was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using sequencing primer 5’- CATGAAGCAGTGGGCATAGA-3’ and the presence of the C326Y mutation was confirmed within the 3’ amplicon using sequencing primer 5’-CACACACACACATATATACATGCAA-3’. Southern blotting using a probe against neomycin was used to confirm that only a single integration event had occurred. Correctly recombined ES cells were injected into albino C57BL/6J blastocysts and the resulting chimeras were mated with albino C57BL/6J females. Successful germline transmission yielded black pups and F1 mice harboring the conditional C326Y knock-in allele were identified using the above screening PCR. F1 heterozygous male mice were bred with C57BL/6J Flp recombinase deleter mice (Tg(ACTB-Flpe)9205Dym (Jax stock 005703)) and offspring were screened for the deletion of the selection cassette using a forward primer (5’-GATATCATCATCGCCCTTTGG- 3’) binding within the 3’ untranslated region of the exon 7–8 minigene and a reverse primer (5’- TTGCATGTATATATGTGTGTGTGTG-3’) binding immediately downstream of the cassette. A 1.4 kb amplicon was obtained from the Flp deleted conditional C326Y knock-in allele. Heterozygous mice without the selection cassette were then backcrossed with C57BL/6J to remove the Flp transgene prior to onward breeding.</p></sec><sec id="s25" sec-type="appendix"><title>Aconitase and ETC activities</title><sec id="s26"><title><bold>Total aconitase I activity assay</bold></title><p>Total aconitase I activity was measured as the rate of isomerization of cis-aconitic to isocitrate at 240 nm and 37°C using a spectrophotometer.

To prepare ubiquinol, 10 mg of decylubiquinone (Sigma) was dissolved in 312.5 µl absolute ethanol to give a final concentration of 100 mmol/L. An aliquot of 100 µl decylubiquinone working solution was further diluted in 900 µl ethanol and acidified to pH 2 with a 6 mol/L HCl solution.

To prepare the reduced cytochrome c<sup>2+</sup>, a dialysis tubing (Viking 7000/1) of appropriate length was hydrated for 30 min in 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O supplemented with 20 g sodium carbonate and 0.372 g EDTA at 80°C. A solution of 100 mg of cytochrome c from bovine heart and 10 mg sodium ascorbate dissolved in 10 ml potassium phosphate (0.1 mol/L, pH 7.0) was added to the tubing and dialysed against 1 L of 0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer for 24 hr at 4°C. The phosphate buffer was exchanged three times, every 8 hr. The redox state of the synthesized reduced cytochrome c was verified by measuring the absorbance spectra between wavelengths of 500 and 600 nm, in the presence or absence of 100 µmol/L potassium ferricyanide (Sigma) and compared against the oxidized cytochrome c. The reaction was carried out in 1 ml assay buffer (10 mmol/L potassium phosphate pH 7.0 and 0.50 µmol/L reduced cytochrome c) supplemented with 5 µl protein lysate and read for 3 min at 550 nm against a blank of assay buffer supplemented by 100 µmol/L potassium ferricyanide.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found the manuscript to have merit and potentially to make an important contribution to understanding iron homeostasis at the tissue level. For the first time, the authors tested the conjecture that tissue hepcidin production may contribute to local tissue-level iron regulation.</p><p>However, a number of important issues were raised by the reviewers including the need to be stricter in the methodology used and its description. In particular, the reviewers were seeking further evidence that the data on hepcidin expression and regulation were robust and that bioactive hepcidin was being detected, with hepcidin KOs as controls. Reviewers were reluctant to accept immunohistochemical staining as quantification of bioactive secreted hepcidin. Furthermore, iron efflux experiments need to be described in more detail. Tissue heterogeneity including the possible presence of macrophages may be an issue to resolve. Any further evidence that can be provided on the regulation of hepcidin would strengthen the paper.</p><p>I have summarised the major issues below:</p><p>1) Subsection “Hamp expression and regulation in the heart”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The semiquantitation of hepcidin by immunohistochemical methods has serious liabilities because hepcidin is a secreted protein and because antibodies can detect functional and nonfunctional hepcidin peptide, including precursor and degraded forms. The conversion of propeptide to active peptide is a step that could be regulated by iron and this may not be detected by the method used. The Methods section indicates that it was a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody from Abcam, but it does not say which antibody from Abcam was used. Several listed on Abcam's website were prepared against human peptides but have anti-mouse reactivity; one was prepared against mouse antigen and recognizes both Hamp1 and Hamp2 in mice. Are the authors certain that the antibody is recognizing the hepcidin-25 peptide encoded by Hamp1, and not something else? If they are detecting either pro-hepcidin or Hamp2 the conclusions of the paper might be very different. Also, because hepcidin functions as an extracellular peptide, it is difficult to draw conclusions from intracellular antibody staining. Specifically: a) It is not clear which hepcidin forms are stained and where they are located. Does the antibody detect intracellular peptide which is mostly propeptide? Fluorescent confocal microscopy could help with localization. b) No evidence is provided that cardiac myocytes can generate the functional 25 amino acid hepcidin. The processing of peptide hormones to bioactive forms requires prohormone convertases which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.</p><p>2) Subsection “Hamp expression and regulation in the heart”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: The detection of hepcidin secreted by cardiomyocytes in culture needs to be validated better because the concentrations are very low, and because the post-mRNA effect of DFO and FAC on hepcidin secretion is unprecedented. This experiment is crucial for understanding the function of local control by hepcidin-ferroportin. It is therefore necessary to be as careful as possible here. Controls should include hepcidin KO cardiomyocytes. At these low peptide concentrations, adsorption of peptide to plastic surfaces causes major losses and these could be affected by DFO and FAC treatment. Neither is it clear which forms of hepcidin are released into the media. Finally, primary hepatocytes within less than 24h in culture lose their ability to physiologically regulate hepcidin in response to iron, and this can result in delayed paradoxical suppression of hepcidin mRNA by FAC. If this happens with cardiomyocytes it could lead to artefacts. The regulation of hepcidin mRNA by FAC and DFO should therefore be checked as a function of time in culture.</p><p>3) To confirm the equivalence of Hamp KO and ferroportin C326Y the survival curves need to be compared. This is a hard endpoint that has produced a surprise previously (e.g. the marked difference in survival between global hepcidin KO and global ferroportin C326S). If data exists on the survival of Ferroportin C326Y transgenic mice, it should be presented.</p><p>4) It would be relatively straightforward for the authors to examine the regulation of cardiac Hamp using hemojuvelin floxed (Hfe2 fl/fl) mice (Chen W et al., Blood 2011) or other approaches, as regulation of hepatic Hamp expression is well understood. Hfe2 is expressed at high levels in the heart and might be relevant there as it is in the liver. The paper would be much stronger if there was some indication of the mechanism of hepcidin regulation in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>5) The authors refer to other animal models of cardiac iron deficiency, but they don't really distinguish between those caused by dietary iron deprivation, which would have the confounding existence of iron deficiency anemia, and a heart-specific Tfrc knockout model in which iron deficiency is restricted to the heart (Xu W et al., Cell Reports 2015, ref 31). The heart-specific Tfrc knockout was shown to have many characteristics that are similar to those described in this paper. One important difference, however, was in the levels of electron transport chain complexes found in untreated and iron treated control and cardiac Hamp-/- mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Xu et al. reported decreases in the bands representing iron-containing ETC complexes using the same OXPHOS blotting approach, as would be expected in iron deficient cells. Those representative proteins are labile when the complexes do not form properly. How do the authors explain their unexpected results, particularly considering the decreased complex activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</p><p>6) Several experiments were carried out using isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. How did the authors insure that the cell populations were not contaminated with other cell types, particularly macrophages, which might confound the results?</p><p>7) The iron efflux experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> appear to be novel because there is no reference provided. Is this correct? For that reason it would be very helpful to know more about them, to assess their validity. Apparently, cells were loaded with non-transferrin bound 55Fe by a 30 minute incubation. How much iron was taken up under these conditions? Why was non-transferrin bound iron used instead of Fe-Tf, particularly considering the results described in Xu et al., 2015 indicating that the transferrin cycle is very important for cardiomyocyte iron uptake? What measures were undertaken to ensure that the PBS washes effectively removed non-assimilated radiolabeled iron? How many times were the experiments repeated, and how variable were the results?

The conversion of propeptide to active peptide is a step that could be regulated by iron and this may not be detected by the method used. The Methods section indicates that it was a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse antibody from Abcam, but it does not say which antibody from Abcam was used. Several listed on Abcam's website were prepared against human peptides but have anti-mouse reactivity; one was prepared against mouse antigen and recognizes both Hamp1 and Hamp2 in mice. Are the authors certain that the antibody is recognizing the hepcidin-25 peptide encoded by Hamp1, and not something else? If they are detecting either pro-hepcidin or Hamp2 the conclusions of the paper might be very different. Also, because hepcidin functions as an extracellular peptide, it is difficult to draw conclusions from intracellular antibody staining. Specifically: a) It is not clear which hepcidin forms are stained and where they are located. Does the antibody detect intracellular peptide which is mostly propeptide? Fluorescent confocal microscopy could help with localization. b) No evidence is provided that cardiac myocytes can generate the functional 25 amino acid hepcidin. The processing of peptide hormones to bioactive forms requires prohormone convertases which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.</italic> </p><p>Hepcidin is synthetized as an 84 amino acid prepropeptide, containing an N-terminal ER targeting signal sequence (aa 1-24), a proregion (pro) with a consensus Furin cleavage site (aa 25-59) and a C-terminal bioactive iron-regulatory mature peptide (aa 60-84). The antibody used for immunohistochemical detection of hepcidin in the heart is ab30760 from Abcam, which was raised against the human mature peptide (aa60-84). We now include this information in the Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers’ concerns over the specificity of this antibody are ones that we also had, and consequently we did carry out appropriate control experiments. We now include the results of those control experiments in the revised manuscript. First, we showed that staining with this antibody is absent in the heart of cardiac-specific hamp-1 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), despite Hamp-2 expression being unaltered in these hearts compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). These data demonstrate that this antibody detects HAMP1 and not HAMP2. Second, we showed that staining in the heart of wild-type animals is completely abrogated by the use of the mature peptide (hepcidin-25, Abcam ab 31875) as a blocking peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In hepatocytes, it has been shown that the propeptide can also be secreted, and that this propeptide is detectable by antibodies raised against the mature peptide (Rouault and Klausner, 1997). Thus, in theory our antibody detects not only the mature secreted peptide but also the propeptide, and even demonstration of extracellular staining by immunohistochemistry would not constitute formal evidence for the presence of the active mature peptide. We do, however, provide direct evidence for the secretion of an active hepcidin by cardiomyocytes. First, in our in vitro experiments, where we detect hepcidin by ELISA in supernatants of primary cardiomyocytes from control animals (original data). We reproduced this finding in a second independent experiment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and further show that hepcidin is greatly reduced or undetectable in supernatants of cardiomyocytes from cardiac Hamp-1 knockout animals. We now include these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Second, we also provide evidence that the secreted peptide is active, and this is discussed below.</p><p>The reviewer is right to point out that the release of the bioactive hepcidin mature peptide requires prohormone convertases, which may or may not be present in the heart. Furin is the prohormone convertase required for release of hepatic bioactive mature hepcidin peptide. In hepatocytes, it has been shown that Furin inhibition leads to decreased release of the active mature peptide and increased release of the larger inactive propetide, and that both of these protein species are detected by assays targeting the mature peptide (Rouault and Klausner, 1997). Furin is also highly expressed in the heart (Beaubien et al., 1995), raising the intriguing possibility that it may be involved in the production of the bioactive hepcidin mature peptide from cardiomyocytes. To test this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments using the Furin inhibitor Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone trifluoroacetate salt(CMK). These experiments showed that while Furin inhibition under iron replete conditions did not decrease secreted HAMP levels (consistent with the release of the propeptide as reported in hepatocytes) (Valore and Ganz, 2008), it nonetheless increased iron export from primary cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the effect of Furin inhibitor on iron export was only seen in Hamp fl/fl and not in Hamp fl/fl Myh6.Cre+ cardiomyocytes. We include these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Appendix 1—Figure 1</xref>. Together, these results provide evidence that cardiomyocytes release an active form of hepcidin in a Furin-dependent manner.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that increased HAMP release from DFO-treated cardiomyocytes depended on Furin. These data are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. We also found that Furin itself was upregulated by iron deficiency in vitro and in vivo. We include these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. These findings are consistent with the previously reported regulation of Furin by iron deficiency through Hypoxia-inducible factors HIFs (Silvestri, Pagani and Camaschella, 2008). They suggest that differential regulation of Furin by iron may explain the divergent effects of iron on Hamp transcript and HAMP protein.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “Hamp expression and regulation in the heart”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: The detection of hepcidin secreted by cardiomyocytes in culture needs to be validated better because the concentrations are very low, and because the post-mRNA effect of DFO and FAC on hepcidin secretion is unprecedented. This experiment is crucial for understanding the function of local control by hepcidin-ferroportin. It is therefore necessary to be as careful as possible here. Controls should include hepcidin KO cardiomyocytes. At these low peptide concentrations, adsorption of peptide to plastic surfaces causes major losses and these could be affected by DFO and FAC treatment. Neither is it clear which forms of hepcidin are released into the media. Finally, primary hepatocytes within less than 24h in culture lose their ability to physiologically regulate hepcidin in response to iron, and this can result in delayed paradoxical suppression of hepcidin mRNA by FAC. If this happens with cardiomyocytes it could lead to artefacts. The regulation of hepcidin mRNA by FAC and DFO should therefore be checked as a function of time in culture.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed additional experiments with primary cardiomyocytes from cardiac hamp1-ko cells, and found that levels of HAMP proteins were greatly reduced or undetectable in their supernatants. We include this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. Furthermore, the concentrations detected in the supernatants are well within the detection range (4.94-400pg/mL) of the ELISA kit used (Uscn Life Science Inc. #E91979Mu). The reviewer was also concerned that in vitro treatments (DFO and FAC) may affected detection of the hepcidin peptide by this ELISA assay. To guard against the possibility of differential absorption resulting from the presence of DFO or FAC, we compared the standard curves obtained by dilution of the peptide standard in a) standard diluent provided in the kit, b) unconditioned cardiomyocyte growth medium, c) unconditioned cardiomyocyte growth medium with 100uM DFO, and d) unconditioned cardiomyocyte growth medium with 500uM FAC. We found no significant differences between the 4 standard curves. We include these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>. This demonstrates that the presence of DFO or FAC does not affect the detection of the hepcidin peptide by this ELISA kit.</p><p>The reviewer was concerned that physiological control of hepcidin was lost in cardiomyocytes due to the length of culture. First, both in the original and in the additional experiments performed herein, cardiomyocytes were used within 2 hours of harvest. Additionally, as suggested by the reviewer, we carried out a timecourse of treatment with FAC and DFO, and now present these data in the manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for Hamp transcript and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for HAMP in supernatants). Overall, the direction of change in response to DFO and FAC, both for hepcidin transcript and protein are maintained over the 24 hour period and are consistent with the single-timepoint data presented in the original manuscript prior to revision.</p><p><italic>3) To confirm the equivalence of Hamp KO and ferroportin C326Y the survival curves need to be compared. This is a hard endpoint that has produced a surprise previously (e.g. the marked difference in survival between global hepcidin KO and global ferroportin C326S). If data exists on the survival of Ferroportin C326Y transgenic mice, it should be presented.</italic> </p><p>We now provide those data as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. As for Hamp fl/fl;Myh6.Cre+ mice, Slc40a1 fl/fl;Myh6.Cre+ animals also have greater mortality compared to their littermate controls with mean survival of 32 weeks.</p><p><italic>4) It would be relatively straightforward for the authors to examine the regulation of cardiac Hamp using hemojuvelin floxed (Hfe2 fl/fl) mice (Chen W et al., Blood 2011) or other approaches, as regulation of hepatic Hamp expression is well understood. Hfe2 is expressed at high levels in the heart and might be relevant there as it is in the liver. The paper would be much stronger if there was some indication of the mechanism of hepcidin regulation in cardiomyocytes.</italic> </p><p>HJV is one of many putative regulators of cardiac hepcidin. As it happens, muscle-specific HJV KO mice have increased rather than decreased cardiac hepcidin expression (Kostas Pantopoulos, personal communication). Thus, it appears that both with respect to HJV and to iron, cardiac hepcidin is regulated differently from liver hepcidin. Substantive additional studies are required to explore the role of known regulators of hepatic hepcidin in the regulation of cardiac hepcidin. We consider such studies beyond the scope of this revision as the work would constitute an independent manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors refer to other animal models of cardiac iron deficiency, but they don't really distinguish between those caused by dietary iron deprivation, which would have the confounding existence of iron deficiency anemia, and a heart-specific Tfrc knockout model in which iron deficiency is restricted to the heart (Xu W et al., Cell Reports 2015, ref 31). The heart-specific Tfrc knockout was shown to have many characteristics that are similar to those described in this paper. One important difference, however, was in the levels of electron transport chain complexes found in untreated and iron treated control and cardiac Hamp-/- mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Xu et al. reported decreases in the bands representing iron-containing ETC complexes using the same OXPHOS blotting approach, as would be expected in iron deficient cells. Those representative proteins are labile when the complexes do not form properly. How do the authors explain their unexpected results, particularly considering the decreased complex activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</italic> </p><p>With regards to the description of animal models of cardiac iron deficiency, we have now amended the text to distinguish between the various models, as suggested by the reviewer. With regards to the levels of ETC complexes detected by OXPHOS, we too were initially surprised that we did not detect a reduction as was seen in cardiac TfR knockout mice (Xu et al., 2015).However, this becomes less surprising when you consider the relative severity of cardiac iron deficiency, which is reflected in the fact that cardiac-specific TfR KO are embryonic lethal whereas cardiac-specific hepcidin knockouts have a mean survival of 28 weeks. In this context, it is important to consider the mechanisms through which iron deficiency impinges on the ETC. These mechanisms include not only limiting iron availability for complex assembly and for enzymatic activity of assembled complexes, but also reducing the levels of mitochondrially-encoded proteins. Indeed, the degree of iron deficiency (and iron excess) have been shown to correlate with damage to mitochondrial DNA (Walter et al., 2002), and many of the proteins in ETC complexes are encoded by mitochondrial genes. Thus, depending on the degree of iron deficiency in the cardiomyocytes, different mechanisms may come into play, meaning that complex assembly or activity could still be disrupted when levels of individual proteins in the complex are still maintained.</p><p><italic>6) Several experiments were carried out using isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes. How did the authors insure that the cell populations were not contaminated with other cell types, particularly macrophages, which might confound the results?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is right to point out that macrophages are known to be present in the cardiac tissue. We cannot exclude the presence of macrophages in our cardiomyocyte culture. However, specifically with respect to hepcidin production in the supernatants, we can be confident that cardiomyocytes are the source of the hepcidin, because very little hepcidin was detected in supernatants of cardiac-specific hepcidin knockouts (where cardiomyocytes but not macrophages have deletion of the hepcidin gene). We include these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) The iron efflux experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref> appear to be novel because there is no reference provided. Is this correct? For that reason it would be very helpful to know more about them, to assess their validity. Apparently, cells were loaded with non-transferrin bound 55Fe by a 30 minute incubation. How much iron was taken up under these conditions? Why was non-transferrin bound iron used instead of Fe-Tf, particularly considering the results described in Xu et al., 2015 indicating that the transferrin cycle is very important for cardiomyocyte iron uptake? What measures were undertaken to ensure that the PBS washes effectively removed non-assimilated radiolabeled iron? How many times were the experiments repeated, and how variable were the results? Why do the authors think the FpnC326Y mutant had higher iron efflux compared to Hamp-/- cardiomyocytes in the absence of Hamp?</italic> </p><p>The method for measuring iron efflux used in our experiments is not novel, but adapted from the method used by Mckie et al. 2000, which was the first publication to describe the function of FPN in iron efflux. We now include this reference in the text. This method does not enable measurement of absolute amounts of iron flux, but rather measurement of iron efflux as a percentage of the total iron taken up during incubation with the uptake solution; percentage efflux= 100 x Fe55 in efflux solution /(Fe55 in efflux+ Fe55 remaining in cells). The readouts are obtained using a scinitillation counter and are expressed as counts per minute. Count rate does not universally equate to dose rate, and there is no simple universal conversion factor. Any conversions are instrument-specific.</p><p>The reviewer also questions the use of non-transferrin bound Fe55 (as in Mckie et al., 2000) instead of transferrin-bound Fe55 for loading cells with iron. The rationale for this is to circumvent any confounding effects of differential iron uptake between cells of different genotypes due to differing levels of TfR1 expression. Indeed, we know that TfR1 expression is higher in cardiac-hepcidin knockout cells and in Slc40a1 C326Y knock-in cells than in their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). While TfR1 is the dominant route of iron uptake into cardiomyocytes, it is known that NTBI also enters cardiomyocytes via L and T-type calcium channels.</p><p>To minimise carryover of Fe55, cells were washed with PBS 3 times before addition of efflux medium. Efflux measurements were carried out in three independent experiments, with each experiment containing three biological replicates (3 wells of cardiomyocytes) for each genotype and condition. The range between values obtained from three biological replicates constituted between 0.07and 0.21 of the value of mean. Thus, the results were sufficiently accurate to make meaningful comparisons between genotypes and treatment conditions within each experiment, and the outcome of those comparisons was reproducible between experiments.</p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question relating to the levels of iron export being higher in Slc40a1 C326Y knock-in cardiomyocytes than in Hamp knockout cardiomyocytes (p=0.014). We too were initially surprised at this result. One possible explanation is that FPN levels in Slc40a1 C326Y knock-in cardiomyocytes are higher than in Hamp KOs cardiomyocytes, due to the fact that FPN in the former setting is completely insensitive to any hepcidin, while FPN in the latter may still be subject to some regulation by hepcidin from non-cardiomyocyte sources.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A – this appears to be mRNA expression but this is not stated. If it is, how was it normalized? In panel B, as the authors pointed out, it is quite surprising that there appears to be most anti-Hamp staining under iron deficient conditions. If this is truly physiologically important staining (see point 2 above) then it becomes even more important to understand how Hamp expression is regulated (see point 3 above). Hamp is typically measured extracellularly, rather than intracellularly because it is a secreted protein; a defect in pre-protein processing might help explain the discrepancy between panels B and C in this figure. Panel D is particularly important – how many times was this experiment replicated? How reliable is the assay kit (the methods indicate that it is from &quot;uscnk&quot; but I don't know what that is – please specify), and is it specific for Hamp1 rather than Hamp2?</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A depicts mRNA expression of hepcidin. We have amended the corresponding figure legend to make this clear. Expression was measured using Taqman multiplex gene expression assays, where hepcidin and the house keeping gene (b-actin) were measured in the same sample. A δ CT (CT for hepcidin-CT for b-actin) value was generated for each sample. Subsequently δ CT values for each sample were normalised to the average δ CT of the control samples (hearts under control diet), to obtain a δ CT value. Relative expression was then calculated as 2<sup>-δ δ CT</sup>. The reviewer’s questions relating to the discrepancy between hepcidin transcript and protein, the possible role of protein processing and the measurement of hepcidin in supernatants are addressed in responses to points 1 and 2 above.</p><p><italic>9) The heart sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> are suboptimal.
