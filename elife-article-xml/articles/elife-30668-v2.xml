Here, we study the dynamics of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis by tracking individual cells in live analysis of mouse embryos. We report that during an initial phase, FHF precursors differentiate rapidly to form a cardiac crescent, while limited morphogenesis takes place. In a second phase, no differentiation occurs while extensive morphogenesis, including splanchnic mesoderm sliding over the endoderm, results in HT formation. In a third phase, cardiac precursor differentiation resumes and contributes to SHF-derived regions and the dorsal closure of the HT. These results reveal tissue-level coordination between morphogenesis and differentiation during HT formation and provide a new framework to understand heart development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30668.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We all start life as a single cell, which – over the course of nine months – multiplies to generate the billions of cells that can be found in a newborn.

The tube is made up of cells from two different origins, known as the first and second heart fields. Unlike other organs, the heart has to start beating while it is still developing, and until now, it was unclear how the heart manages this difficult task.</p><p>Here, Ivanovich et al. studied mouse embryos grown outside the womb by using a combination of advanced microscopy and genetic labeling to track how single cells turn into beating cells and move while the heart forms. The results showed that specializing into beating cells and forming the heart tube shape happened during alternating phases. The first heart-field cells turned into beating cells and began to contract at an early stage before the heart tube was formed. Next, the cells of the second heart field did not instantly develop into beating cells, but instead, helped the first heart-field cells to acquire the shape of a heart tube. Once this was completed, the second heart-field cells started to specialize into beating cells and created the additional parts of the more complex adult heart.</p><p>This research shows that the second heart field plays an active role in helping the heart tube form. The alternating phases of cell specialization and tissue formation allow the heart to become active whilst it is still developing. A better insight into how the heart forms may help us to create new treatments for various genetic heart conditions. The methods used here could also help to study how cells build other organs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac development</kwd><kwd>heart tube</kwd><kwd>first heart field</kwd><kwd>second heart field</kwd><kwd>cardiac crescent</kwd><kwd>live-imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2015-71519-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD16/0011/0019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ATL1275-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanovitch</surname><given-names>Kenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000609/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ivanovitch</surname><given-names>Kenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2015-70193-REDT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEV-2015-0505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tissue-level coordination of cardiac progenitor cells in the early mouse embryo produces a temporal compartmentalization of differentiation and morphogenesis essential for heart tube formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The heart is the first organ to form and function during embryonic development. At embryonic day (E) 7.5, cardiac precursors in the splanchnic mesoderm (mesoderm apposed to the endoderm) differentiate into cardiomyocytes by assembling the contractile sarcomere machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyser et al., 2016</xref>) and form a bilateral structure known as the cardiac crescent (cc) in the mouse. Concomitant with foregut invagination, the cc swings inwards to become placed underneath the developing head folds. By a complex morphogenetic process, the cc subsequently transforms into an early heart tube (HT) initially opened dorsally, which by E8.25 has transformed into a closed and beating linear HT, also known as the primitive HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cc and early HT mainly give rise to the left ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zaffran et al., 2004</xref>). The right ventricle (RV), the outflow tract and most of the atria derive instead from cardiac progenitors located dorso-medially to the cc in the splanchnic mesoderm, that are progressively recruited at the poles of the HT at subsequent developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mjaatvedt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waldo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galli et al., 2008</xref>). These findings led to the concept that cardiac mesodermal progenitors contain two populations of cells: the first heart field (FHF) precursors, recruited early in development to form the initial HT and mostly containing the LV primordium, and the second heart field (SHF), recruited later and elongating the HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Clonal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meilhac et al., 2004a</xref>) supports the idea that FHF and SHF precursors are two independent developmental fields with dedicated molecular pathways. Clonal analysis also showed that the SHF shares a common origin with the skeletal muscles of the head and neck within the pharyngeal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lescroart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lescroart et al., 2015</xref>), further supporting differences between FHF and SHF populations. However, the existence of a common precursor between FHF and SHF was also reported in the early mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meilhac et al., 2004a</xref>) and other views suggest that the heart would form by a continuous differentiation process from a single population of cardiac precursors and only timing of recruitment would distinguish cells of the FHF and SHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Issa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moorman et al., 2007</xref>). In support of the latter, the typical marker of the SHF, Islet1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2003</xref>), is also transiently expressed in FHF precursors and must therefore be considered as widespread cardiac progenitor marker instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuan and Schoenwolf, 2000</xref>). Whether the recruitment of cardiomyocytes from progenitors is a continuous process and how this coordinates with morphogenesis, however, has not been directly studied. This is partly because the spatial arrangement of progenitors and differentiated cardiomyocytes has so far been analyzed on fixed embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Später et al., 2013</xref>) and the expression dynamics of genes reporting differentiation together with cell movements during HT morphogenesis have not been captured so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu-Issa, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the live-imaging and 3D+t cell tracking of HT formation in whole mouse embryos. Using this method, in conjunction with an Nkx2.5eGFP reporter line, which provides high level of GFP in differentiated cardiomyocytes, we studied the dynamics of cardiac field differentiation. During an initial phase, FHF cardiac precursors differentiate rapidly to form a cardiac crescent, while limited morphogenesis takes place. During a second phase, no differentiation events are detected and extensive morphogenesis, including splanchnic mesoderm sliding over the endoderm, results in HT formation. Finally, using an Isl1-Cre lineage-tracing assay combined with live-imaging, we show that during a third phase, cardiac precursor differentiation resumes and contributes not only to the known SHF-derived regions but also to the dorsal aspect of the HT. These results show essential properties of FHF and SHF contribution to heart development and reveal tissue-level coordination between alternating phases of differentiation and morphogenesis during HT formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3D static analysis of mouse HT formation</title><p>To assess how the initial cardiogenic region transforms into a HT and differentiates, we first analyzed <italic>Nkx2.5<sup>cre/+</sup>; Rosa26Rtdtomato</italic><sup>+/-</sup>embryos, in which both cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes are labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanley et al., 2002</xref>). Before cc differentiation, at early head fold stage (EHF, ~E7.5), the cardiogenic region is visualized as a flat horse shoe-shaped tdtomato+ mesodermal layer at the rostral border of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A’</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the criteria for embryo staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downs and Davies, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson and Wilson, 2016</xref>).

We next studied the distribution of Cardiac troponin T (cTnnT), one of the first evident sarcomeric proteins to appear in the cardiac crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyser et al., 2016</xref>). At EHF stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while most embryos are negative for cTnnT expression, some embryos show weak cTnnT localization in subsets of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,A’</xref>). At a subsequent embryonic stage (~E7.7), cTnnT signal reveals the cc, which is folding inwards. During folding, the cTnnT signal increases. cTnnT+ cells are initially columnar epithelial cells and show apical localization of the tight junction component zona-occluden-1 (ZO-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B,B’</xref>). During differentiation, cardiac precursors switch to a rounded shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linask et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and separate from the endoderm, while maintaining a basal lamina at the endocardial side (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Morphogenetic changes starting at ~E8 subsequently lead to the formation of a hemi-tube whose major axis is transversal to the embryo A-P axis. We will refer to this stage as transversal HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Later, the tube adopts a more spherical shape, very similar to the linear HT but still open dorsally. We will refer to this stage as open HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Relative cell positions therefore remain mostly coherent as the embryonic tissues undergo this initial global movement.

According to our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), these cells can reliably be assigned to cardiomyocytes. The initial location of this cell population fated to become cc cardiomyocytes delineates a crescent-shaped domain at EHF stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Cells retaining lower GFP intensity level throughout the video initially localize posteriorly and medially to this crescent. Most of the cells that have high GFP levels at the final time point show low GFP levels at the initial time point and increase their GFP level over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). These results suggest that cardiomyocytes of the cc differentiate during 5–6 hr starting at the EHF stage, which is consistent with the onset of detectable cTnnT at that stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Cells in the cardiac mesoderm do divide during the observation time, so we identified cell division events and tracked the descendant cells. 43% of the tracked cells underwent one division during the 4–5 hr videos. To determine whether cell fate (differentiation versus progenitor) is allocated in the cardiogenic mesoderm at the EHF stage, we tracked GFP levels in dividing cells and their descendants. We found that most sister cell pairs show matched high or low GFP intensity levels at the end of the observation period (38 out of 39, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

To do so, we tracked cells located in the splanchnic mesoderm and cc in <italic>Nkx2.5-eGFP</italic> embryos at successive periods of around 3 hr covering the 5–7 hr during which the transversal HT transforms into the open HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Video 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This analysis revealed that the trajectories of cc cells move apart from each other over time as the tissue expands during the transition from the transverse HT to the more spherical open HT. The HT starts to beat during the observation period, especially at the later stages, and therefore, in some cases, cardiomyocyte cell shape appears distorted in single optical sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>); however, the GFP level could be determined. As mentioned above, antero-medial movement of the splanchnic mesoderm can be observed concomitant with the transformation of the transversal HT into the open HT (visible also in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">12</xref>).

Importantly, they retain a columnar shape typical of weak cTnnT+ and cTnnT- cells located at the boundary zone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref>). Although these cells migrate antero-medially relative to the underlying more static endodermal cells (see endodermal cell highlighted by the red arrow from t = 69 m in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>), they do not contribute to the HT during the observation period. We confirmed this observation in longer time-lapse videos spanning 7 hr that covered the whole transition from transversal to open HT stage. Again, progenitors strictly respected the boundary with the HT throughout the entire time-lapse video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>, boundary imaged five times in different locations and in two independent embryos). All together, these data suggest that during the transformation of the cc into the dorsally open HT no cardiomyocytes are added to the HT from the SHF. These observations suggest two distinct phases of early HT formation: a first phase of differentiation of the FHF into the cc, lasting around 5 hr, and a second phase of HT morphogenesis in which the SHF progenitors remain undifferentiated, lasting around 5–7 hr. During this second phase, extensive remodeling of the cardiac crescent is concomitant with the antero-medial splanchnic mesoderm displacement.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30668.043</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>No cardiac differentiation is detected during early HT morphogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A–A’’</bold>) Images from time-lapse <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref> of a tamoxifen-induced <italic>RERT<sup>+/-</sup>; Rosa26Rtdtomato<sup>+/-</sup>; Nkx2.5eGFP</italic> embryo during the stages at which the transversal HT transforms into an open HT, showing cells located in the splanchnic mesoderm (white arrows in A’ and A’’), respecting the boundary with the HT (yellow arrows in J’ show two cells located in the HT).

This study further confirmed that SHF differentiation at the arterial pole is initiated when the HT is about to close dorsally but not before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, SHF cells do not differentiate during the 5–7 hr period when morphogenesis of the open HT takes place, but coordinately start differentiation at different regions of the HT during dorsal closure.

We report three distinct temporal phases of HT formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). During the first phase, the cc differentiates rapidly and morphogenesis, in terms of changes in the relative position of cells, is minimal. During the second phase, differentiation is not detected and morphogenetic remodeling gives rise to a dorsally open HT. During the third phase, cardiac precursor recruitment and differentiation resumes, contributing to the formation of the RV and the dorsal closure of the HT. Our results support the early establishment of distinct FHF and SHF cell populations and show that the morphogenetic changes that transform the cc into a HT largely take place in the absence of cardiac precursor differentiation. These observations indicate tissue-level coordination of differentiation and morphogenesis during early cardiogenesis in the mouse.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30668.054</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model of cardiomyocyte differentiation dynamics during early heart development.</title><p>We propose that two distinct phases of cardiomyocyte differentiation take place during early heart development.

Subsequently, the cc. undergoes further morphogenesis to transform into a HT, initially open dorsally and no cardiomyocyte differentiation is detected during this transformation. Finally, cardiac differentiation resumes contributing new cardiomyocytes from the splanchnic mesoderm to the arterial pole (prospective RV) and the dorsal closure of the HT.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30668-fig10-v2"/></fig><p>The series of 3D reconstructions from fixed embryos was important to establish a reference staging of HT formation. This allowed us to accurately stage embryos in live experiments based on morphology and it will also be useful in the future for gene expression mapping and accurate phenotypic analysis of mutant embryos. The tissue growth pattern observed in static 3D reconstructions was insightful to suggest variability in growth rates during different phases of HT formation. Growth of the differentiated cardiac tissue is relatively paused when the cc undergoes morphogenesis to form the open HT during the second phase. This is consistent with previous studies in mouse, chick and human models showing that proliferation drops in the differentiated myocardium of the forming HT, while proliferation remains high in the splanchnic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Berg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sizarov et al., 2011</xref>). Our live analysis further showed that SHF cells do not contribute to the forming HT during the differentiation pause, which correlates with the growth rate reduction during this phase. This period coincides as well with the onset of cardiac contractility in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyser et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Following the phase of differentiation pause, growth of the HT is reinitiated by incorporation of new cells as the HT closes dorsally and the RV precursors are added at the arterial pole during the third phase. During this third phase, similarities were found in the differentiation dynamics of SHF precursors and splanchnic precursors contributing to the dorsal regions of the linear HT. The dorsal aspect of the linear HT gives rise to the inner curvature of the looped heart, which has an important contribution to non-chamber myocardium, including atrio-ventricular canal and parts of the conduction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christoffels et al., 2000</xref>). Our results suggest that the late recruitment of progenitors to the dorsal HT could contribute to differences between inner curvature cardiomyocytes and the rest of the heart tube.</p><p>While the live-imaging experiments were essential for the identification of the 5–7 hr hiatus between FHF and SHF differentiation, live imaging of the arterial pole during the SHF differentiation phase was challenging and was complemented by 3D reconstructions based on fixed and optically cleared embryos. These experiments confirmed the pause in differentiation during open HT formation and its reactivation during linear HT closure. In the future, it will be interesting to explore whether novel non-toxic index-matching media compatible with embryo viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boothe et al., 2017</xref>) may alleviate the limitations for deep cardiac imaging during late HT formation.</p><p>Regarding the specification of FHF and SHF populations, previous prospective clonal analyses showed that these lineages diverge around gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>). In agreement with this, our tracking of cell lineages in the cardiac forming region shows that sister cells share fates to either the cardiac crescent or the SHF. In addition, the fact that cells contributing to the SHF do not differentiate during the period when the cardiac crescent transforms into the primitive heart tube may contribute to the establishment of the sharp boundary observed between left and right ventricles later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devine et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies will be required to assess how this temporal pause of cardiac differentiation is regulated. The molecular analyses of early FHF and SHF precursors suggest that intrinsic molecular differences between the two lineages appear around or shortly after gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>). These intrinsic differences may contribute to the regulation of the two distinct differentiation schedules described here. These studies and our observations, however, cannot discriminate whether this lineage allocation results from intrinsic differences between these lineages or it is due to their exposure to position-specific environments, especially as in our studies sister cells remain close neighbors. Environmental cues thus could also control the sequential differentiation of FHF and SHF precursors. The Wnt and BMP pathways are well known regulators of cardiac differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klaus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marvin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qyang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tirosh-Finkel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ueno et al., 2007</xref>) and specific mechanisms affecting these pathways could be operating during the formation the HT, whereby the differentiation pathways could be temporally restrained. Finally, the endoderm may also play a key role in mediating FHF differentiation. Indeed cardiac mesoderm differentiation is affected in the absence of Sox17 -a transcription factor required for maintenance of the definitive endoderm- and this is accompanied by the formation of a morphologically abnormal HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfister et al., 2011</xref>). It remains, however, unclear whether this effect is secondary to an initial defect in foregut development that is observed in this mutant.</p><p>A recent study reported spontaneous calcium transients propagating laterally thought the cardiac crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyser et al., 2016</xref>). Left/Right (L/R) asymmetry therefore exists within the cardiac crescent, prior to any detectable cardiac contraction, and BMP/SMAD1 signaling in the lateral plate mesoderm may be involved in this asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furtado et al., 2008</xref>). In our studies, however, we did not detect any L/R difference in cTnnT expression by whole-mount immunodetection or Nkx2.5GFP activation by live analysis in the cc.</p><p>Regarding the possible conservation of the temporal differentiation sequence described here, elegant experiments in zebrafish using a cardiac myosin light chain reporter line and a Kaede photo-conversion assay, addressed the temporal order of cardiac differentiation in live embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Pater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Stainier, 2012</xref>). Two distinct phases of cardiomyocyte differentiation were also observed. During a first phase, cardiomyocytes were recruited first into the ventricle and atria at the venous pole. During a second phase, cardiomyocyte differentiation was observed at the arterial pole of the HT. These pulse-chase experiments, however, do not address whether cardiac differentiation is continuous or includes a differentiation-paused phase, so further studies will be required to establish the conservation of the observations made here for the mouse embryo.</p><p>Finally, an important question to address is the functional relevance of the three distinct phases described here; more specifically, what is the role of the observed differentiation pause. An interesting possibility is that this pause would be functionally related to the extensive morphogenetic events that transform the cardiac crescent into the HT. Our study demonstrates coordinated splanchnic mesoderm movements during this phase. These movements involve a very active antero-medial displacement of the splanchnic mesoderm surrounding the cc -mostly fated to the SHF-. This behavior of the splanchnic mesoderm appears essential for transforming the cc into a dorsally closed HT. Importantly, this displacement involves the sliding of the splanchnic layer over the endoderm, suggesting an active role of SHF precursors in this morphogenetic movement. Such displacement of the splanchnic mesoderm over the endoderm during cardiogenesis had been suggested by classical time-lapse studies in the chick embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dehaan, 1963</xref>), and it is tempting to speculate that a similar phenomenon contributes to the incorporation of SHF cells to both poles of the HT at later stages of HT development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Berg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zaffran et al., 2004</xref>). These observations suggest that SHF cells do not represent just a reservoir of cardiac precursors but play a morphogenetic role essential for heart tube formation. The main consequence of the displacement of the splanchnic mesoderm layer over the endoderm is the medial convergence of the left and right frontiers between the cc and SHF to form the dorsal mesocardium and close the HT. An important consequence of the differentiation pause described here is the stability of the cc/SHF frontiers during these morphogenetic movements. This stability prevents further spreading of the differentiation wave from the cc into the SHF/splanchnic mesoderm, which could interfere the ability of the latter to efficiently displace over the endoderm. We therefore hypothesize that the stability of the cc/SHF frontiers – and thus the differentiation pause – would be essential to allow the effective displacement of SHF/splanchnic mesoderm and elicit HT formation. The temporal allocation of the morphogenetic phase after cc differentiation allows the formation of the HT while simultaneously providing an incipient cardiac function essential for the organization of embryonic circulation. This hypothesis poses a functional basis for the alternation of differentiation and morphogenesis phases during HT formation.</p><p>Our study applies whole-embryo live analysis of cardiac development at tissue level and with cellular resolution. We expect that extending this experimental approach will allow to further uncover unexpected and novel mechanisms of organogenesis. While limited attention had been paid so far to the temporal dynamics of differentiation during embryonic development, this is an essential aspect of organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gogendeau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parchem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show the relevance of differentiation timing regulation during heart tube formation and its coordination with morphogenesis at the tissue level. Further understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these phenomena will help us expanding pools of cardiac progenitors in vitro or directing them towards differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Mouse alleles used in the manuscript are listed including bibliographic references and allele identities at the ‘Mouse Genome Informatics’ data base (MGI, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>). <italic>Mesp1<sup>cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saga et al., 1999</xref>, MGI:2176467), <italic>Isl1<sup>cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2003</xref>, MGI:3623159), <italic>Nkx2.5<sup>cre</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanley et al., 2002</xref>, MGI:2448972), <italic>Rosa26Rtdtomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>, MGI:3809524), <italic>Rosa26RmTmG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>, MGI:3716464), <italic>Nkx2.5eGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2006</xref>, MGI:5788423), <italic>Polr2a<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (<italic>RERT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guerra et al., 2003</xref>, MGI:3772332) and <italic>C57BL/6</italic> (Charles River).

Embryos were incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies diluted in PBST: mouse anti-cTnnT (1:250, MS-295 Thermo Scientific), rabbit anti-PH3 (1:250, 06–570 Millipore), CD31 (553370 BD Pharmingen clone MEC 13.3), SMA (C6198 Sigma) and rabbit anti-Laminin1 (1:500, Sigma, L9393).

Before imaging, embryos were washed in PBST at room temperature and cleared with focus clear (Cell Explorer, FC-101) to enhance the transparency of the embryo. Confocal images were obtained on a SP8 Leica confocal microscope with a 20X oil objective (0.7 NA) at a 1024 × 1024 pixels dimension with a z-step of 2–4 μm.

Embryos were staged on the basis of morphological criteria (supplementary Figure 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downs and Davies, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson and Wilson, 2016</xref>), and those between the bud and early somitogenesis stages were used for culture and time-lapse imaging. To track the early phase of cardiac differentiation and subsequent phases of morphogenesis, we used embryos at EHF to transversal HT stage. Embryos were cultured in 50% fresh rat serum, 48% DMEM without phenol red, 1% N-2 neuronal growth supplement (100X, Invitrogen 17502–048) and 1% B-27 supplement (50X Thermo Fisher Scientist 17504044) filter sterilised through a 0.2 mm filter. To hold embryos in position during time-lapse acquisition, we made special plastic holders with holes of different diameters (0.5–3 mm) to ensure a good fit of embryos similarly to the traps developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nonaka, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nonaka et al. (2002)</xref>. Embryos were mounted with their anterior side facing up. To avoid evaporation, the medium was covered with mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich; M8410). Before starting the time-lapse acquisition, embryos were first pre-cultured for at least 2 hr in the microscopy culture set up. The morphology of the embryo was then carefully monitored and if the embryos appeared unhealthy or rotate and move, they were discarded, otherwise, time-lapse acquisition was performed. For the acquisition, we used the Zeiss LSM780 equipped with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and a heating chamber maintaining 37°C. The objective lens used was a 20X(NA = 1) dipping objective, which allowed a long working distance for imaging mouse embryos and tissues. A MaiTai laser line at 1000 nm was used for two-channel two-photon imaging. Acquisition was done using Zen software (Zeiss). Typical image settings were: output power: 250 mW, pixel dwell time: 7μs, line averaging: two and image dimension: 610 × 610 μm (1024 × 1024 pixels). To maximize the chance of covering the entire heart tube during long-term time lapse videos, we allowed 150–200 μm of free space between the objective and the embryo at the beginning of the recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell labeling, 3D tracking and GFP intensity measurement</title><p>For labeling single cells, tamoxifen was administered by oral gavage (2–4 mg/mL) in <italic>RERT;Rosa26R-tdtomato</italic> (cell tracking) or <italic>RERT;Rosa26RmTmG</italic> mice (cell shape study) at E7. Cell shape measurements were done on single cells, imaged in mosaic-labeled, fixed and immunostained embryos and analyzed with Fiji software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Tracking of tdtomato-labeled cells was done on single cells located within the cardiogenic mesoderm -excluding endothelial, pericardial and endodermal cells- and their GFP intensity was measured over time. To track cells manually in 4D stacks, the MTrackJ Fiji plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meijering et al., 2012</xref>) was used. A local square cursor (25 × 25 pixels) on the cell of interest snaps according to a bright centroid feature on a slice-by-slice basis. Only tracks lasting for the entire length of the video were kept. When an ambiguity arises in the tracking between consecutive time points, the track was discarded. Tracks split at cell divisions. A cell division event is normally clearly distinguishable over at least two time points. In case one of the two daughter cells is not tractable, the other daughter cell is still tracked. Each track is assigned an ID number and excel files with all the tracks coordinates in x, y, z and t was generated. Coordinates of each track were converted into 8-bit 4D images using a custom Fiji macro in which each cell was represented by a sphere of specific pixel intensity, from 1 to 255, while pixels corresponding to background were set to zero. The 4D images were then opened with Imaris to perform visualization of the 3D trajectories of each cell using the ‘spots’ tool, where each object were identified according to pixel intensity. GFP intensity measurement is performed by segmentation of cell shape. A Gaussian filter whose radius is adjusted to the typical size of a cell was first applied, followed by a Laplacian filter. The resulting 32 bits image was next converted to a mask by thresholding. When objects touched each other, a watershed on the binary mask and manual corrections was applied. Each segmented cell was checked and tracked manually for accuracy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref> nuclei segmentation was performed manually. The mean GFP signal intensity of the segmented objects was then measured using the ‘analyze particle’ tool in Fiji. To quantify the GFP level of tracked cells through time, four to five successive time points were arbitrarily chosen in each video (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, where GFP intensity level was measured in every time point.

To find a correlation between GFP and cTnnT levels of 0.8 with an alpha-level f 0.05 and a power of 0.2 at least 10 cells per embryo were required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

To calculate the average speed of splanchnic mesoderm displacement, the shortest distance between the left and right splanchnic mesoderm was calculated in two z-level, using the measure tool in Fiji, and the variation in this distance by time unit was divided by 2, to determine the speed of movement of each sliding side of the splanchnic mesoderm.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the CNIC Microscopy unit for help with the live confocal analysis, Fatima Sanchez Cabo for help with the statistical analyses and Florencia Cavodeassi, Miguel Manzanares, Briane Laruy and members of the Torres lab for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Isabelle Migeotte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant paper that tracks in real time the movements and differentiation status of cells contributing to the heart, specifically discriminating between the behaviours of the first and second heart field. The study used fluorescent reporters and confocal microscopy to obtain high resolution 3 and 4D images of early mouse hearts, including highly informative time-lapse movies of heart tube formation in wildtype embryos. It brings together many disparate and mostly 2D findings into a more coherent concept and provides a way to visualise the formation of what is called the transverse heart tube. The authors careful observations make a number of new points, including defining distinct stages of heart tube morphogenesis based on detailed 3D reconstructions that will be extremely useful for staging embryos and defining gene expression and function. The most significant finding is the discovery of a differentiation hiatus during heart tube formation that corresponds to a phase of heart tube morphogenesis separating first and second heart progenitor cell differentiation. This pause also covers the onset of cardiac function. This is an important observation that further highlights the distinction between the early and late differentiating populations of cardiac progenitor cells. Although the authors did not investigate how this pause might be regulated, for example by studying heart tube formation in mutant embryos, their approach could be adapted for such analysis in the future, with the challenge of dealing with complex genetic crosses. The transition between progenitor and differentiation has been observed as an increase in the levels of Nkx2-5-GFP and cTnT. Importantly, this is not continuous and differentiation of FHF and SHF progenitors is separated by a time window of ~5-7 hours. This point has some considerable implications for conceptualising this transition in light of the various findings to date and the difficult issues surrounding the use of Cre reagents and Cre reporters of varying efficacy upon which the concept of FHF and SHF are in part built. How the situation in mouse relates to that in Zebrafish will remain unclear until more careful studies allow a more direct comparison between the two species. To our knowledge, live Imaging of mouse heart morphogenesis has never been performed for such long period with such high degree of cellular resolution and quantitative analysis of individual cells fate. The data nicely complement previous studies showing temporal waves of precursors at gastrulation corresponding to the FHF and SHF, and provides a credible explanation for the long period between the exit of those populations with different profiles from the streak, and their allocation to the proper anatomical position. The data is of high quality, and the health of the embryos is remarkable after quite a long imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data suggesting that FHF and SHF differentiation and morphogenetic behaviours are set within the cardiac crescent, does not formally address whether there are meaningful functional differences in lineage state between these populations. Geographical issues rather than lineage issues may determine the timing of differentiation and morphogenesis. This should be made very clear in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Subsection “Imaging the Isl1-expressing cell lineage confirms absence of cardiac progenitor differentiation during early heart tube morphogenesis”, first paragraph. With respect to the activation of the Isl1Cre x reporter, I think it is the efficacy of the Cre not the frequency of activation that is the issue. Please clarify.</p><p>3) The reviewers disagree with the statement in the second paragraph of the Discussion that the contribution of the Isl1+ cells/SHF cells to the dorsal part of the primary HT will define these as non-chamber myocardium. This is not shown and lineage tracing by Christoffels with Tbx-Cre reagents show that non-working myocardium of the AVC and contribute significantly to chamber myocardium. Furthermore, it follows that the mosaic contribution of the SHF to the inflow/atrial region would also have to remain non-chamber myocardium. This is not shown and previous lineage tracing with Isl1 Cre and other reagents do not show exclusion form the atrial appendages (working myocardium). Please qualify appropriately.</p><p>4) Technical information about the time period between frames would be useful.</p><p>5) The Cre activation of Tomato also labels endoderm as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, especially in the sections. This should be commented on early in the Results, as it is later in the Isl1 section. Are endodermal cells also seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>? Have they been removed in the reconstructions? Please comment on the basis for the differences between the different Nkx2-5 alleles (Cre versus eGFP).</p><p>6) The authors describe the major axis at the &quot;transversal&quot; hemitube stage as being transversal to the AP axis. The authors should clarify whether their data suggest that this axis is realigned or simply replaced by an AP axis during the transition to the linear HT.</p><p>7) The authors are encouraged to elaborate in the Results section on what has been learnt from the dynamic imaging shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref>-8. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo” they state that this has provided information concerning the formation of the endocardium and lumen formation, yet they do not say what this information is. Similarly, can they expand on any new findings concerning the anterior movement of splanchnic mesoderm? Given that even the striking observation of the differentiation pause is validated using confocal imaging of fixed embryos it is important to highlight exactly what can be gained by time-lapse imaging. This clearly goes beyond concluding that increased Nkx2.5 expression reports cardiomyocyte differentiation (as stated as the conclusion of the next paragraph).</p><p>8) The Discussion is short and could be extended, in part by elaborating on some of the points mentioned above. The observation that there is a growth pause coincident with the differentiation pause also merits discussion. The coincidence of this pause with the onset of cardiac function could also be further discussed. Also, in the Discussion, the authors state that addition of the SHF to the zebrafish heart is seen as a continuum. However this is unclear, and the original work of de Pater et al. suggest SHF addition demarcates a distinct late differentiation phase, not dissimilar to the authors' new observations in the mouse.</p><p>9) Panel 4A explaining the live imaging set-up is slightly confusing. Was imaging of the second phase carried out by continuing imaging of embryos from the first phase or in separate experiments? Given the embryos can be cultured for 24 hours, were embryos imaged continuously through these two phases and if so were the results then the same for the second phase? Please clarify. It would be helpful to add a little more technical information to the first Results paragraph dealing with live imaging (subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo”), mentioning maximal culture and imaging times and frequency of time-lapse acquisitions.</p><p>10) Can the authors provide live imaging data of the third phase during which SHF cells initiate differentiation? This would be most interesting to document in time-lapse images and would significantly reinforce their hypothesis that this phase involves recovery from the differentiation hiatus.</p><p>11) Concerning <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, please clarify the significance of cells that remain columnar with low levels of GFP expression. Can the authors conclude that these are SHF cells versus endocardial cells?</p><p>12) Making conclusions about lineage commitment by following the GFP status of sister cells seems a relatively weak argument. For example, do the authors envisage that cells would move from a GFP high to low state? It would potentially be more interesting to highlight that differentiation is not associated with a cell division event.</p><p>13) It is unclear how the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> were labeled. Please explain this more fully in the Results section.</p><p>14) How do the authors consider that some of the tomato labeled cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> become further apart over time? Is it possible to generate a video of these views comparable to <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Video 16</xref>?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30668.058</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data suggesting that FHF and SHF differentiation and morphogenetic behaviours are set within the cardiac crescent, does not formally address whether there are meaningful functional differences in lineage state between these populations.

Contribution to the endocardium was also observed (as reported by Stanley et al. 2002) and we also added this information in the text. For the purpose of the 3D reconstruction, the tdtomato labelled endodermal and endocardial cells was systematically removed manually and only the cardiac lineages FHF and SHF have been 3D-rendered. We added a supplementary figure to illustrate this clearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, the segmentation procedure is further explained in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Regarding the embryo shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, at the cardiac pre-differentiation stage, tdtomato signal is not detected in endodermal cells and we commented on that in the main text (subsection “3D static analysis of mouse HT formation”, first paragraph). tdtomato signal in endothelial cells (identifiable because of their typical flat morphology) can however be observed. The 3D reconstruction of the crescent shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>’ does not include the endoderm but does include endocardial cells.

While the Nkx2.5eGFP line is a 2.1kb enhancer line previously described as directing specific expression in the cardiac tissues (Lien. et al. 1999), the Nkx2.5cre line is a knock-in line driving cre expression in broader domains including the pharyngeal endoderm (Stanley et al. 2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors describe the major axis at the &quot;transversal&quot; hemitube stage as being transversal to the AP axis.

We do see cells moving apart from each other over time at specific positions of the cc and now we mention this in the manuscript (subsection “Cardiomyocyte differentiation is not detected during heart tube morphogenesis”, first paragraph). These observations suggest highly anisotropic local behaviors involved in this this transition. Altogether, our movies do suggest that the transverse axis does not simply realign along the AP axis during the transition from transverse HT to the more spherical open HT (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Video 14</xref>), however the fragmentary nature of the data generated precludes conclusions at this point. We consider that we would need extended quantitative cell track analyses at higher density and registering 4D data between different experiments to fully understand how cells reorganize during this transition. This is ongoing work in the laboratory that will not be resolved in a short time and we consider it to be out of the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors are encouraged to elaborate in the Results section on what has been learnt from the dynamic imaging shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref>-8. For example, in the second paragraph of the subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo” they state that this has provided information concerning the formation of the endocardium and lumen formation, yet they do not say what this information is. Similarly, can they expand on any new findings concerning the anterior movement of splanchnic mesoderm? Given that even the striking observation of the differentiation pause is validated using confocal imaging of fixed embryos it is important to highlight exactly what can be gained by time-lapse imaging. This clearly goes beyond concluding that increased Nkx2.5 expression reports cardiomyocyte differentiation (as stated as the conclusion of the next paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly disagree with the idea that live analysis might not be so relevant for the conclusions in this paper. We used fixed specimens of the Islet1Cre line for validation of our live observations but this mouse line has been around in many labs for many years and these conclusions were never inspired until live imaging has been achieved. Indeed, this highlights the need for live analysis, as it suggests we may be missing many relevant aspects of cardiac development by looking just at fixed embryos.</p><p>In our initial manuscript we did not want to enter fully into the relevance of splanchnic mesoderm migration (which is not just toward anterior but has an important medial directionality) as we felt it would not be completely understood until analyzed in detail at single cell resolution (see answer to point 6), however, upon the comment of the reviewer, we realize this aspect is an essential part of this manuscript and actually nicely provides a functional hypothesis for our observations. We have now added a new Results section focusing on morphogenesis in which we address the formation of the endocardial lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>’, subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo reveals morphogenetic events leading to HT formation”, second paragraph), the migration of the splanchnic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, see the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>, subsection “Cardiomyocyte differentiation is not detected during heart tube morphogenesis”) and the changes in cell shape occurring during cardiomyocyte differentiation (“2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo reveals morphogenetic events leading to HT formation”). The migration of the splanchnic mesoderm is in fact essential to understand HT formation and provides a plausible functional explanation for the existence of a pause in differentiation during HT formation. A new paragraph in the Discussion explains the functional relevance of these findings and the proposed hypothesis (Discussion, eighth paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Discussion is short and could be extended, in part by elaborating on some of the points mentioned above. The observation that there is a growth pause coincident with the differentiation pause also merits discussion. The coincidence of this pause with the onset of cardiac function could also be further discussed. Also, in the Discussion, the authors state that addition of the SHF to the zebrafish heart is seen as a continuum. However this is unclear, and the original work of de Pater et al. suggest SHF addition demarcates a distinct late differentiation phase, not dissimilar to the authors' new observations in the mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and we have extended our Discussion accordingly. We have now discussed the growth pause coincident with the differentiation pause and the coincidence of this pause with the onset of cardiac function (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We also changed our statement relative to the zebrafish heart since we cannot exclude the existence of a differentiation pause in this organism (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Panel 4A explaining the live imaging set-up is slightly confusing. Was imaging of the second phase carried out by continuing imaging of embryos from the first phase or in separate experiments? Given the embryos can be cultured for 24 hours, were embryos imaged continuously through these two phases and if so were the results then the same for the second phase? Please clarify. It would be helpful to add a little more technical information to the first Results paragraph dealing with live imaging (subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo”), mentioning maximal culture and imaging times and frequency of time-lapse acquisitions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the technical information about the videos in the Results section. Also, we now provide information on the total imaging time and frequency of time-lapse acquisition in video legends (see also answer to point 4). The maximum culture time and imaging time was 24 hours (in 3 occasions) and we now also mention this in the manuscript (subsection “2-photon live-imaging of early cardiac development in the mouse embryo reveals 204 morphogenetic events leading to HT formation”, first paragraph). Although the embryos developed well for 24 hours, the chances that the region of interest moves out of focus increases with time, making those long acquisitions very challenging. Typical acquisition times varied instead between 3 to 13 hours (see the information in movie legends) and some embryos were indeed continuously imaged throughout the two phases (see for example <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">videos 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>). Some individual cells could also be tracked throughout the two phases. We have now added an example in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can the authors provide live imaging data of the third phase during which SHF cells initiate differentiation? This would be most interesting to document in time-lapse images and would significantly reinforce their hypothesis that this phase involves recovery from the differentiation hiatus.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide evidence for the reinitiation of differentiation during the third phase by live imaging at both the arterial and venous poles. In similarity to our observations during the first phase, using the Nkx2.5eGFP reporter line, we were able to track cells at the border between the FHF and SHF at the venous pole which, at this stage is rather externally exposed and easier to image. We started the movies during the second phase, when differentiation is not detected, and extended recordings into the third phase, when differentiation is expected to restart. We tracked cells showing initially a low and stable GFP level throughout the second phase, and found few cells increasing their GFP expression at later stages corresponding to the start of the third phase. These data have been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>During the third phase, it remains however a challenge to track SHF cells differentiating at the arterial pole by detection of an increase in the Nkx2.5eGFP signal, because those cells are located deep inside the embryo and the fluorescent signal is consequently poorly detected and remains faint over time (as explained in the first paragraph of the Discussion). We have replaced the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> to make the point about this limitation. In contrast, the Rosa26Rtdtomato reporter can be detected in cells of the arterial pole by live imaging during the third phase. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have therefore added one additional live imaging analysis from an Isl1cre/R26tdtomato embryo. While no differentiation of SHF cells during the second phase could be detected (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Video 16</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">17</xref>), the recordings during the third phase show that SHF tdtomato positive cells initiate incorporation to the arterial pole after the open HT has formed, as the RV becomes visible (included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This is confirmed in 3D reconstructions based on fixed and optically cleared embryos of a similar stage. These data confirm by live imaging that cells at the border between FHF and SHF remain undifferentiated during HT morphogenesis and resume differentiation at the end of this phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Concerning <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, please clarify the significance of cells that remain columnar with low levels of GFP expression. Can the authors conclude that these are SHF cells versus endocardial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, those cells that remain columnar with low level of GPF expression are SHF cells and not endocardial cells. Whole mount immunostainings against CD31, an endocardial marker, shows that endocardial cells are absent from the splanchnic mesoderm, where SHF cells reside. We added a supplementary figure to show this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, endocardial cells show typical elongated cell shapes which makes them easily identifiable in live analysis, and they are found in the cardiac crescent/heart tube lumen but not in the splanchnic mesoderm, where SHF cell reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>’’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have now clarified this point in the text (subsection “Live tracking of Cardiomyocyte differentiation in individual cells reveals cardiac 262 crescent differentiation dynamics”, third paragraph). Note that eGFP signal in the Nkx2.5eGFP enhancer line can be detected in the endocardium but also, albeit faintly, in some endodermal cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Making conclusions about lineage commitment by following the GFP status of sister cells seems a relatively weak argument. For example, do the authors envisage that cells would move from a GFP high to low state? It would potentially be more interesting to highlight that differentiation is not associated with a cell division event.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, indeed our tracking is short-term and therefore we would not be able to tell the fate of the cells beyond the observation period if we would solely rely on our observations. However, we show that high GFP levels correlate with expression of cTnnT and long-term experiments using cTnnTcre lineage tracing indeed show that all cells expressing cTnnT are exclusively fated to the cardiomyocyte lineage (Jiao et al. 2003). We therefore think it is reasonable to assume that we have effectively traced the fate of the cells at the cardiac crescent stage by this assay. Obviously, this observation is of limited interest, provided the previous report of FHF/SHF segregation around gastrulation (Lescroart et al. 2014; Devine et al., 2014) and the restricted mixing of cardiac precursor cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> but also past clonal analysis showing non-dispersion of clonally related cells in the heart, Meilhac et al. 2003), as commented in our response to point 1). Nonetheless we think there are not many examples of tracking cell division and differentiation events at single-cell resolution in vertebrates and certainly none in mammalian heart development, so we think this is an important demonstration of the potentiality of the new approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) It is unclear how the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref> were labeled. Please explain this more fully in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now explained in the Materials and methods section how single cells were labelled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> (subsection “Cell labeling, 3D tracking and GFP Intensity Measurement”). We have also indicated the genotype of the mouse used in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) How do the authors consider that some of the tomato labeled cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> become further apart over time? Is it possible to generate a video of these views comparable to <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Video 16</xref>?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the video related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>) and it shows SHF cells indeed moving apart from each other over time (distance between the green arrows increase from 61 to 83um over 3 hours 12mn). Cell growth and/or proliferation of cells located between the labeled cells could explain why cells are moving apart. Cells located in the splanchnic mesoderm are indeed proliferative (de Boer et al. 2012). In addition, more complex cell behaviors are plausible, like intercalation of cells as part of 3D tissue remodeling. At this stage of our analysis, we have not been able to comprehensively describe these phenomena. More detailed quantitative analysis of the 3D+t cell tracking is being performed at the moment but this is a whole and challenging project out of the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
