expression of selective aggression toward novel conspecifics. Here, we utilize behavioral and anatomical techniques to extend the current understanding of neural mechanisms that mediate pair bond maintenance. For both sexes, we show that pair bonding up-regulates mRNA expression for genes encoding D1-like dopamine (DA) receptors and dynorphin as well as enhances stimulated DA release within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We next show that D1-like receptor regulation of selective aggression is mediated through downstream activation of kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) and that activation of these receptors mediates social avoidance. Finally, we also identified sex-specific alterations in KOR binding density within the NAc shell of paired males and demonstrate that this alteration contributes to the neuroprotective effect of pair bonding against drug reward. Together, these findings suggest motivational and valence processing systems interact to mediate the maintenance of social bonds.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15325.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15325.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15325.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bond between parents is one of the most important social relationships that humans have. Prairie voles are one of the few other mammals whose individuals also form long-term social bonds after having offspring together, so they have frequently been used to study the brain mechanisms that underlie such bonding. However, most previous studies have focused only on how the bond between a pair of mating partners is formed: little is known about how this bond is then maintained over months and years.</p><p>When a prairie vole forms a bond with a mate, it will then aggressively reject other prairie voles. This “selective aggression” only happens once a social bond between two mating prairie voles is formed, so this behavior can be used as a proxy to confirm that the social bond exists.</p><p>In order to study how prairie voles maintain bonds with a mate, Resendez et al. tracked what happens in the brain of a prairie vole during selective aggression. The experiments showed that this aggressive behaviour coincides with changes in gene expression and brain chemistry that make it unpleasant for a prairie vole to be exposed to voles that are not its partner. For male prairie voles – but not females – these changes only happened if the female mating partner became pregnant during the cohabitation period.</p><p>The changes that occur in the brain as a result of bonding with a partner also mean that drugs that are normally addictive are no longer pleasant and rewarding to the prairie vole. Indeed, forming a social bond between mating animals alters the brain in similar ways to the effects produced by addictive drugs. Thus, in a sense, each member of the mating pair becomes ‘addicted’ to their partner.</p><p>The results presented by Resendez et al. also have implications for humans. They suggest that having a strong social support network is a powerful way of preventing casual drug use from developing into compulsive drug addiction. This may also mean that positive social relationships could help to treat people with drug addiction problems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15325.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15325.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>pair bonding</kwd><kwd>prairie vole</kwd><kwd>dynorphin</kwd><kwd>kappa-opioid receptors</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0953106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aragona</surname><given-names>Brandon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD040127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Resendez</surname><given-names>Shanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA034681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office of Vice President Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aragona</surname><given-names>Brandon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R21MH096216-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aragona</surname><given-names>Brandon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neural mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of social bonds between prairie voles suggest that social support networks may be a powerful way of treating addiction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to maintain meaningful social bonds is a critical component of human health and mental well being, yet the neural capacity to maintain such relationships is not well understood. The socially monogamous prairie vole (<italic>Michrotus ochrogaster</italic>) presents an ideal animal model to study the neural correlates of social bond maintenance because, unlike most mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kleiman, 1977</xref>), prairie voles form selective and enduring attachments to their mating partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2009</xref>). In both the field and laboratory, the maintenance of these bonds is associated with the expression of selective aggression towards novel conspecifics as well as selective affiliation with the mating partner (i.e., mate guarding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carter and Getz, 1993</xref>). Importantly, the expression of selective aggression provides a robust and reliable assay that can be utilized in a laboratory setting to deconstruct neural signaling pathways involved in the regulation of social bond maintenance.</p><p>To date, laboratory studies have identified that the expression of selective aggression, and therefore pair bond maintenance, requires the activation of both D1-like dopamine (DA) and kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) within the nucleus (NAc) shell as blockade of either one of the receptors attenuates aggressive rejection of novel conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, regulation of pair bond maintenance requires neural systems that code evaluation of salient environmental stimuli as well as those that are important for the generation of motivational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in other animal models, these receptor systems have been shown to directly interact at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlezon et al., 1998</xref>) as well as in the transition between motivational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chartoff et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is unknown if similar interactions occur in the regulation of pair bond maintenance. This study therefore endeavored to examine pair bond induced neural plasticity within the DA and dynorphin/KOR systems as well as how these systems interact to mediate the expression of selective aggression, a well established indicator of a fully established pair bond.</p><p>Given that activation of KORs is associated with aversive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mucha and Herz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pfeiffer et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shippenberg and Herz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bals-Kubik et al., 1989</xref>), we first determined if activation of NAc KORs prior to pairing with a novel social stimulus is sufficient to tag a recently encountered social stimulus as aversive. Next, to assess how the establishment of a pair bond alters both motivational (DA) and aversive (dynorphin/KOR) processing systems, we conducted extensive anatomical, neurochemical, and functional comparisons within the striatum of male and female prairie voles. In total, we conducted mRNA expression analysis (RT-qPCR), protein binding measurements (receptor autoradiography), and measures of DA concentration (fast-scan cyclic-voltammetry) to identify sex-specific alterations within the DA and dynorphin/KOR systems of pair bonded voles. We next utilized site-specific behavioral pharmacology to examine interactions between NAc shell D1-like and KORs in the expression of selective aggression. Finally, in male prairie voles, we show that pair bonding, but not other social manipulations, decreases the rewarding properties of the psychostimulant amphetamine and that this attenuation requires the activation of NAc shell KORs. In total, the present study demonstrates that the development of a pair bond is underpinned by sex-specific modifications in motivational (DA/D1) and valence (dynorphin/KOR) processing systems, that these systems interact to mediate selective aggression in both sexes, and that male specific alterations in the dynorphin/KOR system buffers against the rewarding properties of amphetamine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KORs within the NAc shell encode social aversion</title><p>Activation of NAc shell KORs is required for the expression of selective aggression by pair bonded voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>); however, the psychological processes that underlie the expression of this behavior are not well understood. In other rodent species, activation of these receptors has been shown to induce aversion as well as mediate avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Land et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>). For example, pairing of a previously neutral stimulus with either an aversive experience that results in KOR activation, such as stress, or with direct pharmacological activation of these receptors results in the avoidance of that stimulus during subsequent encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Land et al., 2008</xref>). Given the known relationship between aversive processing of environmental stimuli, avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boren et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">D'Amato et al., 1967</xref>), and KOR activation, we hypothesized that one mechanism in which NAc shell KORs mediate social avoidance behaviors is through the encoding of novel social stimuli as aversive.</p><p>To determine if activation of NAc shell KORs during a social encounter results in social avoidance behaviors, we utilized a modified version of the partner preference paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Specifically, we employed a social pairing condition (1 hr cohabitation with an opposite sex conspecific) that is insufficient to produce a preference for the familiar partner over an unfamiliar conspecific (the stranger). A lack of a preference for either social stimulus is indicated by equivalent amounts of time spent with the partner and stranger during the social choice test, suggesting that both social stimuli are of equal valences. As expected, a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for non-parametric data demonstrated that control males treated with aCSF did not show a preference for either individual (W<sub>(5)</sub> = 33, z = −0.97, p=0.33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Conversely, male subjects that were administered a KOR agonist (1 μg U50,488) into the NAc shell immediately prior to pairing with the female partner avoided the female that had been paired with KOR activation and therefore displayed a robust preference for contact with the novel female that had not been previously paired with NAc shell KOR (Wilcoxon signed rank sum test, W<sub>(6)</sub> = 32.5, z = -2.56, p=0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). In addition to differences in direct contact time, activation of NAc shell KORs prior to pairing with a social stimulus also resulted in differences in the duration of time spent in each stimulus chamber (two-way ANOVA, (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,36) </sub>= 7.07, p=0.003). Specifically, males that received administration of a KOR agonist avoided the chamber containing the partner (Bonferroni’s post hoc test, p=0.02) and spent more time in the chamber occupied by the stranger (p=0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Finally, control males and males receiving site-specific administration of the KOR agonistdid not differ in total contact time (time spent with partner + time spent with stranger) (t-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>(11)</sub> = 0.35, p=0.73), indicating that reduced contact with the partner did not result from a general decrease in motivation for social contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Both groups of male subjects also did not differ in affiliative social behavior or grooming behavior during the 1 hr cohabitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15325.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NAc shell KORs encode social aversion.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental design.

Given that activation of NAc shell KORs is required for the expression of selective aggression in pair bonded voles, it is possible that KOR activation within the NAc shell mediates pair bond maintenance by assigning social stimuli other than the mating partner with a negative valence signal. We therefore conducted our next series of experiments to determine how pair bonding alters neural systems involved in the regulation of selective aggression to promote pair bond maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pair bond induced alteration in mRNA expression within the ventral striatum</title><p>Sexually naïve prairie voles find social novelty rewarding and will readily approach and interact with novel conspecifics. In stark contrast, a pair bonded vole will avoid and aggressively reject this same social stimulus, suggesting that they find social stimuli—other than their mating partner or offspring—to be aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that this behavioral transformation is mediated by an up-regulation of neural systems that regulate the expression of selective aggression, such as both the D1-like receptor and dynorphin/KOR systems within the ventral region of the striatum. Thus, to determine if non-pair bonded (sibling housed) and pair bonded (2 weeks cohabitation with an opposite-sex conspecific) voles differ in the expression level of mRNA for genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of selective aggression, we utilized RT-qPCR to compare the level of mRNAs related to the DA and dynorphin/KOR systems. For all groups, comparisons were made within the dorsal and ventral striatum (i.e., NAc).</p><p>Extensive cohabitation with a mating partner predominately altered the expression of mRNA for genes that code for proteins associated with pair bond maintenance. Specifically, within the ventral striatum, t-test results show that pair bonded males and females showed higher levels of mRNA for the gene encoding dynorphin (<italic>Pdyn</italic>) (Male: t<sub>(24)</sub> = 2.26, p=0.03; t<sub>(26)</sub> = 3.05, p=0.005), the endogenous ligand for KORs.

For paired males, similar elevations in mRNA for the gene that encodes KOR (<italic>Oprk1</italic>) also occurred; however, due to high levels of variability in the expression of this gene, elevations in Oprk1 mRNA did not significantly differ from non-paired males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

male-female cohabitation were specific to genes that encode proteins involved in the regulation of pair bond maintenance, we also examined the expression of genes that encode proteins that regulate social behaviors associated with pair bond formation. Within the NAc, these proteins include D2-like DA receptors, mu-opioid receptors (MORs), and the oxytocin receptor. Following 2 weeks of male-female cohabitation, differences in the expression of genes related to pair bond formation (<italic>Drd2, Penk/Oprm1, Oxtr)</italic> were not found within the ventral striatum of pair bonded voles indicating that the differences identified above are specific to neural systems that regulate pair bond maintenance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Also in contrast to the above findings, sex-specific alterations in the expression of genes related to pair bond formation were identified within the dorsal striatum. Specifically, compared to non-paired subjects, pair bonded males had higher levels of <italic>Drd3</italic> mRNA (t-test; <italic>t</italic><sub>(26)</sub> = 2.34, p=0.03) while pair bonded females had higher levels of <italic>Drd2</italic> mRNA (t<italic>-</italic>test; <italic>t</italic><sub>(26)</sub> = 2.12, p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d</xref>). No other differences were identified within the dorsal striatum.</p><p>Overall, the above findings are consistent with the proposed mechanism that the establishment of a pair bond is associated with region specific alterations in neural systems that regulate selective aggression. However, an up-regulation in the expression of mRNA is not always indicative of an increase in protein levels. We therefore utilized receptor autoradiography to examine pair bond induced differences in KOR binding density within the striatum. We focused on KORs in the present study because it has previously been shown that pair bonding increases the expression of D1-like receptors specifically within the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sex specific alterations in KOR binding</title><p>To determine whether pair bonding alters striatal KOR density, KOR binding densities were compared between non-paired (i.e., same-sex sibling housed) and pair bonded prairie voles (i.e., 2 weeks male-female cohabitation) of both sexes.

These receptors are primarily of the low-affinity sub-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Richfield et al., 1989</xref>) and their activation requires high concentrations of DA to be released, such as that which occurs during burst firing of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gonon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cheer et al., 2007</xref>).

Specifically, although paired males are generally more aggressive than paired females, when aggression levels were further compared by fecundity classification, only males from optimally pregnant pairs showed significantly higher levels of selective aggression than females (Bonferroni’s post hoc test, optimally pregnant: p=0.01, sub-optimally pregnant: p&gt;0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Specifically, examination of DA release properties in relation to the pairs reproductive status revealed that only males from optimally pregnant pairs showed significantly greater elevations in NAc shell DA release compared to non-paired males (one-way ANOVA, <italic>F<sub>(</sub></italic><sub>3,39)</sub> = 0.29, p=0.05; Dunnett’s post hoc test, p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). In contrast to paired males, reproductive status did not influence NAc shell DA transmission dynamics of paired females (one-way ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,31)</sub> = 1.67, p=0.20). Rather, females of all reproductive categories (not pregnant, sub-optimally pregnant, or optimally pregnant) showed modest elevations in stimulated DA release compared to non-paired females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Thus, it is possible that sex-differences in the magnitude of change in NAc shell DA transmission dynamics results from paired females showing elevations in stimulated DA release regardless of reproductive status, whereas only males from optimally pregnant pairs (7 out of 22 total pairs) had enhanced DA transmission within the NAc shell.</p><p>To further explore the relationship between pair fecundity and NAc shell DA transmission dynamics, we next examined the relationship between neonatal weight and DA release. For paired males, the magnitude of stimulated DA release was positively correlated with neonatal weight, with fecundity accounting for nearly 30% of the variation (linear regression, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.29, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,20)</sub> = 8.16, p=0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Conversely, there was no relationship between fecundity and the magnitude of stimulated DA release within the NAc shell DA of paired females (linear regression, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.32, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,8)</sub> = 3.77, p=0.09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Together, these data suggest that reproductive status alters DA transmission within the NAc shell of paired voles in a sex-specific manner. Moreover, these effects are primarily localized to the NAc shell as paired voles categorized by their reproductive status did not differ in DA transmission dynamics within the NAc core or dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, it should be noted that despite a lack of overall differences in DA transmission within the dorsal striatum based on the categorization of pairs by pregnancy, a comparatively modest correlation between DA transmission and pregnancy was found within the dorsal striatum of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nonetheless, these data suggest that fecundity exerts sex-specific effects on DA transmission dynamics in pair bonded prairie voles. Given the identified relationship between fecundity and selective aggression and fecundity and DA transmission, we next examined if variations in DA transmission within the NAc shell contribute to variable levels of selective aggression in paired males.</p><p>Prior to measures of stimulated DA release, resident intruder test were administered to male and female subjects by placing a same-sex intruder into the test subjects home cage. Following the completion of behavioral testing, stimulated DA release was measured within the striatum and the frequency of attack behavior was quantified by an experimentally blind observer. These measures were subsequently utilized to assess the relationship between the magnitude of stimulated DA release and the degree of selective aggression displayed toward a resident intruder.</p><p>For pair bonded males, the intensity of aggression directed toward a resident intruder was positively correlated with NAc shell DA release, accounting for over 40% of the variation (linear regression, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.41, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,9)</sub> = 6.32, p=0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). In contrast, no relationship between NAc shell DA release and selective aggression was identified in paired females (linear regression, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.32, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,8)</sub> = 3.77, p=0.09) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Additionally, no relationship between stimulated DA release and attack frequency was found within other regions of the striatum for either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the relationship between stimulated DA release and attack behavior in pair bonded prairie behaviors occurs in a sex and region specific manner. When these data are considered in combination with site-specific pharmacology data demonstrating that activation of D1-like DA receptors specifically within the NAc shell is required for the expression of selective aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>), they suggest that the degree to which DA transmission dynamics are altered within the NAc shell of paired males may underlie fecundity induced modulation of pair bond strength. In other words, enhancement of DA release would facilitate the activation of low-affinity D1-like receptors, possibly leading to the display of higher levels of aggression by males from optimally pregnant pairs. Moreover, stimulation of D1-like receptors results in the production of dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Engber et al., 1992</xref>), the endogenous ligand for KORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chavkin et al., 1982</xref>) and activation of these receptors is also required for the expression of selective aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>).

The consistent requirement for higher doses of a KOR agonist to observe either a behavioral or physiological impact in prairie voles suggests potential value in comparing the genetic sequence of the prairie vole KOR to other species that have been used to study KOR pharmacology (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and humans). Indeed, the prairie vole KOR is distinct from the above-mentioned species as its genetic sequence diverges from that of rats and mice (whose KOR structure is quite homologous) as well as humans and guinea pigs (whose KORs also share substantial homologies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is also notable to mention that the prairie vole KOR is more similar to that of humans and guinea pigs than that of rats and mice in which most pharmacological studies have been conducted. In total, there are four amino acids that are unique to prairie voles, humans, and guinea pigs (Alanine 28, Serine 186, Aspartic acid 218, Aspartic acid 374), one amino acid that is unique to humans and prairie voles (Isoleucine 232), and fifteen amino acids that are unique to prairie voles, including one residue that is located in the dynorphin binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rasakham and Liu-Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that these genetic differences may partially account for species differences in KOR pharmacology and determining how ligands interact with the prairie vole KOR will be an important future area of study. Nevertheless, the above data demonstrate that activation of KORs within the prairie vole striatum produces the expected decreases in DA transmission.</p><p>We next compared KOR modulation of DA transmission within the NAc shell of non-bonded (sibling housed) and pair bonded (2 weeks cohabitation with a mating partner) prairie voles to determine if pair bond induced alterations in KOR protein binding within the NAc shell impact KOR modulation of DA transmission.

In contrast, D1-like receptor activation in the presence of KOR inactivation was insufficient to restore measures of selective aggression to levels of paired controls (Male attack frequency: planned contrast, post hoc: p=0.006; Female attack frequency: planned contrast, post hoc: p=0.008; Male attack latency: planned contrast, post hoc: p=0.001; Female attack latency; planned contrast, post hoc: p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d–g</xref>), further suggesting that KOR mediation of selective aggression is downstream of D1-like receptors.

We therefore first examined the impact of a rewarding regimen of AMPH (3 AMPH injections at 1-mg/kg across 3 days) on KOR binding in non-pair bonded prairie voles.

However, following extended cohabitation with a breeding partner and the full development of a pair bond, prairie voles aggressively reject novel conspecifics. In the present study, we critically extend current understanding of the neural mechanisms that mediate the transition to the pair bonded state by identifying neuroplasticity within the NAc shell that regulates the maintenance of monogamous bonds. Specifically, compared to non-paired subjects, pair bonded males and females have enhanced DA release potential within the NAc as well as an up-regulation of D1 receptor and dynorphin mRNA within this region. The functional significance of this pair bond induced plasticity was demonstrated with site-specific pharmacology as blockade of either one of these receptor systems attenuates the expression of pair bond maintenance. Moreover, while both sexes show some degree of mate guarding behavior, paired males are generally more aggressive than paired females and in the present study we provide the first mechanistic data to explain sex differences in the expression of selective aggression. Compared to females, pair bonded males exhibited additional neuroplasticity within the NAc as well as fecundity dependent alterations in DA transmission including: a positive correlation between DA release and pair fecundity, decreased binding of KORs, and enhanced KOR regulation over DA transmission. These more robust alterations within the NAc of males may partially explain why males show more intense mate guarding than females as well as the dependence of male mate guarding on fecundity. Finally, we also show that AMPH exposure alters KOR binding density within a sex-specific manner and that neuroplasticity within the dynorphin/KOR system of pair bonded males is critical for pair bond induced attenuation of drug reward. Together, the data presented in the present study reveal novel mechanisms underlying the maintenance of monogamous pair bonds as well as the neural protective effects of social bonding against drug reward.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neural and behavioral plasticity associated with pair bonding</title><p>A combination of comparative anatomical approaches and behavioral pharmacological studies has been utilized to identify neural mechanisms that underlie pair bond formation and maintenance in the socially monogamous prairie vole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2009</xref>). In regards to pair bond formation, the initial stages of bond development are mediated in part by D2-like, oxytocin, vassporessin, and mu-opioid receptors systems located within reward processing regions of the brain such as the striatum and the ventral pallidum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Insel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>). Interesting, following social conditioning procedures that promote the establishment of a pair bond, we did not identify alterations in the expression of mRNA for genes encoding D2-like, oxytocin, vasopressin, or mu-opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson and Young, 2015</xref>). One possible explanation of why a lack of an alteration in receptor systems associated with partner preference behavior was not observed in the present study is that a preference for social proximity is required in both the bonded and non-bonded state, while the emergence of an aversion towards social novelty is specific to the establishment of a pair bond and requires alterations in both social and motivational circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to neural systems that regulate pair bond formation, motivational and valence processing systems associated with pair bond maintenance undergo a dramatic overhaul during the transition from the naive to the pair bonded state. An important function of this alteration is to render pair bonded voles hyper aggressive toward novel conspecifics in order to achieve robust mate guarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>). As such, it is not surprising that neuroplasticity associated with pair bond development occurs within systems that mediate the expression of social behaviors associated with pair bond maintenance, DA/D1 and dynorphin/KOR systems and that these alterations occur specifically within the NAc shell, the striatal sub-region where these receptor systems act to mediate pair bond maintenance. Moreover, behavioral pharmacological data make evident the functional significance of these alterations by demonstrating that activation of KORs within the NAc shell of prairie voles mediates the assignment of negative social valence onto novel conspecifics, while blockade of either D1-like or KORs abolishes selective aggression. Together, these data support the working hypothesis that neuroplasticity within the NAc shell stabilizes established pair bonds by enhancing the perceived negative valence of novel social stimuli and the promotion of robust mate guarding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sex-specific alterations in motivational systems and behavior</title><p>In species where monogamous breeding systems have evolved, males will often engage in mate guarding behavior to prevent access of competitor males to the female partner, increasing the males opportunity for selective breeding as well as reducing the likelihood of uncertain paternity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trivers and Campbell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kleiman, 1977</xref>). While this breeding strategy is adaptive for some species, mate guarding behavior is intensely energetically costly given that a great deal of time must be spent maintaining proximity to the female and a high level of energy expended engaging in risky agonistic social encounters with competitor males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grafen and Ridley, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Getz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Crews and Moore, 1986</xref>). As a result, males can usually only successfully guard one female at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brotherton et al., 2003</xref>) and, to maximize reproductive fitness, it is adaptive for mate guarding behavior to emerge only after the establishment of a reproductively successful pair bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>). For the socially monogamous prairie vole, an indication of pair fecundity is indeed required for males to transition to the pair bonded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Curtis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>); yet the neural mechanisms that underlie this sex difference have remained elusive. In the present study, we provided the first proximal mechanistic data to explain how fecundity induced sex differences in selective aggression might arise.</p><p>Consistent with the theory that mate guarding in monogamous males serves to maximize reproductive fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trivers and Campbell, 1972</xref>), the present study demonstrates that the extent to which DA transmission was enhanced within the NAc shell of paired males was positively correlated with both pair fecundity as well as measures of selective aggression. Moreover, significant enhancements in NAc shell DA transmission only occurred in males from optimally pregnant pairs and males from these pairs also showed significantly higher levels of selective aggression. Thus, neuroplastic changes that are associated with the expression of selective aggression only occur in paired males when an adaptive benefit in defending the female partner has been established (i.e., when the benefit of defending the female outweighs the risk associated with aggressive conflict as well as predation risks that may occur when searching for a new mate).</p><p>In contrast to paired males, a relationship between alterations in DA transmission and pair fecundity were not identified in paired females, which is consistent with both field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rose and Gaines, 1976</xref>) and laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>) studies that have yet to identify a relationship between fecundity and mate guarding behavior in female prairie voles. One possible explanation for a lack of influence for fecundity on both neural and behavioral changes associated with pair bonding in females is a difference between males and females in the ultimate mechanisms that underlie the decision to bond with a partner. For instance, given that the reproductive status of the male is constant, whereas females require extended periods of contact with a male for sexual receptivity to be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter et al., 1987</xref>), it may be more beneficial for a female to increase the likelihood of reproductive success by remaining in contact with a male partner than to risk predation by searching for a new mate. Moreover, unlike males, female mammals do not risk exerting unnecessary energy raising offspring that are not their own if their male partner engages in extra-pair copulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trivers and Campbell, 1972</xref>). Thus, the risk to reward ratio for engaging in agonistic social encounters may not be as great for females and may also partially explain why females tend to be less aggressive overall than males. Together, sex differences in the adaptive value of mate guarding as well as sex differences in temporal and environmental factors that regulate reproductive activation between males and females may partially underlie known sex differences in the intensity of selective aggression as well as behavioral and neural neuroplasticity associated with the transition to the bonded state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sub-region specific alterations in male NAc shell KOR binding</title><p>Increasing evidence suggests that anatomical and functional heterogeneity occurs within the shell region of the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peciña and Berridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Resendez and Aragona, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Richard et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, it has been demonstrated that heterogeneity in the valence coding properties of the dynorphin/KOR system is anatomically segregated within the NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Castro and Berridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, the release of dynorphin into the dorso-medial region of NAc shell and the subsequent activation of KOR induces positive hedonics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Castro and Berridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>), while the release of dynorphin into the ventral NAc shell induces aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, pair bonding altered the binding density of male NAc shell KORs in a sub-region specific manner that maps onto the topographical organizational of the aversive coding properties of the dynorphin/KOR system. Pair bonding down-regulated KOR binding within the ventral region of the NAc shell, while leaving KOR binding within the dorso-medial and lateral regions of the NAc shell unaltered. Thus, pair bonding altered KOR binding only in the sub-region of the NAc shell where activation of these receptors acts to encode aversion.</p><p>One possible mechanism underlying the sub-region specific influence of the dynorphin/KOR system on valence coding may be due to anatomical heterogeneity in the downstream projection targets of the dorso-medial and ventral regions of the NAc shell. In general, downstream projection targets from the afferents of cell bodies originating in the dorsomedial region of the NAc shell are more widespread than those originating from cell bodies located in the ventral region of the NAc shell. For cell bodies located in the dorso-medial NAc shell, the highest density of afferents are located in the medial region of the ventral pallidum (VP), the lateral preoptic area, and the lateral hypothalamus with sparser fiber labeling occurring within the lateral septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the anterior hypothalamus, the medial preoptic area, and rostral portion of the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zahm et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the ventral region of the NAc shell varies from the dorso-medial region of the NAc shell in both the number and specific brain regions it projects to. While the dorso-medial NAc shell sends dense projections to the medial region of the VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</xref>), the ventral region of the NAc shell projects specifically to the lateral region of the VP and also sends sparser projections to the lateral preoptic area and rostral-caudal extent of the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zahm et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that although the release of dynorphin and the subsequent activation of NAc shell KORs has the potential to reduce dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission throughout the entire dorsal-ventral axis of the NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hjelmstad and Fields, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Britt and McGehee, 2008</xref>), the sum of the influence on downstream neuronal networks has the potential to vary greatly between the two sub-regions.</p><p>One notable downstream projection target that is unique to the ventral NAc shell is the lateral region of the VP. The lateral VP is an important brain region for reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cromwell and Berridge, 1993</xref>) and is innervated by NAc shell medium spiny neurons that primarily express Gi-coupled D2-like DA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gerfen and Young, 1988</xref>). Thus, KOR-mediated reductions in DA within the ventral NAc shell would increase the activity of GABAeregic medium spiny neurons that project to the lateral VP, resulting in the inhibition of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonci and Carlezon, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, reduced activity has been observed directly within the VP following exposure to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Itoga et al., 2016</xref>) as well as an increase in activity within brain nuclei that receive input specifically from GABAergic neurons located within the lateral region of VP. Of specific interest is the relief of inhibition of the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a brain nucleus that is downstream of the VP and has been indicated in aversive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yashoshima et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to the ventral NAc shell, reductions in DA specifically within the dorso-medial region of the NAc shell would cause a decrease in the activity of the PVT through inhibition of glutamatergic afferents from the LH that project to the PVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Thompson and Swanson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zahm et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the ventral NAc shell → lateral VP → PVT circuit may be one mechanism in which site-specific modulation of NAc shell KORs contributes to aversive coding, while the dorso-medial NAc shell → LH → PVT circuit may contribute to positive valence coding by NAc KORs. However, more work is necessary to determine how topographical organization of NAc shell contributes to opposing modulation of valence coding and the subsequent divergent responses on motivated behavioral states, such as approach versus avoidance behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Interactions between D1-like and KORs mediate pair bond maintenance</title><p>Complex behaviors often require interactions between multiple neural systems. Indeed, studies of pair bond formation show that partner preferences require concurrent activation of D2-like and OT receptors within the NAc shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu and Wang, 2003</xref>) as well as V1a receptor activation within the VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2004</xref>). These previous studies argued that peptide systems are necessary for social recognition, while DA transmission is important for reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson and Young, 2015</xref>). In the present study, we expand our current understanding of neural mechanisms involved in the regulation of pair bond behavior by demonstrating that interactions between opioid peptides, such as the dynorphin/KOR system, and DA transmission within the NAc may act to couple valence processing systems within motivational circuitry. Consistent with the theory that interactions between these systems mediate pair bond induced transitions in the valence encoding of novel social stimuli, previous studies of drug reward have demonstrated that interactions between DA/D1 and dynorphin/KOR systems mediate the propensity for previously rewarding stimuli to be processed as aversive. Specifically, stimulation of D1-like receptors phosphorylates cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to induce the expression and release of dynorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlezon et al., 1998</xref>), resulting in the valence encoding of a psychostimulant to be reversed from rewarding to aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pliakas et al., 2001</xref>). Together, these data suggest that alterations in the activity and, subsequently, interactions between DA and dynorphin/KOR systems play a critical role in experience mediated plasticity in reward processing.</p><p>While it is known that activity within the dynorphin/KOR system plays a critical role in reward processing, the mechanism in which this system modulates the encoding of reward is not well understood. One hypothesized mechanism in which the dynorphin/KOR is thought to negatively impact motivation and reward processing is through its ability to robustly decrease dopaminergic transmission within the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shippenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlezon and Thomas, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, interactions between these systems were augmented following the establishment of a pair bond in male, but not female, prairie voles. Given that paired bonded males are the more aggressive sex and that paired males also incur greater reproductive costs if their mate engages in extra-pair copulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that paired males show a greater aversion to social novelty and this enhanced aversion may be mediated by augmented coupling between DA and dynorphin/KORs within the NAc. While more work is necessary to determine the exact mechanism in which NAc KORs mediate the expression of sex differences in selective aggression, the present study nonetheless provides an interesting example of how the dynorphin/KOR system modulates reward and motivation to promote ethologically relevant behavioral adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Neuroprotective effects of pair bonding on drug reward</title><p>Addiction is a debilitating disorder that is characterized in part by chronic relapse, and, while pharmacological treatments continue to be sought for the treatment of this disorder, many have been ineffective in sustaining drug abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fattore and Diana, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, there is compelling evidence that a preventative approach, focused on neural adaptations resulting from the formation and maintenance of positive social relationships, may offer positive benefits to psychological well being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Feldman, 2015</xref>). For example, in drug-addicted humans, the presence of positive social support reduces the propensity for relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Creswell et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that positive social experience, such as bonding, may wire the brain in a manner that reduces future drug seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Young et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, despite the demonstrated positive benefit for social bonding on mental health, the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between social bonding and drug taking have not been extensively studied. The scarcity of studies examining this relationship is likely related to a lack of animal models that exhibit both the propensity for social bonding and drug taking behavior.</p><p>The socially monogamous prairie vole offers an excellent animal model in which to study the relationship between drug and social reward because, unlike most mammals, they form selective social attachments to their mating partner. Importantly, as demonstrated in the present study, the establishment of a pair bond, but not mere social exposure or mating, is required for social bonding to exert protective effects against AMPH reward. The specificity of the establishment of a social bond to the neural protection against drug reward is likely related to the fact that the establishment of a pair bond alters the brain in a manner in which other social experiences do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith and Wang, 2014</xref>). Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated that activation of neural systems that mediate pair bond maintenance (NAc D1-like receptors), but not those that mediate pair bond formation (NAc D2-like receptors), are required for pair bond induced protection against drug reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we extended these previous findings by demonstrating that, for male prairie voles, activation of NAc shell KORs is required for pair bond induced attenuation of AMPH reward. Given that drugs that act at the dynorphin/KOR system are currently under intense investigation as potential therapeutics for the treatment of addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlezon and Miczek, 2010</xref>) and that pair bonding induces neural plasticity within this system to result in an attenuation in drug reward, there may be considerable therapeutic value in understanding the neural mechanisms in which social experiences alter reward circuitry to buffer against drug reward. Finally, data presented in the present study also provide support for the consideration of socially related cognitive therapies when developing future treatment regimens for the treatment of addiction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Future considerations for how interactions between the D1-like dopamine receptor system and the dynorphin/KOR system mediate pair bond maintenance</title><p>Following the establishment of a pair bond, male prairie voles show an enhancement in KOR-agonist induced decreases in stimulated DA within the NAc shell, despite having an overall reduction in KOR binding density within this region. Given the presumption that a reduction in receptor number would also reduce the efficacy of an agonist to produce the measured physiological response, these findings appear to contradict one another. However, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRS), including KORs, are dynamic proteins that can adopt multiple conformational states, resulting in variability in ligand binding affinity as well as efficacy of the receptor to activate distinct downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruchas and Chavkin, 2010</xref>). For example, G proteins have been shown to pre-couple with receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nobles et al., 2005</xref>) and this coupling can lead to conformational changes in the extracellular portion of the receptor that enhance affinity of the ligand for the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the percent of G protein receptor coupling can vary as a function of receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, under certain physiological conditions, it is possible for receptor coupling efficiencies to be enhanced, resulting in a fewer number of receptors to be required for an agonist to produce the maximal biological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kenakin, 2002</xref>).</p><p>With binding of the agonist, changes in conformational state of the receptor can also be induced, to increase affinity of the G protein to the receptor. In addition, GPCRS can engage a diverse array of signaling pathways in a manner that is dependent on the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">White et al., 2014</xref>), cellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan et al., 2008</xref>), as well as lipid membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nygaard et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, there are wide variety of dynamic receptor states that can influence functional interactions between the ligand and the receptor as well as the receptor and its G protein. Future research is therefore necessary to determine if, in addition to pair bond induced changes in striatal KOR expression patterns, if KOR mediated signaling properties also vary as a function of social state as well as the potential for such alterations to influence DA transmission dynamics.

The 3 hr test was recorded and later scored by an experimentally blind observer for the duration of time spent in side-by-side contact with either the partner or stranger.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Resident-intruder tests</title><p>1 hr prior to resident-intruder testing, subjects received site-specific infusions of one of the following treatment groups: aCSF, 10 ng SCH 23,390 (D1 receptor antagonist), 10 ng SCH 23,390 and 1 μg U50,488, or 0.4 ng SKF 38,393 (D1 receptor agonist) and 500 μg norBNI (KOR antagonist) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>). 1 hr after drug infusion, the subject was placed in its home cage (in isolation) and its behavior was recorded for 10 min, allowing time for acclimation to the testing environment and the assessment of locomotor activity. Locomotor activity was assessed by counting the number of cage crosses made during the 10-min habituation period. Next, a same-sex stimulus animal was introduced to the subject’s home cage and behavioral interactions were recorded for 10 min. Resident-intruder tests were scored for the frequency of aggressive behaviors (offensive rears, lunges, bites, and chase frequency). The latency to engage in agonistic behavior was determined by the first time point in which an aggressive encounter occurred. If an aggressive encounter was not observed during the testing period, an attack latency of 10 min was applied. Affiliative behavior was assessed by quantifying the sum of the duration of time that the test subject spent investigating and in side-by-side contact with the intruder.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Conditioned place preference</title><p>A non-biased conditioned place preference assay was used to assess the rewarding properties of 1 mg/kg of amphetamine, a dose that has been shown to reliably elicit a preference for the drug paired compartment in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragona et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). A pre-test was conducted on day 1 of conditioning to determine if the test subject had a bias for either side of the chamber. Test subjects that showed a robust preference for either chamber (greater than 67% of the pre-test) were excluded from the study. On the following 3 days, subjects were administered saline in the preferred chamber and 1 mg/kg AMPH the non-preferred chamber and placed in the chamber for 40 min. The order of injections was counterbalanced between subjects and treatments were administered 6 hr apart. On day five of testing, a preference for the amphetamine paired chamber was determined by placing the subject in the apparatus and allowing it to freely roam either compartment for 30 min.</p><p>To determine how social conditioning impacts AMPH reward, male subjects were placed in one of several housing conditions: sibling housed, housed with a novel male, house with an OVX female, or housed with an intact female. To determine if alterations in KOR binding contribute to the protective effects of pair bonding against drug reward, non-paired or paired subjects received either peripheral administration of saline or 50 mg/kg nor-BNI dissolved in sterile saline on day 1 of conditioning. To determine if the impact of KORs on drug reward processing was specific to the NAc shell, test subjects received site-specific microinfusions of either aCSF or 500 μg nor-BNI into the NAc shell on day 1 of conditioning. These doses were chosen because they have previously been shown to reduce selective aggression in male prairie voles without altering locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>).

To examine the effect of pair bonding on KOR binding density, subjects were either paired with a novel female for two weeks or remained housed with a same-sex sibling. To determine the effects of AMPH exposure on KOR binding density, striatal slices from male prairie voles receiving either control injections of saline or injections of 1 mg/kg AMPH for three days were also processed for KOR autoradiography. Follow the completion of either social or drug exposure, subjects were sacrificed via rapid decapitation 24 hrs following the last day of pairing (for the pair bonding manipulation) or the final injection (for the AMPH manipulation). Brains were removed, immediately frozen on powdered dry ice, and stored at −80ºC until sectioning. A cryostat was used to section the brain into a 1:4 series at 20 μM. Sections were directly mounted onto glass slides and stored at −80°C until time of assay.</p><p>Autoradiography for KORs was conducted with <sup>3</sup>H U-69,593 radioligands (Perkin Elmer, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>). On the day of the assay, slides were thawed at room temperature (RT) until dry and fixed in 0.1% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4; 2 min).

Next, slides were washed in 50 mM Tris containing 0.2% MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 5 min at 4°C (4 washes) then for 30 min at RT (1 wash). Slides were briefly dipped in nanopure H<sub>2</sub>O, allowed to dry at RT and then exposed to BAS Imaging Plates (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 2 weeks. All plates were scanned on the BAS-5000 plate reader using BAS-5000 Image Reader software (Version 1.8). Binding densities were determined with region of interest analysis using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>FSCV</title><p>Following rapid, live decapitation, brains were quickly extracted, immediately submerged in cold, pre-oxygenated high sucrose aCSF consisting of 180 mM sucrose, 30 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM D-Glucose in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O (pH 7.4), and sectioned into coronal slices (400 μm) containing the DS, the NAc core, and the NAc shell.

Therefore, each group contains at least 6–8 subjects. Consistent with established standards in the literature, we used at least 6 subjects for mRNA and receptor autoradiography experiments and at least 3 subjects for slice FSCV experiments, with multiple samples taken per slice. For most experiments, comparisons were made between biological replicates, i.e., comparisons between treatment groups receiving a pharmacological manipulation or between different social conditions. For FSCV experiments, both biological and technical replicates, i.e., repeated measurements from the same coronal slice under identical preparations were also made. To determine whether the data were normally distributed and equivalent in variance, we examined boxplots for each group. In cases where boxplots revealed that the data were not normally distributed or there was a lack of equal variance among groups, nonparametric tests were used. Statistical significance was assessed with either a t-test, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA. An alpha level was set at p≤0.05 for all statistical analysis. All analysis were performed in SPSS version 21 for Windows.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NSF Grant 0953106 and Office of Vice President Research Grant (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) to BJA SLR is supported by the North Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities (T32 HD040127).

Similarly, the Results section is written in a distracting conversational style that obscures the point.</p><p>Results (second paragraph) &quot;activation of NAc shell KORs&quot; is very vague. Neither the drug nor dose is specified in the paragraph or figure legend. &quot;KOR treated&quot; is sloppy phrasing. The choice of BRL 5237 as the kappa agonist needs to be better justified and citations supporting claims of receptor selectivity need to be provided. Many more studies use the U compounds, thus the choice of BRL makes it more difficult to compare these findings with others. Because the vole kappa receptor is genetically distinct from rat and mouse, the agonist specificity of BRL needs to be verified by antagonist controls, and cannot be assumed. &quot;strangest effects expected to occur in the ventral striatum.&quot; is an unfortunate typo.</p><p>It is troubling that the significance of the differences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is driven by the variance, not the magnitude of the difference. Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seem largely descriptive and no strong conclusions are drawn.</p><p>The dose-response curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, F, G</xref> are not optimally clear. First, it's not clear whether the hydrochloride' salt needs to be specified. Second the concentration units (μM?) are not labeled in either the axis or in the insets (F &amp; G).</p><p>The authors state, &quot;The slope of the dose response curve also significantly differed between paired and non-paired males (t test; t(6) = 3.74, p = 0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).&quot; (actually <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the confidence intervals of the EC50s should be presented. Second, the interpretation of the change in slope is not explained. Typically, DR slopes more shallow than predicted by mass-action kinetics result from drug interaction with a high and low affinity site. The increase in slope may have been caused by the inactivation of a high affinity site. How do the authors interpret this change?</p><p>The experiments seem to have loose and superficial connections. The conclusions are plausible, but alternative interpretations are not excluded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The title strongly emphasizes motivation and valence processing systems, as opposed to the dopamine and k-opioid systems. I don't think it's justified to put these psychological terms in the title when they are not the direct focus of the paper. For instance, dopamine plays a role in a great deal more than motivation, and the manuscript is not particularly focused on differentiating motivation from learning or reward.</p><p>2) The experiment &quot;Social reward impairs AMPH-induced place conditioning&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) divides subjects into a number of groups based on social stimulus. However, there is a major problem with these groups. Five of the groups are experimenter-controlled (Sibling saline, Sibling AMPH, novel male AMPH, OVX female AMPH, intact female AMPH), but the last of these (intact female AMPH) was sub-divided into three self-selected groups (not pregnant, suboptimal, optimal). Mixing experimenter-controlled groups with self-selected groups turns the entire experiment into a quasiexperiment, with additional caveats due to lack of experimental control. The authors are strongly advised to subdivide the intact female AMPH group only for post-hoc analysis purposes. The same results and conclusions are likely to be justified.</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors draw conclusions about sex-specific effects without having included males and females in the same statistical analysis. Examples: <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; the sex difference between bonding-induced elevations in DA release; etc. In most cases, males and females should be combined into a single analysis (mostly by adding a factor to the ANOVA, or using ANOVA instead of t-test) to show sex effects (both main effects and interactions), which should also strengthen the ability to see sex-independent effects.</p><p>3) In several places, the authors relied on t-tests to describe their data when ANOVAs would have been more appropriate. Examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> calls for a two-way ANOVA, and the main effect of drug from that ANOVA would provide the same information as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; the genetic analysis from <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1 and 2</xref> should have been done with a multivariate ANOVA with post-hoc tests; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3 and 4</xref>, same; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref> could be replaced by an ANOVA comparing the two curves.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Prairie voles pair bond with their mating partners and are an important model for studying the neurobiology of social attachment behavior. Resendez et al. have performed a series of studies to understand how signaling through D1-like dopamine receptor (<italic>Drd1</italic>-like) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) influence pair bonds under a variety of behavioral paradigms, including social familiarity preference, mate guarding, and buffering of preference for amphetamine. These behavioral and pharmacological studies are tied in with analysis of dopamine release in acute slices using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Despite these impressive wide-ranging studies, no clear picture emerges as to how and where these two signaling systems interact to control pair bonding. This lack of mechanistic insight diminishes my enthusiasm.</p><p>I am also puzzled by some of the results. For example, KOR activation leads to preference for an unfamiliar vole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as well as mate guarding or attacking a non-partner, unfamiliar conspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). How is this to be reconciled? Similarly, KOR binding is reduced in pair bonded voles but activation of KOR reduces dopamine release in these voles. The most parsimonious explanation is that these signaling systems are regulating pair bonding at multiple points in the circuit and also regulating other behaviors. Until these are resolved I don't see how firm conclusions can be drawn.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15325.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>While there is general enthusiasm for this paper, there are a number of issues raised by the three reviewers that are difficult to condense into a specific set of essential revisions.

Many more studies use the U compounds, thus the choice of BRL makes it more difficult to compare these findings with others. Because the vole kappa receptor is genetically distinct from rat and mouse, the agonist specificity of BRL needs to be verified by antagonist controls, and cannot be assumed.</italic></p><p>While we agree with the reviewer that more work is necessary to understand the differences in KOR pharmacology between prairie voles and other commonly studied species, this specific area of research was not the primary focus of the present study and would require extensive follow up studies that are beyond the scope of the submitted manuscript. The KOR agonist, BRL 5237, was chosen based on a previous study that utilized FSCV in striatal slice preparations collected from rats to examine KOR modulation of DA release within the NAc shell. This study identified a significant reduction in stimulated dopamine release following a 1μM bath application of BRL 5237 (Britt &amp; McGehee, 2008). We included this dose, in addition to others, in our studies to show that a significant reduction in stimulated dopamine release within the nucleus shell of prairie voles required a much higher dose of this agonist. This study also utilized a KOR antagonist to show that the drug is specific to KOR receptors under these conditions. Although other studies since this publication have utilized the U50, 488 KOR agonist in combination with FSCV in striatal slice preparations, when we initially began our studies, many of these papers had not yet been published and we therefore chose the BRL 5237 KOR agonist to allow us to compare our results to other previously published findings. Additionally, in a previous publication, we conducted extensive behavioral pharmacological comparisons utilizing the U50,488 agonist to show that a much higher dose of the KOR antagonist, nor-BNI, was required to block the locomotor and analgesic effects produced by U50,488 in both male and female prairie voles. Thus, the necessity for higher doses of drugs that act at the KOR in this species is consistent across multiple pharmacological compounds as well as both in vivo and in vitro measures. Finally, although our genetic analysis shows that the prairie vole KOR differs from that of rats, mice, humans, as well as guinea pigs, it also shows that the prairie vole KOR is more similar to that of guinea pigs and humans than that of rats and mice. Importantly, the pharmacological compounds utilized in the present study have been shown to be specific in guinea pigs and humans despite having some differences in pharmacological properties of the drugs when compared to rats and mice. See the second paragraph of the subsection “Pair bonding alters KOR regulation of DA transmission in a sex-specific manner” for the amino acids in which the prairie vole KOR differs from other species.</p><p><italic>&quot;strangest effects expected to occur in the ventral striatum.&quot; is an unfortunate typo.</italic></p><p>This typo has been corrected.</p><p><italic>It is troubling that the significance of the differences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is driven by the variance, not the magnitude of the difference. Results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> seem largely descriptive and no strong conclusions are drawn.</italic></p><p>We appreciate this comment. The RT-qPCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that in both males and females, pair housing increased the expression of <italic>Pdyn</italic> as well as <italic>Drd1</italic> mRNA within the ventral, but not dorsal, striatum. These significant increases are largely due to the size of the effect, since the variance in expression of these genes is similar between groups. However, as the reviewer points out, there are other transcripts (<italic>Penk</italic> and <italic>Oprk1</italic>) that exhibited a similar magnitude of difference between groups. Yet differences between these groups did not meet the criteria for statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) due to a larger amount of variability. The specific p values for all non-significant comparisons can be found within <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> of the manuscript.</p><p>It is important to note that for each sample, RT-qPCR reactions were completed in triplicate and normalized to housekeeping genes as a within-sample control. Additionally, we only observed this degree of variability at these genes, and only in the ventral striatum. Together, this suggests that the variability in measured expression of these genes is biological rather than technical in nature. We interpret these results to indicate that any potential changes in the expression of these genes following pair bonding were not consistent across animals within a group. Finally, while larger sample sizes may be sufficient to detect these more variable effects, we note that the samples sizes used in the present study are more than adequate for this type of experiment, and also that the lack of change in these genes is in no way an essential component of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>The dose-response curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, F, G</xref> are not optimally clear. First, it's not clear whether the hydrochloride' salt needs to be specified. Second the concentration units (uM?) are not labeled in either the axis or in the insets (F &amp; G).</italic></p><p>We have removed hydrochloride from the label. The concentration units (μM) have been added to the figure.</p><p><italic>The authors state, &quot;The slope of the dose response curve also significantly differed between paired and non-paired males (t test; t(6) = 3.74, p = 0.009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).&quot; (actually <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the confidence intervals of the EC50s should be presented. Second, the interpretation of the change in slope is not explained. Typically, DR slopes more shallow than predicted by mass-action kinetics result from drug interaction with a high and low affinity site. The increase in slope may have been caused by the inactivation of a high affinity site. How do the authors interpret this change?</italic></p><p>A table including the 95% confidence interval of the IC50s has been included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Given that a lower dose of the KOR agonist was needed to produce a 50% decrease in stimulated DA release in pair bonded prairie voles and that this group also had a reduction in KOR binding, we think it is unlikely that changes in slope are related to inactivation of a high affinity binding site because this would result in a reduction in agonist potency. Differences in the shape of the concentration response curve may also reflect mechanistic differences in the binding of the drug and/or in activation of downstream signaling targets. Given that the goal of the experiment was to examine differences in interactions between the DA/and KOR system between pair bonded and non-pair bonded prairie voles, we were not able to determine possible mechanistic differences in KOR function between these two groups in the present study. For this reason, we do not think it is appropriate to discuss possible mechanistic differences in the Results section, but have included such information in the Discussion section “Future considerations for how interactions between the D1-like dopamine receptor system and the dynorphin/KOR system mediate pair bond maintenance”).</p><p><italic>The experiments seem to have loose and superficial connections.

I don't think it's justified to put these psychological terms in the title when they are not the direct focus of the paper. For instance, dopamine plays a role in a great deal more than motivation, and the manuscript is not particularly focused on differentiating motivation from learning or reward.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have therefore rewritten the title as, “Dopamine and opioid systems interact within the nucleus accumbens to maintain monogamous pair bonds<bold>”</bold></p><p><italic>2) The experiment &quot;Social reward impairs AMPH-induced place conditioning&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) divides subjects into a number of groups based on social stimulus. However, there is a major problem with these groups. Five of the groups are experimenter-controlled (Sibling saline, Sibling AMPH, novel male AMPH, OVX female AMPH, intact female AMPH), but the last of these (intact female AMPH) was sub-divided into three self-selected groups (not pregnant, suboptimal, optimal). Mixing experimenter-controlled groups with self-selected groups turns the entire experiment into a quasiexperiment, with additional caveats due to lack of experimental control. The authors are strongly advised to subdivide the intact female AMPH group only for post-hoc analysis purposes. The same results and conclusions are likely to be justified.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have recombined the data for all pair housed subjects into one group (regardless of pregnancy status of the pair) to be analyzed in a one-way ANOVA. Indeed, when data for paired subjects were combined into a single group (pair housed), the overall group data exhibited protective effects against the rewarding properties of amphetamine. Data were subsequently separated for further comparison to show that within the pair housed group, only males whose females became pregnant during the two-week pairing period exhibited protective effects against the rewarding properties of amphetamine (subsection “D1-like and KORs interact to mediate selective aggression”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors draw conclusions about sex-specific effects without having included males and females in the same statistical analysis. Examples: <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1 &amp; 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; the sex difference between bonding-induced elevations in DA release; etc. In most cases, males and females should be combined into a single analysis (mostly by adding a factor to the ANOVA, or using ANOVA instead of t-test) to show sex effects (both main effects and interactions), which should also strengthen the ability to see sex-independent effects.</italic></p><p>To provide direct comparisons between the sexes, additional analyses were conducted on the data when possible. Specifically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows analysis for sex differences in KOR binding density (subsection “Sex specific alterations in KOR binding”, last paragraph) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows analysis for sex differences in pair bond induced alterations in dopamine transmission (subsection “Pair bond induced enhancement of DA release”, first paragraph), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> shows sex differences in the influence of fecundity on selective aggression (subsection “Pair fecundity influences DA transmission dynamics in a sexually dimorphic manner”, second paragraph), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> supplement shows sex differences in pair bond induced alterations in KOR modulation of dopamine transmission (subsection “Pair bonding alters KOR regulation of DA transmission in a sex-specific manner”, fourth paragraph), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> supplement shows sex differences in amphetamine induced alterations in KOR binding density (subsection “Amphetamine-induced neuroplasticity mimics that of pair bonding”, last paragraph).</p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to conduct such analysis on the mRNA data because all data were normalized to a control gene that was processed in parallel with samples from paired and non-paired subjects of each sex to account for small differences in RNA that go into the reaction as well as the efficiency of the cDNA synthesis. Due to the large number of samples that were used for analysis in this study, data from male and female subjects had to be processed separately at different time points and it would therefore not be ideal to combine these data sets for analysis.</p><p><italic>3) In several places, the authors relied on t-tests to describe their data when ANOVAs would have been more appropriate.

Resendez et al. have performed a series of studies to understand how signaling through D1-like dopamine receptor (Drd1-like) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) influence pair bonds under a variety of behavioral paradigms, including social familiarity preference, mate guarding, and buffering of preference for amphetamine. These behavioral and pharmacological studies are tied in with analysis of dopamine release in acute slices using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. Despite these impressive wide-ranging studies, no clear picture emerges as to how and where these two signaling systems interact to control pair bonding. This lack of mechanistic insight diminishes my enthusiasm.</italic></p><p><italic>I am also puzzled by some of the results. For example, KOR activation leads to preference for an unfamiliar vole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as well as mate guarding or attacking a non-partner, unfamiliar conspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). How is this to be reconciled?</italic></p><p>While we agree with the reviewer that it is not possible to definitively conclude that a preference for the unfamiliar partner was formed versus avoidance of the familiar partner, we think that given the sum of our data, it is more likely that pairing a social stimulus with KOR activation produces avoidance behavior. Moreover, even in the case that a preference was formed for the unfamiliar social stimulus, this preference would still require that the familiar partner that was paired with KOR activation to be avoided. Finally, it is well established that animals will avoid stimuli that have previously been paired with an aversive experience and our study design employed similar conditioning procedures. Specifically, prior to pairing with a female partner, males were administered either aCSF or a KOR agonist into the NAc shell. After the one-hr pairing, males were then given the option to choose to spend time in contact with the familiar female partner or a novel stranger. Males who were administered a KOR agonist immediately prior to pairing avoided the female partner that had been paired with KOR activation suggesting that activation of KOR while in the presence of a social stimulus results in the stimulus to be encoded as aversive and avoided. This finding is similar to previous research showing that pairing an odorant with either stress or KOR activation can result in the avoidance of that odorant (Landet al., 2008).</p><p><italic>Similarly, KOR binding is reduced in pair bonded voles but activation of KOR reduces dopamine release in these voles. The most parsimonious explanation is that these signaling systems are regulating pair bonding at multiple points in the circuit and also regulating other behaviors. Until these are resolved I don't see how firm conclusions can be drawn.</italic></p><p>This is another important point that has been brought up by the reviewer. Although the data appear to be conflicting, much evidence supports that GPCRs are capable of behaving in a dynamic nature that can vary by ligand binding, receptor density, lipid membrane properties, G protein coupling, as well as the specific downstream signaling cascade that is engaged. While we agree that figuring the mechanism underlying how enhanced reduction of dopamine transmission occurs in pair bonded males despite this group also showing a reduction in KOR binding, this would require extensive amounts of follow up experiments that our beyond the main focus of this paper. Here, our main goal was to determine if interactions between D1-like receptors and KORs mediate the maintenance of monogamous social bonds and future experiments will be required to figure out the mechanism of this interaction. We have highlighted this issue in the Discussion section and added an additional section entitled, “Future considerations for how interactions between the D1-like dopamine receptor system and the dynorphin/KOR system mediate pair bond maintenance” to address this important future area of research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
