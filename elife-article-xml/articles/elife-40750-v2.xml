precipitate a rapid shift from healthy to ictal activity remain unclear. Furthermore, the diversity of inhibitory interneuron populations poses a challenge for understanding local circuit interactions during seizure initiation. Using a combined optogenetic and electrophysiological approach, we examined the activity of identified mouse hippocampal interneuron classes during chemoconvulsant seizure induction in vivo. Surprisingly, synaptic inhibition from parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons remained intact throughout the preictal period and early ictal phase. However, these two sources of inhibition exhibited cell-type-specific differences in their preictal firing patterns and sensitivity to input. Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is not associated with loss of firing by these interneurons or a failure of synaptic inhibition but is instead linked with disruptions of the respective roles these interneurons play in the hippocampal circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seizure</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin</kwd><kwd>somatostatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miri</surname><given-names>Mitra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000010</institution-id><institution>Ford Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miri</surname><given-names>Mitra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Frontiers</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinck</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rubicon Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinck</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardin</surname><given-names>Jessica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

One mechanism of such an imbalance may be a transient loss of GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziburkus et al., 2006</xref>). Acute blockade of GABA receptors rapidly initiates seizure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose and Blakemore, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Treiman, 2001</xref>), suggesting the necessity of synaptic inhibition to maintain healthy activity patterns. Previous work has also highlighted the potential preictal contribution of excitatory GABAergic effects due to Cl- accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cossart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miles et al., 2012</xref>) or loss of inhibition due to depletion of GABAergic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Interneuron firing may also transiently cease during ictal events as a result of depolarization block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziburkus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cammarota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Nykamp, 2017</xref>). Developmental dysregulation of inhibitory interneurons causes chronic epileptic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lau et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rossignol et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tai et al., 2014</xref>), and interneurons also appear to be particularly sensitive to seizure-related damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sloviter, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Lanerolle et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robbins et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rice et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gibbs et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cossart et al., 2001</xref>). However, the circuit mechanisms underlying seizure initiation in vivo and the specific role of GABAergic interneurons remain largely unknown.</p><p>Work from in vitro and in vivo animal models has suggested that different neural populations may have distinct and complex patterns of preictal activity during seizure initiation. Putative interneurons in multiple hippocampal regions are reported to exhibit increases and/or decreases in firing rates prior to seizure initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grasse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toyoda et al., 2015</xref>). In vitro recordings during seizure-like events further suggest interleaved bursts of firing by interneurons and excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziburkus et al., 2006</xref>). In the cortex, fast-spiking, putative inhibitory interneurons may exhibit enhanced preictal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timofeev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gnatkovsky et al., 2008</xref>), but recent work using population imaging largely observed increased activity following seizure onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khoshkhoo et al., 2017</xref>). Putative fast-spiking interneurons in human cortex may also exhibit increased preictal firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Truccolo et al., 2011</xref>). In comparison, previous work has largely found increased preictal firing of putative excitatory hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cymerblit-Sabba and Schiller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiruska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujita et al., 2014</xref>), but several reports have highlighted mixed populations, with some neurons increasing and some decreasing firing prior to seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bower and Buckmaster, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toyoda et al., 2015</xref>). The trajectory of interneuron activity and the relationship between excitatory and inhibitory neurons during seizure initiation thus remain unclear.</p><p>One key challenge in examining the respective roles of excitatory and inhibitory cells in seizure initiation is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons. Neocortical GABAergic interneurons exhibit a wide variety of morphologies, molecular markers, and activity patterns, and make synapses on different subcellular domains of target pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). In the hippocampus, these include the soma-targeting, axo-axonic and basket cells that co-express the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) and the dendrite-targeting O-LM and bistratified interneurons that co-express the peptide somatostatin (SST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buhl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sik et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature Group et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lapray et al., 2012</xref>). Despite their divergent cellular properties, these cell classes are difficult to identify in vivo using traditional recording methods. Conflicting previous reports of the preictal activity of putative interneurons may thus be due in part to recordings of mixed neural populations.</p><p>Here, we used optogenetic tools to identify, track, and probe two distinct populations of hippocampal interneurons, the PV- and SST-expressing cells, in two models of acute chemoconvulsive seizure initiation in vivo. Chemoconvulsant models are reliable and consistent across animals and provide a window into the transition from healthy to pathological neural activity, separating interneuron activity and inhibitory influence in the initial transition to ictal activity from alterations in interneuron activity that are known to occur as a result of seizure-induced cell death or sprouting. The inhibitory influence of PV and SST interneuron firing on nearby neurons remains largely intact throughout the preictal and early ictal periods, suggesting that seizure activity does not arise from a failure of GABAergic inhibition from these cells. Instead, PV and SST cells exhibit cell-type-specific differences in their preictal activity and in the evolution of their sensitivity to input. Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is associated with dysregulation of the distinct roles these interneuron populations play in the local hippocampal circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To examine the preictal activity of identified hippocampal interneurons, we performed tetrode recordings of isolated single units and local field potentials (LFPs) from hippocampal CA1 in lightly anesthetized mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in target cells. Seizure activity was induced with systemic administration of the chemoconvulsant Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During the baseline period, we identified PV- (n = 56 cells in 45 mice) and SST- (n = 42 cells in 34 mice) expressing interneurons in PV-Cre/ChR2 or SST-Cre/ChR2 mice, respectively, by their short-latency, low-jitter responses to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lima et al., 2009</xref>). On average, PV cells displayed narrow spike waveforms, whereas SST cells exhibited broader waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). However, there was extensive overlap of waveform characteristics among the populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), indicating that spike waveform alone is not sufficient to distinguish cell types under these conditions. Histological analysis confirmed that the two identified interneuron populations were largely non-overlapping within CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-K</xref>). In some experiments, unidentified cells (n = 49 cells in 26 mice) were simultaneously recorded along with ChR2-tagged units in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice or in the pyramidal cell layer of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). A subset of these unidentified cells (n = 26 cells in 16 mice) were regular spiking (RS), putative excitatory cells with characteristic broad spike waveforms and relatively low baseline firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40750.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Firing rate changes of ChR2-tagged interneurons precede seizure initiation (<bold>A</bold>) Upper: Schematic of experimental paradigm showing baseline, PTZ injection and preictal period leading up to ictal onset.</title><p>Middle: LFP trace from hippocampal CA1 recording.

However, the patterns of activity underlying these transitions from stable to epileptiform activity are not well understood.</p><p>In the current study, where we utilized an acute chemoconvulsant seizure induction, the onset of the ictal period was defined quantitatively by increased LFP amplitude, which largely corresponded to the first ictal spike. These early events occurred in advance of full ictal recruitment. We found that PV- and SST-expressing interneurons and RS, putative excitatory cells exhibited different preictal firing rate trajectories. SST and RS cells showed an early, modest increase in firing, whereas &gt;90% of PV cells exhibited a late increase in firing immediately before ictal onset. During the early ictal period, PV and SST cell firing rates returned to baseline levels, whereas RS cell firing remained elevated. These changes in PV and SST cell firing rates occurred in the absence of changes in the impact of ChR2-evoked inhibition on local RS cells. Overall, these results suggest that the initial changes in network activity leading to early stages of seizure initiation may not be associated either with an overall failure of GABAergic inhibition from PV or SST cells or with unconstrained excitation. However, we note that our findings do not preclude additional impairments in inhibitory function at the time of ictal recruitment or later in the ictal period.</p><p>Fast-spiking, PV-expressing interneurons are coupled to both high-frequency and theta rhythms in the hippocampus, and are thought to contribute to maintaining the fine temporal organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Csicsvari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amilhon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huh et al., 2016</xref>).

Previous work has suggested that increased inhibitory synaptic activity or the onset of depolarization block in fast-spiking interneurons could precipitate seizure onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Velazquez and Carlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timofeev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziburkus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujiwara-Tsukamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gnatkovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cammarota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Nykamp, 2017</xref>), and we found that the onset of ictal spikes occurred immediately after a sharp increase in PV interneuron spiking in both anesthetized and awake animals. However, we found no evidence for decreased interneuron spike amplitude prior to ictal onset, suggesting that these interneurons did not enter depolarization block prior to ictal onset. Late preictal increases in PV interneuron firing could lead to irregular firing patterns or bursts in excitatory neurons, potentially resulting in hyper-synchronized, pathological entrainment of excitatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yekhlef et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avoli et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the PV interneurons, SST interneurons showed a sustained elevation of preictal firing without a late increase in firing rate preceding the transition to ictal activity. SST interneurons did not show a change in the overall temporal pattern of their spiking or entrainment to specific hippocampal rhythms. However, optogenetic stimulation revealed that SST, but not PV, cells exhibited altered sensitivity to input and a decreased maximum response to inputs during the late preictal period. OLM cells, the primary group of SST neurons targeted in our experiments, receive input from CA1, but not CA3 or the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blasco-Ibáñez and Freund, 1995</xref>). They innervate the distal tuft dendrites of local excitatory pyramidal neurons, providing potent recurrent feedback within the local circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloss et al., 2016</xref>). SST inhibition restrains the occurrence of hippocampal pyramidal neuron bursts, which promote highly effective transmission to downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lisman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Royer et al., 2012</xref>), and may regulate plateau potentials and plasticity in pyramidal cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>). SST cells show a preictal decrease in dynamic range and loss of ability to respond to depolarizing inputs, potentially leading to nonlinear amplification of excitatory activity in the local hippocampal circuit.</p><p>Previous work has found extensive heterogeneity in preictal firing rate trajectories of extracellularly recorded putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Intracellular and extracellular recordings of fast-spiking, putative PV interneurons have found increased preictal firing rates in cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timofeev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gnatkovsky et al., 2008</xref>) or a transient increase in firing immediately preceding ictal onset for some hippocampal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grasse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toyoda et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge, there are no previous data on the preictal firing rate trajectories of SST interneurons, although recent work in motor cortex found general population recruitment of both PV and SST interneurons following contralateral seizure onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khoshkhoo et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, some reports suggest increased preictal firing of regular spiking putative excitatory neurons in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cymerblit-Sabba and Schiller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiruska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujita et al., 2014</xref>), but others find a mix of increases and decreases within multiple hippocampal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bower and Buckmaster, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toyoda et al., 2015</xref>). Although the findings of a number of studies in both neocortex and hippocampus are thus consistent with inhibitory disruption, it also remains possible that the mechanisms underlying seizures in these areas are different.</p><p>We found that identification by action potential waveform or baseline firing rate was not a reliable indicator of cell identity for hippocampal PV interneurons. In addition, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Halabisky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katona et al., 2014</xref>), we found that SST interneurons exhibited varied action potential durations and could not be distinguished from regular spiking excitatory neurons by waveform. Optical tagging with Cre-dependent ChR2 allowed identification of each population despite overlapping action potential characteristics, and we found that the three cell classes we examined demonstrated distinct trajectories. Indeed, &gt;90% of PV interneurons exhibited a characteristic increase in firing immediately prior to the first ictal spike, suggesting that some of the heterogeneity observed in previous studies may arise from a mixed population of unidentified cells.</p><p>We examined interneuron activity in two chemoconvulsant models of acute induction of status epilepticus. These models provide insight into the mechanisms by which normal, healthy neural circuits transition to pathological patterns of activation, although the precise commonality of circuit-level mechanisms underlying induced and spontaneous seizures has not been fully explored. We used both PTZ, thought to be a competitive antagonist of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2001</xref>), and Pilocarpine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turski et al., 1989</xref>). Despite distinct pharmacological mechanisms, we found similar trajectories for PV interneuron activity in both models, as well as in awake animals, suggesting that preictal increases in PV activity may be a common element of acute seizure initiation. However, the exact timing of interneuron activity varied slightly across models. Because these drugs arrive rapidly in the brain at effective concentrations following systemic administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yonekawa et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramzan and Levy, 1985</xref>), it is unlikely that the progression of interneuron firing changes resulted from gradual accumulation of chemoconvulsants in neural tissue. Our experiments were largely conducted under anesthesia, which could potentially prolong the preictal period and reduce seizure activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fang and Wang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grover et al., 2016</xref>). However, the light anesthesia we used allowed normal spontaneous hippocampal firing patterns to be maintained and promoted short ictal onset delays similar to those in awake animals. Furthermore, we observed similar PV and SST trajectories in awake and anesthetized animals.</p><p>One potential function of inhibition during seizure is the restraint of ictal activity. The spreading ictal wavefront generates feedforward excitation, which recruits powerful feedforward inhibition that may restrict the postsynaptic recruitment of spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition restrains the spread of ictal activity in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trevelyan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trevelyan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schevon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sessolo et al., 2015</xref>), and surround inhibition around epileptic foci has been observed in animal and human seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prince and Wilder, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartz and Bonhoeffer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Timofeev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trevelyan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trevelyan et al., 2007</xref>). We observed preictal increases in both PV and SST firing rates, raising the possibility that compensatory increases in inhibition transiently restrain oncoming ictal events. However, the increasing loss of normal temporal structure and input sensitivity by the PV and SST interneuron populations, respectively, may contribute to the transition to a pathological state.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that cell-type-specific disruption of finely tuned interneuron relationships with the local hippocampal circuit may contribute to reorganization of inhibitory activity prior to seizure initiation. These findings highlight the complex involvement of distinct GABAergic interneuron populations in early stages of pathological activity in the hippocampal circuit. Indeed, although the PV and SST populations encompass a large proportion of hippocampal interneurons, other inhibitory cell types may be differentially engaged by seizure initiation and remain to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Yale University.

On the day of the surgery, the mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane and the scalp was shaved and cleaned three times with Betadine solution. An incision was made at the midline and the scalp resected to each side to leave an open area of skull. Two skull screws (McMaster-Carr) were placed at the anterior and posterior poles. Two nuts (McMaster-Carr) were glued in place over the bregma point with cyanoacrylate and secured with C&amp;B-Metabond (Butler Schein). The Metabond was extended along the sides and back of the skull to cover each screw, leaving a bilateral window of skull uncovered over primary visual cortex. The exposed skull was covered by a layer of cyanoacrylate. The skin was then glued to the edge of the Metabond with cyanoacrylate. Analgesics were given immediately after the surgery and on the two following days to aid recovery. Mice were given a course of antibiotics (Sulfatrim, Butler Schein) to prevent infection and were allowed to recover for 3 – 5 days following implant surgery before beginning wheel training.</p><p>Once recovered from the surgery, mice were trained with a headpost on the wheel apparatus. The mouse wheel apparatus was 3D-printed (Shapeways Inc.) in plastic with a 15 cm diameter and integrated axle and was spring-mounted on a fixed base. A programmable magnetic angle sensor (Digikey) was attached for continuous monitoring of wheel motion. Headposts were custom-designed to mimic the natural head angle of the running mouse, and mice were mounted with the center of the body at the apex of the wheel. On each training day, a headpost was attached to the implanted nuts with two screws (McMaster-Carr). The headpost was then secured with thumb screws at two points on the wheel. Mice were headposted in place for increasing intervals on each successive day. If signs of anxiety or distress were noted, the mouse was removed from the headpost and the training interval was not lengthened on the next day. Mice were trained on the wheel for up to 7 days or until they exhibited robust bouts of running activity during each session. Mice that continued to exhibit signs of distress were not used for awake electrophysiology sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Awake seizure induction protocol</title><p>For experiments performed in awake animals, mice were placed on the wheel and fixed in place by the headpost at the beginning of the session.

Tetrodes were targeted to the CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus (AP:+1.5 – 2 mm; ML: 1.2 – 1.75, Franklin and Paxinos, 2001). Signals were digitized and recorded with a DigitalLynx 4SX system (Neuralynx, Bozeman MT). All data were sampled at 40 kHz and recordings were referenced to the cerebellum. LFP data were recorded with a bandpass 0.1 – 9000 Hz filter and single-unit data was bandpass filtered between 600 – 9000 Hz.

We first used the KlustaKwik 3.0 software (Kadir, 2013) to identify a maximum of 30 clusters using the waveform energy and energy of the waveform’s first derivative as clustering features. We then used a modified version of the M-Clust environment to manually separate units. Units were accepted if a clear separation of the cell relative to all the other noise clusters was observed, which generally was the case when isolation distance (ID) (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005) exceeded 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). We further ensured that maximum contamination of the ISI (Inter-spike-interval) histogram did not exceed 0.1% at 1.5 ms. To analyze the firing rates of cells after ictal onset, we manually determined the last point at which cluster separation from the noise was clearly visible. Only cells whose ictal activity could be tracked for at least 60 s were included in the ictal period analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of waveform parameters</title><p>For each isolated single unit, we computed an average spike waveform for all channels of a tetrode.

LV values greater than one indicate irregular firing, whereas LV values smaller than one indicate sub-Poisson regular firing (Shimokawa and Shinomoto, 2009).

Spike-field locking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>) was computed using the Pairwise Phase Consistency, a measure of phase consistency that is not biased by the firing rate or the number of spikes (Vinck et al., 2012). Spike-LFP phases were computed for each spike and frequency separately by computing the Discrete Fourier Transform of Hanning-tapered LFP segments. These segments had a duration of 7 cycles per frequency. LFP power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) was computed by dividing the signal into 1 s segments and computing the DFT with a Hanning taper.

To avoid heating of the brain, we calibrated the light power (&lt;75 mW/mm2) during ChR2 unit tracking experiments in order to ensure a mean spike probability of ~1 spikes per 5 ms light pulse in the targeted population. Real-time output power for each laser was monitored using a photodiode and recorded continuously during the experiment. During baseline periods, we identified ChR2-expressing interneurons using short (5 ms) pulses of blue light, relying on the short latency of ChR2-evoked spikes and the high degree of temporal precision of the evoked spikes. In a subset of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we measured the input-output function of ChR2-identified interneurons in response to a calibrated range of light intensities. Due to the potential for manipulation of interneurons to affect the firing of surrounding cells, data from optogenetic manipulation experiments was not used to calculate preictal and ictal firing rates or patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Seizure detection</title><p>Ictal onset was identified by examining hippocampal CA1 LFP recordings, and was defined as the first occurrence of an ictal spike following injection of the chemoconvulsant.

Sustained, elevated z-scores were generally observed after ictal onset, and ictal onset was typically coincident with the first ictal spike. We used spectrograms to validate that there were no consistent LFP changes prior to ictal onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To quantify the extent to which RS cells were inhibited following the light pulses, we compared their firing rates in the 50 ms period post-light pulses (FR<sub>post</sub>) with their firing rate in the 200 ms prior to light pulses (FR<sub>pre</sub>). We then computed the modulation of RS firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>) as</p><p>y = [FR<sub>post –</sub> FR<sub>pre</sub>]/[FR<sub>post</sub> +FR<sub>pre</sub>].</p><p>We computed this modulation separately for pulses of medium and high intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The medium intensity level was defined as the level at which the simultaneously driven PV cells had, on average, a 50% firing probability. The highest intensity level was the level at which the simultaneously recorded PV cell spiking reached its maximum spike probability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical testing</title><p>Paired and unpaired Rank Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis tests were used throughout the manuscript to avoid the assumptions made by parametric statistical tests. α values were adjusted in cases where multiple comparisons were performed on the same data set, and all measures of significance in these cases are reported as Bonferroni corrected values. Exact p values are reported in the Source Data files for each figure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank M Higley for comments on the manuscript, H Blumenfeld for discussion of seizure models, and the Yale Center for Analytical Science for assistance with statistical analysis.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Altered hippocampal interneuron activity precedes ictal onset&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by Gary Westbrook in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The two reviews are below for your consideration. In discussion with the reviewers and editor, we agreed that the work needs to be expanded to look at spontaneously occurring seizures to be of high impact, and further that the activity subsequent to the first &quot;spike&quot; is also of key relevance. This expansion would require major revisions, reworking the experimental design and analysis. We appreciate that the topic is of interest and the general approach could be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This report uses optogenetic tagging to examine, in two models of chemoconvulsant induced seizures, the general activity levels of two classes of hippocampal interneurons in the period leading up to seizures. The approach is solid, using careful methods to fully document the changes in PV, SST and non-PV/SST (presumed pyramidal cells). Results convincingly show that there is very little evidence for loss of inhibition in this critical preictal period. This is an area of controversy with some recent evidence suggesting failure of inhibition might play a role in ictogenesis, and this paper could have an important impact. The data, while technically convincing, are limited in some ways, that reduce overall impact. First, while two models are used, they are both acute chemoconvulsant induced seizures, and so might tell us little regarding the mechanisms leading up to spontaneously occurring seizures in epileptic subjects.

To this end the authors do a good job of developing two seizure models and examining how their firing is affected during preictal periods. The authors use state of the art methods to identify the interneuron populations combining single unit recordings with optogenetic stimulation, such that short latency responding cells can be distinguished by their responses. Importantly, although rather a sidebar to the central story the authors indicated that using spike width to classify neurons (particularly FS interneurons) is not particularly reliable. This secondary point aside, they do a very nice job of examining firing of PV, SST and RS (presumably largely pyramidal) neurons during preictal periods. Their major finding here is that PV but not SST interneurons alter their firing during preictal periods. They then go on to examine the inhibitory efficacy of PV and SST interneurons in preictal periods through optogenetic stimulation and examining their effect on pyramidal cells, which remains strong. From this they conclude that while interneuron function is retained during seizures, the PV population at least is decoupled from their normal function. In general, this is a very good paper that would make a good addition to <italic>eLife</italic> after some further experimentation is completed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1E I would like to see the change in firing rates for PV, SST, and RS after ictal onset. I realize that given the high level of activities recruited during seizures isolating single units may prove difficult to isolate. That said the advent of new methods where optogenetic methods are coupled with patch clamp methods make such an approach tenable and well within the skill set of this group. Even a limited set of patch recordings would greatly increase my enthusiasm for this work, especially as it would provide information as to the afferent IPSC/EPSCs within interneurons during preictal and ictal firing periods.</p><p>2) They tested the firing rates during the &quot;preictal&quot; period for two chemical models (PTZ and pilocarpine). I am a bit concerned that the progressive changes they see in the preictal period may be confounded by the kinetics of the arrival of the IP injection of the drugs to the brain rather than reflecting something that happens biologically before spontaneous seizures. I think it would add considerably to this study if they recorded the firing rate changes preceding a spontaneous seizure (1 week after the pilocarpine injection) to determine if the observed changes in firing rates are consistent between the two models. I concede that this experiment is technically challenging, and their system may not be stable enough to allow 1-week post-seizure induction survival.

As I suggested above, efforts to do some whole cell recording from PV and SST interneurons, identified using optogenetic stimulation would certainly increase the impact of their paper. At the very least, a further discussion of the implications of the uncoupling they observe in PV cells is needed. Since the hippocampus is tightly linked network and the PV cells are strongly connected to both the SST and RS populations, I was surprised that changes to the PV frequency spectrum of PV cells do not end up being reflected in the firing of other cells in the network. Given the previous work of the senior author demonstrating that PV cell activation can induce Γ band activity, further explanation why such a strong change in their firing rhythms are not reflected in the overall network activity warrants discussion. It would be helpful if the authors discuss this point and perhaps include a model as to how they think these changes lead to a seizure and network changes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Altered hippocampal interneuron activity precedes ictal onset&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as the Senior and Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This revised manuscript investigates the differing roles of PV and SST interneurons in two models of acute pharmacologically induced seizures, using sophisticated and well thought out experimental methods. The study addresses an important area of controversy regarding the cellular mechanisms of ictogenesis, with some studies proposing failure of inhibition or depolarization block, and others implying that interneurons themselves are the trigger. The results show that inhibition remains intact in the preictal period, and that the two types of interneurons demonstrate reduced activity and sensitivity to input during ictal periods, along with cell-type specific differences in LFP coupling, suggesting that the two interneuron classes play different roles. The use of two chemoconvulsant models with different mechanisms of action is a strength. There is also a rigorous and much-needed demonstration of the pitfalls involved in distinguishing cell-type specific waveforms in extracellular recordings. This revised manuscript also now includes two pieces of highly novel data. First, the main result is validated in a limited number of recordings in non-anesthetized animals. Secondly, the authors provided very interesting results regarding continued evolution of neural activities past the preictal period. Overall, this is a convincing data set that will be of general interest. The paper provides important data regarding inhibitory activity in the time period leading up to ictal recruitment, and the observation of preictal/early ictal decoupling of PV firing from LFP β rhythms (20-28 Hz) is also an important new contribution.</p><p>Having said that, there remain some concerns regarding approach and interpretation.</p><p>1) We agree that injury induced, or genetic models would be much more difficult to study than acute chemoconvulsant seizures, especially given their variable and unpredictability. Nevertheless, the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion section need to emphasize this point and must include the rationale included in the rebuttal. In particular, the seizure models must be listed in the Abstract e.g. by inserting the word chemoconvulsive before &quot;seizure induction&quot;. There must be caution exercised in translating these results to spontaneous seizures occurring in the context of chronic epilepsy (i.e. in patients). This limitation should be mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) Despite the high quality of the results, some aspects of the paper are still underdeveloped. The last sentence of the introduction provides some observational results but does not put them into any particular context. The Results section ends on a similarly flat note.</p><p>3) The four preseizure periods could be better rationalized and/or explained in the results. It would help with clarity if it simply stated that the preseizure period was divided into four equally-spaced quartiles for each animal based on the latency between chemoconvulsant administration and seizure onset. What is a bit confusing is that the text indicates &quot;equal duration&quot; but this wording presumably does not apply across animals.</p><p>4) The definition of seizure onset is not clear, and it potentially confounds the results. To be fair to the authors, there is considerable controversy regarding the definition of an electrographic seizure, and how to determine when a specific site is recruited into an ongoing seizure. Nevertheless, the analysis is highly sensitive to these questions, and they should be taken into account in interpreting study results.</p><p>It is possible that the &quot;ictal&quot; period that is assessed may be composed in part or entirely of the discharging that is seen prior to ictal recruitment (i.e. penumbra). In Figure 1, the recruitment transition appears to take place well over a minute after ictal onset (based on this low resolution trace), so it would not have been included in the analysis which is limited to the first 60 seconds after onset. In Figure 2, the recruitment transition appears to occur during ictal period 4, in which there is a drop in PV and SST firing to baseline levels despite continued elevated excitatory firing. It would be very interesting to compare PV and SST activity to either side of this transitory event, if those data are available.</p><p>5) There is a mismatch between the time window of inhibitory failure vs. the time windows used for analysis of preictal and ictal periods. Inhibitory failure, as previously demonstrated in animal and human studies, is an abrupt event that occurs in &lt; 2 seconds at the time of ictal recruitment. For this and reasons related to uncertainty of defining seizure onset, the conclusion in the Abstract and first paragraph of the Discussion section that &quot;onset of ictal activity is not due to loss of firing … or failure of synaptic inhibition&quot; is too strongly worded.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40750.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This report uses optogenetic tagging to examine, in two models of chemoconvulsant induced seizures, the general activity levels of two classes of hippocampal interneurons in the period leading up to seizures. The approach is solid, using careful methods to fully document the changes in PV, SST and non-PV/SST (presumed pyramidal cells). Results convincingly show that there is very little evidence for loss of inhibition in this critical preictal period. This is an area of controversy with some recent evidence suggesting failure of inhibition might play a role in ictogenesis, and this paper could have an important impact. The data, while technically convincing, are limited in some ways, that reduce overall impact. First, while two models are used, they are both acute chemoconvulsant induced seizures, and so might tell us little regarding the mechanisms leading up to spontaneously occurring seizures in epileptic subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the selection of seizure models is a challenging issue. Chemoconvulsant models offer several advantages for detailed circuit examination in vivo. They are reliable and consistent across animals and have provided relevant insights into seizure pathology in previous work. One of our goals is to better understand the transition from healthy to pathological neural activity. Acute seizure induction allows us to separate the pattern of interneuron activity and inhibitory influence in the initial transition to ictal activity from alterations in interneuron activity that are known to occur as a result of seizure-induced cell death or sprouting.</p><p>In addition, although there are induced and genetic mouse models of seizure, each presents a different problem for data collection and interpretation. Because even clustered seizures in the pilocarpine model are unpredictable and spaced relatively far apart in time (e.g., Henderson et al., 2014), it is not possible to obtain sufficient ChR2-tagged interneuron recordings specifically at seizure onset to allow a rigorous analysis. In turn, most genetic models of epilepsy have known deficits in interneuron function (e.g., Tai et al., 2014; Adotevi and Leitch, 2016; Hedrich et al., 2014; Peñagarikano et al., 2011), and therefore are not suitable for understanding interneuron contributions to initial ictal transition in a healthy network. For these reasons, we feel that the models we use in the current work are both informative and well suited to the experimental goals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the results are obtained under anesthesia, and no discussion is provided regarding this important confound.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing the push to address this issue. We have now added recordings of identified interneurons and regular spiking cells in awake behaving animals during seizure initiation. We find increased PV and SST interneuron activity prior to ictal onset, with a sharp increase in PV firing immediately before the first ictal event. In addition, we find an altered temporal pattern of PV, but not SST, firing, with a preictal increase in the regularity of spiking.</p><p>These data extend our findings in two key ways. First, our findings in anesthetized and awake animals are very similar, suggesting that the anesthetized paradigm is a useful model.

In addition, we have included new plots (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) to clearly show the distribution of latencies to ictal onset.

Holding interneuron recordings after ictal onset is very challenging, but we were indeed able to follow a subset of interneurons after ictal onset (new Figure 2). We find that interneuron firing rates return to baseline levels, but regular spiking neurons continue to fire at elevated rates, suggesting that the change in interneuron activity is transient and specific to the transition from preictal to ictal activity.

This comparison has not been made by previous studies, presumably because many previous datasets of identified hippocampal interneurons are quite small, with &lt;10 cells per class. Previous work using waveform characteristics as the sole identifier of inhibitory interneuron identity has reported much more variable patterns of firing by putative FS interneurons at ictal onset than we find in the current work. To further support our claims, we have added new quantification of the laminar position of each recorded cell class in the hippocampus (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We show that in the rostral portion of the hippocampus, where our recordings were made, nearly 100% of each interneuron class not only exclusively expresses one of the two genetic markers (PV or SST), but also has a cell body location consistent with the identified cell class. As we now suggest in the revised Discussion section, our data may explain some of this previous variability as the result of poorly identified or mixed cell classes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1E I would like to see the change in firing rates for PV, SST, and RS after ictal onset.

We agree with the reviewer that intracellular recordings would provide additional insights into synaptic input to interneurons during this period. However, in our extensive experience, this is a prohibitively difficult experimental approach to implement. Hippocampal interneurons are quite sparse, giving low yield for a single pipette, and changes in vascular dilation and tissue instability preclude holding high-quality patch recordings during ictal onset in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They tested the firing rates during the &quot;preictal&quot; period for two chemical models (PTZ and pilocarpine).

In addition, because even clustered seizures in the pilocarpine model happen very infrequently (e.g., Henderson et al., 2014), it is not practically possible to obtain sufficient recordings from identified interneurons during seizure onset to perform a rigorous analysis. Previous work, now covered in the discussion, suggests that the kinetics of drug arrival in the brain do not match the trajectories of altered activity observed in the hippocampus. We have also now added new data from awake behaving animals showing the same results. In addition, the mechanisms of action of pilocarpine and PTZ are quite distinct and have different intrinsic kinetics (Huang et al., 2001; Turski et al., 1989; Ramzan and Levy, 1985; Yonekawa et al., 1980), whereas we find very similar neural trajectories in both cases. Finally, the drugs are presumably still present immediately after ictal onset, when we observe a rapid decline in interneuron activity and sustained firing of RS cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I think the paper would benefit from a more direct analysis of the decoupling of PV interneurons during the preictal period.

We have extensively rewritten the Results section and Discussion section to better synthesize our findings. The observation that PV cells increase their firing but become more regular and lose their coherence with the low gamma band is indeed quite interesting. In combination with the optogenetics findings, these results suggest that the overall level of interneuron influence is largely maintained during the preictal period, but the fine timing of inhibitory spikes is disrupted. This loss of PV timing may release RS cell spiking from tight temporal control over firing patterns. Over the same time period, the SST interneurons become less responsive to input. Because SST cells play a key role in restricting the bursting of excitatory pyramidal neurons, the loss of appropriately recruited SST activity may nonlinearly amplify excitatory activity in hippocampal circuits. Our results suggest a model in which the transition to ictal activity is associated with a disruption of the normal circuit operations of both PV and SST interneurons, potentially a two-pronged insult to the organization of hippocampal activity. We have further added a discussion of the potential compensatory role of the observed preictal increase in overall interneuron firing rates in transiently restricting the pathological recruitment of excitatory spiking.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>Having said that, there remain some concerns regarding approach and interpretation.</p><p>1) We agree that injury induced, or genetic models would be much more difficult to study than acute chemoconvulsant seizures, especially given their variable and unpredictability.

Recent methods of seizure detection in rodents have included thresholding of the LFP or EEG, hand-tuning based on signal features, and measurement of power spectral coherence and entropy, each of which gives distinct results for ictal onset. In the current study, we used a quantitative measure of LFP activity, evaluated by z-scoring, to identify the earliest timepoint of pathological activity. This quantitative estimate largely coincided with the initial ictal spike. Our analysis thus focuses on the early phase of pathological activity, prior to full ictal recruitment. However, there are compelling reasons to look at this early period activity, as initiating events in the local circuit arise well prior to ictal recruitment. We were unfortunately not able to hold recordings of identified interneurons through ictal transition due to mechanical instability. In addition, there was some variability in the timing of recruitment transition across animals.</p><p>However, we fully recognize the limitations of this approach, and thus, in ongoing work we are examining the activity of identified interneurons during later ictal periods using 2-photon imaging, which does not provide precise spike times but is stable over longer periods of pathological activity. We have added text in the discussion to further highlight these issues and to emphasize that our current analysis focuses on relatively early events in the progression from normal activity to ictal recruitment:</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Disruption of the excitatory-inhibitory balance profoundly alters circuit function (Fritschy, 2008; Ziburkus et al., 2013) and is hypothesized to play a significant role in the pathophysiological patterns of brain activity leading to the onset of seizure. The transition to ictal activity has been characterized in a variety of ways in rodents, including by manual validation (Henderson et al., 2014), threshold detection of increased EEG power (Khoshkhoo et al., 2017), and combined measurement of EEG power trajectory and spectral features (Krook-Magnuson et al., 2014). However, the patterns of activity underlying these transitions from stable to epileptiform activity are not well understood.”</p><p>In the current study, where we utilized an acute chemoconvulsant seizure induction, the onset of the ictal period was defined quantitatively by increased LFP amplitude, which largely corresponded to the first ictal spike. These early events occurred in advance of full ictal recruitment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is a mismatch between the time window of inhibitory failure vs. the time windows used for analysis of preictal and ictal periods. Inhibitory failure, as previously demonstrated in animal and human studies, is an abrupt event that occurs in &lt; 2 seconds at the time of ictal recruitment. For this and reasons related to uncertainty of defining seizure onset, the conclusion in the Abstract and first paragraph of the Discussion section that &quot;onset of ictal activity is not due to loss of firing … or failure of synaptic inhibition&quot; is too strongly worded.</p></disp-quote><p>We have softened the wording of the Abstract:</p><p>“Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is not associated with loss of firing by these interneurons or a failure of synaptic inhibition but is instead linked with disruptions of the respective roles these interneurons play in the hippocampal circuit. “</p><p>We note that the Discussion section states that ‘the initial changes in network activity may not be associated with either an overt failure of inhibition or unconstrained excitation’, rather than stating that ‘ictal activity is not due to a failure of inhibition’. As noted in the response to point 4 above, the initial events that are the focus of the current manuscript occur earlier than many of the more electrographically prominent elements of seizure, such as broad ictal recruitment. Our data suggest that these early initiating events are not associated with a failure of inhibition, but do not allow us to draw conclusions about inhibitory function later in the ictal period. We have added this point to the Discussion section and emphasized the early timepoint:</p><p>“Overall, these results suggest that the initial changes in network activity leading to early stages of seizure initiation may not be associated either with an overall failure of GABAergic inhibition from PV or SST cells or with unconstrained excitation. However, we note that our findings do not preclude additional impairments in inhibitory function at the time of ictal recruitment or later in the ictal period.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
