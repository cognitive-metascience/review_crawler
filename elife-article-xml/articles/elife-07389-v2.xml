Many researchers have used the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to understand morphogenesis, which occurs both during the development of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and during metamorphosis (when the pupa changes to become an adult fly).</p><p>Like other insects, adult fruit flies have three main body sections (a head, a thorax and an abdomen), which are further divided into segments. The adult's abdomen forms inside the pupa from precursor cells called histoblasts. These cells are unusual in that they develop in the embryo but remain inactive during the larval stages of life. During pupation, these cells are reactivated by a hormone called ecdysone, and gradually replace the larva's tissues. However, it was not clear how this process was coordinated.</p><p>Verma and Cohen have now demonstrated that a small RNA molecule—a microRNA called <italic>miR-965</italic>—acts in histoblast cells and controls how much these cells divide as well as how they migrate during morphogenesis to replace the larval cells. MicroRNAs regulate other RNAs, called messenger RNAs, typically by targeting them for destruction. This prevents the messenger RNA molecules from being used to make proteins. When flies develop without <italic>miR-965</italic>, they are mostly normal but have defects in the formation of segments in the abdomen.</p><p>Verma and Cohen revealed that <italic>miR-965</italic> acts by targeting two important messenger RNAs for destruction. These messenger RNAs encode a protein called String, which regulates histoblast proliferation, and another protein called Wingless. Once the pupa starts to form, the ecdysone hormone reduces the production of <italic>miR-965</italic> to increase histoblast proliferation and migration. The <italic>miR-965</italic> microRNA in turn reduces the level of ecdysone receptor. The ecdysone hormone acts as an all-or-nothing switch to make an irreversible change from the larval to the pupal stage. The hormone boosts its own activity by increasing expression of its own receptor. This ‘positive feedback loop’ acts like a switch and is very sensitive to small changes in the amount of hormone present.</p><p>Verma and Cohen propose that by reducing the levels of the hormone receptor, <italic>miR-965</italic> makes the system more stable. This is because the hormone must first overcome the action of <italic>miR-965</italic> before it can kick off the positive feedback loop. This takes time, and means that any change in the amount of hormone must be around for a while to have an effect. This mechanism buffers against short-lived, small changes in hormone levels that might throw the switch at the wrong time—a feature known as ‘robustness’. This seems to be a complicated process to go from one state to another (i.e., from a larva to a pupa). But, the existence of the many distinct checks and balances makes sure the switch is thrown only when it is needed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07389.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07389.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verma</surname><given-names>Pushpa</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF12OC0000552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A microRNA-mediated mechanism coordinates cell proliferation with cell rearrangements during tissue morphogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process, through which the organism coordinates cell proliferation and cell death with cell migration and rearrangements to achieve final organ shape and size. Mechanisms controlling these processes play important role in morphogenesis, tissue repair and regeneration, and in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rorth, 2009</xref>). The abdominal epithelium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a useful model system in which to study the dynamics of tissue morphogenesis in vivo and to explore the genetic and cellular mechanisms that control these complex morphogenetic processes.</p><p>During metamorphosis, larval epidermal tissues undergo cellular restructuring and rearrangement to give rise to adult abdominal epithelium. The adult abdominal epithelium is produced from progenitor cells, known as histoblast cells. Histoblasts are small diploid cells, easily distinguishable from the large polyploid larval epidermal cells (LEC) that surround them. Histoblasts are specified in the embryo and lie quiescent throughout larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guerra et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Simcox et al., 1991</xref>). There are four pairs of histoblast nests in each segment, which merge to assemble the adult abdominal epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Madhavan and Schneiderman, 1977</xref>). The anterior and posterior dorsal histoblast nests give rise to the external dorsal cuticle of the abdominal segments (tergites), while the ventral pair give rise to the ventral cuticle (sternites).</p><p>During larval stages, histoblasts are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. At pupariation, an ecdysone pulse triggers the expression of <italic>string (cdc25)</italic>, which activates cyclin/CDK and pushes the histoblasts into rapid proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edgar and O'Farrell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gautier et al., 1991</xref>). The proliferative phase is divided into two stages with distinct features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Madhavan and Madhavan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). The early ‘division phase’ is characterized by rapid and synchronous cell division without intervening G2 phases to allow for cell growth. Cells double in number and decrease in size with each division, with little change in the size of the nests. This is followed by a phase of slower division, from 15–40 hr of pupal development, in which proliferation is accompanied by longer intervening gap phases to allow cell growth. During this phase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Insulin receptor/PI3K- signaling coordinate the growth of cells with proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). During the growth phase, the histoblast nests begin to spread to replace the LEC. The expansion of the histoblast nests by cell migration is accompanied by programmed cell death, so that larval cells are replaced by the expanding histoblast population to maintain integrity of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bischoff and Cseresnyes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakajima et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Patterning of the adult abdominal segments makes use of many of the signaling pathways that pattern the embryonic and larval segments, including <italic>hedgehog</italic>, <italic>wingless</italic>, <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> and EGFR. Interactions between morphogen gradients produced by some of these proteins determine anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning of segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sanicola et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shirras and Couso, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Struhl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kopp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ninov et al., 2010</xref>). Although abdominal segmental patterning has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms regulating cell division, migration, cell replacement and their interactions during formation of segments remain less well understood. Here, we provide evidence that the microRNA, <italic>miR-965,</italic> is required in the histoblast nests, where it acts via regulation of <italic>string</italic> and <italic>wingless</italic> to control histoblast proliferation and migration during pupal morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>miR-965</italic> microRNA is located in the first intron of the <italic>kismet</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>kismet</italic> and <italic>miR-965</italic> are transcribed in the same direction.

One mutant allele was made by homologous recombination using the pw25 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gong and Golic, 2003</xref>). In this allele, the genomic region containing the miRNA hairpin was replaced by a mini-white reporter gene flanked by LoxP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, w+KO1).

EcR activity limits <italic>miR-965</italic> expression. <italic>miR-965</italic> activity limits <italic>EcR</italic> primary transcript levels, suggesting an effect on transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings link regulation of the <italic>miR-965</italic> microRNA to the onset of histoblast proliferation at the larval to pupal transition. Previous reports have provided evidence that Ecdysone signaling activates <italic>string</italic> expression to trigger the onset of histoblast proliferation at the beginning of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings provide evidence that Ecdysone signaling works though regulation of <italic>miR-965</italic>, which in turn regulates <italic>string.</italic> Interestingly, we also find evidence for negative feedback regulation of <italic>miR-965</italic> on <italic>EcR</italic>. Mutual repression circuitry of this type can contribute a switch-like function: EcR activity lowers <italic>miR-965</italic> activity, which allows greater <italic>EcR</italic> expression/activity by alleviating <italic>miR-965 </italic>mediated repression. In a circuit of this design, there will be a delay between reduced transcription of the miRNA primary transcript and the decay of the mature miRNA product. Hence sustained EcR activity is needed to throw the switch.</p><p>We have previously reported that <italic>EcR </italic>shows positive transcriptional autoregulation and that this is buffered by <italic>miR-14 </italic>in a mutual repression circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Varghese and Cohen, 2007</xref>). Positive feedback allows for a sharp switch-like response, but also makes the system very sensitive to stochastic fluctuation in <italic>EcR</italic> activity. Coupling <italic>EcR </italic>positive auto-feedback to miRNA-mediated repression allows a robust switch function upon Ecdysone stimulation, while protecting the system from the effects of biological noise. This study provides evidence that <italic>miR-965</italic> plays an analogous role in regulating <italic>EcR</italic> response and suggests that <italic>miR-965</italic> confers robustness to the <italic>EcR</italic> response in the histoblasts.</p><p>Upregulation of <italic>string</italic> in the <italic>miR-965</italic> mutant contributes to the defects in histoblast proliferation. How misregulation of <italic>string</italic> might contribute to the migration defects is less immediately obvious. Previous work has shown that cell cycle progression in the histoblast population is required to trigger programmed cell death in the surrounding LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakajima et al., 2011</xref>). Those authors provided evidence that cell growth and the expansion of the histoblast nests may be required to elicit LEC apoptosis. Although the mechanism by which expansion of the histoblasts triggers LEC death is not clear, elevated <italic>string</italic> expression in the <italic>miR-965</italic> mutant is likely to be responsible for the cell cycle progression defects during this phase, hindering normal LEC removal and histoblast migration.</p><p>Persistence of the LECs might also be a consequence of the increased expression of Wg protein in the mutant histoblast nests. Wg acts in combination with EGFR and Dpp signals to control abdominal segment patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shirras and Couso, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kopp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2010</xref>). These signals are thought to control differential cell adhesion, which may be important for elimination of the LECs as well as for proper segmental fusion of the histoblast nests. Elevated expression of Wg protein may lead to an expanded range of action, perhaps resulting in ectopic Wg activity in the LECs.</p><p>Each adult abdominal segment has a well-defined anterior-posterior polarity. Wg is required from 15–20 hr APF for bristle formation and from 18–28 hr APF for tergite differentiation and pigmentation. Overexpression of <italic>wg</italic> has been shown to cause ectopic bristle formation, and <italic>shaggy</italic> mutant clones, which constitutively activate <italic>wg</italic> signaling, can cause polarity reversal in abdominal bristles, while <italic>EGFR, FGF, dpp</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic> signaling have no effect on the polarity of bristles in adult epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lawrence et al., 2002</xref>). Wg levels are normally higher in the posterior region of the anterior histoblast nests and lower more anteriorly. Our finding that Wg levels were elevated and that the distribution of Wg was broader than normal suggests ectopic Wg activity throughout the histoblast nest, including cells that normally experience low Wg levels. Ectopic spread of Wg could be responsible for the formation of ectopic bristles and for the occasional instances of polarity reversal observed in the anterior part of tergites in the <italic>miR-965</italic> mutants.</p><p>Replacement of the larval epidermis during metamorphosis involves regulation of both cell-intrinsic events in the abdominal histoblasts and communication between histoblasts and the larval cells they will replace. <italic>miR-965</italic> acts on at least two separate processes required during histoblast morphogenesis. A miRNA with multiple targets can add a layer of regulation, acting across different pathways to integrate their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herranz and Cohen, 2010</xref>). In doing so, the <italic>miR-965</italic> miRNA appears to contribute to the robustness of this complex morphogenetic system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p><italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> was used as the control genotype unless otherwise indicated. <italic>esg-GAL4, UAS-GFP</italic> was obtained from Shigeo Hayashi. <italic>UAS-stg.N4, stg</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup><italic>, stg</italic><sup><italic>EY12388</italic></sup><italic>, wg</italic><sup><italic>Sp-1</italic></sup><italic>, wg</italic><sup><italic>I-12</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>k13416</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>k11324</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>k10237</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>BG01657</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>KG08532</italic></sup><italic>, Kis</italic><sup><italic>EY12846</italic></sup><italic>, Df(2L)Exe7702, Df(2L)ED19</italic> are from Bloomington stock center. <italic>EcR-RNAi (v37059)</italic> was from Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Research Center and <italic>P{GawB}esg</italic><sup><italic>NP7011</italic></sup> and <italic>ZCL2207 (Atpα-GFP)</italic> was from DGRC, Kyoto.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mutant generation</title><p>miR-965 (KO1) and miR-965<sup>RMCE</sup> (KO2) deletion mutants were generated by targeted homologous recombination as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this paper addresses an interesting topic and that the regulation of histoblast proliferation and migration by miR-965 is in principle suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. There were however, some concerns that the conclusions are not fully supported by the current data. The main areas of concern are as follows:</p><p>1) There is an apparent discrepancy between the severe defects in pupal histoblast proliferation and spreading, and the rather mild adult defects. This needs clarification: are the adults escapers with a more mild initial phenotype? What are the frequencies of the phenotypes and pre-eclosion lethality? Generally, the phenotypic analysis needs quantification and explanation.</p><p>2) Although the effects on stg look robust, the role of miR-965 on wg is less convincing. The effects of loss of miR-965 on wg expression was weak, and reduction of wg was not a very effective suppressor. This needs clarification with further data or, failing that, the conclusion that wg is a significant target of miR-965 in histoblast development needs to be more cautious.</p><p>3) Since mutation of the miR-965 site in the stg 3' UTR does not fully rescue the luciferase reporter expression, it is possible that miR-965 might have other indirect effects which might effect stg. This ought to be acknowledged.</p><p>4) mir-965 is predicted to target 69 genes, so it should be clarified whether these are the only two targets with functional relevance to the phenotypes observed. This can be addressed by testing whether reduction of both stg and wg together completely rescue the phenotype of mir-965 mutants? At least it needs to be clear whether there are other relevant targets, even if they are unidentified.</p><p>5) The role of ecdysone, which is an important physiological element of the model, also needs some further clarification. How functionally important is the ecdysone regulation of stg in histoblasts? Is it dependent on miR-965? And the effect of EcR loss on wg expression was not explored: if wg is a significant player, this is a gap that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Overall, we have limited our major comments to issues that the reviewers believe are necessary to support the model, not to extend it. It is acknowledged that this will require some additional data but the consensus is that these are necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07389.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is an apparent discrepancy between the severe defects in pupal histoblast proliferation and spreading, and the rather mild adult defects.

The data present the total number of surviving adults (live) and the total number of dead pupae (dead). There was no significant difference between the mutant and control genotypes used to make the movies:</p><p>p=0.67 comparing KO2 esgG4&gt;GFP/+ vs KO2 esgG4&gt;GFP/KO1 (Mann-Whitney test).</p><p>p=1 comparing KO1 esgG4&gt;GFP/+ vs KO1 esgG4&gt;GFP/KO2 (Mann-Whitney test).</p><p>Given that there was no significant loss of a class of more severely affected animals, we suggest that the apparent difference reflects a delay in tissue replacement in the mutant, so that most animals end up with milder defects by the end of pupariation than were apparent during the time window for making the movies. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref> and mentioned in the text.</p><p>Quantification: please note that the quantification of the segment gap phenotype was given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.

The effects of loss of miR-965 on wg expression was weak, and reduction of wg was not a very effective suppressor. This needs clarification with further data or, failing that, the conclusion that wg is a significant target of miR-965 in histoblast development needs to be more cautious</italic>.</p><p>Wg protein level was higher and its range expanded in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The question is whether that upregulation has an impact on the phenotype. The evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> says that Wg upregulation does contribute.</p><p>The reviewers’ point is based on the magnitude of the effects of manipulating stg and wg activity in the mir-965 mutant background. Because these data are represented in a quantitative manner, it is tempting to interpret the magnitude of the effect as an indication of how “significant” misregulation of the target is to the phenotype. This might be misleading, for the following reason.</p><p>In order to be able to compare the relative contribution of each target, we would need to be able to reduce each of them back to normal levels in the mutant background. We lack the means to control target levels so precisely. So, we prefer to limit our interpretation of this class of experiment to a qualitative assessment: Does upregulation of Wg contribute to the mutant phenotype? We believe that the evidence presented answers this question.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ comments, we have changed the text to highlight that the magnitude of the effects of Wg are smaller than those of String. We have added the following text to help the reader think about how to interpret the magnitude differences:</p><p>“Next, we tested the effect of removing one copy each of <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>wg.</italic> The segment gap phenotype was reduced comparing <italic>KO1/KO2</italic> vs <italic>KO1 wg</italic><sup><italic>SP-1</italic></sup><italic>/KO2</italic>; <italic>stg</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, p&lt;0.001, Fisher’s exact test). Taking out one copy each of <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> lowered penetrance of the phenotype to ∼4%, compared with 6-7% for Stg/+ alone or 12% for Wg/+ alone.</p><p>These experiments provide evidence that overexpression of <italic>string</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> each contribute to the <italic>miR-965</italic> mutant histoblast phenotypes. The effect of limiting Wg expression in the mutant background may appear to be smaller than that of limiting String. However, to make a meaningful comparison of the relative contribution of these two targets, it would be necessary to restore each of them to normal levels. The genetic method used to reduce target activity in the mutant background does not allow precise control over the final target level, so this question cannot be addressed. We do not exclude the possibility that there could be other functionally significant targets in addition to Wg and String.”</p><p><italic>3) Since mutation of the miR-965 site in the stg 3' UTR does not fully rescue the luciferase reporter expression, it is possible that miR-965 might have other indirect effects which might effect stg. This ought to be acknowledged</italic>.</p><p>We added: “however, we do not exclude the possibility that there could also be indirect effects of <italic>miR-965</italic> on expression of this reporter. ”</p><p><italic>4) mir-965 is predicted to target 69 genes, so it should be clarified whether these are the only two targets with functional relevance to the phenotypes observed. This can be addressed by testing whether reduction of both stg and wg together completely rescue the phenotype of mir-965 mutants? At least it needs to be clear whether there are other relevant targets, even if they are unidentified</italic>.</p><p>Data on the combined effects of lowering stg and wg have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. Removing both together further suppressed the defect, beyond the level reached by either alone. ∼4% of individuals still showed a phenotype. This could be due to partial offsetting of the increase in target expression (ie residual target excess not allowing complete suppression) or it could be interpreted to mean that there are other targets. Please see the response to point 2 above. The new text highlights the possibility of additional targets.</p><p><italic>5) The role of ecdysone, which is an important physiological element of the model, also needs some further clarification</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise multiple points. I’ve separated them for clarity.</p><p><italic>How functionally important is the ecdysone regulation of stg in histoblasts? Is it dependent on miR-965?</italic></p><p>To address this, we asked if depletion of EcR would affect string mRNA levels in the <italic>miR-965</italic> mutant background. String levels were not affected, so it appears that up-regulation of miR-965 is needed for EcR to act on string mRNA at this stage. Data are in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p><italic>And the effect of EcR loss on wg expression was not explored: if wg is a significant player, this is a gap that needs to be addressed</italic>.</p><p>We examined the relationship between EcR and string at the onset of pupariation (0hr white prepupae), when the Ecdysone pulse induces <italic>string</italic> to trigger histoblast proliferation. Wg expression begins in the histoblast nests from 15hr after pupariation, so it is not evident that we should expect the link between EcR and wg to be analogous to that with string. Nonetheless, we did test <italic>wg</italic> transcript in the 0hr prepupal RNA samples used for the string experiment: there was no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). We did not include the <italic>wg</italic> data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, but can do so if the editors request it.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07389.038</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07389.038">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07389.038</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07389-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>New data added on the relationship between EcR and miR965:</italic></p><p>While exploring the relationship between EcR and miR-965, we’ve made an interesting new finding: EcR and miR-965 appear to be linked in a mutual repression feedback loop in which EcR and miR-965 repress each other. The new data on repression of EcR by miR965 consists of:</p><p>1) qPCR to show that both EcR mRNA levels increase in the miR-965 background. Both mature and primary transcript were affected, suggesting that miR-965 acts indirectly to limit EcR transcription. Data are in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p>2) We also tested for possible direct effects of miR-965 on an EcR 3’ UTR reporter transgene, but did not see evidence for direct regulation of EcR by the miRNA. The data are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Mutual repression circuitry of this type can contribute a switch-like function: EcR activity lowers 965 activity, which allows greater EcR expression/activity by alleviating miR-965 mediated repression. In a circuit of this design, there will be a delay between reduced transcription of the miRNA primary transcript and the decay of the mature miRNA product. Hence sustained EcR activity is needed to throw the switch.</p><p>We previously reported that EcR shows positive transcriptional autoregulation and that this is buffered by miR-14 in a mutual repression circuit (Varghese &amp; Cohen, 2007). Positive feedback allows for a sharp switch-like response, but also makes the system very sensitive to stochastic fluctuation in EcR activity. Coupling EcR positive feedback to miRNA-mediated mutual repression allows a robust switch function upon Ecdysone stimulation, while protecting the system from the effects of random fluctuation in EcR levels that might otherwise trigger a feedback response. Our new data provides evidence that miR-965 plays an analogous role in regulating EcR response and suggests that miR-965 confers robustness to the EcR response in the histoblasts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
