In vitro, their counterparts are embryonic (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), respectively. Activation of the FGF signaling cascade results in mouse ESCs differentiating into mEpiSCs, indicative of its requirement in the shift between these states. However, only mouse ESCs correspond to the naive state; ESCs from other mammals and from chick show primed state characteristics. Thus, the significance of the naive state is unclear. In this study, we use zebra finch as a model for comparative ESC studies. The finch blastoderm has mESC-like properties, while chick blastoderm exhibits EpiSC features. In the absence of FGF signaling, finch cells retained expression of pluripotent markers, which were lost in cells from chick or aged finch epiblasts. Our data suggest that the naive state of pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved among amniotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07178.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07178.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07178.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, stem cells divide to give rise to other cells that have specialized roles in the body. ‘Pluripotent’ stem cells—which are able to produce cells of any type—can be obtained from young mouse embryos. Once grown in the laboratory, these cells are called naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their discovery has been vitally important for understanding how mammals develop. ESCs also have considerable medical potential because they could be used to repair or replace tissues that have been lost to injury or disease.</p><p>A family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) triggers naive ESCs to mature into another class of stem cell that are ‘primed’ to only produce particular types of cells. Curiously, the stem cells that have been collected from other mammal embryos are already in this primed state. Therefore, biologists wonder whether the naive state is exclusive to mice embryos, or whether it is present in other animals but has so far remained undetected.</p><p>The development of chick and other bird embryos shares many parallels with that of mammals. However, embryos in chicken eggs do not contain naive ESCs. It is possible that this is due to chicken eggs being laid when the embryos have reached a later stage in development where the naive stem cells have already matured into the primed cells. Here, Mak et al. compared the stem cells in chick embryos to those from another bird called the zebra finch.</p><p>The experiments show that the finch embryos contain stem cells that share several features with mouse ESCs. In particular, these finch cells continue to express genes that are required for the naive state to be maintained in the absence of FGF. On the other hand, these genes are switched off in cells from chick embryos and in older zebra finch stem cells.</p><p>Mak et al.'s findings show that finch eggs are laid at an earlier stage of embryo development than chicken eggs. The experiments also suggest that both birds and mammals have naive pluripotent stem cells during the early stages of embryo development. In future, the zebra finch could be used as a model to study stem cells and other aspects of animal development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07178.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07178.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>zebra finch</kwd><kwd>ES cell</kwd><kwd>early embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mak</surname><given-names>Siu-Shan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mak</surname><given-names>Siu-Shan</given-names></name><name><surname>Wrabel</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Honda</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Finch embryos are laid at an earlier stage than other avian embryos and contain cells with similar properties to pluripotent embryonic stem cells from mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The successful isolation and in vitro culture of embryonic stem cells (ESC) from mouse embryos have enabled technological breakthroughs and revolutionized our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans, 2011</xref>). However, similar applications to other species have been lacking. One conceptual difficulty has been linking the innate pluripotency of the embryo with the characteristics of cultured stem cells, raising the speculation that mESCs may be solely a result of in vitro manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pauklin et al., 2011</xref>). In the mouse, ESCs are at naive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>), which recent evidence suggests is most similar to cells from embryonic day (E) 4–4.5 of mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>). Cells taken from this stage can give rise to derivatives of all three germ layers as well as germ cells. These cells, both in their native naive state and in culture, express genes associated with pluripotency such as <italic>Oct3/4</italic> (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>), <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Nanog</italic> (2). Using defined media that includes the presence of either an inhibitor of FGF signaling or its downstream Erk/MAP kinase transduction pathway, mouse ESCs (mESCs) can be propagated while maintaining the expression of these pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ying et al., 2008</xref>). A second pluripotent cell type in the mouse, epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs), is derived from embryos that are later in development (E5.5) and is in what has been termed, the primed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brons et al., 2007</xref>). These cells have a more limited potency and require different culture condition for in vitro propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</xref>), with a dependency on FGF-mediated ERK activation for the maintenance of pluripotent gene expression. Pluripotent ESCs from other mammalian organisms, such as human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thomson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schatten et al., 2005</xref>), and from non-mammalian amniotes, such as chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pain et al., 1996</xref>), share this requirement for ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tesar et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, the primed state of pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved in mammalian and non-mammalian amniotes. However, the naive state has so far only been confirmed in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ying et al., 2008</xref>) and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buehr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>), raising the possibility that this state is not conserved among the amniotes. More recent reports suggested that with specific reprogramming factors and culture conditions such a naive state may also exist for human ESCs, although the exact nature of these naive-type human cells is under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ware et al., 2014</xref>). Identifying the naive state of embryogenesis in other species is therefore central to our conceptual understanding of pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>A comparative embryology approach to address this question should include non-mammalian amniotes. These include avian species, which share key molecular and cellular features of epiblast morphogenesis with the mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheng, 2014</xref>), yet are evolutionarily distant enough to serve as an outgroup. As in all amniotes, fertilization of avian oocytes takes place internally and avian embryos undergo some development prior to egg-laying (oviposition). The most widely used avian developmental models are chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), quail (<italic>Coturnix japonica</italic>), and zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>). However, chicken embryos at oviposition are already at a late blastula/early gastrulation stage (Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (EGK) stage X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>). These embryos have a columnar epithelialized epiblast overlying scattered hypoblasts and are thus morphologically similar to E5.5 mouse embryo, later than the stage at which mESCs can be derived. The Japanese quail embryos are laid at a stage later than the chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sellier et al., 2006</xref>), while the ovipositional stage of zebra finch embryos is unclear. Early-staged avian embryos can generate cells that show some of the characteristics of mammalian ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jean et al., 2015</xref>) after the introduction of reprogramming factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rossello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2014</xref>) or after the manipulation of culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pain et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jean et al., 2013</xref>). However, it was not clear how the pluripotency generated be exogenous factors related to the pluripotent state of cells in the embryo. We decided to investigate the early development of the zebra finch (hereafter referred to as the finch) in more detail. The finches are a model system commonly used in neurobiological studies of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brazas and Shimizu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svec et al., 2009</xref>), vocalization, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarvis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petkov and Jarvis, 2012</xref>). These studies have led to an increased focus on the developmental neurobiology of zebra finch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charvet and Striedter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>), and in turn the embryology of the finch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murray et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the finch genome has been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Warren et al., 2010</xref>) and their relatively small adult body sizes (4–7 times smaller than adult chickens) and shorter generation time (2–3 months for finches vs 4–6 months for the chickens) makes it feasible to breed them within a normal laboratory setting. Thus, we asked whether finch embryos could be used for early embryogenesis and ESCs studies, complementing existing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rossello et al., 2013</xref>), which together may lead to potential technological breakthroughs that facilitate genetic and functional investigations in this model organism.</p><p>Here, we report the first molecular characterization of ovipositional finch blastoderms by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemical staining, and in situ hybridization. Our results suggested that finch embryos are laid at stage EGK-VI to EGK-VIII, much earlier than the chicken embryos, and are morphologically more similar to the E4–E4.5 mouse embryos from which mESCs can be derived. Cells derived from the finch blastoderm at oviposition and cultured in the presence of a MEK inhibitor and Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) retained expression of the pluripotent markers; <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>PouV</italic> expression, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity<italic>.</italic> In contrast, chicken cells taken from newly laid embryos and cultured under the same conditions did not produce <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>PouV</italic>, or AP-positive aggregates. Our data suggest that birds and mammals share a common regulatory mechanism in the maintenance of pluripotency. Finch embryos are ideally suited for the establishment and characterization of avian ESCs, and the incorporation of recent technical improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2014</xref>) could lead to the finch becoming a tractable avian model for genetics and regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Finch oviposition is at EGK-VI prior to subgerminal cavity expansion</title><p>Avian embryos undergo varying degrees of intrauterine development prior to oviposition (egg-laying). Chick oviposition is at the late blastula/early gastrula stage (EGK-X to EGK-XI). In other <italic>Galloanserae</italic>, oviposition ranges from EGK-VII (Turkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta and Bakst, 1993</xref>] and Duck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sellier et al., 2006</xref>]) to EGK-XI (the quail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stepinska and Olszanska, 1983</xref>]). Ratite embryos are laid at EGK-X, similar to the chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagai et al., 2011</xref>). The oviposition stage of <italic>Passerine</italic> (songbird) species has not been carefully investigated, although gross morphology of newly laid embryos of the zebra finch and society finch (Bengalese finch) suggested that they are younger than EGK-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamasaki and Tonosaki, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murray et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the difficulty in retrieving pre-ovipositional (&lt;EGK-X) chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagai et al., 2015</xref>), we decided to further explore the potential advantages of finch eggs and carried out a detailed morphological and molecular characterization of ovipositional finch embryos in order to evaluate their potential use for comparative stem cell studies as well as for genome engineering.</p><p>Finch eggs are laid in intervals of between 20 and 29 hr, with most laid following a 24- to 25-hr periodicity. Based on the EGK staging system for pre-oviposition chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>), we found that finch embryos from newly laid eggs ranged from EGK-VI to EGK-VIII, with ∼10% of eggs at EGK-VI and the rest at EGK-VII and -VIII. To probe morphological and molecular heterogeneity of the finch blastoderm, we first used section analysis of embryos stained for Hhex, a marker for endoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). At EGK-VI (early blastula), the embryo was composed of similar-sized blastoderm cells organized into 7–8 layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The subgerminal (blastocoel) cavity was not as apparent as in similarly staged chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheng, 2014</xref>). By EGK-VIII (mid-blastula stage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the subgerminal cavity and the area pellucida became apparent and the embryo was thinner at the center of the blastoderm (4–5 cell-thick) than at EGK-VI. Cells located apically, closer to the vitelline membrane (the putative epiblast precursors) were smaller than those located closer to the yolk side (the putative hypoblast precursors). A low level of <italic>Hhex</italic> expression was detected in the hypoblast precursors. Post-ovipositional incubation of around 6 hr yielded finch embryos at EGK-X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At this stage, the epiblast and hypoblast were clearly separated and the epiblast showed a columnar epithelial organization. In addition, strong <italic>Hhex</italic> expression was detected in the hypoblasts.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07178.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphology of the finch blastoderm at oviposition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Finch embryos were sectioned after <italic>Hhex</italic> in situ hybridization to reveal the morphology of the blastoderm.

To understand the transformation of the epithelial morphology between EGK-VI to EGK-X, we asked if there were changes to E-cadherin and ß-catenin localization consistent with epithelialization of the early embryo. At EGK-VI, both E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and ß-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) were expressed in all cells. Staining did not appear to be enriched in any particular region of the cell and epithelialization was not apparent. By EGK-VIII, formation of an epithelial cell-sheet was not observed although the nuclei of the outermost, putative epiblast, cells appeared more regularly organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H</xref>). In contrast, deep, putative hypoblast, cells appeared to down-regulate both proteins. By EGK-X, E-cadherin was up-regulated in the lateral regions of the epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

In chick, a different SoxB family member, Sox3 is expressed in epiblast precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rex et al., 1997</xref>). We thus used Sox3 and Gata4 to determine the presence and distribution of these cell types in EGK-VI/VIII finch embryos.

These genes have been defined from work in the mammalian species and adapted to avian species more recently. We first tested core pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

We hypothesized that finch blastodermal cells may act more like mESCs, whereas chick blastodermal cells would behave more similarly to mEpiSCs. An important difference between mESCs and mEpiSCs is the effect of extracellular receptor kinase (Erk) pathway inhibition. Naive mESCs culture is aided by blockage of Erk pathway in the presence of LIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nichols and Smith, 2012</xref>), whereas mEpiSCs do not. In order to test this hypothesis, individual blastoderms from finch or chick embryos at oviposition were isolated, dissociated, and cultured.

However, these aggregated colonies did not show AP activity nor did they express pluripotency-associated genes (<italic>Nanog</italic> or <italic>PouV</italic>). Inclusion of LIF in the culture media had little effect on the morphological and molecular features of either chick or finch-dissociated blastodermal cells.

Mouse data suggest that in permissive strains, ES cells can be derived from embryos at around E4–E4.5 of development, a stage that has been termed the naive stage of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>). The epiblast and hypoblast cell lineage has been specified at this stage and is dispersed throughout the inner cell mass; however, epithelialization has yet to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plusa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artus et al., 2011</xref>). We find that the finch embryo at oviposition displays similar characteristics: although the epiblast, hypoblast, and germ line are specified, these cells are dispersed throughout the multi-layered blastoderm, which has yet to epithelialize. It is likely that the sorting mechanisms that ensure segregation of germs layers are similar to those in the mouse, but would require further study. However, given the accessibility of early avian development in the finch embryo, these and other comparative studies to test hypotheses on the evolution of germ layer formation in amniotes are possible.</p><p>Pluripotent gene expression in blastodermal cells derived from finch embryos is independent of the Erk pathway. This is also an important feature of mouse ES cells. In contrast, in our culture regimen, chick blastodermal cells do not retain pluripotent gene expression when cultured with an ERK pathway inhibitor, a feature of mEpiSC. Our data thus suggest that the finch blastoderm at oviposition is likely to correspond to the naive stage of embryogenesis. Furthermore, the evolutionary distance between finch and mouse suggests that the naive stage during embryogenesis is conserved amongst amniotes and that this stage likely corresponds to the pre-epithelialized epiblast in amniotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07178.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Putative conservation of the naive stage during amniote embryogenesis.</title><p>Similar to mouse pre-implantation embryos (around E4), prior to epiblast epithelialisation, zebra finch embryos at oviposition are at early–mid-blastula stages (EGK-VI/VIII) show no overt morphological segregation despite the expression of epiblast and primitive endoderm/hypoblast markers in distinct sub-populations of cells with the embryo. Cells from mouse and finch at this stage do not require ERK activation for the maintenance of pluripotent marker expression in vitro. Chick embryos at oviposition are more similar to the mouse blastula where epithelialisation has occurred. Similarly, cells from chick and mouse embryos at this stage are unable to maintain pluripotent marker expression when ERK signaling is inhibited.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07178.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07178.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07178-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The relationship between the pre-epithelialized epiblast and pluripotency is not clear. Recent data suggest that a mesenchymal to epithelial transition is important for efficient reprogramming of somatic cells into iPScells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Samavarchi-Tehrani et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, E-cadherin, which is important in establishing epithelia, mediates LIF signaling during ES cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">del Valle et al., 2013</xref>). While, this does seem contrary to the notion that ES cell derivation occurs from the pre-epithelialized epiblast, we found that despite a lack of epithelialization of the newly laid finch blastoderm, E-cadherin is still highly expressed. This is similar to E-cadherin expression profile in the mouse late blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, more than a mesenchymal to epithelial transition, perhaps the expression of E-cadherin represents a metastable, transitional state during mesenchymal–epithelial transition that is permissive for ES cell derivation. This also suggests that the ability to form epithelial-type adhesive contacts is present but inhibited at early/mid-blastula stages. This may be due to the presence of endogenous inhibitors of E-cadherin homophillic interactions, or alternatively it may be simply that the full repertoire of epithelial-type adhesion molecules is not yet expressed. Consistent with this is the differing adhesive properties of finch and chick blastodermal cells in culture. Chick blastodermal cells were able to adhere to a wide variety of substrates; however, optimal growth of finch blastodermal cells was only observed when type IV collagen was used as a substrate.</p><p>The question then remains: how does the pluripotent characteristics of isolated cells relate to the epiblast? One scenario could be that the epiblast consists of mixed populations of cells in varying states of pluripotency, and that the culture conditions employed can stabilize, select for, induce, or enrich for a particular state. Several lines of evidence suggest that this is the case. The use of MEK inhibition promotes the production of ES cells from the epithelialized epiblast of mouse strains that are otherwise refractory for ES cell derivation. Conversely, EpiSC cells can be isolated from the pre-epithelialized epiblast of the majority of mouse strains that do not readily produce ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Najm et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests a mixed population of cell states, and our data support this view: finch epiblast cells at oviposition likely contain sufficient numbers of naive state cells such that MEK inhibition is able to then stabilize and select for them. The situation in avians is less clear: culture conditions and exogenously introduced genes can significantly alter the pluripotency state of these cells. Transcriptional profiling suggests that chick ES cells, that are cultured in a complex but defined mix of growth factors and additives, are more similar to mouse ES cells than to mouse EpiSC, but are less similar to the chicken blastodermal cells from which they are derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jean et al., 2015</xref>). Chick iPS cells also display characteristics of ES cells, with AP activity detectable in colonies in the presence of MEK inhibition. However, these observations do not suggest how induced pluripotency relates to normal early embryonic development. Our data suggest that in a minimal media, naive pluripotency in finch blastodermal cells is insensitive to MEK inhibition, whereas chick blastodermal cells require MEK for the expression of pluripotent markers, in these conditions. The challenge is to now further stabilize the naive pluripotent fate of finch blastodermal cells and in combination with recent advances in avian cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jean et al., 2015</xref>), develop this technology for understanding and manipulating avian development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebra finch husbandry, eggs and embryos collection</title><p>Zebra finches were maintained under a 13:11-hr light–dark cycle with constant room temperature (RT) at 23°C. Eggs were collected every 2 hr from the onset of the light cycle and could be stored at 17–20°C for up to 5 days without any observable drop in hatchability. Sexing of the finches was performed by PCR amplification from genomic DNA isolated from feather pulps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2001</xref>). Detailed finch husbandry protocols are available in a separate manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35a">Mak et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fertile chicken eggs were purchased from Shiroyama Farm (Kanagawa, Japan). Staging of the pre-primitive streak embryos followed a system previously described in the chick and are stated as Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stages (EGK) -I to EGK-XIV in this manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>). Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) system was used for embryos of streak stages and onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>). Chicken blastoderms were collected with a paper ring. Finch blastoderms were micro-dissected from eggs by tungsten needles owing to their small size and yolk removed as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Blastodermal culture</title><p>Both chick and finch blastoderms were cut out in Ringer's solution. At early stages, yolk is strongly adherent to the embryo, and the bulk of this was removed by gentle aspiration with a P1000 pipetteman. This left a layer of yolk adherent to the embryo. To remove this layer, the partially cleaned embryos were transferred to 0.45% D-Glucose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) in HBSS+ (HBSSg) solution and left at RT for 2 hr. After incubation, this yolk layer could be lifted from the embryo by gentle aspiration around the periphery the embryo. Embryos were then be collected and centrifuged at 400×<italic>g</italic> for 2 min. The pellet was resuspended in ED medium (ESGRO [EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States]: DMEM in 1:1) supplemented with Glutamax (Gibco, Waltham, MA., United States), essential amino acid (Gibco), 0.3 mM 2-mercapthoethanol, sodium pyruvate (1:100, Gibco), and 1% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated and grown at different culture conditions. In experiments using MEK inhibitor (PD0325901, Stemgent, Lexington, MA, United States), GSK3ß inhibitors (CHIR99021, Stemgent), the PKC inhibitor (Gö6983 Sigma), and human LIF (LIF1005, EMD Millipore), half to one finch blastoderm per well of an 8-well slide chamber (177445, Nunc Nalgene, Waltham, MA, United States) was used in all experiments unless specified. 1/8 of the chick blastoderm at EGK-X was seeded in each well of an 8-well slide chamber. The growth of avian cells on a variety of substrates was also tested. Substrates tested were 0.1% or 0.25% gelatin (G1393, Sigma) in PBS, collagen type I (C2249, Sigma), type IV (C0543, Sigma), type VI (F1141, Sigma), recombinant E-cadherin (MAB1838, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States), growth factor-reduced matrigel (354230, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States), fibronectin (F5022, Sigma) and pronectin F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishishita et al., 2012</xref>) (a kind gift from Shin Kawamata, Foundation of Biomedical Research and Innovation, Kobe, Japan) or laminin (354458, BD Biosciences). Chicken cells grew much more robustly than finch cells and could grow on many different surface types (0.1% or 0.25% gelatin in PBS, collagen type I, type IV, type VI, recombinant E-cadherin, matrigel, fibronectin, pronectin F, or laminin). Optimal growth for chicken blastoderm cells was seen with type I and IV collagen, on which ES colony-like cell aggregates arose after 4-day culture. Optimal growth for finch blastoderm cells was obtained on human placenta type IV collagen-coated surface. We therefore used this coating for all subsequent studies. For Q-PCR analysis, cells were dissociated from the dish using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, spun down, and resuspended in lysis buffer before RNA extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Endogenous AP activity detection and antibody staining of embryos and cultured cells</title><p>AP activity was detected by incubating 4% PFA fixed sections of embryos/cultured cells with 4.5 μl/ml NBT (BD Bioscience) and 3.5 μl/ml BCIP (BD Bioscience) substrates. Immunofluorescent staining was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, sections were blocked with 2% skim milk/PBST (0.1% Triton X-100 [Sigma] in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. The primary antibody was applied on 12-to 14-μm cryosections and the slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were: SSEA-1 and EMA-1 (used in 1:200, Developmental studies hybridoma bank), SOX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>) (in 1:300, a gift of Sara Wilson, Umeå University, Sweden), GATA6 (1:1000, R&amp;D), E-cadherin (1:200, BD Bioscience), and ß-catenin (1:200, BD Bioscience). Slides were rinsed in PBST and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa dyes were applied. The slides were incubated at RT for 4 hr. After rinsing with PBST, the nuclei of the samples were counter-stained with DAPI (1:4000, Dojindo) and mounted in Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham MA, United States). Detection for the finch Vasa homologue was also attempted. Six antibodies against the chick VASA homologue (CVH/DDX) were tested, namely VN1, VN2, VC3, and VC4 (gifts from Bertrand Pain, unpublished); anti-VASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsunekawa et al., 2000</xref>) and anti-CVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lambeth et al., 2013</xref>). These were used on the sections of zebra finch blastoderms and day 9 gonads, as well as the chicken day 12 gonads as a positive control.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior Editor), Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewing Editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Mak and colleagues characterize the primitive blastoderm and pluripotent cells of the early zebra finch embryo. They show that oviposition occurs at an earlier developmental stage than the chick allowing access to the potential naïve state of pluripotency. Their data on expression analysis of naïve and primed pluripotency markers and some culture experiments broadly support their claim that the finch blastoderm is in a more naïve state than the chick blastoderm. All reviewers generally considered the work to be an exciting study that explores a novel model organism not previously used to study pluripotency and which potentially allows the study in a bird of a developmental stage likely to correspond to the late blastocyst of the mouse.</p><p>There is, however, a general consensus that the work would benefit from a more extensive consideration of the available literature and further characterization of the lines described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>. More precisely:</p><p>1) There are some recent papers in the literature on generating induced pluripotent stem cells in different avian species and mice. The authors mention nothing about these papers, and how they interpret such their findings in light of these past findings. For example, Rossello et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2012) generated and compared iPSC-like cells from finch, chicken, quail, and mice. They claim that the chicken iPSC-like cells are more like the mouse than the finch is, which is the opposite conclusion of the current study in terms of stem cell phenotype.

The Discussion is re-written in light of them. Our main purpose is to understand how normal development relates to the derivation of ES cells. The studies from both the Pain and Jarvis labs do suggest that the chick ES and chick IPS cells exhibit certain features similar to mouse ES cells. However, in both cases significant manipulation is involved – in the case of the Pain group by manipulating culture conditions, and in the case of the Jarvis group, introducing the Yamanaka factors. In this work, we used direct comparison (between chick and finch embryos, and between early finch and late finch embryos) without any experimental manipulation, or used mouse ES cell culture conditions and investigated the effect of only the MEK inhibitor and LIF without any other inhibitor(s). This enabled a more straightforward comparison. Our data suggest that finch embryos at oviposition exhibit clear molecular and morphological features indicative of them being at a naïve state of development, whereas chick embryos show features of them being closer to the primed state. That said, we do not think that data from our lab and other labs contradict each other for two reasons. First, although chick embryos are at a primed developmental state, the molecular data also suggested that they are less primed than originally assumed, as it retains some levels of expression of naïve pluripotent markers. Second, we do not think that there is a fundamental difference between the chick and finch embryos, aside from their ovipositional stages; and all of these studies combined support our claim that there is a naïve state of development in birds and conservation of the naïve state of embryogenesis amongst amniotes.</p><p><italic>2) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6"><italic>Figures 5 and 6</italic></xref> <italic>are not fully supportive of the finch blastoderm being in a naïve state at oviposition, and the chick being in a primed state.

As the reviewers had suggested, we performed additional experiments by comparing ovipositional finch embryos before and after incubation (i.e., comparing EGK-VI-VIII finch embryos with EGK-X-XI finch embryo). The data (presented in revision <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with our chick/finch comparison (revision <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In both types of comparisons, no cDNA amplification was involved, and multiple biological replicates were prepared and quadruple Q-PCR reactions for each sample were performed. We think our Q-PCR data are statistical rigorous. We do agree with the reviewers that cross-species comparison of Q-PCR data should be interpreted with caution. We therefore would like to thank the reviewers for suggesting this experiment, which is now shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which provided even stronger evidence for a transition from naïve to primed stages as development proceeds. We also tested the other experiment suggested by this reviewer, by performing Q-PCR analysis of cultured blastoderm cells (revision <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Due to the small amounts of RNA obtainable from a single colony and subsequent errors that could be introduced by cDNA amplification, as well as the “user bias”, all cells within a single well were used for Q-PCR analysis. Molecular data from this experiment suggest that MEK inhibition helps retain naïve markers in cultured blastoderm cells (revision <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The results together strengthen our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
