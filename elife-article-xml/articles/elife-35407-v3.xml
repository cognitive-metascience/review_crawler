Most differentiation events are switch-like and instruct progenitor cells to decisively adopt a more specialized fate. Epigenetic and transcriptional control have long been known to drive differentiation, and self-reinforcing circuits built around transcription factors or chromatin modifiers help establish the switch-like character of these reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atlasi and Stunnenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pijnappel et al., 2013</xref>). Recent work suggested that posttranslational modifications, including monoubiquitylation, guide differentiation events also independently of gene expression, yet the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood.</p><p>Monoubiquitylation plays a critical role during craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGourty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). This process begins with the emergence of neural crest cells, which originate at the border of the neural plate and non-neural ectoderm and migrate to various target tissues in a developing organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betancur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>). Upon reaching their destination, neural crest cells differentiate into various derivatives, including chondrocytes, melanocytes, or glial cells. Cranial neural crest cells emerge at the rostral end of the neural tube, migrate to the branchial arches of the developing head, and differentiate into chondrocytes that lay out a collagen matrix for subsequent bone formation. Accordingly, the misregulation of cranial neural crest specification or differentiation results in pathologies that are characterized by the aberrant formation of craniofacial bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achilleos and Trainor, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Generation of neural crest cells relies on the E3 ligase CUL3 and its substrate adaptor KBTBD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> monoubiquitylates the RNA-binding proteins TCOF1 and NOLC1, which allows these paralogs to associate with each other and recruit enzymes of ribosome biogenesis and modification. The subsequent production of new and possibly modified ribosomes reshapes the mRNA translation landscape of stem cells in favor of neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). Underscoring the importance of this regulatory circuit for human biology, mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> account for ~90% of cases of the craniofacial disease Treacher Collins Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">The Treacher Collins Syndrome Colla, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones et al., 2008</xref>), while additional transcription factor binding sites in the promoter of <italic>KBTBD8</italic> drive melanoma, a cancer of neural crest origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayward et al., 2017</xref>). At later stages of craniofacial development, CUL3 pairs up with a distinct adaptor, KLHL12, to monoubiquitylate a COPII vesicle coat protein and accelerate collagen secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGourty et al., 2016</xref>), and mutations in this pathway lead to the craniofacial disorder cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyadjiev et al., 2006</xref>). Together, these findings revealed critical roles of monoubiquitylation in cell differentiation and implied that tight regulation of CUL3 is essential for human development.</p><p>Despite its importance for neural crest specification, mechanisms that ensure accurate CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> activation and function are very poorly understood. While CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> is essential for establishing neural crest cells, it is not required for the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). This suggested that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> engages its targets at specific stages of differentiation, yet how it recognizes its substrates at the right time and place is not known. How monoubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> helps TCOF1 and NOLC1 bind each other is also unclear: while monoubiquitylation often recruits effector proteins to a modified target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dikic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>), no ubiquitin-binding domains have been identified in TCOF1, NOLC1, or their known binding partners. Indeed, rather than being organized into structural domains that engage in distinct interactions, TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain large stretches of acidic residues that are predicted to be of low structural complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). How monoubiquitylation of an intrinsically disordered protein can precipitate a switch-like transition in cellular state is an open question.</p><p>Here, we show that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent monoubiquitylation and neural crest specification require multisite substrate phosphorylation by CK2, a kinase whose levels gradually increase during development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mestres et al., 1994</xref>). The essential CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 contain 10 or more motifs that, following their phosphorylation by CK2, can be independently recognized by a conserved surface on KBTBD8. We found that multiple CK2 motifs need to be phosphorylated in the same substrate to mediate both monoubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> as well as neural crest specification. Multisite dependency allows cells to convert a gradual increase in kinase input, as seen for embryonic CK2, into decisive activation of signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunawardena, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapuy et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore propose that multisite dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> provides an elegant mechanism for switch-like cell fate decisions controlled by monoubiquitylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CK2 kinase is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent neural crest specification</title><p>CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> drives neural crest specification by catalyzing the monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), but how it selects its targets at the right time during development is not known. As substrate recognition by cullin-RING ligases often requires posttranslational modifications or co-adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGourty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>), we speculated that regulators of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> could be identified as shared interactors of NOLC1 and TCOF1. We therefore affinity-purified <sup>FLAG</sup>NOLC1 and <sup>FLAG</sup>TCOF1 from human 293T embryonic kidney cells, a system that had previously allowed us to discover stem cell-related signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGourty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), and analyzed the immunoprecipitates by CompPASS mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). These experiments showed that both NOLC1 and TCOF1 interacted with all subunits of the CK2 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which was consistent with earlier studies that found these proteins to be phosphorylated by CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meier and Blobel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wise et al., 1997</xref>). We confirmed the robust interaction of NOLC1 and TCOF1 with CK2α and CK2β by affinity-purification and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CK2 kinase is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate binding and ubiquitylation in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Both NOLC1 and TCOF1 associate with the CK2 kinase. <sup>FLAG</sup>NOLC1 and <sup>FLAG</sup>TCOF1 were affinity-purified from 293 T cells and specific binding partners were determined by CompPASS mass spectrometry. Total spectral counts (TSCs) of specific interactors were normalized to 1000 TSCs for each bait protein and plotted against each other. For each CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate, three independent affinity-purification and mass spectrometry experiments were performed. The results of each affinity experiments were compared to a database, which included ~100 unrelated affinity-purifications performed with the same antibody and in the same cell line.

PKN1 is a specific binding partner of KBTBD8 that is not known to be ubiquitylated by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> and that is not important for neural crest specification. (<bold>D</bold>) CK2 is required for monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 in cells. Ubiquitylated proteins were purified under denaturing conditions from 293 T cells expressing <sup>HIS</sup>ubiquitin. Ubiquitylated proteins were detected by western blotting using the indicated antibodies.

Together with our binding studies, these observations suggested that phosphorylation by CK2 might play a role in target recognition and monoubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>. To test this hypothesis, we purified KBTBD8, the subunit of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> that directly binds substrates, from cells that were transfected with shRNAs against CK2β, that is the subunit shared by both CK2a/β and CK2α’/β complexes, and treated with a small molecule CK2 inhibitor (CX4945). Such effective inhibition of CK2 prevented NOLC1 or TCOF1 from binding to CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>, whereas PKN1, a protein that associates with a different surface of KBTBD8 and is not important for neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), was still recognized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Inhibition of CK2 also blocked CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1, while the modification of an unrelated protein, PCNA, was not impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In line with these results, inactivation of PP1 and PP2A phosphatases, which oppose CK2 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Popescu et al., 2009</xref>), strongly promoted substrate binding and monoubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Interestingly, the phosphatase subunit PP1A decreases during neural crest specification in vitro at times when TCOF1 and NOLC1 engage CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Monoubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> allows NOLC1 and TCOF1 to bind each other and recruit enzymes required for ribosome biogenesis and neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether CK2 is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent signaling, we therefore asked whether CK2 inhibition impaired formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes. As seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), we found that the expression of KBTBD8 caused TCOF1 and NOLC1 to associate with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Loss of CK2 prevented the CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent assembly of the TCOF1-NOLC1 platform to the same extent as inactivation of KBTBD8 through mutation of its CUL3-binding motif (KBTBD8<sup>Y74A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Accordingly, depletion of CK2β or small molecule inhibition of CK2 kinase activity interfered with neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We had previously shown that hESCs that fail to produce neural crest cells induce a compensatory pathway characterized by increased expression of forebrain markers, FOXG1 and SIX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), and we observed the same response if hESCs were subjected to differentiation in the absence of CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, low concentrations of the PP1 and PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid increased the efficiency of neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that CK2 is required for the recognition and monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>, formation of a TCOF1-NOLC1 ribosome biogenesis platform, and neural crest specification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CK2 is required for neural crest specification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CK2 is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>- and ubiquitylation-dependent formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes. <sup>FLAG</sup>TCOF1 was affinity-purified from control- or CK2 activity-depleted cells (shCK2β/CX4945) that expressed WT-KBTBD8 or mutant KBTBD8<sup>Y74A</sup>, which is unable to bind CUL3 and thus cannot catalyze monoubiquitylation.

Multiple E3 binding sites might ensure robust substrate ubiquitylation, as backup sites could buffer mutation or defective phosphorylation of a single motif. If this were to be the case, increasing the number of CK2 motifs should not improve substrate affinity under conditions of saturating kinase activity. Alternatively, studies on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor SIC1 found that multiple E3-binding sites could produce allovancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csizmok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2007</xref>): following dissociation of one SIC1-degron, neighboring E3 recognition motifs already in proximity to the enzyme rapidly rebind and thereby retain the interaction between the substrate and its E3. It would also be possible that multiple CK2 motifs access different positively charged patches on KBTBD8 in a multivalent manner. If the latter two mechanisms were at play for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>, adding more CK2 sites would be expected to increase the affinity of substrates for this E3. Supporting these models, we found in a competition assay that the more CK2 sites were included in TCOF1, the better it bound KBTBD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We noted a particularly prominent increase in substrate affinity if TCOF1 fragments contained six or more CK2 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed these results by monitoring the ability of immobilized KBTBD8 to retain TCOF1 fragments with increasing numbers of CK2 motifs. When assayed at high substrate concentration, TCOF1 fragments with 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 CK2 motifs were all able to bind KBTBD8 in a CK2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, if all peptides were incubated with KBTBD8 at the same time, only TCOF1 fragments with six or more CK2 motifs were retained by the E3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). When tested at substrate concentrations below the K<sub>D</sub> of a single CK2 motif, KBTBD8 only bound fragments with multiple CK2 motifs even in the absence of competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Under these conditions, KBTBD8 required dimerization for target recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which was also seen with KBTBD8 immunoprecipitated from cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), as well as in in vitro ubiquitylation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In contrast to the effects on affinity, increasing the number of E3-binding sites did not alter the nature of ubiquitylation, and a TCOF1-fragment with eight CK2 motifs was still only monoubiquitylated by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Thus, CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> requires multiple CK2 motifs for optimal substrate recognition, a feature that is referred to as multisite dependency.</p><p>Multisite dependency allows cells to translate small increases in the levels or activity of a kinase into large changes in signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csizmok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunawardena, 2005</xref>), which can introduce ultrasensitivity needed for switch-like differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serber and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). To test whether its mode of substrate recognition enables CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> to convert the gradual increase in CK2 levels during embryogenesis into decisive recognition of NOLC1 or TCOF1, we titrated CK2α/β into reactions that monitored the binding of a TCOF1 fragment with eight CK2 motifs to KBTBD8; to mimic the cellular situation, where many proteins compete for access to CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bian et al., 2013</xref>), we also included an excess competitor with two CK2 motifs. Notably, we found that in the presence of the competitor, TCOF1 was only able to bind KBTBD8 at high CK2 levels, where the affinity gain provided by eight phosphorylated CK2 motifs overcame the concentration advantage of the competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Accordingly, the Hill coefficient of the TCOF1-KBTBD8 binding reaction increased from ~1 in the absence of a competitor to ~3.5 in its presence, which is indicative of ultrasensitive behavior. Based on these observations, we infer that multisite dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> provides a mechanism for cells to translate a slow increase in CK2 levels into switch-like E3 substrate recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Multisite dependency by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> controls substrate recognition in cells</title><p>We finally wished to determine whether multisite dependency governed substrate regulation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> in cells.

Contrary to the wildtype protein, NOLC1<sup>CK1</sup> failed to bind endogenous KBTBD8 either in 293 T cells or in differentiating hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

In line with these results, we found that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent monoubiquitylation of NOLC1 and its ubiquitin-dependent association with TCOF1 required multiple CK2 motifs, and the most robust signaling was again observed in the presence of all phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Interestingly, NOLC1 variants with five or less CK2 motifs were ubiquitylated by an E3 ligase distinct from KBTBD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which did not promote TCOF1-NOLC1 complex formation and has an unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Multisite dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> substrate recognition in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A single CK2 motif is not sufficient for substrate recognition by KBTBD8 in cells.

Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), the loss of NOLC1 prevented neural crest specification and induced compensatory expression of forebrain markers, as seen by qRT-PCR, western blotting, or fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). These phenotypes could be rescued by shRNA-resistant wild-type NOLC1, which underscores the specificity of our depletion approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). When we introduced NOLC1 variants with increasing numbers of CK2 sites, we found that only those containing seven or more CK2 motifs were able to support neural crest specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). As seen with KBTBD8 binding and formation of the NOLC1-TCOF1 platform, wild-type NOLC1 containing all ten CK2 sites was most efficient in driving neural crest specification. Although it is difficult to exclude unknown effects of point mutations, the ability of NOLC1 variants to support neural crest specification therefore closely mirrored their ubiquitylation by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> in cells, and seven or more CK2 motifs need to be present in NOLC1 to allow for modification and function of this ribosome biogenesis factor. We conclude that multisite-dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> governs monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification, a switch-like change in cell fate.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multisite dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> during neural crest specification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple CK2 motifs in NOLC1 are required for its role in neural crest specification.

While phosphorylation is a common event in promoting substrate recognition by SCF E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>), this example shows that similar regulation exists for the CUL3 family of E3 ligases.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multisite dependency of substrate recognition by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup></title><p>The essential CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 each contain 10 or more motifs that can be independently phosphorylated by CK2 and mediate binding to KBTBD8 with comparable efficiency in vitro. Proteomic approaches found most of these CK2 motifs to be phosphorylated in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bian et al., 2013</xref>), which we confirmed in our own experiments. The CK2 motifs are spread throughout the central disordered domains of TCOF1 and NOLC1, and accordingly, we detected nine distinct monoubiquitylation sites on TCOF1 that were always in proximity to CK2 motifs. While we might have missed cellular ubiquitylation sites, these observations already suggested that multiple CK2 sites can function as CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-recognition motifs.</p><p>Fluorescence polarization measurements showed that KBTBD8 recognizes a single CK2 motif with a dissociation constant of ~1 μM, and steady-state assays indicated that the affinity of KBTBD8 for most CK2 motifs in TCOF1 or NOLC1 is in a similar range. KBTBD8 therefore binds more than 10 distinct motifs in TCOF1 or NOLC1 with an affinity that is akin to that of the E3 ligases SCF<sup>CDC4</sup> or UBR1 to their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csizmok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tasaki et al., 2009</xref>). However, a single CK2 motif was not sufficient for substrate binding by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> in cells, where hundreds of proteins compete for access to CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bian et al., 2013</xref>). The CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent binding and monoubiquitylation of NOLC1, formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes, and differentiation of hESCs into neural crest cells required at least seven CK2 motifs. We note that the presence of all 10 CK2 motifs resulted in more robust KBTBD8 recognition and neural crest specification, indicating that most, if not all, E3 binding sites contribute to CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate ubiquitylation and cell differentiation. We conclude that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> relies on multisite substrate phosphorylation for optimal target selection.</p><p>Our results are reminiscent of the yeast CDK inhibitor SIC1, whose recognition by the E3 ligase SCF<sup>CDC4</sup> requires ~5–6 phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csizmok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). In a mechanism referred to as allovalency, its multiple E3 binding sites allow the intrinsically disordered SIC1 to rapidly rebind SCF<sup>CDC4</sup> after a single motif dissociated. Similar to SIC1, TCOF1 and NOLC1 have multiple E3 binding motifs that are embedded in an acidic domain of intrinsic disorder (IDRs). TCOF1 and NOLC1, however, differ from SIC1 in that they contain a positively charged carboxy-terminal IDR with nuclear and nucleolar localization signals. Biophysical work suggested that ampholytic IDRs, such as TCOF1 or NOLC1, adopt a compact globular conformation that can undergo rapid structural fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Pappu, 2013</xref>). We therefore speculate that most CK2 motifs in TCOF1 and NOLC1 are buried in a collapsed conformation of the IDRs, while some CK2 motifs are frequently, yet stochastically, exposed on the surface of the substrate. The exposed CK2 motifs are recognized by a conserved positively charged loop in KBTBD8 and potentially a second substrate binding site whose existence was implied by the behavior of the KBTBD8<sup>W579A</sup> variant. The compact conformation of its IDRs might limit the propensity of unstructured TCOF1 and NOLC1 to aggregate, while its multiple E3 recognition motifs ensure that ubiquitin-dependent signaling is still possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that multisite dependency of an E3 ligase provides an elegant mechanism to control the activity of intrinsically disordered proteins, which have now been linked to many important cell behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of multisite-dependent substrate recognition by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>.</title><p>CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrates TCOF1 and NOLC1 are first phosphorylated by CK2 in conserved CK2 motifs (12 motifs in TCOF1; 10 motifs in NOLC1), which increases the negative charge of the central intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Phosphorylation likely occurs on multiple Ser residues within a CK2 motif (see insert). While the phosphorylated substrate likely adopts a compact conformation, CK2 motifs are stochastically exposed, allowing for their recognition by KBTBD8. We speculate that the resulting monoubiquitylation of TCOF1 and NOLC1 opens up their conformations to allow for recognition of ribosome biogenesis factors, including RNA polymerase I, the pseudouridylation machinery, and the SSU processome. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werner et al., 2015</xref>), the subsequent production of new, and likely modified, ribosomes then triggers neural crest specification.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35407-fig8-v3"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for ubiquitin-dependent signaling</title><p>The mechanism for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate recognition implies that multiple residues in TCOF1 or NOLC1 could serve as acceptor sites for monoubiquitylation. As mentioned before, we found that TCOF1 is ubiquitylated in cells on several Lys residues, even though we have not observed multi-monoubiquitylation (i.e. multiple Lys residues in the same substrate are modified with ubiquitin at the same time). It is difficult to rationalize ubiquitylation events that are agnostic to a particular Lys residue with binding of effector proteins that typically recognize both ubiquitin and a proximal substrate motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Husnjak and Dikic, 2012</xref>), and indeed, ubiquitin-binding domains have not yet been identified in TCOF1, NOLC1, or their interaction partners. Rather than promoting a specific interaction, we anticipate that the ubiquitin subunits attached to TCOF1 and NOLC1 function as steric block or solubilizing domain to pry open the compact conformation of both substrates. This conformational change could allow TCOF1 and NOLC1 to engage their partners during ribosome biogenesis and neural crest specification. Understanding this potential role of ubiquitylation in cellular signaling will rely on reconstitution of the monoubiquitylation-dependent formation of TCOF1-NOLC1 complexes, which is currently impossible due to difficulties in the purification of these large and unstructured proteins. Why CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> stops after having transferred a single ubiquitin is also an open question that will be an interesting basis for experiments aimed at elucidating mechanisms of monoubiquitylation.</p><p>Multisite phosphorylation allows cells to integrate numerous environmental cues into a coherent signaling response, or to introduce ultrasensitivity and threshold effects into signaling circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gunawardena, 2005</xref>). In case of a distributive kinase, such as CK2, the probability of complete substrate phosphorylation decreases the more sites have already been targeted by the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serber and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). This behavior is likely exacerbated by the large number of CK2 substrates in cells that can act as sponges to titrate the kinase away from TCOF1 and NOLC1. Thus, while the low constitutive activity of CK2 in stem cells might lead to some TCOF1 or NOLC1-phosphorylation, only the increase in CK2 activity observed during nervous system development should enable phosphorylation to the extent required for substrate recognition by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>. Based on these observations, we propose that multisite dependency of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> establishes a threshold concentration for CK2, which needs to be surpassed for monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification at specific stages of embryogenesis.</p><p>Mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> are the major cause of Treacher Collins Syndrome, a craniofacial disease that is characterized by aberrant neural crest specification and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">The Treacher Collins Syndrome Colla, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wise et al., 1997</xref>). The mutations in <italic>TCOF1</italic> map throughout the IDR and typically lead to a truncated protein that has fewer phosphorylation sites and hence is less likely to engage in multisite phosphorylation and monoubiquitylation. These mutations also delete carboxy-terminal nuclear and nucleolar localization sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Isaac et al., 2000</xref>), and thus, additionally disrupt targeting of TCOF1 to the nucleolus. Treacher Collins Syndrome is further characterized by an environmental component that strongly affects the phenotypic strength of identical <italic>TCOF1</italic> mutations across patients. It is possible that DNA damage or oxidative stress, which result in TCOF1 modification by kinases other than CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciccia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakai et al., 2016</xref>), compete with multisite phosphorylation by CK2. If this were to be the case, mutations that reduce the number of available CK2 sites and environmental conditions that funnel TCOF1 into alternative pathways likely synergize to prevent monoubiquitylation-dependent neural crest specification. In these cases, our data suggests that inhibition of phosphatases that oppose CK2 or approaches that activate CK2 kinase output could ameliorate phenotypes of <italic>TCOF1</italic> mutation. Conversely, inhibition of CK2 might provide therapeutic benefit against melanoma, a cancer driven by aberrant expression of KBTBD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayward et al., 2017</xref>).

Random Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 20x objective and processed using ImageJ. SOX10-positive cells and total nuclei were counted (~150–200 cells per condition for each of the three replicates) and average percentage of SOX10-positive cells was determined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Julia Schaletzky for comments on the manuscript, and Brenda Schulman for the generous gift of Nedd8-modified CUL3.

Your article has been reviewed by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Simona Polo (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>E3 ligases serve prominent roles in the development of multicellular organisms and this necessitates that their activity be tightly controlled both spatially and temporally. E3 ligase-substrate interactions often depend of substrate phosphorylation and therefore the corresponding kinase activity can provide a timing signal for substrate ubiquitylation and the processes they regulate. In the submitted manuscript, Werner et al. demonstrate that the activity of the CK2 kinase, which increases during embryogenesis, turns on the recognition and the monoubiquitylation of NOLC1 and TCOF1 by the E3 ligase CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>. These two substrate proteins are intimately involved in neural crest differentiation once mono-ubiquitinylated. Multisite phosphorylation is carried out by the CK2 kinase, which recognizes and phosphorylates several CK2 consensus sites in both TCOF1 and NOLC1. Using in vitro approaches to evaluate binding affinities, the authors nicely show the relevance of the CK2 mediated phosphorylation for KBTBD8-TCOF1 and KBTBD8-NOLC1 interaction. They further demonstrate that a single phosphorylation event is enough to positively influence the interaction in vitro while more than 7 phosphorylation events are necessary to allow the interaction in vivo, and the consequent ubiquitylation. Finally, the authors show that multiple CK2 motifs are required for optimal recognition by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> and for neural crest specification. They hypothesize that multisite dependency allows cells to convert a gradual increase in kinase expression (embryonic CK2) into a sharp activation of the signaling output (ubiquitylation of the TCOF1-NOLC complex formation).</p><p>Overall the study provides compelling evidence in support of the importance of multi-site phospho-recognition of TCOF1/NLCO1 by KBTBD8 and its ability to impart switch-like/ultrasensitive control of neural crest differentiation under the control of CK2 activity. In addition, the experimental results are fully consistent with the proposed binding model. However, additional experiments would strengthen the manuscript by providing additional support to their claims and to rule out alternate models.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors mention that CK2 expression changes during embryogenesis (Subsection “CK2 kinase is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent neural crest specification”), but never determine the expression profile of CK2 in their assay, the neural crest specification system from hESCs. This should be performed in a time course experiment, together with the expression profile of PP1 and PP2A, the phosphatases that in 293T cells oppose CK2 and promote substrate binding and monoubiquitylation. Similarly, the authors should test the importance of phosphatase activity in neural crest specification, using siRNA or inhibitors as they did for CK2 (Figure 2).</p><p>2) The effect of multisite phosphorylation on monoubiquitylation is evaluated only in 293T cells. It would be important to determine the phosphorylated and ubiquitylated state of NOLC1 WT and NOLC1<sup>CK1</sup> to NOLC1<sup>CK9</sup> in the hESCs model, to be able to attribute the defect observed in neural crest specification to the phosphorylation threshold and subsequent monoubiquitylation.</p><p>3) Homology modeling and conservation analysis Figure 3A. What is the diversity of species used in the analysis? My concern is that everything appears conserved if too closely related species are compared. If the KBTBD8 protein is only present in higher organisms, then conservation analysis is not that informative. The fact that the authors found mutations that work reduces my concern, but it would be easy to beef this analysis up. In addition, the authors should include the homology model coordinates as supplementary information. A more informative analysis would be to project conservation onto the surface of their homology model. Does this identify a hot spot of conservation suggestive of a degron biding site?</p><p>4) Figure 5F. All the deletion mutants are generated by deletion from one end of the protein. One possible explanation for the behavior of the system (that needs to be ruled out) is that one extreme end of TCOF1 houses a secondary binding site for KBTBD8, which is responsible for the apparently all or none binding behavior. This could be ruled out by generating and testing a limited number of deletion mutants of TCOF1 starting from the other terminus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35407.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors mention that CK2 expression changes during embryogenesis (Subsection “CK2 kinase is required for CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-dependent neural crest specification”), but never determine the expression profile of CK2 in their assay, the neural crest specification system from hESCs.

While mRNA levels of CK2, PP1, and PP2A subunits do not change dramatically during neural conversion, we did observe that the protein levels of PP1A and PP2A C decreased over the time course of differentiation. Western blotting showed a corresponding slight, but reproducible, increase in CK2 substrate phosphorylation at the first day of differentiation, i.e. at the time when neural crest specification is initiated. Thus, similar to the situation in mouse embryos, where CK2 levels peak at day 11/12 of development, our data suggests that in in vitro differentiation systems CK2 output increases at the time of neural crest specification.</p><p>We also monitored the efficiency of neural crest formation upon PP1 and PP2A inhibition. Given the essential cell cycle functions of both phosphatases (Wang et al., 2015), siRNA experiments unfortunately are impossible to conduct. As an alternative strategy, we treated cells with low concentrations of okadaic acid, a small molecule that inhibits both PP1 and PP2A. Although at high concentrations of okadaic acid face the same problems as siRNA-mediated co-depletion of PP1 and PP2A (i.e. hESCs die at concentrations above 1nM), lower levels of this PP1/PP2A inhibitor allowed hESCs to survive; more importantly, under these conditions, we observed a dose-dependent stimulation of neural crest specification (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effect of multisite phosphorylation on monoubiquitylation is evaluated only in 293T cells.

However, such experiments are cost-prohibitive (we calculated that due to the high cost of hESC and neural conversion medium, the suggested ubiquitylation analysis would cost ~20,000$). Our previous work had shown that 293T cells can be used to study stem cell-specific E3 ligases and their regulation (Jin et al., 2012; McGourty et al., 2016; Werner et al., 2015); moreover, the ability of NOLC1<sup>CK1</sup> to NOLC1<sup>CK9</sup> variants to drive neural crest specification was completely consistent with binding and ubiquitylation studies of wildtype NOLC1 performed in 293T cells (Werner et al., 2015). Thus, we hope that the reviewers agree that the insight gained by repeating ubiquitylation studies in hESCs does not justify the large financial investment.</p><p>Our previous work had shown that NOLC1-binding to CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> strictly correlates with ubiquitylation of NOLC1 and its ability to induce neural crest specification (Werner et al., 2015). To provide further evidence that CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> shows multisite dependency in hESCs, we therefore asked whether more than one CK2 site is required for recognition of NOLC1 by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> in hESCs. We expressed low levels of wildtype NOLC1 with 10 CK2 motifs or a mutant that contains a single CK2 site (NOLC1<sup>CK1</sup>) in self-renewing hESCs, where CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> is not required, or in differentiating hESCs, where CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> is essential to monoubiquitylate NOLC1 and drive neural crest specification. Consistent with the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>-substrate recognition, NOLC1 engaged endogenous KBTBD8 and TCOF1 only upon initiation of differentiation. By contrast, NOLC1<sup>CK1</sup> did not show any of these interactions (new Figure 6B). This confirms that substrate engagement by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup> and downstream ubiquitin-dependent signaling (i.e. TCOF1 binding) require multiple CK2 motifs also in differentiating hESCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Homology modeling and conservation analysis Figure 3A.

We took KBTBD8 variants from 54 different vertebrate species as the basis for a new sequence comparison (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), identified highly conserved residues, and mapped these onto a structural model of the Kelch repeats on KBTBD8. This analysis showed that the 5HK loop is very highly conserved – in fact, with the exception of a single His-residue, this loop is invariant (new Figure 3A). As mentioned by the reviewers, this observation is highly suggestive of a degron binding site, which in fact might include an additional conserved positively charged surface in close proximity to the 5HK loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5F. All the deletion mutants are generated by deletion from one end of the protein. One possible explanation for the behavior of the system (that needs to be ruled out) is that one extreme end of TCOF1 houses a secondary binding site for KBTBD8, which is responsible for the apparently all or none binding behavior. This could be ruled out by generating and testing a limited number of deletion mutants of TCOF1 starting from the other terminus.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we generated TCOF1 fragments that lacked amino-terminal CK2 motifs, and instead contained more carboxy-terminal CK2 motifs. We found that fragments with two or four CK2 motifs behaved identical in KBTBD8 binding irrespective of whether the fragments were obtained from the amino- or carboxy-terminus of TCOF1 (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We also noted a very interesting behavior of another C-terminal fragment, which contained an inactive CK2 motif embedded between two and three active CK2 motifs, respectively (R3/8; the sixth CK2 motif contains two Arg residues and is therefore unable to bind CK2, see Figure 4D). This fragment bound KBTBD8 with an affinity comparable to R1/3, an amino-terminal fragment with three active CK2 motifs. The R3/8 fragment therefore provided the insight that it is multisite phosphorylation in consecutive CK2 motifs that is required for recognition by CUL3<sup>KBTBD8</sup>. We have added this data to our manuscript, and we thank the reviewers for motivating us to conduct this interesting experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
