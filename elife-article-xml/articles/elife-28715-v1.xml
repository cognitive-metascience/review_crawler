ecosystems, the ecological analysis of microbiome function remains in its infancy. We used transformed wild tobacco plants (<italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>) which constitutively express an antimicrobial peptide (Mc-AMP1) of the common ice plant, to establish an ecological tool for plant-microbe studies in the field. Transgenic plants showed in planta activity against plant-beneficial bacteria and were phenotyped within the plants´ natural habitat regarding growth, fitness and the resistance against herbivores. Multiple field experiments, conducted over 3 years, indicated no differences compared to isogenic controls. Pyrosequencing analysis of the root-associated microbial communities showed no major alterations but marginal effects at the genus level. Experimental infiltrations revealed a high heterogeneity in peptide tolerance among native isolates and suggests that the diversity of natural microbial communities can be a major obstacle for microbiome manipulations in nature.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28715.026</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants never grow alone in their natural environments, but are instead constantly surrounded by microbial life. The microbes associated with a plant are known as the plant’s microbiome, and while a few of them are thought to benefit the plant’s health, little is known about what most of these microbes really do. It is also not clear under which conditions so-called beneficial microbes would benefit a plant. This is partly because scientists do not know how a plant would look if it were missing these microbes in nature, as it has been impossible to grow a “microbe-free” plant under field conditions. </p><p>Now, Weinhold et al. have tested a new approach to manipulate a plant’s microbiome in its natural environment. First, wild tobacco plants (<italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>) were genetically modified to produce an antibiotic substance, specifically an antimicrobial peptide. Instead of providing disease resistance to disease-causing bacteria, this peptide mainly inhibits the growth of bacteria that benefit plants. Then, these modified plants were grown and studied in glasshouses and in field experiments in southwestern Utah. </p><p>Although experiments in the glasshouse confirmed that the modified plants reduced the growth of certain beneficial bacteria, this was not equal among all strains tested. Even closely related bacteria belonging to a genus called <italic>Bacillus</italic> responded very differently. However, the field trials showed no negative consequences for the modified plants; they still grew to the same size as normal in their natural environment.Sequencing the genetic material of the microbiomes from those field-grown plants revealed that the bacterial community associated with the roots was not altered in a major way, but showed only subtle differences. </p><p>Together these findings show that, contrary to expectations, the attempt to manipulate a plant’s microbiome in a natural environment had little impact on the plant and its microbiome. Weinhold et al. suggest that the rich diversity of bacteria in the soil may account for resilience of microbiomes in natural environments. Nevertheless, Weinhold et al. hope that their unusual approach can inspire other researchers to consider more innovative ways to study plant-microbe interactions in the wild. Also, these new findings still have direct implications for agriculture, because they alleviate long-held concerns that using antimicrobial peptides to protect crops might harm beneficial microbes and negatively affect plant growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome function</kwd><kwd>microbiome engineering</kwd><kwd>plant endophyte</kwd><kwd>heterologous expression</kwd><kwd>plant-microbe interaction</kwd><kwd>knottin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Nicotiana attenuata</kwd><kwd><italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinhold</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinhold</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Max-Planck-DST India Mobility Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rameshkumar</surname><given-names>Natarajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The attempt to manipulate a microbiome in planta to study the ecological consequences under field conditions leaves plants and their microbes surprisingly unimpressed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants are surrounded by a vast and diverse community of soil bacteria, some of which are able to form close associations and important mutualistic relationships with plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hardoim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2016</xref>). Plant-microbe interactions play an important role in plant health and productivity and have received increasing attention for their roles in natural ecosystems as well as in agriculture for their utilization in advanced plant breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hacquard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kroll et al., 2017</xref>). Many bacteria are considered to be either harmless or to benefit a plant under certain conditions, and some are suspected to be even involved in aboveground defenses against herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schädler and Ballhorn, 2016</xref>) or flowering phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, most microbiota inhabit plants without producing symptoms, and despite the assumption of evolutional benefits of the plant’s holobiont, little is known about the ecological relevance of most plant-associated bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sánchez-Cañizares et al., 2017</xref>). Functional characterizations are usually limited to culturable bacteria, frequently used in gnotobiotic conditions or inoculated in titers higher than those of native soils and likely overestimating their real roles in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haney et al., 2015</xref>). The reconstruction and establishment of artificial communities or microbial consortia refines this approach, but remains restricted to culturable bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vorholt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Modern sequencing techniques, such as 454 pyrosequencing, enable a more comprehensive and culture-independent characterization of plant-associated bacteria and allow the in situ identification of previously overlooked communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundberg et al., 2013</xref>). High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed rare taxa and whole community compositions, and have greatly increased our understanding of microbiome assemblages in Arabidopsis, maize and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards et al., 2015</xref>), but also for non-model plants within their native habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman-Derr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fonseca-García et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). Soil type and geographical locations seem to be major determinants of microbiome variations, whereas plant cultivars or genotypes have a much smaller influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards et al., 2015</xref>). Plant-microbe interactions are complex, and we are just beginning to understand the factors which shape microbial associations and which are essential for bacteria to inhabit the intercellular space of a host plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ofek-Lalzar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levy et al., 2018</xref>). Still, the ecological analysis of root microbiome function remains in its infancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitzpatrick et al., 2018</xref>), and the influences of even highly abundant (but unculturable) taxa of the plant microbiome remain unknown. Novel approaches are needed to provide experimental procedures which could link changes in community composition to fitness consequences under native growth conditions, to be able to utilize this knowledge for sustainable and targeted microbiome engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Foo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oyserman et al., 2018</xref>). A ‘microbe-free plant’, not only as a theoretical game of thought, would be a valuable ecological tool to reveal hidden phenotypes of bacterial mutualisms under natural environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Partida-Martínez and Heil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gilbert and Neufeld, 2014</xref>). However, the feasibility of engineering a near-aposymbiotic plant using a transgenic approach, remains to be evaluated.</p><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, cationic peptides, which have been shown to inhibit the growth of a broad range of microbes. They can be found among many organisms and are part of the innate immune system of plants as well as animals. This allows the expression of AMPs across kingdom levels, and raised expectations for their medical application or biotechnological engineering of pathogen resistance in transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Souza Cândido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ageitos et al., 2017</xref>). For agricultural purposes, such approach has been employed for various plants, including tobacco, potato or Arabidopsis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holaskova et al., 2015</xref>). Little is known about the consequences that AMP expression has on beneficial plant mutualists, and the investigation of unintended effects is only rarely considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As a novel approach to evaluate microbiome function under native growth conditions, we expressed an AMP with selective activity against a mainly beneficial subset of bacteria and investigated if this would influence plant performance in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For this purpose, we expressed more than ten different AMPs from various origins in the wild tobacco plant <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> (Torr. ex S. Watson). All transgenic plants were thoroughly screened to ensure reliable gene expression levels over multiple generations and the accumulation of the heterologously expressed peptides was confirmed using a novel nanoUPLC-MS<sup>E</sup> based quantification method as shown in previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gase et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weinhold et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weinhold et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The antimicrobial peptide 1 (Mc-AMP1) of the common ice plant (<italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic>) proved to be an interesting candidate for this endeavor, as this peptide showed not only high accumulation levels within the leaf apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weinhold et al., 2015</xref>), but also antibacterial activity in planta, as demonstrated by experimental infiltrations within this study. The expressed peptide has an average molecular mass of 4.2 kDa and belongs, due to the distinct ‘knot’ connection motif of the disulfide bridges, to the knottin sub-family of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sampedro and Valdivia, 2014</xref>). These types of peptides are reported to have selective activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelegrini et al., 2011</xref>). The PhytAMP database entry for Mc-AMP1 (ID:PHYT00272) reports under in vitro conditions, activity against <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (formerly <italic>Sarcina lutea</italic>), but no activity against <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Such a selective activity spectrum against <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> would provide the opportunity to preferentially target a non-pathogenic subset of plant-associated bacteria, since the majority of the known plant pathogens are gram-negative (e.g. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Ralstonia</italic>, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, <italic>Xanthomonas</italic>, <italic>Erwinia</italic>, <italic>Xylella</italic>, <italic>Dickeya</italic> and <italic>Pectobacterium</italic>), with notable exceptions among the <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> (e.g. <italic>Clavibacter</italic> spp.) and even a few <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mansfield et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the majority of <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. described as plant endophytes or rhizosphere members, have been characterized as plant-beneficial bacteria, with disease suppressive or plant growth promoting abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gutierrez-Manero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">López-Bucio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hardoim et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the colonization with certain <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> is believed to contribute to drought tolerance of some plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitzpatrick et al., 2018</xref>).

However, these assumptions are usually based on AMP activity estimations from in vitro studies and empirical evidence from comprehensive field studies is still missing. We observed no major shift in the root-associated bacterial community and could demonstrate with experimental infiltrations that native bacterial isolates show distinctive and highly strain-specific susceptibilities, and concerns of broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects within transgenic plants are unfounded.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Antimicrobial peptide expression in Nicotiana attenuata</title><p>We transformed <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants for the ectopic expression of antimicrobial peptides, to evaluate potential effects on plant phenotype in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

During the first field season we planted two independent lines of this genotype (ICE 1 and ICE 6) together with empty vector controls (EV) on a research field plot located at the Lytle Ranch Preserve in Utah (USA) and monitored growth performance, herbivore damage and flower production. Here, plants of line ICE 1 showed a surprisingly severe growth phenotype with a 30% (±7%) reduction in rosette diameter (38 dpp p&lt;0.0005, MWU) and 59% (±9%) reduction in stalk height (41 dpp, p&lt;0.0001, MWU) compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As the heights of individual plants correlated with their log-flower production (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86), the reduced growth of the ICE 1 plants resulted in a clear reduction in total flower numbers by 85% (±22%) compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, plants of the independent line ICE 6 indicated no growth differences to the controls when grown in the field.

As we coincidently generated two versions of this line, which had their T-DNA insertions at different positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, red and green arrows), we could demonstrate that this was independent from the insertion position, as well as independent of antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> red and green arrows) and was likely the result of a transformation or regeneration artifact. Therefore, we replaced line ICE 1 for all following experiments with the alternative line ICE 8, which showed no reduction in growth compared to the controls in the glasshouse, a similar strong transgene expression and similar peptide accumulations in roots and leaves as line ICE 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).</p><p>In a second field season we repeated the growth comparison using two independent lines (ICE 6 and ICE 8) together with empty vector controls.

Here we report the outcome of multiple field trials where we tested if antimicrobial peptide expression for the targeted manipulation of beneficial microbes would impact plant performance in the field. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered as promising alternatives for disease resistance engineering in crops as they show direct antimicrobial activities and are less likely to cause physiological changes within a plant compared to the expression of other resistance-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Souza Cândido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goyal and Mattoo, 2014</xref>). Still, phytotoxic effects and various growth alterations have been observed in AMP expressing plants, which limits their broader application in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nadal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goyal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lay et al., 2014</xref>). To be able to use transgenic plants in comparative field studies, the plants should be free of side effects that result from the plant regeneration process or from the accumulation of the peptide itself. We show that the seed specific peptide Mc-AMP1 from the common ice plant can be ectopically expressed in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants without altering morphology or growth performance of the transgenic plants. A rigorous screening revealed that the growth phenotype within one of the lines (ICE 1) was an exceptional case, as it was independent of the line´s antimicrobial activity as well as the insertion position of the transgene, and likely caused by somaclonal effects resulting from the plant transformation process. Although the growth reduction phenotype was marginal in the glasshouse, it had a large fitness impact for plants grown in the field, which illustrates not only that independently regenerated plant lines are essential for a phenotypic characterization, but also the power of field experiments for an ‘augmented phenotyping’ to uncover hidden traits which cannot be predicted from glasshouse experiments. A prominent example are disease-resistant wheat plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zeller et al., 2010</xref>), which showed promising yield gains in the glasshouse, but suffered from severe yield losses in the field which made these plants useless for agriculture.</p><p>We selected plant lines (ICE 6 and ICE 8) which were suitable for comparative field studies, evaluated their in planta activity against native endophytic isolates and performed in-depth phenotyping in multiple years of field trials. The advantage of an AMP expression approach (in contrast to gnotobiotic conditions) is that it allows for plant fitness estimations with respect to a plants´ ecological interactions (i.e. native herbivore community) under natural growth conditions. Despite the concerns that an unwary expression of AMPs for crop disease resistance engineering might disturb the native microbial flora, with unexpected ecological consequences for the plant, we found no evidence for growth or fitness related aberrations of AMP expression. In contrast to common expectations, AMP expression targeted against a mainly beneficial subset of bacteria seems to have negligible impact on the root-associated microbiota of field-grown plants. Agricultural interests and the depiction of AMPs as being only a part of the plant innate immune system are falling short of the various roles that AMPs play in nature, as AMPs not only function in plant protection, but also in the governance of host-symbiont interactions as shown in legume-rhizobial root nodule symbioses or even function as digestive enzyme inhibitors with direct insecticidal ability as demonstrated for a floral defensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We used a seed-derived AMP of the knottin type family, which showed high sequence similarity to other fungal and insect peptides and to plant peptides within the order <italic>Caryophyllales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboye et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ectopic expression of this AMP in a solanaceous species has the advantage of obviating previous adaptations of native microbial communities. Moreover, the ectopic expression also provided another dimension: AMPs have rarely been reported to be natively expressed in roots. In plants, the majority of AMPs have been isolated from seeds, followed by flowers, fruits, stems or leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho and Gomes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nawrot et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Molesini et al., 2017</xref>). We used a 35S promoter based system, as this is known for its high and tissue independent expression and has been preferentially used for AMP expressions in crop plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holaskova et al., 2015</xref>). Although we were able to clearly detect the heterologously expressed peptide within the root system, it showed a lower accumulation in this compartment compared to leaves. This may explain why root effects were not apparent in the transgenic plants while leaf antimicrobial effects could be readily determined.</p><p>After three field seasons, we can conclude that the ectopic expression of the antimicrobial peptide Mc-AMP1 does not influence plant growth, flower production or herbivore infestation of transgenic <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants, or has any other observable negative effects on the plants when grown in the native environment. Although antibacterial effects could be demonstrated in the glasshouse in leaves, they were not apparent for roots and these experiments highlight that the in planta manipulation of complex microbial communities is a much more challenging endeavor than commonly believed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Divergence of the AMP activity spectrum among native isolates</title><p>In contrast to the commonly reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects of AMPs, we demonstrated that ectopic AMP expression in transgenic plants can show strain-specific effects and a high heterogeneity in resistance against native isolates. Newly discovered AMPs are rarely tested against a larger variety of strains or pathovars, and information about their activity spectrum is often interpolated from in vitro tests with a selected number of plant- or human-pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ageitos et al., 2017</xref>). Knottins are reported to exhibit activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelegrini et al., 2011</xref>), which would make them a promising candidate for the manipulation of the host-microbe relationship. However, as these groupings into activity classes were the result of in vitro tests with a few laboratory strains, it cannot be inferred that they would be able to eradicate an entire microbial group in the environment. Activity of antibiotics against laboratory strains does not commonly reflect a similar effectiveness against native bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wright, 2007</xref>) and for different ecosystems, the diverse communities of soil bacteria have shown to harbor non-anthropogenic resistance to various antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cytryn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shade et al., 2013a</xref>). As demonstrated in a previous study, AMP expressing grapevine plants showed promising resistance against a single pathogen strain in the glasshouse, but failed to display these effects in the field, which is consistent with an underestimated resilience of native pathovars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As we were interested in the effect of AMP expression against the native bacterial community, we performed experimental leaf infiltrations to evaluate the in planta antimicrobial activity of the transgenic plants using individual native isolates. The plant apoplast is an environment that is very different from that of petri dishes, and even though activity tests ex vivo had been traditionally used to confirm correct peptide folding, they are less informative than the evaluation of whether growth inhibition could be expected <italic>within</italic> the plant. We could demonstrate activity against several <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains under physiological conditions of the leaf apoplast. But despite the strong peptide accumulations within the leaves, only about half of the tested bacterial strains showed a reduction in the experimental infiltrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Noteworthy is <italic>Micrococcus luteus,</italic> which is supposed to be susceptible to this AMP from in vitro reports, but showed the opposite effect with an increase in CFU numbers within the transgenic plants. It has frequently been shown that AMP activity changes or vanishes in planta due to salt concentrations, protease-based degradation or the inhibition by phenolic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zeitler et al., 2013</xref>). AMPs are notoriously sensitive to divalent cations and their activity can be drastically reduced due to small amounts of Ca<sup>2</sup> or Mg<sup>2</sup> within the apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Bolle et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Güell et al., 2011</xref>). As <italic>Micrococcus</italic> is usually known for its exquisite sensitivity to many antibiotics (i.e. lysozyme and insect defensins) it is commonly used as indicator strain for antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fleming and Allison, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cociancich et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, it is not likely to predict general efficacy against other gram-positive <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>.</p><p>In contrast, we observed for most of the <italic>Bacillus</italic> isolates clear reduction effects within the leaf infiltration assay, which enabled us to use this method as a high throughput screening to select for transgenic plants with antimicrobial activity. This confirmed not only that the plants have in planta activity against <italic>Firmicutes</italic> but showed also a surprising heterogeneity of resistance among closely related isolates. Whereas the <italic>B. megaterium</italic> type strain DSM 32 showed no CFU reductions, we found strong differences in antimicrobial effects amongst native isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This was rather remarkable as these strains showed a high phylogenetic relatedness and were practically indistinguishable when compared by their near entire 16S rDNA sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Since antimicrobial peptides are reported to target multiple essential structures of the bacterial cell, the development of resistance mechanisms is usually considered unlikely, but differences in slime capsule formation or surface charge modifications are possible explanations for the observed discrepancies among these isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nawrocki et al., 2014</xref>). Without the experimental leaf infiltrations, such intraspecific heterogeneity would have been missed, and most culture-independent approaches would group these isolates as a single OTU. The grouping into OTUs is a technical necessarily, but it can mask a surprising diversity of ecological heterogeneity and rarely resembles a true monophyletic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koeppel and Wu, 2013</xref>). Whereas the use of single isolates is a rather simple means of accessing this diversity, it can be very rewarding as it allows to determine individual isolate functions within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). Observing the diversity on a sub-OTU resolution via sequencing is not trivial, but recent advances point to ways of overcoming this limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tikhonov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agler, 2016</xref>).</p><p>When we inoculated these highly susceptible <italic>B. megaterium</italic> strains using a more natural inoculation assay, we did not observe reduction effects in the roots of the transgenic plants compared to the controls. This assay delivered more variable results, likely reflecting its requirement for natural colonization rather than the force-infiltration of bacteria. Although the lower peptide amount in the roots may contribute to the lack of observable direct reduction effects, we tested if it might allow bacteria to develop AMP resistance within the transgenic plants. An exposure to a low AMP concentration for 4 weeks has been shown to be sufficient to select for strains with higher AMP resistance in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobson et al., 2014</xref>). However, the ‘root re-isolated’ strain did not differ in susceptibility compared to the original ‘naïve’ strain, as compared in a leaf infiltration assay, and we found no evidence consistent with the hypothesis that bacteria might develop resistances when they reside as a root endophyte within an AMP expressing plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Clearly the results of single strain inoculations are likely poor predictors of the potential effects of AMP expression on the composition of the native community within the field.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>AMP expression has negligible impact on the native root-associated communities</title><p>The root-associated microbial communities of field-grown <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants were mainly dominated by the phyla <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> which together account for 80% of the obtained sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), a commonly observed pattern from the root communities of other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulgarelli et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies in Arabidopsis and maize have shown that the composition of the endophytic microbial community of these plants is mainly influenced by soil type and geographic location, whereas the plant genotype or ecotype had only a minor influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Peiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schlaeppi et al., 2014</xref>). Even the alteration of a plant´s hormone homeostasis rarely showed any ‘genotype effect’ on the endophytic microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Santhanam et al., 2014</xref>), with the exception of mutants with a heavily altered immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lebeis et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we analyzed isogenic plants, which differed only in a single trait. Comparing these plants in the field, we observed no major differences within their root-associated communities. Unfortunately, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> which were the main target group for the generation of AMP expressing plants showed a rather low relative abundance (0.6%) in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Bacilli were believed to be important mutualists of <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, as they dominated the culturable community with up to 63% relative abundance in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Long et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Bacilli</italic> have been described for years as an important and large group of plant endophytes based on culturable approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hardoim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levy et al., 2018</xref>). Still, most recent NGS sequencing datasets are now pointing to much lower estimates and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> are therefore no longer considered as a major root inhabiting group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2016</xref>).

Other studies even reported a potential exclusion of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> from the roots of Arabidopsis and barley, as the levels in the endosphere compartment (&lt;1% abundance) were lower than that of the surrounding soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulgarelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodenhausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schlaeppi et al., 2014</xref>). In a previous study, we analyzed the microbial communities of wild <italic>N. attenuata</italic> populations and observed a similar trend, where <italic>Firmicutes</italic> represented about 4.5% of the community in the bulk soil but only 0.5% for the root compartments of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santhanam et al., 2017</xref>). Despite their low relative abundance, the genus <italic>Bacillus</italic> was the only group within the split dataset analysis which showed the tendency for a reduction among the gram-positive bacteria, though this effect could only be considered as statistically marginal (uncorrected p value 0.053) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Only a few studies have described <italic>Firmicutes</italic> as abundant community members in plants with relatively large numbers obtained from certain plant compartments of desert succulents (e.g. stem and leaf endosphere of Agavae plants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman-Derr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fonseca-García et al., 2016</xref>). These leaf endopshere samples delivered the lowest sequence reads within the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman-Derr et al.

The low complexity within these samples made them less suitable for a meaningful analysis of diversity.</p><p>A few studies had investigated if transgenic plants expressing antimicrobial agents would influence plant-beneficial microbial communities, but never found clear genotype-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Turner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaur et al., 2017</xref>). The feasibility of microbiome manipulation within native ecosystems appears to be more challenging than previously assumed, and even the massive application of antibiotics, as commonly done in apple orchards, had surprisingly little effect on the composition of the microbial community in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shade et al., 2013a</xref>). Even the direct treatment of apple flowers with streptomycin, resulted in no observable change in the microbiome compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shade et al., 2013b</xref>). This shows that our expectations of the potency of antibiotic treatments in the environment is frequently unfounded, and perhaps to be expected, given that soil bacteria are the major sources of the antibiotics that we use.</p><p>Although the overall community level showed no major shifts among the genotypes, more detailed examinations at a finer resolution revealed significant but marginal differences at the genus level. The genus ‘Pedobacter_g3’ within the <italic>Sphingobacteriaceae</italic> was the only group which showed within the ICE lines, a significant reduction in relative abundance compared to the controls. The presence of sphingolipids (the eponymous characteristic of this group) could be a potential susceptibility factor and a binding site for antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thevissen et al., 2000</xref>). But as this group does not contain relevant human- or plant-pathogens, it has never been tested in AMP resistance experiments.</p><p>Interestingly, sequence read numbers matching the genera ‘<italic>Leifsonia</italic>’ (<italic>Microbacteriaceae</italic>) and <italic>Pantoea</italic> (<italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>) were significantly increased within the transgenic plants compared to the controls. The genus <italic>Pantoea</italic> showed a particularly large increase in relative abundance of 6%. Whereas the reduction of mutualists would account for an increase in pathogens, both genera are known to contain plant pathogenic as well as beneficial bacteria and the resolution of the sequencing data does not allow inferences regarding function. As recently shown, the acquisition of virulence plasmids can be sufficient for the transition from plant beneficial to phytopathogenic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). Little attention has been paid to microbe-microbe interactions and the importance of antagonistic mutualisms or antibiosis effects, and it cannot be excluded that under certain growth conditions AMP expression could result in an unintended increase of potential pathogenic bacteria. Greenhouse experiments with artificial communities showed that the exclusion of a single keystone species can be sufficient to influence the composition of the entire community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niu et al., 2017</xref>). If this has consequences for plant fitness in the field remains to be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although we have recently gained deep insights into the assemblage and composition of plant root microbiomes, the functional traits of major taxa remain largely unknown. Only a few bacterial groups are sufficiently characterized and recognized as important mutualists that benefit plants by enhancing growth or stress tolerance. New and innovative approaches are needed to unravel microbiome function under native growth conditions to be able to harness this potential for agricultural applications. Although ectopic AMP expression appears to be a promising approach to manipulate only certain taxa within the native community without interfering with the plant immune system, their broad-spectrum activities have rarely been tested outside the petri-dish, and expectations regarding their in planta efficacy against native communities appear overstated. This reminds us of the findings within the human gut flora, where the majority of commensals proved to be remarkably resilient to inflammation-associated AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen et al., 2015</xref>). The tremendous diversity of environmental bacteria, and their rich reservoir of genetic variability, allows natural communities to withstand antimicrobial activity and act as a single cohesive unit of antibiotic resistance as shown for marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordero et al., 2012</xref>). Small mobile elements (e.g. vectors with resistance genes) can easily spread within a native microbial community, resulting in dramatic changes of resistance, with few observable shifts in the distribution of taxa. Currently, the Illumina sequencing platform has (together with the 515F/806R primer pair) become a widely used and universally accepted system for high throughput 16S rDNA profiling of bacterial communities; however, these relative short amplicons limit the phylogenetic resolution and thwarts the characterization of intraspecific variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van der Heijden and Schlaeppi, 2015</xref>). The community clearly needs additional technical and computational advances in sequencing as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agler (2016)</xref>, and make use of longer amplicons (i.e. PacBio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frank et al., 2016</xref>), to link the ‘rough’ taxonomic OTU groupings of genotypes to functionally important phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we should reconsider the utility of in vitro antimicrobial tests, as long as native bacteria could overcome such activities in vivo, not only in plants, but particularly within the human body. To paraphrase what Thomas Eisner once said about insects: Microbes won’t inherit the Earth—they own it now, and it behooves us to appreciate the sophistication of their stewardship.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant transformation and cultivation</title><p>For the construction of the plant transformation vector pSOL9ICE the antimicrobial peptide Mc-AMP1 of the common ice plant (<italic>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</italic> L.) was selected from the PhytAMP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phytamp.pfba-lab-tun.org/main.php">http://phytamp.pfba-lab-tun.org/main.php</ext-link>) (ID:PHYT00272) and the cDNA sequence retrieved from NCBI (GenBank:AF069321).

Experiments were terminated about 6 weeks <italic>post</italic> planting and flowering plants were completely excavated for the determination of the root and shoot fresh mass, whereas the ICE 8 plants were left in the field to continue with the observation of growth parameters and flower production. Damage from the native herbivore communities was estimated as percentages canopy damage per total plant leaf area and was assessed by two independent researchers. The different types of herbivores were differentiated by their characteristic damage pattern, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaquerel et al. (2013)</xref>. Abundant herbivores were mirid bugs (<italic>Tupiocoris</italic> spp.), tree crickets (<italic>Oecanthus</italic> sp.), flea beetles (<italic>Epitrix</italic> spp.), noctuid larvae (<italic>Spodoptera</italic> spp.), hornworm larvae (<italic>Manduca</italic> spp.), leaf hopper (<italic>Empoasca</italic> spp.) and multiple genera of grasshopper (<italic>Acrididae</italic>). For the herbivore performance assays in the glasshouse, freshly hatched larvae of the tobacco hornworm (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>) were placed on individual rosette-stage <italic>N. attenuata</italic> plants and caterpillar mass gain observed for 13 d of feeding (n = 18–22 larvae).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Root sampling in the field for 16S rDNA pyrosequencing</title><p>In May 2013, we harvested plants at the rosette-stage of growth (average diameter 18.0 cm ±0.6 cm) about 3 weeks <italic>post</italic> planting, when the roots were well established in the soil, but before plants started elongating (average height 2.0 cm ±0.3 cm), to avoid further progression of root system lignification. As reported previously for rice, roots are colonize by bacteria within a few days of planting, and can acquire full microbiomes within about two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards et al., 2015</xref>). Bulk soil was sampled after removal of the top soil layer from about 10 cm depth from three sites within the planting area with a distance of more than 30 cm to the plants and did not contain plant roots. Equal-sized plant pairs were excavated within a block of soil to avoid tearing and loss of the fine roots. The plant roots were thoroughly washed under running tap water to remove all adhering soil particles and minimize root surface-associated bacteria, similar as done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wagner et al. (2016)</xref>. Due to limitations of the sampling procedure in the field, the samples may include firmly attached rhizoplane bacteria in addition to the endosphere compartment. Three leaf samples were collected per plant and adhering dust and soil particles were removed with tap water followed by immersion in 70% isopropanol solution and finally rinsing them again with tap water. Cleaned samples were blotted on a paper towel and placed in individual paper bags for transport and preserved by desiccation as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santhanam et al., 2017</xref>). DNA extraction was performed using the MP-Biomedical FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil, replacing the Fast Prep step by manual grinding of the samples in liquid nitrogen. Quantity of the DNA was evaluated on an agarose gel and by a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Sample purity (regarding humic acid contaminations) was evaluated by the ability to amplify a 16S rDNA fragment by PCR. Samples were sent to Molecular Research LP (MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA) and sequenced on a Roche 454 FLX titanium instrument using the barcoded primers bac799F (5′-ACCMGGATTAGATACCCKG-3′) and bac1394R (5′-ACGGGCGGTGTGTRC-3′) as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Santhanam et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Santhanam et al., 2017</xref>). For the pilot analysis, the DNA of five plants were pooled and three pooled samples (leaves and roots) analyzed per genotype. The bulk soil sample contained DNA of three individual soil extractions. Since some of the leaf samples showed an extremely low number of reads (&lt;40) we focused for the main analysis on the root samples and re-sequenced a higher replicate number of root samples from 10 individual plant pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microbial community pyrosequencing data analysis</title><p>Sequence reads of root-associated microbiota were analyzed and processed using the QIIME platform (v1.8.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caporaso et al., 2010b</xref>). Sequences were depleted of barcodes and primers and filtered for ambiguous bases and homopolymer runs exceeding 6 bp. Sequences &gt; 200 bp were de-noised and chimeras removed using de novo and reference-based chimera detection implemented in the USEARCH function. The clustering in OTUs was performed at a 3% divergence threshold (97% similarity). Representative sequences (&gt;200 bp) were aligned to the Greengenes 16S rDNA core set (version gg_13_5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://greengenes.lbl.gov">http://greengenes.lbl.gov</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeSantis et al., 2006</xref>) using PyNAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caporaso et al., 2010a</xref>) and only sequences with a minimum identity of 70% to the closest blast hit were included in the alignment. Taxonomy was assigned using the ribosomal database project (RDP) classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). After taxonomic assignment, all mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences were removed from the dataset by filtering for sequences matching the order ‘Rickettsiales’ or the phylum ‘Cyanobacteria’ using the filter_taxa_from_otu_table package. Likewise, all unassigned sequences (identified by manual BLAST searches as non-plastidal plant DNA) were removed from the dataset by retaining only sequences which matched to the kingdom ‘Bacteria’ for the pilot analysis, or ‘Bacteria’ and ‘Archaea’ for the main root analysis and resulted in a total of 24872 and 34920 quality sequences, respectively. To account for differences in sequencing depth, rarefaction analyses were conducted by randomly picking OTUs matched to the lowest OTU number found within a single sample. The pilot dataset (including soil and leaf samples) was rarefied to 800 reads. To increase the rarefaction depth for the main root-dataset, two samples with low sequence reads (ICE genotype with &lt;600 reads) were pooled and rarefied to 724 reads. The community distances measures were calculated as weighted UniFrac based on OTU relative abundances including phylogenetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</xref>). Non-parametric Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were performed with QIIME using the weighted and unweighted UniFrac as a distance measure. We determined taxonomic differences among genotypes by Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) tested with 99 permutations on the distance matrix and ‘genotype’ as category as implemented in the compare_categories package for QIIME. The rarefied root-dataset contained 333 OTUs and showed, at the genus level, 84% shared phylotypes (total of 145 genera) among the genotypes. Before group significance comparisons, an additional abundance filtering step was included to remove extremely rare taxa from the dataset using the filter_otus_from_otu_table package. Only OTUs which were either present in at least three samples, or which showed a minimum of 10 quality reads within the entire dataset were retained for the analysis. This filtering step decreased the total read number by only 3%, but removed about 40% of the low abundant OTUs. The filtered dataset was rarefied to 696 sequences and showed, at the genus level, 94% shared phylotypes (total of 101 genera) between the genotypes. The taxonomic composition (at family level) was illustrated by a heatmap using log<sub>10</sub> (+1) transformed relative abundances. We evaluated sample dissimilarity contribution of bacterial families based on their relative abundances, and performed similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) with PAST v. 3.04 using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. To test for significant differences among the genotypes, we performed individual group significance comparisons on the filtered and rarefied dataset from phylum to genus level using non-parametric t-tests including Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 permutations as implemented in the group_significance package for QIIME. To reduce the effect on type I statistical error due to multiple comparisons of taxa we applied FDR correction using a false discovery rate (<italic>Q</italic>) of 10%. Similar results were obtained by analysis of variance, performed on the log<sub>2 </sub>(+1) transformed dataset. For the ‘split dataset’ analysis, we divided the dataset by gram types and performed individual analysis for ‘gram-positive’ (<italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic>) and ‘gram-negative’ taxa (containing all remaining groups). The datasets were filtered as described above and rarefied to 223 reads (gram-positives) and 468 reads (gram-negative), respectively. The split datasets were analyzed by group significance comparisons on genus and OTU level. Results were shown as a volcano plot using the -log<sub>10</sub> (uncorrected) p value and the log<sub>2</sub> fold difference calculated by dividing the relative abundances (+1 pseudocount) of the ICE lines divided by EV. Bubble size indicates relative abundance averaged from both genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma Plot (v 12.0) and PAST (v 3.04) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammer et al., 2001</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors Arne Weinhold and Ian Baldwin touch in their manuscript 'Antimicrobial peptide expression in a wild tobacco plant reveals the limits of host-microbe-manipulations in the field' an important topic of feasibility in translating laboratory findings to field applications. The authors therefore describe a comprehensive study analysing the effect of an antimicrobial peptide AMP (Mc-AMP1) ectopically overexpressed in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>. Weinhold and Baldwin perform extensive field experiments to study effects on growth, fitness, resistance against herbivores and naturally associated root microbiota and check for peptide efficiency against selected bacterial groups in the lab. They show a clear effect on certain bacteria in the lab but with strong differences between isolates of the same species. In their field experiments, the authors can show, that AMP expression does not reduce any fitness or has any other effects on the plant. To study the effect of AMP on the microbiota in the field, the authors analyse the root bacterial community using 16S amplicon sequencing. These experiments show no significant genotype effect and therefore lead the authors to conclude that Mc-AMP1 does not change bacterial composition on a genus level under field conditions which might be due to race specific resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The used amplicon method, however, does not allow race specific resolution. This hypothesis is supported by the identification of susceptible and resistant races of the same species to Mc-AMP1 in the lab.</p><p>An essential conclusion of this paper is that laboratory / glasshouse experiments cannot be translated to the field since environmental factors and microbial diversity have a higher impact than previously anticipated.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) One concern raised is about the primer used to do 16S rDNA profiling that might explain the unexpected low number of amplicons for <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. The authors state they used a primer pair previously published by Chelius and Triplett 2001. What they used, however, is a modified primer. The original 799F primer reads AACMGGATTAGATACCCKG, the primer used in this paper reads ACCMGG...…. A primer blast in NCBI shows significant differences for both primers e.g. concerning ACCMGG how many and which <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. one would retrieve. In case this is only a typo, perfect. In case this primer was really used, re-sequencing using an appropriate primer set or testing both primer sets on a defined microbial community would be needed.</p><p>2) The authors have analysed the ectopic expression of AMP1, the in planta activity against several isolates and the growth only in the phyllosphere. There is no data about the root system. Microbial communities in the field, however, were only studied in roots due to low sequence recovery for bacteria from leaves. In case there is the primer problem as mentioned in (1) leaf samples should be re-sequenced, otherwise to make sense of the root data, it would be necessary to test if roots express or secrete the same amount of AMP1 as leaves do and to use e.g. plate assays to test for bacterial inhibition by <italic>N. attenuata</italic> roots expressing AMP1. To use root microbial data it further needs a test to see potential growth effects on roots.</p><p>3) Another major criticism reviewers have highlighted is a focus predominantly on explaining negative results and / or controls for experimental variation, rather than testing the hypothesis. Cutting down main figures and focusing on major results that support the hypothesis would significantly improve the manuscript. Particularly differences that have been identified should be highlighted while similarities could move to supplementary data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28715.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) One concern raised is about the primer used to do 16S rDNA profiling that might explain the unexpected low number of amplicons for Bacillus sp.

Dowd from Molecular research, the company that performed the 454 sequencing analysis for us. There seemed to be no particular reason why they offered this slightly different version of the 799F primer in their standard assay, but it had been frequently used by us and other customers (see details below). Since the mentioned mismatch would basically affect all bacterial phyla, there is no reason to assume a bias against a particular group. A single mismatch in the 5´region has little influence on the primer efficiency, in particular since the 5´end has the much bigger barcoded tail attached as well. In contrast, any mismatch in the 3´region would have a much greater influence, which is the reason why this primer is so efficient in excluding chloroplast sequences. In our experience, in silico estimations are not very good in predicting group exclusions. Take the primer Eub338 as an example. This primer has been widely used as a qPCR primer to estimate bacterial 16S copy numbers, and it has long been considered to be specific to bacteria since it contains five mismatches which are thought to exclude most of the eukaryotic sequences according to an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis. But as all these 5 mismatches are within the 5´ region, the experimental reality is that this primer amplifies yeast and insect host DNA with similar efficiency.</p><p>Regarding the concern about the “low” number of amplicons for <italic>Bacillus</italic> . Maybe we did not word this properly within the manuscript. What we meant was a much lower number of <italic>Bacillus</italic> reads in the sequencing analysis, compared to the expected numbers from previous culturable analysis. In the study of Long et al. (2010) up to 63% of the root isolates from <italic>N. attenuata</italic> were identified as <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., and similar findings have been made from the endosphere compartment of other plants e.g. <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> (Marasco et al. 2012). In contrast, our sequencing approach (of field grown plants) showed &lt;1% relative abundance for <italic>Bacillus</italic> . This is mainly a result of cultivation bias and seems to be a common discrepancy. When we compare our sequencing results with those of other plant-microbe studies, we do not find evidence that our dataset reveals an unusually low number of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> . The first sequencing analysis from our department (Santhanam et al., 2014) tested different primer pairs from which the 799F/1394R combination (as used in this study) proved to be superior in competition with other commonly used primers pairs (515F/806R or 939F/1394R). With this 799F primer version, we obtained the highest species richness and the best exclusion of plant DNA and we continued using it for other studies (Santhanam et al., 2017). In this recent work, we detected in one of the soil samples up to 13% <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (relative abundance). On average, we found higher numbers of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the soil samples (average of 4.5% relative abundance) and a relative depletion in the root compartments of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> to only 0.5% relative abundance (Santhanam et al., 2017). Hence, the results that we present here (about 0.6% relative abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> roots) are completely consistent with our previously published results.</p><p>These levels are also within the expected range of what has been published in other studies, which rarely mention the abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> as they are not dominant members of the community (in cultivation independent datasets). For example Peiffer et al. (2013) tested different primer pair combination, which all showed less than &lt;2% <italic>Firmicutes</italic> for maize rhizosphere soil samples (estimated fromFigure 1). In the studies of Wagner et al. (2016) and Senga et al. (2017), the Illumina sequencing platform had been used with the primers 515F/806R and their data showed &lt;0.7% <italic>Bacillales</italic> in soil and root samples of <italic>Boechera stricta</italic> and 0.5% to 1.1% <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in soil and rhizosphere samples of barley varieties, respectively. Donn et al. (2015) and Kawasaki et al. (2016) used exactly the same 799F primer version and the same company as we did, and detected in the wheat rhizosphere <italic>Firmicutes</italic> ranging from 1-2% relative abundances (estimated fromFigure 3) and for <italic>Brachypodium</italic> rhizosphere an average in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> abundance around 1.6% (compared to up to 12% in bulk soil).</p><p>Whereas Bulgarelli et al. (2015), Schlaeppi et al.(2014) and Bodenhausen et al. (2013) had used the original 799F primer version and reported from Barley and Arabidopsis, an exclusion of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> from the endosphere compartment with less than &lt;1% abundance (again, estimated from their figures). Similar results have been reported previously by Bulgarelli et al. (2012) using a slightly modified 799F primer version and &lt;1% <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the root compartment. In fact, only a few studies report about an enrichment of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> in the root endosphere compartment of Arabidopsis (Lundberg et al. 2012). Relative high levels of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> have only been detected in certain plant compartments (e.g. stem and leaf endosphere of desert succulents) (Coleman-Derr et al., 2016; Fonseca-García et al., 2016).</p><p>Finally, the study of (Maes et al., 2016) used the same primer versions and the same company as we did, and successfully characterized the bee gut flora, which is highly dominated by <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (ranging from 20-70% relative abundance depending on tissue type). This speaks against the assumption of a primer bias, and the exclusion of this group. Although <italic>Bacilli</italic> have been described as the fourth largest group of endophytes when considering culturable approaches (Hardoim et al. 2015), most recent NGS sequencing datasets are now pointing to much lower estimates and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> are therefore no longer considered as a major root inhabiting group (Müller et al. 2016). In summary, we have no evidence that other primer combinations or sequencing platforms would be superior in detecting <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, or that <italic>N. attenuata</italic> shows unusually low levels. A short discussion of these points has been added to the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have analysed the ectopic expression of AMP1, the in planta activity against several isolates and the growth only in the phyllosphere.

We determined the transcript levels in roots and leaves, demonstrated peptide presence in roots and leaves using antibody-based detection and performed root inoculation assays to complement the leaf infiltration results. We also included the analysis of the pilot-sequencing dataset which included leaf and root samples from the field.</p><p>The gene expression analysis confirmed for the root and leaf compartments a strong overexpression of the transgene. Furthermore, we were successful in obtaining ICE peptide specific antibodies and were able to perform immunoblot analysis. These could finally confirm that the peptide is indeed present in the roots (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Compared to leaf samples as positive controls, the roots seem to accumulate lower amounts of the expressed peptide, which would explain why antimicrobial effects within the roots were less apparent. The efficient generation of antibodies with specificity against AMPs has always been described as challenging in previous studies and we are delighted that it had worked out and could show that both transgenic plant lines accumulate similar peptide amounts.</p><p>To test peptide activity in the roots under semi-natural conditions, we performed a large root inoculation trial with 96 plants in the glasshouse. We used those <italic>B. megaterium</italic> strains which showed the highest susceptibility and had been demonstrated to be good root colonizers. Plants were grown for about 4 weeks. Despite the much larger replicate numbers (n = 24) compared to the leaf infiltration assay (n = 4) we did not observe significant differences of CFUs obtained from surface sterilized roots (Figure 7—figure supplement 3A). Whereas the lower peptide accumulations in the root system could explain why no apparent reduction effects could be observed, we further investigated an additional hypothesis, namely if peptide amounts in roots might be sufficient to select for AMP resistance in the inoculated bacteria. The inoculation time (4 weeks) was rather long, and other studies had shown that exposure to AMPs for such a time period can be sufficient to select bacteria that are adapted to AMPs (Dobson et al., 2014). We compared the strain re-isolated from the roots of transgenic plants to the original “naïve” strain. However, both strains showed no difference in their susceptibility and had nearly identical CFU reductions in a leaf infiltration assay (Figure 7—figure supplement 3B). Hence, we could confirm the antibacterial effects of the transgenic plants by leaf infiltrations, but we found no evidence that the inoculated bacteria were reduced in the roots, nor that they evolved resistance to AMPs during their 4 weeks of residence as an endophyte.</p><p>Despite substantial efforts to establish a plate bioassay for root extracts, we could not obtain the conditions or the required concentrations to demonstrate inhibitory or antimicrobial effects in vitro. As crude protein extracts contain a mixture of cytosolic content and cations which inhibit AMP activity, rigorous desalting steps are required and commonly result in peptide losses. Peptide accumulation in the roots seemed to be too low for such assay, and although we acknowledge that it might be possible to show effects by scaling up the amount of source material used for extraction, we believe that this would be of little informative value of in planta activities. It is not uncommon that up to one kilogram of starting materials has been required to obtain enough AMP for bioassays (Cammue et al., 1992; Broekaert et al., 1992), a requirement that obviates any realistic estimation in our case.</p><p>We further included the results of the pilot-sequencing of the field samples (including leaf and soil samples). This pilot-dataset was previously not included, since some leaf samples showed extreme low sequencing depth (&lt;40 reads). Here we included all samples with &gt;800 reads to be able to perform meaningful rarefaction and UniFrac analysis. Interestingly, previous studies on the analysis of leaf endosphere samples in Agavae plants reported also very low read recovery from such compartment (Coleman-Derr et al. 2016). In contrast to the concern of a low recovery or bias against <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, our leaf samples were dominated by <italic>Bacillus</italic> reads which comprised more than 98% of the “community” (relative abundance) from which ~90% comes only from a single <italic>Bacillus</italic> OTU. This resulted in a “community” with very low complexity and species richness. Rarefaction analysis did not indicate that a deeper sequencing of these samples would result in a greater resolution or a more complex structure and illustrates why we focused on the root samples and re-sequenced them for the main analysis. Not only did the root samples deliver a higher sequencing quality and reveal a real “community” structure, they showed also the largest differences in the UniFrac analysis and the largest potential for genotype differences. We tested this hypothesis with a greater number of samples from individual plant roots in our main analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if ectopic AMP expression would influence non-culturable community members or even a beneficial subset of the bacterial community, and plant–beneficial and growth promoting microbes have been mainly describes as root-endosphere or rhizosphere members and to a lesser extend from the leaf endosphere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another major criticism reviewers have highlighted is a focus predominantly on explaining negative results and / or controls for experimental variation, rather than testing the hypothesis. Cutting down main figures and focusing on major results that support the hypothesis would significantly improve the manuscript. Particularly differences that have been identified should be highlighted while similarities could move to supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect that this tone crept into the manuscript as a result of responding to reviewer feedback from previous cycles of review. In the light of strong preconceptions from reviewers about expected results, the text evolved in response to the increased demands for explanations for negative results and additional controls. While we are fine that the results fully support our conclusion that ectopic expression of AMPs has no influence on the growth phenotype of the plant and no major impact on the root community, the opposite is usually expected since the frequently reported “broad spectrum activity” of AMPs comes nearly exclusively from experiments using pure peptides under artificial buffer conditions. The performance of AMPs under physiological conditions can be underwhelming, and in addition to peptide degradation by proteases even a few millimolar of divalent cations within the apoplast are sufficient to completely abolish AMP activity. It was not the goal to confirm that an overdose of AMPs would have antimicrobial activity, but rather to investigate if the ectopic expression of AMPs (as used in agriculture) is sufficient to influence the native microbial community. Even the direct application of large quantities of the antibiotic streptomycin resulted, against common expectations, in no observable effect on the flower microbiome of treated apple trees (Shade et al., 2013b), or in soil of the apple orchard (Shade et al., 2013a). Our observation is fully consistent with what has been reported in previous studies showing little influence of transgenic plants expressing antimicrobial agents on the root community (Heuer et al., 2002; Rasche et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2013).</p><p>This reminds us of the early studies which tried to investigate if mobile phone radiation might cause cancer. In a time where most people had strong expectations that this would be the case, studies with negative results were easily dismissed due to lack of sufficient experimental proof, and research programs were locked into an unproductive cycle of increasing dosage just to demonstrate effects, cycles which made mockery of the core question being studied.</p><p>We tried to improve the overall presentation of the manuscript and rewrote or removed several passages from the Discussion which distracted from the major take-home message. We updated the reference list with more recent and relevant literature and changed or added several new figures for more clarity [Figure 4 (modified), Figure 5 (new), Figure 2—figure supplement 3 (modified), Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (modified), Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (new), Figure 6—figure supplement 2 (new), Figure 6—figure supplement 3 (new), Figure 7—figure supplement 3 (new)].</p></body></sub-article></article>
