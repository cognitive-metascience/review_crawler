(PTBP1) is a RNA-binding protein (RBP) expressed throughout B cell development. Deletion of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in mouse pro-B cells results in upregulation of PTBP2 and normal B cell development. We show that PTBP2 compensates for PTBP1 in B cell ontogeny as deletion of both <italic>Ptbp1</italic> and <italic>Ptbp2</italic> results in a complete block at the pro-B cell stage and a lack of mature B cells. In pro-B cells PTBP1 ensures precise synchronisation of the activity of cyclin dependent kinases at distinct stages of the cell cycle, suppresses S-phase entry and promotes progression into mitosis. PTBP1 controls mRNA abundance and alternative splicing of important cell cycle regulators including CYCLIN-D2, c-MYC, p107 and CDC25B. Our results reveal a previously unrecognised mechanism mediated by a RBP that is essential for B cell ontogeny and integrates transcriptional and post-translational determinants of progression through the cell cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell development</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J00152X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P01898X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monzón-Casanova</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BBS/E/B/000C0427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200823/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000921</institution-id><institution>European Cooperation in Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA17103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monzón-Casanova</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZA 881/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zarnack</surname><given-names>Kathi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-binding protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is essential for B cell development at the pro-B cell stage where it suppresses S-phase entry and promotes progression through mitosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibody diversity is crucial to fight infections and is generated throughout B cell development by the orderly recombination of V(D)J gene segments of the immunoglobulin heavy (Igh) and light (Igl) chain loci. Igh-recombination at the pro-B cell stage typically occurs before Igl recombination in B cell ontogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Pro-B cells can be separated into fractions (Fr) B and C according to Hardy’s criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardy et al., 1991</xref>), with D to J gene segment recombination occurring in FrB pro-B cells prior to V to DJ recombination in FrC pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2003</xref>). Successful VDJ recombination of the Igh chain locus is coupled with a rapid proliferative expansion of early-pre-B cells (FrC’) and the subsequent return to quiescence permissive for recombination at the Igl chain loci in late-pre-B cells (FrD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>). V(D)J recombination occurs during the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlissel et al., 1993</xref>) and the RAG proteins, which are essential for V(D)J recombination, are degraded upon entry into S-phase, suppressing further recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 1996</xref>). The alternation between proliferative and non-proliferative stages during B cell development is precisely controlled to maintain genomic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2014</xref>). Several factors have been identified that suppress proliferation in late-pre-B cells and allow Igl recombination. These include B cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) and protein arginine methyl transferase 1 (PRMT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolezal et al., 2017</xref>), the signal transducers RAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mandal et al., 2009</xref>) and dual specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>) and the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor-4 and −8 (IRF4, IRF8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2003</xref>), IKAROS and AIOLOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), BCL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nahar et al., 2011</xref>) and FOXO3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herzog et al., 2008</xref>). In pro-B cells, IL-7 promotes cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2014</xref>) and the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 suppress proliferation, allowing Igh chain recombination and B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galloway et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, by comparison to pre-B cells the mechanisms and genes that control proliferation in pro-B cells remain poorly understood.</p><p>Transcription factors act to determine which genes are transcribed and the tempo of transcription. A significant body of work has identified a network of transcription factors that control the development and identity of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busslinger, 2004</xref>). Amongst these, FOXO1 is essential for progression after the pro-B cell stage and to induce expression of <italic>Rag</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dengler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amin and Schlissel, 2008</xref>). After transcription, numerous RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>) control messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and coordinate functionally related genes into mRNA regulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keene, 2007</xref>). These post-transcriptionally controlled networks are more challenging to identify because they may combine the effects of different RBPs or microRNAs on the splicing, polyadenylation, export, stability, localization and translation of mRNA. Dynamic gene expression during development and stress responses, which takes place on a timescale of minutes to hours, requires the coordination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms by signalling pathways. The identity of the RBPs that regulate proliferation and differentiation of B cells remains largely unknown.</p><p>Polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins (PTBP) are RBPs with pleiotropic functions that control alternative splicing (AS), polyadenylation site-selection, mRNA stability and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knoch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knoch et al., 2014</xref>). They are encoded by a set of highly conserved paralogous genes of which PTBP1 is expressed in many cell types while PTBP2 and PTBP3 (formerly ROD1) are expressed principally in neurons and hematopoietic cells, respectively. Both PTBP1 and PTBP3 are expressed in mature B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>). PTBP1 can either increase or decrease mRNA stability by binding to the 3’UTR of transcripts, by modulating the AS of exons that will generate transcript isoforms that undergo degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or by affecting polyadenylation site selection and thus the content of the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). PTBP1 binds to <italic>Ptbp2</italic> mRNA and, by inducing <italic>Ptbp2</italic> exon 10 skipping, promotes NMD to suppress expression of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>PTBP1 and PTBP2 have specific and redundant roles and expression of PTBP2 in PTBP1-deficient cells compensates for many functions of PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spellman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>). To study the unique roles of PTBP1 in B cells, we and others have deleted <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in pro-B cells and found normal B cell development accompanied by upregulated PTBP2 expression but important defects in germinal centre (GC) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sasanuma et al., 2019</xref>). In GC B cells PTBP1 promotes the selection of B cell clones with high affinity antibodies, in part by promoting the c-MYC gene expression program induced upon positive selection following T cell help, and this function is not compensated by the upregulated PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>). Here we addressed the potential for redundancy between PTBP in B cell development. We show that PTBP3 is dispensable for B cell development while PTBP1 and, in its absence PTBP2, are essential to promote B cell lymphopoiesis beyond the pro-B cell stage. In pro-B cells, PTBP1 suppresses entry into S-phase and promotes transition into mitosis after G2-phase. At the molecular level, PTBP1 controls mRNA abundance and AS of genes important for S-phase entry and mitosis. Therefore, PTBP1 is an essential component of a previously unrecognised posttranscriptional mechanism controlling proliferation in pro-B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PTBP2 can compensate for PTBP1 in B cells</title><p>We used a panel of previously characterised PTBP paralog-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>) to measure the expression of the three main PTBP members at defined stages of B cell development in mouse bone marrow by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Therefore, PTBP2 compensated for the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP3 during B cell development in the bone marrow. Our findings revealed high redundancy between the different PTBP paralogs which could reflect a requirement of certain amounts of total PTBP protein for the development of B cells. Importantly, we showed an essential role for PTBP1 in B cell development at the pro-B cell stage that is compensated for by PTBP2, but not by PTBP3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PTBP1 regulates mRNA abundance and AS in pro-B cells</title><p>To establish the genes regulated by PTBP1 necessary for successful B cell development in pro-B cells we carried out mRNAseq on cKIT<sup>+</sup> FrB pro-B cells from P1P2dKO, P1sKO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We carried out five biological replicates per condition and sequenced the mRNAseq libraries on a 125 bp paired-end mode obtaining ~105 million reads per sample to increase the probability of capturing reads spanning two different exons which inform on which splice sites are used. We focused our analysis on FrB pro-B cells as they are the first stage where PTBP1 and PTBP2 were depleted in B cell development with the <italic>Cd79a<sup>cre</sup></italic> allele. Thereby, we increased the likelihood of identifying direct targets of PTBP1 amongst the genes with differences in gene expression. To identify transcripts directly bound by PTBP1 we made use of a PTBP1 individual-nucleotide resolution Cross-Linking and ImmunoPrecipitation (iCLIP) dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>) which reveals PTBP1-binding sites in the whole transcriptome and thereby allows distinction between direct and indirect targets. The PTBP1 iCLIP data were from mitogen-activated mouse primary B cells because it was not feasible to purify sufficient numbers of pro-B cells for iCLIP. There is a positive correlation between the transcriptomes of mitogen-activated primary B cells and pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that the PTBP1 iCLIP data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>) is suitable to infer PTBP1-bound RNAs in pro-B cells. We only found 681 genes with no mRNA expression (0 Transcripts Per Million (TPM) in activated primary B cells that were expressed in pro-B cells (&gt;=1 TPM). Therefore, the probability of missing specific targets of PTBP1 in pro-B cells using the iCLIP data from mature activated B cells was small.</p><p>We analysed changes in mRNA abundance by comparing pro-B cell transcriptomes from the different genotypes in pairwise comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The inclusion level of a particular alternatively spliced event is displayed as a proportion, scaled to a maximum of 1, of transcripts containing the alternatively spliced mRNA segment.

Such AS events promoting NMD will be underestimated in our data, since NMD-targeted isoforms will be degraded and difficult to detect by mRNAseq.</p><p>As B cell development is largely unaffected in P1sKO mice, we sought to identify differences in mRNA abundance and AS unique to P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to both P1sKO and control pro-B cells to identify the changes causing the block in B cell development in the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2. To this end we carried out unsupervised clustering of the genes with differential mRNA abundance between the different genotypes and genes that were differentially spliced. We identified 1021 and 611 genes with decreased and increased mRNA abundance, respectively, in P1P2dKO compared to control and P1sKO pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Amongst AS changes, we found 971 genes with increased or decreased inclusion levels of at least one event in P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to control and P1sKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). P1P2dKO pro-B cells clustered separately from P1sKO and control pro-B cells when considering abundance changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). When analysing AS, P1P2dKO and P1sKO pro-B cells clustered together but separately from control pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore, the compensatory functions of PTBP2 when PTBP1 is absent were more evident when considering mRNA abundance than AS. We observed only 54 genes with different mRNA abundance (cluster d) or changes in AS (clusters i and iii, 384 events) that were predominantly regulated in P1sKO pro-B cells compared to P1P2dKO and control pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In contrast, large numbers of genes had different mRNA abundance (clusters a, b and c, 1632 genes) and AS (clusters ii and iv, 1397 events) in P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to P1sKO and control pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>).

Amongst genes with increased mRNA abundance we also found an enrichment for ‘ribosome biogenesis’, ‘ribonucleoside biosynthetic process’ and ‘rRNA processing’, indicating a higher biosynthetic capacity of P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to control and P1sKO pro-B cells.</p><p>Amongst genes with reduced mRNA abundance there was an enrichment for ‘cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor activity’. Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors are major regulators of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otto and Sicinski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>) and could be relevant in controlling the proliferation of P1P2dKO pro-B cells.

With this approach, we identified cells in early-, late- or post-S-phase in the whole pro-B cell population. Cells that incorporated only EdU (post-S-phase) were in S-phase at the beginning, but not at the end of the labelling period; cells that incorporated both EdU and BrdU were in late S-phase; and cells labelled only with BrdU at the end of the labelling period were in early S-phase. In control mice, we detected few pre-pro-B cells in S-phase (3.8% in early- and late-S), compared to 13% of pro-B cells and 53% of early-pre-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).

The magnitude of the increase in the proportions of cells in post S-phase was smaller than the increase in either early- or late-S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Combined PTBP1 and PTBP2 deficiency resulted in a complete block in B cell development and striking defects at two stages of the cell cycle of pro-B cells. The enhanced entry into S-phase of pro-B cells was only observed when both PTBP1 and PTBP2 were absent. The role of PTBP1 in suppressing S-phase entry was unanticipated since in other systems, including GC B cells, PTBP1 promoted proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suckale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">La Porta et al., 2016</xref>) and progression through late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>). However, these previous studies were done in the presence of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suckale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">La Porta et al., 2016</xref>) and GC B cells did not tolerate deletion of both PTBP1 and PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the role of PTBP1 in supressing entry into S-phase may not be unique to pro-B cells and may be found in other cell types if they survive the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 long enough to assess cell-cycle progression. Similar to our findings in pro-B cells, PTBP1-deficient GC B cells and embryonic stem cells also had increased proportions of cells in G2/M phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monzón-Casanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shibayama et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the role of PTBP1 in promoting G2 transition into mitosis is conserved in other systems.</p><p>Although the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 caused qualitative and quantitative changes in mRNA expression of many genes, we found that PTBP1 controlled the abundance and splicing of a collection of mRNAs that together comprise a cell cycle mRNA regulon. We identified direct binding of PTBP1 to the targets of this cell cycle mRNA regulon using mature proliferating B cells. Shared and specific mechanisms will control the cell cycle in mature and pro-B cells but the components of this cell cycle mRNA regulon are expressed in both mature and pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, direct binding of PTBP1 to these targets is expected in pro-B cells. The proteins encoded within this mRNA regulon interact with each other to generate feed-forward activation loops that promote cell cycle entry and mitosis. For example, c-MYC suppresses <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> (encoding p27) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2001</xref>) and increases <italic>Ccnd2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>). CYCLIN-D2 promotes nuclear export and degradation of p27/CDKN1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Susaki et al., 2007</xref>) and p27 directly inhibits CYCLIN-D-CDK4/6 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>). Although the block in G2-phase we observed could have resulted from a response to DNA damage we found little evidence for enhanced DNA damage in FrB pro-B cells (data not shown). This data suggested that the block at G2 in P1P2dKO pro-B cells resulted mainly from increased p27 expression. The net outcome from deregulation of the PTBP1 controlled cell cycle mRNA regulon in the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 is an enhanced CDK activity in G0/G1 pro-B cells that drives entry into S-phase and a reduced CDK activity amongst blocked G2 pro-B cells.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>mRNA expression levels of cell cycle regulators in mitogen activated mature B cells and FrB pro-B cells.</title><p>Values shown are arithmetic mean Transcripts Per Million (TPMs) from four and five mRNAseq libraries for activated mature B cells and for FrB pro-B cells, respectively.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Activated mature B cells</th><th>FrB pro-B cells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>Myc</italic></td><td>155.8</td><td>315.3</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Ccnd2</italic></td><td>128.5</td><td>52.7</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Btg2</italic></td><td>51.5</td><td>109.3</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Rbl1</italic></td><td>19.3</td><td>127.0</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Cdc25b</italic></td><td>66.8</td><td>190.1</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Ect2</italic></td><td>17.8</td><td>198.9</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Kif2c</italic></td><td>30.0</td><td>151.6</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Kif22</italic></td><td>35.6</td><td>344.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Our study focused on FrB pro-B cells to increase the likelihood of identifying direct targets of PTBP1 as this is the first stage in B cell development where <italic>Ptbp1</italic> and <italic>Ptbp2</italic> were deleted with the <italic>CD79a<sup>cre</sup></italic> transgene. Absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 in FrC pro-B cells resulted in the same defects in proliferation as in FrB pro-B cells. Thus, alterations in the progression through the cell cycle in both fractions contributed to the block in B cell development in the whole pro-B cell population. FrC pro-B cells lacking PTBP1 and PTBP2 also had an increase in c-MYC expression at the G0/G1 stage and increased p27 expression at G2. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms by which PTBP1 controls the cell cycle and promotes B cell development in pro-B cells were conserved in both pro-B cell fractions.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of PTBP action on the cell cycle mRNA regulon that we assessed were limited to the regulation of AS and mRNA abundance. PTBPs are known, in addition, to control polyadenylation site choice and IRES-mediated translation of certain transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we can expect that additional roles for PTBP1 regulating translation efficiencies and polyadenylation site usage in pro-B cells may emerge. Moreover, by suppressing the inclusion of non-conserved cryptic exons that generate NMD targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sibley et al., 2016</xref>), PTBPs may play a broader role in maintaining the global ‘fidelity’ of the transcriptome. Cryptic exons, that are poorly conserved between mouse and human have been found when both PTBP1 and PTBP2 were depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2016</xref>). In pro-B cells deficient for PTBP1 and PTBP2 we found cryptic exons promoting mRNA degradation amongst cell cycle regulators. For most of them we did not find evidence for their conservation in human cells where PTBP1 and PTBP2 were absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2016</xref>). However, the A5SS in <italic>Rbl1</italic> that generates an NMD-target was conserved in human, suggesting that it is a functional AS-NMD event with a role in post-transcriptional control.</p><p>The role that we have found here for PTBP1 and PTBP2 is distinct from that of other RBPs such as AUF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadri et al., 2010</xref>) and ELAVL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>) which, when deleted, have little effect on B cell development. The ZFP36 family members ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 are important for quiescence during lymphocyte development, but their absence has a much milder impact on B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galloway et al., 2016</xref>) than does the combined absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2. The unique role that we have found for PTBP1 in controlling the cell cycle, and its redundancy with PTBP2, further underscores the importance of post-transcriptional RNA regulation as an essential component of the molecular regulation of the cell cycle. In the context of B cells this regulation is essential for developmental progression beyond the pro-B cell stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained in the Babraham Institute Biological Support Unit.

Xlink sites and clusters of PTBP1 binding were assigned to transcripts and genomic features with the following hierarchy: CDS, 3’UTR, 5’UTR, intron, ncRNA using the Mus_musculus.GRCm38.93.gtf annotation from Ensembl (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). mRNA abundance analysis mRNAseq libraries were trimmed with Trim Galore (v 1.15 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/</ext-link>) with default parameters and mapped with Hisat2 (v 2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) with -p 7 t --<monospace>phred33-quals</monospace> --<monospace>no-mixed</monospace> --<monospace>no-discordant</monospace> parameters, the Mus_musculus.GRCm38 genome and known splice sites from the Mus_musculus.GRCm38.90 annotation. Read counts mapped over genes were counted with HTSeq (v0.10.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) with f bam -r name -s no -a 10 parameters and the Mus_musculus.GRCm38.93.gtf annotation from Ensembl. Reads mapping to immunoglobulin genes (including V, D, J gene segments, light and heavy immunoglobulin genes and T cell receptor genes) were excluded before DESeq2 analysis. Differences in mRNA abundance were computed with DESeq2 (v1.22.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Love et al., 2014</xref>) by extracting differences between different genotypes in pair-wise comparisons using ‘apeglm’ method as a shrinkage estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Information on the sex of the mice from which the mRNAseq libraries were generated was included in the design formula in addition to the genotype (design = ~Sex + Genotype). From the DESeq2 results we only considered genes with a mean expression level of at least 1 FPKM (from the five biological replicates) in any of the three genotypes analysed. FPKMs were calculated with cuffnorm from Cufflinks (v2.2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>) using the -library-norm-method geometric. We considered genes with differential mRNA abundance as those with a |log2-fold change| &gt; 0.5 and a p-adjusted value of &lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>A gene with different mRNA abundance was bound by PTBP1 at the 3’UTR if at least one cluster of PTBP1-binding from the PTBP1 iCLIP data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was found to overlap with any 3’UTRs annotated in the Mus_musculus.GRCm38.93.gtf for that gene after assignation to genomic features for the binding sites of the iCLIP as described above.</p><p>Genes with different mRNA abundance in P1P2dKO FrB pro-B cells compared to P1sKO and control FrB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) were identified after hierarchical clustering of the Euclidian distances between Z-scores of each gene calculated from the DESeq2 normalised read counts for the 15 mRNAseq libraries (five biological replicates per genotype).

Only results from rMATS with reads on exon-exon junctions were considered further. Significantly differential alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>) were defined as events that have an FDR &lt; 0.05, have an absolute inclusion level difference &gt;0.1 (to reduce the number of significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) differentially spliced events computed by rMATS with small changes in splicing between the different pairwise comparisons), come from genes expressed with at least 1 FPKM (mean across five biological replicates in any of the genotypes analysed) and have at least 80 reads from the sum of the five biological replicates mapping to either the included or skipped alternative splicing event in at least one of the two conditions analysed. Only alternative splicing events with the highest inclusion level difference were kept out of AS events which had the same genomic coordinates in the AS event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). rMATS considers five different types of alternative splicing events: skipped exons (SE), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 5’ and 3’ splice sites (A5SS and A3SS, respectively) and retained introns (RI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study from Monzon-Casanova, Turner and colleagues examines the role the Polypyrimidine Tract Binding proteins 1 and 2 in B cell development. The Turner group previously showed that the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 plays an important role in the selection of B cells with high-affinity BCRs in the light zone of germinal centers. In the present manuscript, they demonstrate that the conditional ablation of PTBP1 in B cells resulted in increased expression of PTBP2, which can compensate for the loss of PTBP1, as had been observed in other systems. Conditional loss of both PTBP1 and PTBP2 in Cd79a-Cre Ptbp1(fl/fl) Ptbp2(fl/fl) mice (cDKO) led to the arrest of early B cell development at the pro-B cell stage. Detailed analysis revealed that the developmental block was likely due to the deregulation of cell cycle progression in pro-B cells. The entry into S-phase was accelerated, while progression past the G2-phase was arrested. RNA-seq and iCLIP experiments identified PTBP1/2 targets. The accelerated S-phase entry was possibly due to an increase in positive regulators (Myc and Ccnd2) and a decrease in negative regulators (Btg2 and Rbl1/p107) of S-phase entry in cDKO pro-B cells. A strong increase in expression of the CDK1 inhibitor p27 at the G2/M phase transition likely explains the block to cell progression past the G2-phase.</p><p>The reviewers all found the paper to be of interest for its findings in both B cell biology and posttranscriptional gene regulation. The demonstration that a posttranscriptional regulatory program controls progression through B cell development is novel and important. The PTBP1 proteins have primarily been studied in other cell types, and characterizing their role in hematopoiesis and in cell cycle control is significant. The methods are fairly standard, and the experiments are carefully executed and controlled. However, a number of questions were raised as to how the results were best interpreted. With proper revision, the study could be a valuable contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear why RNA-seq was performed on Fraction B pro-B cells, because the block in the double knockout mice appears to be at the Fraction C to C' transition. The observed gene expression changes seem to have minimal impact on the size of the pro-B cell compartment (Figure 1D). This raises the question of how informative it is to segregate the cells based on CD249/BP1 expression. How would the conclusions be affected if they define pro-B cells as Kit+CD19<sup>+</sup>B220+IgM-IgD-CD25- cells, which encompasses both Fr.B and Fr.C cells?</p><p>2) Given that the block appears later than the changes in cell cycle gene expression, what other gene changes may be relevant to the observed Fraction C to C' block? For example, are genes affecting cell survival also altered in the double knockout pro-B cells, which might lead to an increase pro-B cell death? Is expression normal in double knockout pro-B cells for other genes known to be involved in the pro-B to pre-B cell transition? The above analysis may have already been performed, with the conclusion that aberrant expression of cell cycle regulators are the only genetic changes observed. If so, the paper should present a hypothesis for how cell cycle defects in Fraction B pro B cells lead to the Fraction C to C' block.</p><p>3) The authors use iCLIP data obtained with mature B cells for the interpretation of the pro-B cell expression data, evidently due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient pro-B cells to perform iCLIP experiments. This strategy is not without risk, particularly for identifying cell cycle targets that could be under very different control regimes in the mature cells. This should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>4) Paragraph two of subsection “PTBP2 can compensate for PTBP1 in B cells”: PTBP2 is not normally expressed during B cell development but a key point is that its expression is induced when PTBP1 is deleted. It would be helpful to show these data in the present paper and emphasize the point more clearly. The only support for this critical information is a reference to Supplemental Data in the previous Nature Immunology paper. Similarly, a discussion of PTBP3 seems oddly missing from the paper, since it is expressed in B cells. Is it doing something completely different? Has it been deleted – does a PTBP1/3 double behave like the PTBP1/2 KO? This might indicate that the proteins have a common function but there is a threshold level needed for the total PTBP1/2/3 protein.</p><p>5) More detail is needed on how the RNAseq was done. How many reads were generated per condition? How many replicates? How does this affect the reliability of the splicing analysis? Etc.</p><p>6) In other developmental pathways and in cell culture PTBP1 expression is associated with proliferation. Do the authors think that the cell cycle effects upon PTBP loss described here will be general? More discussion of this is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53557.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear why RNA-seq was performed on Fraction B pro-B cells, because the block in the double knockout mice appears to be at the Fraction C to C' transition.

We focused our analysis on this stage as it enhances the likelihood to find direct targets of PTBP1 necessary for the development of B cells and therefore the segregation between FrB and FrC pro-B cells is informative. We have added this explanation in our revised manuscript (Results section “PTBP1 regulates mRNA abundance and AS in pro-B cells”, “We focused our analysis on FrB pro-B cells…”).</p><p>We include new data identifying pro-B cells as Kit+CD19<sup>+</sup>B220+IgM-IgD-CD25- cells. Identification of pro-B cells with this strategy resulted in only slightly reduced numbers of pro-B cells in P1P2dKO mice compared to control mice (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Therefore, our conclusions are the same after defining pro-B cells with this combination of cell surface proteins and by segregating them into FrB and FrC pro-B cells. We discuss this new data in the Results section (“Enumeration of pro-B cells identified as c-Kit+ CD19<sup>+</sup> B220+ IgM- IgD- CD25- cells yielded similar results (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given that the block appears later than the changes in cell cycle gene expression, what other gene changes may be relevant to the observed Fraction C to C' block? For example, are genes affecting cell survival also altered in the double knockout pro-B cells, which might lead to an increase pro-B cell death? Is expression normal in double knockout pro-B cells for other genes known to be involved in the pro-B to pre-B cell transition? The above analysis may have already been performed, with the conclusion that aberrant expression of cell cycle regulators are the only genetic changes observed. If so, the paper should present a hypothesis for how cell cycle defects in Fraction B pro B cells lead to the Fraction C to C' block.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not find an enrichment for gene-ontology terms related to cell death or apoptosis and mRNA expression of genes important for cell survival such as <italic>Bcl2, BCl<sup>-</sup>XL (Bcl2l2), Bax and Bim (Bcl2l11)</italic> was similar in P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to control pro-B cells. We have included a sentence specifying this information in the Results section “PTBP1 regulates pathways associated with growth and proliferation” (“Similarly, genes regulating cell survival and apoptosis such as Bcl2, Bcl2l2 (BCl<sup>-</sup>XL), Bax and Bcl2l11 (Bim) had normal mRNA abundance and AS patterns in P1P2dKO pro-B cells (Figure 4—source data 1 and 2))”).</p><p>In the Results section “PTBP1 regulates pathways associated with growth and proliferation” we discuss the expression of genes known to be important for the transition between pro- and pre-B cells shown in (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E). Most of these genes have normal mRNA expression in P1P2dKO pro-B cells and we elaborate further on those that have changes in P1P2dKO pro-B cells compared to control pro-B cells. Our conclusion is that the essential elements of B cell development at the pro-B cell stage are unaffected by the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2.</p><p>In our revised manuscript we present new data showing that the cell cycle defects observed in P1P2dKO FrB pro-B cells were also found in P1P2dKO FrC pro-B cells (new data for FrC pro-B cells: Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Similarly, we show that the expression patterns of c-MYC, p27, pS807/811-RB, pT592-SAMHD1 in FrC P1P2dKO pro-B cells is the same as in FrB P1P2dKO pro-B cells (new data for FrC pro-B cells: Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2). Therefore, our hypothesis is that the cell cycle defects observed in FrB pro-cells are conserved at the FrC pro-B cell stage where they will also contribute to the block in B cell development seen in the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2. We have modified the text in the manuscript (“We found an increase in the proportions of FrB and FrC pro-B cells that are in S-phase …”; “These expression patterns of p27 in P1P2dKO FrB pro-B cells were conserved in P1P2dKO FrC pro-B cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 1).” and “Proportions of both p-RB and p-SAMHD1-positive cells were increased in FrB and FrC P1P2dKO G0/G1 pro-B cells compared to control and P1sKO G0/G1 pro-B cells (Figure 7C, 7D, and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B)”; “FrC P1P2dKO pro B cells in G0/G1 also showed increased cMYC-staining compared to control FrC pro-B cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 2)” and included a paragraph in the Discussion section to reflect this hypothesis (“Our study focused on FrB pro-B…”).</p><p>We can expect other genes unrelated to cell cycle control with altered expression in P1P2dKO pro-B cells to have a role in B cell development as there were many genes with altered mRNA expression in the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 (Figure 4). Nonetheless, the control of progression through the cell cycle in pro-B cells constitutes a major function of PTBP1 in pro-B cells and the dramatic block at G2 in P1P2dKO pro-B cells will contribute to the block in B cell development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors use iCLIP data obtained with mature B cells for the interpretation of the pro-B cell expression data, evidently due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient pro-B cells to perform iCLIP experiments. This strategy is not without risk, particularly for identifying cell cycle targets that could be under very different control regimes in the mature cells. This should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The PTBP1 targets we identified that form a cell cycle mRNA regulon in pro-B cells were expressed in mature proliferating B cells (new Table 1). Therefore, we can expect that PTBP1 will also bind to these targets in pro-B cells, even if PTBP1-binding in mature B cells is not direct proof of binding in pro-B cells. We have discussed this point in more detail as follows:</p><p>In the Discussion section, “…We identified direct binding of PTBP1 to the targets of this cell cycle mRNA regulon using mature proliferating B cells. Shared and specific mechanisms will control the cell cycle in mature and pro-B cells. The components of this cell cycle mRNA regulon are expressed in both mature and pro-B cells (Table 1). Therefore, direct binding of PTBP1 to these targets is expected in pro-B cells.”</p><p>And in the Results section “PTBP1 regulates pathways associated with growth and proliferation”: “None of these CDK inhibitors has an obvious change in AS or a binding site for PTBP1 in the 3’UTR (Figure 4—source data 1 and 2) although they were expressed in mature B cells (data not shown).”</p><p>Moreover, there could be additional PTBP1 targets in pro-B cells that are not captured in our iCLIP from mature proliferating B cells. We also discuss this point further in the Results section “PTBP1 regulates mRNA abundance and AS in pro-B cells”: “The PTBP1 iCLIP data were from mitogen-activated mouse primary B cells because it was not feasible to purify sufficient numbers of pro-B cells for iCLIP. There is a positive correlation between the transcriptomes of mitogen-activated primary B cells and pro-B cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), suggesting that the PTBP1 iCLIP data set (Supplementary Files 1 and 2) is suitable to infer PTBP1-bound RNAs in pro-B cells. We only found 681 genes with no mRNA expression (0 Transcript Per Million (TPM) in activated primary B cells that were expressed in pro-B cells (&gt;= 1 TPM). Therefore, the probability of missing specific targets of PTBP1 in pro-B cells using the iCLIP data from mature activated B cells was small.”</p><p>In summary, we acknowledge that this strategy has risks and have discussed them in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Paragraph two of subsection “PTBP2 can compensate for PTBP1 in B cells”: PTBP2 is not normally expressed during B cell development but a key point is that its expression is induced when PTBP1 is deleted. It would be helpful to show these data in the present paper and emphasize the point more clearly. The only support for this critical information is a reference to Supplemental Data in the previous Nature Immunology paper. Similarly, a discussion of PTBP3 seems oddly missing from the paper, since it is expressed in B cells. Is it doing something completely different? Has it been deleted – does a PTBP1/3 double behave like the PTBP1/2 KO? This might indicate that the proteins have a common function but there is a threshold level needed for the total PTBP1/2/3 protein.</p></disp-quote><p>To emphasise that PTBP2 is only expressed in B cells in the absence of PTBP1 we now present the data on PTBPs expression throughout B cell development in Figure 1 instead of in the supplementary/expanded data. We also present new flow cytometry data showing that PTBP2 is only expressed in B cells in the absence of PTBP1 in Figure 2B and emphasize this point more clearly in the text (“Deletion of Ptbp1 resulted in expression of PTBP2 (Figure 2B and (Monzon-Casanova et al., 2018))…”). Moreover, we also show now the expression of PTBP2 in PTBP1-deficient pro-B cells in Figure 3C, while in our previous version of the manuscript this data were in a supplementary figure.</p><p>We addressed the roles of PTBP3 in B cell development with a novel <italic>Ptbp3</italic>-floxed allele and include our results now in the revised manuscript (“To study the roles of PTBP3 in B cell development we deleted Ptbp3…”). Deletion of <italic>Ptbp3</italic> results in normal B cell development (new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Therefore, PTBP1 compensates for any potential roles of PTBP3 in the development of B cells.</p><p>Moreover, we also generated a Ptbp1 and Ptbp3 double conditional KO mouse (P1P3dKO) with the <italic>Ptbp1<sup>fl</sup>, Ptbp3<sup>fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Cd79a<sup>cre</sup></italic> alleles. B cell development in the bone marrow of these mice is normal (new data in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). P1P3dKO B cells express PTBP2 (new data in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). Therefore, PTBP2 in P1P3dKO B cells compensates for the functions of PTBP1 and PTBP3 during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. These data show high redundancy between the different PTBP paralogs in B cell development in the bone marrow. The different phenotypes observed in the different conditional knockout mouse models could indeed reflect a requirement of certain amounts of total PTBP protein at distinct stages of B cell development. We discuss this possibility in the Results section “The essential role for PTBP1 in the absence of PTBP2 in B cell development is at the pro-B cell stage” in our revised manuscript (“Deletion of Ptbp1 and Ptbp3 at the pro-B cell stage…”)</p><p>Importantly, the developmental block at the pro-B cell stage in the P1P2dKO mice despite the expression of PTBP3 by P1P2dKO pro-B cells, shows that PTBP1 is the most important PTBP paralog for successful B cell development in the bone marrow. Therefore, we focus on the roles of PTBP1 in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More detail is needed on how the RNAseq was done. How many reads were generated per condition? How many replicates? How does this affect the reliability of the splicing analysis? Etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more details on how the RNAseq was carried out in the Results and the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.

Therefore, we sequenced the mRNAseq libraries with an Illumina HiSeq2500 on a 2x125 bp paired-end run at high depth. We obtained an average of 52.5 million reads per sample from each end resulting in an average of ~105 total million reads per sample.”</p><p>New text in the Results section “PTBP1 regulates mRNA abundance and AS in pro-B cells”: “We carried out five biological replicates per condition and sequenced the mRNAseq libraries on a 125bp paired-end mode obtaining ~105 million reads per sample to increase the probability of capturing reads spanning two different exons which inform on which splice sites are used”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In other developmental pathways and in cell culture PTBP1 expression is associated with proliferation. Do the authors think that the cell cycle effects upon PTBP loss described here will be general? More discussion of this is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended our discussion related to the roles of PTBP1 in controlling proliferation in the Discussion section. We comment now on the roles of PTBP1 in supressing entry into S-phase and promoting progression from G2 into mitosis separately. “Combined PTBP1 and PTBP2 deficiency resulted in a complete block in B cell development and striking defects at two stages of the cell cycle of pro-B cells. The enhanced entry into S-phase of pro-B cells was only observed when both PTBP1 and PTBP2 were absent. The role of PTBP1 in suppressing S-phase entry was unanticipated since in other systems, including GC B cells, PTBP1 promoted proliferation (Suckale et al., 2011; Shibayama et al., 2009; La Porta et al., 2016) and progression through late S-phase (Monzon-Casanova et al., 2018). However, these previous studies were done in the presence of PTBP2 (Suckale et al., 2011; Shibayama et al., 2009; La Porta et al., 2016) and GC B cells did not tolerate deletion of both PTBP1 and PTBP2 (Monzon-Casanova et al., 2018). Thus, the role of PTBP1 in supressing entry into S-phase may not be unique to pro-B cells and may be found in other cell types if they survive the absence of PTBP1 and PTBP2 long enough to assess cell-cycle progression. Similar to our findings in pro-B cells, PTBP1-deficient GC B cells and embryonic stem cells also had increased proportions of cells in G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Monzon-Casanova et al., 2018; Shibayama et al., 2009). Therefore, the role of PTBP1 in promoting G2 transition into mitosis is conserved in other systems”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
