The vertebrae form from blocks of tissue called somites that make segments along the body axis—a virtual line running from the head to the tail-end—of the embryo.

The PM becomes segmented into epithelial structures called somites, which are sequentially produced in a rhythmic fashion from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The PSM is formed caudally during gastrulation by ingression of the PM progenitors located initially in the anterior part of the primitive streak (PS) and later, in the tail-bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bénazéraf and Pourquié, 2013</xref>). At the end of somitogenesis, the embryonic axis is segmented into a fixed species-specific number of somites which varies tremendously between species ranging from as little as ∼32 in zebrafish to more than 300 in some snakes. The somites subsequently differentiate into their final vertebral and muscular derivatives to establish the various characteristic anatomical regions of the body. <italic>Hox</italic> genes code for a family of transcription factors involved in specification of regional identity along the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mallo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noordermeer and Duboule, 2013</xref>). In mouse and chicken, the 39 <italic>Hox</italic> genes are organized in four clusters containing up to thirteen paralogous genes each. <italic>Hox</italic> genes exhibit both spatial and temporal collinearity, meaning that they are activated in a sequence reflecting their position along the chromosome and become expressed in domains whose anterior boundaries along the body axis also reflect their position in the clusters.</p><p>Whether <italic>Hox</italic> genes control axis length and segment number has been controversial. Mouse mutants in which entire sets of <italic>Hox</italic> paralogs are inactivated show severe vertebral patterning defects but exhibit normal vertebral counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wellik and Capecchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McIntyre et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, precocious expression of <italic>Hox13</italic> genes in transgenic mice leads to axis truncation with reduced vertebral numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, mouse null mutations for <italic>Hoxb13</italic> or <italic>Hoxc13</italic> result in the production of supernumerary vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godwin and Capecchi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Economides et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In chicken and fish embryos, the arrest of axis elongation has been linked to the inhibition of FGF and Wnt signaling in the tail-bud which leads to the down-regulation of the transcription factor <italic>T/Brachyury</italic> and of the Retinoic Acid (RA)-degrading enzyme <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Kimelman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). Downregulation of <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> in the tail-bud ultimately leads to rising RA levels and to differentiation and death of the PM progenitors which terminates axis elongation. Premature exposure of the tail-bud to high RA levels in chicken or mouse embryos inhibits Wnt and FGF signaling and leads to axis truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iulianella et al., 1999</xref>) suggesting that the tail-bud must be protected from the differentiating action of RA. In the <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> null mutant mice, RA-signaling reaches the tail-bud, prematurely inducing the downregulation of FGF signaling and the increase of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression, resulting in axis truncation posterior to the thoracic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Abed et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakai et al., 2001</xref>). In chicken, the tail-bud starts to produce RA when explanted in culture after the 40-somite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>). This late RA signaling activity in the tail-bud is involved in the termination of segmentation and axis elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). At the 40-somite stage, the mRNA for <italic>Raldh2</italic>, the RA-biosynthetic enzyme becomes expressed in the tail-bud potentially accounting for this late RA activity. What triggers this late expression of <italic>Raldh2</italic> in the chicken tail-bud is however unknown.</p><p>In vertebrates, the termination of axis elongation is accompanied by a progressive reduction in size of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez and Pourquié, 2009</xref>). The shrinking of the PSM which brings the segmented region producing RA in the vicinity of the tail-bud might also contribute to the raise in RA levels in the tail-bud and possibly to the late <italic>Raldh2</italic> activation in the tail-bud. Thus in the chicken embryo, the timing of elongation arrest (and hence the total number of somites formed) could be in part controlled by the kinetics of PSM shrinking. PSM size depends on the velocity of somite formation which removes cells anteriorly and on the flux of cells from the primitive streak and tail-bud generated during elongation which injects cells posteriorly. How this flux of progenitors ingressing in the PSM is regulated over time, and which genes are regulating this process remain poorly understood. <italic>Hoxb1-9</italic> genes have been proposed to control cell ingression of paraxial mesoderm precursors from the epiblast during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>). However, <italic>Hoxb1-9</italic> genes are only expressed in anterior regions of the embryo precluding their playing a role in the control of axis termination.</p><p>Here, we first investigate the relationship between the speed of somite formation and of axis elongation. We show that, in the chicken embryo, activation of Abdominal B-like posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the tail-bud correlates with the slowing down of axis elongation, while the speed of somitogenesis remains approximately constant. Our data indicate that a subset of progressively more posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes, which are collinearly activated in vertebral precursors, repress Wnt and FGF activity with increasing strength, leading to a graded repression of the <italic>Brachyury/T</italic> transcription factor. This progressively reduces mesoderm ingression and cell motility in the PSM, thus slowing down the elongation process. Due to the continuation of somite formation at a steady pace, this mechanism leads to the progressive reduction of PSM size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activation of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes correlates with axis elongation slowing down</title><p>We measured the variations of velocities of axis elongation and somite formation in time-lapse videos of developing chicken embryos during the formation of the first 30 somites (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

In contrast, axis elongation velocity increases during the formation of the first 10 somites and then it decreases until the 25-somite stage, when it drops abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>, n = 41 embryos).

Activation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the epiblast and tail-bud is collinear and occurs in two phases. First, the paralog groups 1 to 8 (and <italic>Hoxb9</italic>) are quickly activated within ten hours before the first somite formation (stage 7 HH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, n = 8 embryos for each condition).

We developed a strategy allowing to overexpress two different sets of constructs in largely different populations of paraxial mesoderm cells by performing two consecutive electroporations of the paraxial mesoderm (PM) precursors of the epiblast of stage 4–5 HH embryos. Embryos are first electroporated on the left side of the primitive streak with a control Cherry construct, and then on the right side of the streak with a second vector expressing the yellow fluorescent protein Venus and a <italic>Hox</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This strategy results in essentially different PM cells expressing the two sets of constructs with the Cherry expressing cells enriched on the left side whereas Hox expressing cells are mostly found on the right side.

In contrast, cells expressing Cherry were always extending more anteriorly than cells expressing Venus and one of the following posterior <italic>Hox</italic> gene: <italic>Hoxa9, Hoxc9, Hoxd10, Hoxd11, Hoxc11, Hoxa13, Hoxb13,</italic> or <italic>Hoxc13</italic>, indicating that these <italic>Hox</italic> genes can delay cell ingression of the PSM progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref> n &gt; 6 for each condition and not shown). This simply reflects the fact that cells ingressing later become located more posteriorly. Strikingly, the effect on ingression was progressively stronger when overexpressing more 5′ genes suggesting a collinear trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Inverting the order in which the constructs are electroporated did not affect the final phenotype. The distance between the anterior boundaries of the two domains was found to progressively increase with more posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes as shown by measuring the ratio between Venus and Cherry posterior domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Over-expression of <italic>Hoxa10, Hoxc10, Hoxa11, Hoxc12, Hoxd12 and Hoxd13</italic> showed no difference with the control Cherry vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, n &gt; 6 for each condition and data not shown). Using consecutive electroporation of <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and <italic>Hoxc11</italic> constructs labeled with Cherry and Venus, respectively, we observed that <italic>Hoxc11</italic> has a stronger effect on ingression than <italic>Hoxd10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, n = 12 embryos).

No ectopic expression of laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B–C″</xref>), acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D–E″</xref>), or E-cadherin (data not shown) was observed after <italic>Hoxa13</italic> over-expression. We compared the number of Venus-positive cells in epiblast vs primitive streak and mesoderm in embryo sections. The majority of <italic>Hoxa13</italic>-expressing cells were still found in the epiblast while control cells have ingressed into the primitive streak and mesoderm indicating that <italic>Hoxa13</italic> delays ingression by retaining cells in the epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>, n = 4 embryos for each condition). No up-regulation of the neural marker <italic>Sox2</italic> was observed in the tail-bud of embryos electroporated with <italic>Hoxa13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>, n = 8 embryos for each condition) and very few cells were observed in the neural tube of embryos electroporated with Hox constructs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>, Figure 6A–B, Figure 7D–J and Figure 9A and Videos 4–8). This indicates that the effect on ingression is not caused by the recruitment of PM precursor cells to a neural fate. Ingression of cells from the epiblast to the primitive streak occurs via an epithelium to mesenchyme transition which involves first destabilization and then complete loss of basal microtubules in these cells. This process has been shown to be regulated by a basally localized activity of the small GTPase RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakaya et al., 2008</xref>). In order to test if the effect of the posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes on delaying PSM progenitors ingression could involve regulation of microtubule stability, we used a dominant negative form of <italic>RhoA</italic> (DN-RhoA) as a tool to destabilize basal microtubules in the epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakaya et al., 2008</xref>).

We observe a similar collinear effect of these posterior genes overexpressed in PM precursors on delaying their ingression in the PSM and on the slowing down of axis elongation. This inhibition of Wnt signaling is accompanied by a down-regulation of FGF signaling which was shown to control elongation velocity by regulating cell motility in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bénazéraf et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are involved in the slowing down of axis elongation by acting both on the flux of cells in the posterior PSM and on the motility of PSM cells.</p><p>In the chicken embryo, PM precursors originate initially from the lateral epiblast which migrate toward the midline during formation of the primitive streak ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selleck and Stern, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatada and Stern, 1994</xref>). Around stage 4 HH, somite precursors begin to ingress from the superficial epiblast of the anterior primitive streak and posterior Node region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iimura et al., 2007</xref>). Two types of PM precursors have been identified in chicken and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). A first set derives from the Node/primitive streak border and exhibits long-term self-renewal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selleck and Stern, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2007</xref>). These cells express <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Brachyury</italic> and they can contribute both to the PM (mostly to the medial part of the somites) and to the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ordahl, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondoh and Takemoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). A second set derives from the anterior portion of the primitive streak and contributes to shorter clones restricted to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>). After stage 4 HH, in the chicken embryo, the primitive streak begins to regress and after stage 13-14 HH, it becomes part of the tail-bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoenwolf, 1979</xref>). At the 25-somite stage (stage 15 HH), the posterior neuropore closes and the tail-bud becomes enclosed into the tail fold. During these stages, PM precursors are continuously produced first by the primitive streak and then by the tail-bud. Fate mapping of the 25-somite stage tail-bud with quail-chick chimeras and diI labeling showed that the formation of the PM follows morphogenetic movements very similar to that seen earlier at the primitive streak level during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catala et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knezevic et al., 1998</xref>). After this stage, the remnant of the primitive streak becomes localized ventrally to form a structure known as the Ventral Ectodermal Ridge (VER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoenwolf, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldman et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Whether cell ingression continues after posterior neuropore closure to generate the PM is not well established. Knezevic et al. reported that cell ingression from the VER stops at stage 16 HH (26–28 somites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knezevic et al., 1998</xref>) but Ohta et al. demonstrated that ingression into the mesoderm continues in the VER up to the 40-somite stage (stage 20 HH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohta et al., 2007</xref>). There is also some lineage continuity at the level of the PM precursors of the Node/primitive streak border which were shown to become internalized to become part of the chordo-neural hinge in the tail-bud. DiI labeling of the late chordo-neural hinge in stage 20–22 HH (40–45 somites) embryos showed that mesoderm cells are produced by this structure at late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>). The cellular organization of the chordo-neural hinge has not been characterized and whether mesoderm production by this structure occurs through ingression movements involving an epithelium to mesenchyme transition as is seen for the production of paraxial mesoderm from the primitive streak is not established. Overall, very little is known about the movements of cells in the tail-bud after the 25-somite stage in chicken and mouse embryos. The respective contribution of the VER and the CNH to the PM at these late stages has not been characterized.</p><p>If Knezevic et al. are correct, it could be that the action of posterior Hox genes on ingression ends at the 25-somite stage when <italic>Hoxa13</italic> is first expressed. The strong effect of <italic>Hoxa13</italic> on ingression might trigger the arrest of cell ingression leading to the slowing down of axis elongation observed at this stage. The resulting imbalance between the velocity of somitogenesis and of axis elongation could account for the progressive shortening of the PSM observed during the production of the next 25–28 somites. Alternatively, it could be that, as suggested by Ohta et al. and by Olivera-Martinez et al., ingression continues up to the 40–45 somite stage. In this case, <italic>Hoxa13</italic> expression at the 25-somite stage would only significantly reduce the rate of cell ingression into the PM. At the 40–43 somite stage, <italic>Hoxb13</italic> and <italic>Hoxc13</italic> become expressed in the tail-bud potentially terminating further ingression. Whether Hox13 genes might regulate the late ingression of PM at the level of the VER, as shown by Ohta et al., or at the level of the CNH as proposed by Olivera-Martinez remains to be established. In both cases, however, the PSM is expected to shrink in response to Hox13 genes.</p><p>Even though our experiments do not directly address the process whereby axis elongation stops, they suggest that Wnt and FGF repression in the tail-bud, which signals termination of axis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al., 2012</xref>), could be mediated by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes. By reducing the flux of cells to the PSM and their motility, posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes can indirectly control its progressive shortening. Furthermore, the inhibition of FGF and Wnt signaling which are required for the segmentation clock oscillations provides an explanation for the arrest of somite formation before the complete exhaustion of the PSM described in avians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellairs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>). In vivo, the downregulation of the FGF target <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> downstream of Hox13 genes (this report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>) would leave the tail-bud more vulnerable to the increase of RA. Whether, the raise in RA levels caused by bringing the segmented region closer is also responsible for <italic>raldh2</italic> activation in the late tail-bud remains to be explored. In such scenarios, posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes indirectly control the termination of axis elongation and hence the segment number in the chicken embryo.</p><p>In mouse embryos, over-expression of Hox13 genes results in axis truncation posterior to the thoracic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, overexpression of <italic>Hoxa13</italic>, <italic>b13,</italic> and <italic>c13</italic> from the same promoter in transgenic mice results in truncations at different antero-posterior levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>), arguing for different truncation efficiency of the mouse Hox13 proteins. This is highly reminiscent of our observations showing different quantitative effects of the overexpression of the same three Hox13 genes in chicken embryos. Duplications and deletions of regions of the mouse <italic>Hoxd</italic> cluster lead to heterochronic expression of posterior <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes in the tail-bud yet they do not seem to alter segment numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kmita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tarchini and Duboule, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tschopp et al., 2009</xref>). This is also consistent with our observations that <italic>Hoxd</italic> genes have limited effect on axis elongation in our experiments.</p><p>In transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>Hoxc13</italic>, Wnt targets and the FGF target <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> were also found to be down-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2009</xref>) as observed in chicken embryos overexpressing <italic>Hoxa13</italic>. This argues for a conserved role of posterior Hox proteins in the repression of the Wnt and FGF pathway between chicken and mouse embryos. In mouse embryos however, no strong <italic>raldh2</italic> expression or late RA production is detected in the tail bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al., 2010</xref>) and axis elongation continues for a longer time resulting in tail formation. Moreover, <italic>raldh2</italic> −/− mouse embryos which lack RA production during posterior body formation can form normal tails, suggesting that RA is not involved in axis termination in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 2011</xref>). In mouse embryos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington (1996)</xref> initially reported an arrest of ingression when the posterior neuropore closes at the 30-somite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington, 1996</xref>), but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</xref> subsequently provided evidence for continued ingression of cells in the PM after this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cambray and Wilson, 2002</xref>). Thus, in mouse embryos, termination of axis elongation could simply result from exhaustion of PM progenitors caused by the slowing of axis elongation triggered by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes acting on cell ingression and motility. Remarkably, among amniotes, many species such as lizards, rodents, or monkeys bear a long tail whereas others such as birds or humans do not. Closely related species such as monkeys and apes can differ by the presence of a tail suggesting that the genetic switch involved in the control of tail formation is quite simple. Whether this switch involves an RA-dependent elongation arrest mechanism as seen in chicken and whether this control depends on posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes is an attractive possibility which remains to be investigated.</p><p>Our work provides evidence for functional collinearity in the control of axis elongation by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Our data also suggest that our overexpression conditions are saturating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), abolishing any effect of gene dosage of the overexpressed <italic>Hox</italic> genes. This confirms previous results published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref> showing that <italic>Hoxb1-9</italic> gene expression driven by promoters of different strength (CMV, TK, and CAGGS) leads to similar ingression phenotypes. Together, this suggests that the information driving the quantitative effects of Hox proteins on Wnt repression, cell ingression, and elongation is built in the structure of the proteins themselves rather than reflecting the actual amounts of Hox proteins present. This functional collinearity might be related to the recently described structural collinearity of binding specificities reported for fly Hox proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slattery et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our work suggests that low amounts of posterior Hox protein levels could be saturating in vivo. This is consistent with the analysis of paralog knock-out experiments showing that leaving only one single wild-type allele leads to a much milder phenotype than the deletion of an entire paralog group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wellik and Capecchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McIntyre et al., 2007</xref>). Also, increasing Hox doses by adding an extra mouse or human HoxD cluster does not alter the vertebral formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kmita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tarchini and Duboule, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tschopp et al., 2009</xref>). The fact that low levels of <italic>Hox</italic> proteins are saturating could confer great robustness to the system consistent with the extreme stability of intraspecific vertebral formula. That 8 of the 16 posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes from all posterior paralog groups except Hox12 show an effect in the ingression, elongation, and Wnt signaling assays argue for an extreme redundancy of the system that could further explain the intraspecific robustness of the vertebral formula.</p><p>We observe a trend showing an increasing strength of the effects on cell ingression, Wnt repression, and axis elongation when overexpressing progressively more 5′ Hox genes. This increasing trend can be partly accounted for by the posterior prevalence of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes observed in the control of ingression and in the repression of Wnt signaling for genes of different paralog groups. However, different quantitative effects were observed for genes from the same paralog groups arguing against a simple posterior prevalence model. This is in line with the result of inactivation of the entire paralogs groups such as <italic>Hox10</italic> or <italic>Hox11</italic> which demonstrates specific properties of each of these paralog groups arguing against a simple posterior prevalence model functioning in vertebral patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wellik and Capecchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McIntyre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We identify a role for the TALE protein Pbx1 in the control of cell ingression from the epiblast into the PSM by anterior but not posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes. TALE homeoproteins have been shown to act as co-factors able to enhance DNA binding specificity of Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moens and Selleri, 2006</xref>).

Embryos with progressively lower quantities of T exhibit more severe axis truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stott et al., 1993</xref>). Similar graded truncations are also observed for <italic>Wnt3a</italic> allelic series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galceran et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that precise quantitative regulation of this pathway is required for completion of body axis elongation.

Our data suggest that the gradient of T activity is established by the graded regulation of Wnt signaling by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) thus providing a possible explanation for these complex phenotypes. At the cellular level, it argues that the Hox-dependent regulation of <italic>T</italic> levels in the epiblast is critical to control the balance between cell ingression and maintenance of a self-renewing paraxial mesoderm progenitor pool in the epiblast/tail-bud. Cell ingression requires an EMT that involves destabilization of the basal microtubules of epiblast cells followed by basal membrane breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakaya et al., 2008</xref>). Inhibiting Rhoa activity can rescue the ingression delay caused by <italic>Hoxa13</italic> overexpression, suggesting that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes can control cell flux to the PM by acting on basal microtubule stabilization in epiblast cells. As T is also able to rescue <italic>Hoxa13</italic> phenotype on elongation, it could act upstream of this process and the details of such a molecular pathway remain to be investigated.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04379.027</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model representing the 3 phases (I, II, and III) of <italic>Hox</italic> action in PM precursors in the epiblast/tail-bud during axis elongation.</title><p>Model representing the 3 phases (I, II, and III) of <italic>Hox</italic> action in PSM precursors in the epiblast/tail-bud during body axis elongation.

This results in a progressive arrest of cell ingression in the PSM, leading to a decrease in axis elongation rate.

Thus, the Wnt repression experienced by epiblast cells in response to posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes overexpression could induce these cells toward a neural fate hence preventing them to ingress. However, <italic>Hoxa13</italic> overexpression does not lead to up-regulation of the neural marker <italic>Sox2</italic> in electroporated cells as detected by in situ hybridization and in our microarray analysis. Furthermore, electroporated cells are seen to enter the PM and do not enter the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and supplementary videos). This therefore suggests that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are unlikely to control cell ingression by promoting acquisition of a neural fate in epiblast cells. While we cannot completely rule out that a subpopulation of these cells remains in the tail-bud as <italic>Sox2</italic>-positive cells, it is unlikely that this contributes to the dramatic axis elongation slow down observed after posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes overexpression.</p><p>Thus our data suggest that disruption of the balance between epiblast and ingressing cells can be achieved by interfering with <italic>T</italic> levels either directly or indirectly by altering Wnt levels or Hox expression.

Only embryos successfully electroporated in the PSM progenitors (90–100%) are processed for videos (see the axis elongation measurement section). For the luciferase assay embryos are electroporated in the PM progenitors and examined 20 hr after electroporation (see the Luciferase assay section). In both assays, we finally obtain 90–100% of the electroporated embryos showing reporter expression restricted to the paraxial mesoderm. In rare cases (less than 10%), we observed few cells in the lateral plate mesoderm. These embryos were discarded. To better illustrate the accuracy of the electroporations performed, we now present a video showing the expression of a control construct electroporated in the anterior epiblast and showing the ingressing PSM cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Consecutive electroporation</title><p>To over-express two sets of constructs in different somitic precursors of the epiblast, two consecutive electroporations of the anterior primitive streak (PS) were carried out. Embryos were first prepared for EC culture at room temperature which pause their development. The first construct mixed with the control vector pCX-MyrCherry (gift from X Morin) was microinjected on one side of the PS groove and the first electroporation was carried out as described above right after injection. Only 10 s after the first electroporation, the second construct, containing the gene to over-express (<italic>Hox</italic>, <italic>T…</italic>) cloned in the pCAGGS-I2-MyrVenus, was then microinjected at the same level on the other side of the PS groove and immediately electroporated. This procedure targets the entire paraxial mesoderm territory of the epiblast of the anterior primitive streak on the electroporated side. Thus, in these experiments, we only track the timing of ingression of the most anterior epiblast cells which give rise to the most anteriorly localized progeny in the paraxial mesoderm. By biasing the position of the electrode on the right or on the left side of the primitive streak, we can ensure that the electroporation is biased on one side allowing easier observation of the anterior boundaries of the over-expressing cells. In most cases, however, some electroporated cells are seen on both sides despite this bias. The control Cherry vector is usually found to be more bilateral than the <italic>Hox</italic> expressing Venus-positive cells as can be seen from the pictures, which reflects an effect specific to <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Inverting the order of the electroporated plasmids in consecutive electroporation has no effect on the outcome of the experiment, and similar results are observed when the entire somitic territory of the epiblast of the anterior streak is electroporated. Following consecutive electroporation, embryos were cultured in a humidified incubator at 38°C to resume their development. 3 hr after electroporation, the embryos were screened based on fluorescence to ensure that both constructs were expressed and that the correct region was targeted for each construct. At this stage, up to 70% of the embryos are successfully electroporated. The embryos were then reincubated at 38°C until they reach the 15-somite stage (∼20 hr).

Since expression of the constructs is driven by the ubiquitous CAGGS promoter, even a slight inaccuracy in positioning the electrode would result in expression in the neural tube or the lateral plate.</p><p>A fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica M205 FA) equipped with a color camera was used to track anterior boundaries of both control Cherry-expressing cells and mutant Venus-expressing cells. At this stage, up to 60% of the electroporated embryos are exclusively electroporated in the PSM and retained for further analyses (∼10% are discarded because of developmental defects due to the consecutive electroporation procedure). We used the ‘Measure’ plugin of ImageJ to measure the distance between the tail-bud and anterior boundary of both Venus and Cherry-expressing domains in the same embryos.

For tubulin labeling, we used the mouse anti-acetylated alpha-tubulin (sigma T6793) at 1/1000. The secondary antibody was an anti-mouse IgG2b Alexafluor546 (Invitrogen), used at 1/1000. Slides were mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and analyzed with a LSM 510 NLO inverted confocal microscope (Carl ZEISS, Germany) using a plan apochromat 63× (NA 1.4) immersion (oil) objective (Carl Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Hoxa13 protein quantification</title><p>A pBIC control vector (described above) or the pBIC vector containing the full-length <italic>Hoxa13</italic> with a C-terminal HA tag along with a vector containing EGFP under the CAGGS promoter and a vector expressing the rtTA (Clontech, France) were electroporated in the PM progenitors at stage 5 HH. A drop of 50 μl of different doses of doxycyclin (from 50 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml) was applied on top of the embryos immediately after electroporation and the embryos were reincubated for 20 hr. Three embryos for each condition were individually lysed following standard procedure and each lysate was loaded on a different well of an SDS-page gel. Western blot analysis was done following standard procedure. An anti-HA-HRP antibody was used to detect Hoxa13 (Roche #12013819001, dilution 1/1000, Germany). An anti-GFP antibody (abcam ab6556, dilution 1/2000) was used to detect GFP from the pCAGGS-EGFP used as an electroporation control. An anti-β actin antibody (Sigma A5441, dilution 1/5000, Germany) was used to verify that the same amount of tissue was loaded in each well. This experiment has been repeated twice independently.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell proliferation analysis</title><p>A 20 μl drop of 100 µM EdU (Click-iT EdU kit, Cat. #C10083 Invitrogen) was applied on the posterior region of 20–22- and 25–27-somite stage embryos cultured in vitro for 45 min.

Embryos were reincubated for 14 hr in a humidified incubator at 38°C until they reach the 9-somite stage. The region containing the PM progenitors was dissected from several embryos and pooled in a drop of PBS/FCS1% (seven embryos per condition) on ice. Dissected tissues were then transferred in a drop of diluted trypsin and incubated at 38°C for 10 min to allow efficient enzymatic dissociation of cells. Cell dissociation was completed mechanically by pipetting up and down. Cells were then transferred into 500 μl of PBS/FCS 1% on ice and sorted based on YFP fluorescence using a FACS DIVA (BD technologies, France). For each condition, one thousand YFP+ cells were collected directly in Trizol (Invitrogen) and immediately frozen at −80°C. This experiment was repeated twice independently.</p><p>Extraction of total RNA was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Trizol, Invitrogen). Biotinylated cRNA targets were prepared from total RNA using a double amplification protocol according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual: two-Cycle Target Labeling Assay (P/N 701021 Rev.5, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA). Following fragmentation, cRNAs were hybridized for 16 hr at 45°C on GeneChip Chicken Genome arrays. Each microarray (one microarray per condition = two control microarrays and 2 <italic>Hoxa13</italic> microarrays) was then washed and stained on a GeneChip fluidics station 450 and scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Finally, raw data (.CEL Intensity files) were extracted from the scanned images using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) version 3.1. CEL files were further processed with MAS5 and RMA algorithms using the Bioconductor package (version 2.8) available through R (version 2.12.1). Probe sets were filtered based on their expression intensity value (MAS5 value). Probe sets with an intensity value under 100 were discarded.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the three reviewers discussed the comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> to only ask for revisions that can be accomplished in a reasonable time. Given the extensive revisions that would be required to satisfy the reviewers' concerns, we cannot accept your paper for publication at this time. However, we would be open to considering a new submission at a later time that addresses the reviewers’ comments after completion of further experiments and addition of extensive revisions to the text.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Denans, Iimura and Pourquie presents evidence for a role of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in mesoderm ingression and body elongation in vertebrates. They test the interesting hypothesis that some posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes repress Wnt and FGF signaling and so decrease expression of mesodermal gene T, which then leads to reduced ingression of cells through the primitive streak. This eventually leads to termination of the body elongation process by lack of available mesoderm. In this view, 'posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes' regulate the extension of the body plan by indirectly controlling the amount of available mesoderm cells in the tail end of the embryo (via the regulation of cell ingression from the epiblast).</p><p>This is an interesting piece of work, which adds important arguments supporting the function of <italic>Hox</italic> genes during the elongation of the vertebrate body axis. However, the reviewers raised major concerns regarding technical approaches, the lack molecular explanation for the described phenomena, and appropriate reconciliation of the authors’ conclusions with previously published work. Additional control experiments and further discussion of the literature as suggested below are required to substantiate if the proposed mechanism indeed holds true.</p><p>1) One concern is the quantification of all the various phenomenon described in this work. There are several parameters, which can easily escape control in this context (mRNA stability, protein presence, electroporation success, copy number, saturation etc.). This criticism is not particular to this work and a similar question could be asked regarding the results by others in mice in mice, where the strong effect was not explicitly related to a 'physiological' gain of function (even though it may indeed be the case). Vertebral formula is very stable within the same species and thus must rely upon a robust mechanism. How the robustness of this process relates to the quantities of factors is a key issue (are these factors saturating?) At the time of the start of decreasing Wnt signaling due to increasing Hox amounts, a rather smooth gradient of T must be established. At these time points, genetic conditions in mice would be expected to have an effect perhaps stronger than what was reported by Capecchi for the <italic>Hoxb13</italic> mutants? And if several <italic>Hox</italic> genes contribute to this phenomenon, then how to prevent intra-species variations, in particular at the time-points when the system would no longer be saturated?</p><p>2) From this model, one can make rather strong predictions, such as e.g. that the addition of yet another Hox cluster with posterior genes should make the body shorter? Is this the case in the literature?</p><p>3) There are important differences in effects between the <italic>Hoxa13</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> genes. In many developmental contexts, these two genes have very redundant functions and therefore, the difference reported here would suggest that Hoxa13 achieves its function in the tailbud by affecting a pathway or by using a peptide sequence that is not associated or existing in <italic>Hoxd13</italic>? This is particularly unexpected, as <italic><underline>Hoxd13</underline></italic> (at least in mammals) seems to be expressed in the late tail bud more strongly than <italic>Hoxa13</italic>. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) A major claim of the authors is that there is delayed ingression, but this is not convincing. They report delayed expression of the Hox-Ires-Venus cassettes following electroporation into the chick epiblast as measured by Venus protein fluorescence. The authors interpret this effect such that <italic>Hox</italic> gene over-expression can delay ingression of the cells receiving the construct. However, the Hox constructs are driven by the ubiquitous Caggs promoter. Why is expression of the Hox constructs not observed at the same time as that of the control construct? A simple explanation might be that the RNA derived from these constructs is post-transcriptionally controlled, either by immediate degradation or by translational repression. This might assure position-adequate activity of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes. RNA in situ hybridization experiments testing for the time and position of transcription of the constructs are missing. However, they are required at least for some of the constructs. In addition, co-transfection of the control reporter construct with the Hox expression constructs should reveal if indeed ingression is delayed by Hox over-expression. Furthermore, RNAi of critical <italic>Hox</italic> genes (e.g. <italic>Hoxa13</italic>) would be a means of testing if the proposed effect of <italic>Hox</italic> genes can be opposed.</p><p>5) Critical missing data are the level of Brachyury expression along the body axis. If the authors are right that increasing <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression has a repressive effect on Brachyury expression resulting in decreasing mesoderm formation and motility along the body axis, this should be reflected by decreasing Brachyury transcription in the wild-type embryo as it elongates. Is this the case? Of course this would mean measuring expression levels per mesoderm cell (e.g. FPKM or qPCR values determined on FAC sorted cells) at different embryonic stages but at the same axial position (e.g. close to the node), not just overall expression in the embryo. The authors have all the tools at hand for doing the test.</p><p>6) It is not clear if the data from chick can be extrapolated to vertebrates in general. If the proposed mechanism were generally true, vertebrates with tails should not exist. All <italic>Hox</italic> genes are already activated during trunk development and the tail does not gain extra Hox activity grinding Brachyury expression eventually down to a standstill. Thus in tailed animals a different mechanism is more likely. The authors therefore should present their conclusions with respect to the chick and possibly other vertebrates with tiny tails (humans, some monkeys?).</p><p>7) The accuracy of the experimental approaches is difficult to assess, in particular, the accurate and reproducible targeting of the epiblast layer of the primitive streak by electroporation is not documented. It seems likely that there is some variability between embryos and that in some cases cells that are already ingressing are targeted. Furthermore, it seems possible that control cells are sometimes affected by Hox mis-expressing cells in the primitive streak, making this assay difficult to interpret with confidence, particularly when only a handful of embryos are analyzed for each gene. A data set demonstrating localized epiblast targeting reproducibility would strengthen the claims of the authors that they are assessing regulation of the ability of mis-expressing cells to ingress. It is also concerning that the arrow indicating the most rostral red fluorescent label in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is mis-placed caudally.</p><p>8) The time difference between “successive” electroporations should be clarified; if the first construct labels cells earlier then these will progress to a more rostral position than cells electroporated slightly later, which could result in a misleading conclusion that the second construct used delays ingression. It seems the control construct is always electroporated first; can the authors invert the order in which the constructs that induce a delay are electroporated and obtain the same result?</p><p>9) There is no explanation at a molecular level for differences in the ability of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes to delay ingression nor for the effect of posterior dominance within the subset of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes that appear to affect ingression. How does collinear onset of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes lead to progressive loss of Wnt/FGF and T if this does not involve protein accumulation? Identifying these molecular mechanisms is needed to take the paper beyond the discovery of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>10) We are left at the end of the paper without a molecular explanation for how <italic>Hox</italic> genes influence the ingression of cells. It is surprising that a gene that leads to reduced Wnt and FGF signaling in primitive streak epiblast does not affect cell adhesion and E-cadherin expression (data for which is not shown) nor the balance of <italic>Sox2/T</italic> expression in this cell population which would lead to cells adopting a neural over a mesodermal fate. Previous work has shown that FGF signaling is upstream of E-cadherin downregulation, prompts EMT and formation of T expressing mesoderm at the mouse primitive streak (Ciruna and Rossant, 2001, Dev. Cell), while more recent work has demonstrated that high Wnt signaling promotes mesoderm differentiation from neuro-mesodermal (<italic>Sox2/T</italic> co-expressing) progenitors and that reduced Wnt signaling in this context leads to neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsakiridis et al, 2014</xref>, Dev; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gouti et al, 2014</xref>, PLOS Biology). Other work, in chick, analyzing the expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and T transcription throughout body axis elongation shows that strong T persists in the tailbud long after the 25 somite stage, declining only just prior to cessation of elongation at ∼ 44 somite after which T begins to decline and <italic>Sox2</italic> is up regulated in tailbud cells, in a step that involves decreased FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref>, PLOS Biology).</p><p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>, BMC Dev. Biol. show that elongation cessation takes place when the presomitic mesoderm is still present at HH24 (rather than having been used up by somites forming right to the tail tip), suggesting that the body axis does not end due to a lack of ingressed cells. This observation contradicts the main conclusion of this current paper that it is a lack of ingressed presomitic cells that underlies elongation arrest.</p><p>11) The authors present only <italic>Sox2</italic> in situ data (Figure 2–figure supplement 2) in whole mount embryos to support their claim that there is not a cell fate change when <italic>Hoxa13</italic> is mis-expressed. Sections of such embryos in which the <italic>Hoxa13</italic> GFP construct is visible with the <italic>Sox2</italic> in situ signal on a cell by cell basis is required for convincing evidence on this point. A further possibility is that <italic>Hoxa13</italic> expressing cells simply down regulate T but remain <italic>Sox2</italic> positive and so adopt a neural fate and therefore do not ingress. Again comparing control and <italic>Hoxa13</italic> GFP positive cells for levels of T and <italic>Sox2</italic> on a cell-by-cell basis may provide evidence for the decline in T and maintenance <italic>Sox2</italic>.</p><p>12) It is not clear why the authors provide in situ images for <italic>T</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> at HH14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) using an intronic probe; other genes are not assessed in this way and no comment or explanation is provided in the text or figure legend. It is not clear how this data compares with published work showing strong and extensive T transcripts until the end of axis elongation. The authors need to address this difference with previous work, explain the significance of loss of active T transcription and consider how T transcripts continue to be regulated by FGF in the tailbud at these late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref>) if the gene is not actively transcribed. One logic may be that the effects of endogenous posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are very small and slow acting, however, the authors appear to argue that there is a step change as the tailbud forms and the image presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> implies that T transcripts are lost in the tailbud at this time.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “<italic>Hox</italic> genes control vertebrate body elongation by collinear Wnt repression” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and the original three reviewers. The manuscript has been greatly improved and is acceptable pending changes that can easily be accomplished by revisions in writing of the manuscript without requiring further experiments. However, the reviewers feel that being more cautious in interpretation is important so we ask you to carefully attend to these remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Overall, this paper presents a striking phenomenon in the regulation of cell ingression through the primitive streak by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes and some very interesting data that explain to some extent the molecular mechanisms at play here. The authors still need to place the work in an appropriate context both in terms of the literature and the significance of this mechanism during body axis elongation; it may be that collinear activation of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes regulates tailbud morphogenesis half way through axis elongation, but does not directly regulate PSM length.</p><p>1) The role of RhoA is not sufficiently well investigated and documented for giving it a prominent role in the Abstract. If the authors find this point so important they should provide some more experimental support. Alternatively they may want to rewrite the Abstract.</p><p>2) Last line of the Abstract (end of the Introduction and elsewhere,): “this mechanism leads to progressive reduction of PSM size associated to the arrest of somitogenesis” does not follow logically. What does this mean if it is clear that, at least in the chick, body axis elongation ceases when the PSM is still present and there is room for more somites to be generated? How is ingression then associated with arrest of somitogenesis? Somitogenesis arrest is more likely linked to loss of Notch pathway oscillations in the remaining PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>).</p><p>3) In the Introduction the authors should mention the evidence that explanted chick tailbuds (i.e. without somites) are a demonstrated source of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>). This is an important finding, which bears on their hypothesis that shortening of the PSM is a major step in that brings retinoic acid to tailbud and so curtails body axis elongation. It may be that both mechanisms operate and I think this should be made clear upfront, rather than appearing later in the Discussion.</p><p>4) In the Introduction and elsewhere it is confusing to state that “<italic>Hoxb</italic> genes are only expressed in anterior regions of the embryo precluding their playing a role in the control of axis extension”, when <italic>Hoxb13</italic> is known to regulate axis elongation. They need to be more precise, <italic>Hoxb1-9</italic>.</p><p>5) It would be informative to explain in the paper that the 25 somite stage is ∼when the tailbud forms and that this is when when cell ingression through the primitive streak ceases—refer to work from Susan Mackem's lab in chick showing cessation at HH stage16 (∼ 24-28 somites, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knezevic et al, 1998</xref> and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catala et al, 1995</xref>, and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington, 1996</xref>, in the mouse). It seems likely that the mechanism identified by the authors is most functionally significant at this mid-way stage; from then on the PSM is added to from an “internalized” set of precursor cells. McGrew et al, 2009, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref> identify these cell populations by lineage analysis in the chick tail bud as the NMps (Sox/bra expressing cells) and also a transit amplifying cell population of mesodermal progenitors. I think the authors should explain this in the Discussion (and in the Introduction). As the paper currently reads it might be thought that ingression through the primitive streak continues until the end of axis elongation, when in fact in both chick and mouse embryos this ceases at somite 30 of ∼50-53 (chick, HH16) and 33 of 65 (mouse, E10.5). The cessation of ingression thus fits more closely with the establishment of the tailbud about half way through body axis elongation. As <italic>Hoxb</italic> and <italic>d13</italic> begin to be expressed just after tailbud formation, they may contribute to conclusion of the ingression process, but this early role also leaves room for other actions for such <italic>Hox</italic> genes, including the regulation of cell proliferation in the tailbud mesoderm, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Economides et al, 2003</xref>. I think these considerations are important to clarify that the regulation of ingression that they uncover is distinct from the model they originally proposed in which this was directly linked to “exhaustion” of PSM precursors and elongation arrest.</p><p>6) Related to this the authors suggest in the Discussion that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes might act in place of retinoic acid as a mechanism for arresting axis elongation in mouse. However, as ingression has ceased and continued extension is due to the activity of internalized precursors it is difficult to see Hox regulation of cell ingression as a molecular explanation for axis arrest.</p><p>7) The new data localize the region of <italic>Hox</italic> genes involved, but shows that this does not contain a conserved sequence that correlates with repressive activity. We are left with further speculation that this must be due to local protein structure. Similarly, the authors may have identified a further part of the molecular mechanism that regulates cell ingression, by rescuing <italic>Hox</italic> gene induced delay by co-expression with the DN-RhoA construct. However, this simply shows that de-stabilizing microtubules can force ingression and there is no molecular link made here from Brachyury to regulation of RhoA activity. The authors have therefore made a little progress on uncovering molecular explanations for the phenomena observed when posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are mis-expressed.</p><p>8) Finally, the authors have attempted to determine whether <italic>Sox2</italic> expression is present in epiblast cells that are delayed in their ingression through the primitive streak. Unfortunately, they have been unable to improve the in situ hybridization for <italic>Sox2</italic> transcripts (even the control embryo does not reveal the normal caudal domain of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression, which extends into the tailbud (e.g. see Uchikawa et al, 2011, Dev. Growth &amp; Diff; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref>). The authors have also been unable to detect <italic>Sox2</italic> protein using immunocytochemistry, and it is not clear whether this reflects a problem with antibody batches or another technical difficulty. The net result is that they do not provide any new data to address the possibility that cells fail to ingress because having reduced Wnt signaling and <italic>T</italic> expression they have lost mesodermal identity in favor of a neural fate. Given that they are unable to reproduce the <italic>Sox2</italic> expression pattern published by many other groups, they should be cautious in the interpretation of their lower power in situ data, which leaves open the possibility that accumulating non-ingressing primitive streak epiblast cells continue to express <italic>Sox2</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: a further round of revisions was requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “<italic>Hox</italic> genes control vertebrate body elongation by collinear Wnt repression” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two of the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some relatively minor but still important issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors have responded with some discussion of the literature on when ingression ceases, but this is not convincing. It is certainly debatable whether movement of cells from the late chordo-neural-hinge (CNH) to the PSM is considered an ingression; the CNH is the already internalized structure derived from the primitive streak. They should clarify their interpretation.</p><p>2) The response to comment 8 is confused; expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in epiblast cells that fail to ingress does not automatically lead to their contribution to the neural tube. Given the poor quality data (low magnification wholemount in situs which do not recapitulate published caudal expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> even in the controls), they should be cautious with the interpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04379.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) One concern is the quantification of all the various phenomenon described in this work. There are several parameters, which can easily escape control in this context (mRNA stability, protein presence, electroporation success, copy number, saturation etc.). This criticism is not particular to this work and a similar question could be asked regarding the results by others in mice in mice, where the strong effect was not explicitly related to a 'physiological' gain of function (even though it may indeed be the case)</italic>. <italic>Vertebral formula is very stable within the same species and thus must rely upon a robust mechanism. How the robustness of this process relates to the quantities of factors is a key issue (are these factors saturating?)</italic></p><p>We agree that the robustness of the data generated by our electroporation protocol is striking. However, even though the technique does not allow us to precisely control the number of plasmid copies per cell or the number of cells electroporated, we have well established its reliability in the lab over the past 15 years. Successful electroporations like microsurgical experiments require a thorough training, and Nicolas Denans has been practicing these experiments on a regular basis for the past 6 years.</p><p>The quantitative analysis of the different phenotypes shown in the paper clearly demonstrates that these experiments give highly consistent results with most embryos overexpressing a given construct showing a similar phenotype which is specific for the construct (see graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, 6C, 9B). Regarding mRNA stability, we overexpress only the coding sequences (without UTRs) and use the same SV40 polyA signal for all of our constructs. Also in most cases, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are expressed from an IRES-YFP vector and thus Hox expression can be indirectly monitored by examining YFP fluorescence. All <italic>Hox</italic> genes are expressed from the CAGGS promoter which is a strong promoter and which is expected to generate expression levels higher than the endogenous ones. Moreover, we clearly show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-H</xref> that the quantity of Hox protein overexpressed does not affect the phenotype observed. So our conditions are saturating, abolishing any effect of gene dosage of the overexpressed <italic>Hox</italic> genes and leaving the differences only due to the nature of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes overexpressed. These observations are consistent with the analysis of paralog knock-out experiments from Deneen Wellik (Wellik et al, Science, 2003; McIntyre et al; Development, 2007)) showing that leaving only one single wild type allele leads to a much milder phenotype than the deletion of an entire paralog group. These experiments also confirm previous results published in Iimura and Pourquie (Nature, 2006) showing that <italic>Hoxb</italic> genes expression driven by promoters of different strength (CMV, TK and CAGGS) leads to similar ingression phenotypes. Our data suggest that the quantitative effects on ingression result from the progressive expression of more posterior genes. The fact that 8 of the 16 posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes from all posterior paralogs groups except <italic>Hox12</italic> show an effect in the ingression, elongation and Wnt signaling assays argue for an extreme redundancy of the system that could explain the intraspecific robustness of the vertebral formula. We now discuss these ideas in more detail in the revised version of the text.</p><p><italic>At the time of the start of decreasing Wnt signaling due to increasing Hox amounts, a rather smooth gradient of T must be established</italic>.</p><p>We have now analyzed by qPCR the expression of the Wnt targets T/Brachyury, <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the tail bud from the 10 to 25-somite stage (Figure8 C-E). These new data show that repression of Wnt targets parallels activation of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes in vivo starting with a smooth gradient until the 20-somite stage. A significant drop in expression is then observed at the 25-somite stage, which corresponds to the time at which axis elongation drops abruptly when <italic>Hox13</italic> genes are first expressed. This data has been added to the text and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-E</xref>.</p><p><italic>At these time points, genetic conditions in mice would be expected to have an effect perhaps stronger than what was reported by Capecchi for the</italic> Hoxb13 <italic>mutants?</italic></p><p>In null mutant mice embryos for <italic>Wnt3a</italic> or <italic>T</italic>, the first 7 to 9 somites form normally (Takada et al, 1994, Genes and Dev; Wilson et al, Development, 1993), and the body axis is truncated posterior to this level. This phenotype is much stronger than that reported for <italic>Hoxb13</italic> in which only the tail part of the axis is affected. In the experiments performed by Deschamps and Mallo where they overexpress <italic>Hox13</italic> paralog genes in the paraxial mesoderm along the entire AP axis, these genetic conditions result in axis truncations, occurring posterior to the thoracic level (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). Strikingly no effect in the anterior regions is seen in these transgenic animals. The phenotype of these animals resembles hypomorphic <italic>Wnt3A</italic> or <italic>T</italic> mutants suggesting that the Wnt repression by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes is not an on-off mechanism but rather a quantitative effect. This notion is further supported by the different truncation levels reported for <italic>Hoxa13</italic>, <italic>Hoxb13,</italic> and <italic>Hoxc13</italic> expressed from the same promoter in mouse (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). These experiments are consistent with the notion that Wnt and T play an important role in the control of axis elongation from the cervical to the caudal level and that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes quantitatively modulate Wnt activation in the paraxial mesoderm precursors of these regions. We now discuss these points in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>And if several</italic> Hox <italic>genes contribute to this phenomenon, then how to prevent intra-species variations, in particular at the time-points when the system would no longer be saturated?</italic></p><p>Our experiments reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and in show that concentrations of Hox proteins exhibit a similar effect over a large dilution range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting that low levels of Hox proteins are saturating. This property is expected to confer significant robustness to the system in line with the limited intra-species variations observed.</p><p><italic>2) From this model, one can make rather strong predictions</italic>, <italic>such as e.g. that the addition of yet another Hox cluster with posterior genes should make the body shorter? Is this the case in the literature?</italic></p><p>It is true that zebrafish which has extra Hox clusters exhibits a shorter axis when compared to mouse or chicken while snakes which contain less posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes expressed in the tailbud region (Di-Poi N. et al, Nature, 2010) make a much longer axis. However, whether this can be generalized will require further studies. The Duboule lab has generated transgenic mice with a human HoxD cluster or an extra mouse HoxD cluster (Spitz et al, Genes and Dev, 2001). Since the effect of Hox proteins is saturating, duplicating an existing cluster is expected to act on expression levels (rather than timing) of the Hox proteins and thus is not expected to interfere with axis elongation. Accordingly, they did not observe any change in the vertebral counts in these transgenic animals. They also have performed many duplications and deletions within the HoxD cluster and shown that these manipulations can lead to heterochronic expression of <italic>HoxD</italic> genes in the tail bud. However, they do not report any significant variations in vertebral numbers in these cases either (Tarchini et al, Dev Cell, 2006; Tschopp et al, PLOS Genet, 2009, Denis Duboule, personal communication). Importantly, all these genetic manipulations have been performed on the HoxD cluster and in our hands, neither <italic>Hoxd12</italic> nor <italic>Hoxd13</italic> have an effect on elongation/Wnt, and the effect of <italic>Hoxd10</italic> and <italic>Hoxd11</italic> is weaker than that of other <italic>Hox</italic> genes thus providing a possible explanation for the lack of significant effect of this heterochronic expression of posterior <italic>HoxD</italic> genes. In contrast, heterochronic expression of other posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes such as <italic>Hoxa13</italic>, <italic>Hoxb13</italic> or <italic>Hoxc13</italic> (but not <italic>Hoxd13</italic>) genes in the tail bud precursors as described in Young et al (Dev Cell, 2010; and Jacqueline Deschamps, personal communication) was shown to make the body shorter consistent with our hypothesis. We now present our results in the light of these papers in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) There are important differences in effects between the</italic> Hoxa13 <italic>and</italic> Hoxd13 <italic>genes. In many developmental contexts, these two genes have very redundant functions and therefore, the difference reported here would suggest that Hoxa13 achieves its function in the tailbud by affecting a pathway or by using a peptide sequence that is not associated or existing in</italic> Hoxd13<italic>? This is particularly unexpected, as</italic> Hoxd13 <italic>(at least in mammals) seems to be expressed in the late tail bud more strongly than</italic> Hoxa13<italic>. This should be discussed.</italic></p><p>In mouse, <italic>a13</italic> is the only <italic>Hox13</italic> required for embryonic survival because its mutation blocks allantois growth is required for formation of the placenta (Shaut et al, PLOS Genet, 2008). Also whereas transgenic mice overexpressing <italic>Hoxa13</italic> from the cdx2 promoter exhibit axis truncation (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009), overexpressing <italic>Hoxd13</italic> from the same promoter has no effect (Jacqueline Deschamps, personal communication). We now show that the effect of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes on T repression is controlled by the N-terminal domain of posterior Hox proteins (see text and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). While we have not mapped precisely the sequences responsible for the effects described in this paper, there are very significant differences in the N-terminal regions of <italic>Hoxa13</italic> and <italic>Hoxd13</italic> that could explain why in the control of ingression, of elongation and of Wnt signaling, these 2 proteins show different phenotypes (see alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04379-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) A major claim of the authors is that there is delayed ingression, but this is not convincing. They report delayed expression of the Hox-Ires-Venus cassettes following electroporation into the chick epiblast as measured by Venus protein fluorescence. The authors interpret this effect such that Hox gene over-expression can delay ingression of the cells receiving the construct. However, the Hox constructs are driven by the ubiquitous Caggs promoter. Why is expression of the Hox constructs not observed at the same time as that of the control construct? A simple explanation might be that the RNA derived from these constructs is post-transcriptionally controlled, either by immediate degradation or by translational repression. This might assure position-adequate activity of the</italic> Hox <italic>genes. RNA</italic> in situ <italic>hybridization experiments testing for the time and position of transcription of the constructs are missing. However, they are required at least for some of the constructs. In addition, co-transfection of the control reporter construct with the Hox expression constructs should reveal if indeed ingression is delayed by Hox over-expression. Furthermore, RNAi of critical</italic> Hox <italic>genes (e.g.</italic> Hoxa13<italic>) would be a means of testing if the proposed effect of</italic> Hox <italic>genes can be opposed.</italic></p><p>We apologize if the description of our experiments was not clear enough leading the reviewer to think that there is a delayed expression of the Hox-Ires-Venus cassettes following electroporation into the chick epiblast as measured by Venus protein fluorescence. We do not claim that expression is delayed but that ingression is delayed. The two constructs (Hox-green and control-red) are electroporated one after the other (see detailed description for consecutive electroporations below) and then we routinely examine electroporated embryos 3 hours after electroporation to make sure that both control and Hox constructs are expressed at the same time in the precursors of the paraxial mesoderm in the anterior streak region. Then whereas control cells expressing Cherry start to ingress in the posterior PSM, cells expressing the Hox-IRES-GFP constructs remain in the epiblast of the anterior streak region ingressing only later. Only a subset of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes shows a phenotype in these experiments. This experimental paradigm was originally introduced in , see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K-O</xref>, using grafts of epiblast expressing different <italic>Hox</italic> genes. These experiments results in a gap separating the position of the anterior boundary of red control cells from the position of the anterior boundary of green Hox-expressing cells reflecting the fact that cells ingressing later become located more posteriorly. This gap is proportional to the ingression delay experienced by Hox-expressing cells. To quantitatively estimate the variation in the ingression delay, we measure the ratio between the red and the green domains in the paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). We have tried to improve the description of these experiments in the main text and in Material and methods and provide a more detailed illustrative scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Concerning RNAi, we have attempted to block the function of several posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes such as Hoxa13 by electroporating RNAi and in no case could we observe a phenotype. This is not unexpected, given that RNAi only achieve partial inhibition and that Hox proteins appear to be saturating even at low levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This led us to turn to the dominant-negative approach described in the paper.</p><p><italic>5) Critical missing data are the level of Brachyury expression along the body axis. If the authors are right that increasing</italic> Hox <italic>gene expression has a repressive effect on Brachyury expression resulting in decreasing mesoderm formation and motility along the body axis, this should be reflected by decreasing Brachyury transcription in the wild-type embryo as it elongates. Is this the case? Of course this would mean measuring expression levels per mesoderm cell (e.g. FPKM or qPCR values determined on FAC sorted cells) at different embryonic stages but at the same axial position (e.g. close to the node), not just overall expression in the embryo. The authors have all the tools at hand for doing the test.</italic></p><p>We agree with the referee and now provide this data. We have performed Quantitative-PCR on microdissected tailbuds from 10 somite stage (ss), 15ss, 20ss, 25ss for <italic>T</italic>, <italic>Axin2</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> that clearly show a down-regulation of the expression of these 3 genes between the 10-25ss stage. This decrease parallels the slowing-down of axis elongation observed during those stages. We now include these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8C-E</xref> and discuss them in the main text.</p><p><italic>6) It is not clear if the data from chick can be extrapolated to vertebrates in general. If the proposed mechanism were generally true, vertebrates with tails should not exist. All</italic> Hox <italic>genes are already activated during trunk development and the tail does not gain extra Hox activity grinding Brachyury expression eventually down to a standstill. Thus in tailed animals a different mechanism is more likely. The authors therefore should present their conclusions with respect to the chick and possibly other vertebrates with tiny tails (humans, some monkeys?).</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting point and an additional mechanism distinct from the one reported here is possibly involved in tail growth. In chicken which lack a tail, retinoic acid (RA) was shown to play an important role in the termination of axis elongation and somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>; Olivera-Martinez et al, 2011). This increase in RA level is accompanied by Raldh2 reexpression in the tail bud and it triggers differentiation and death of the paraxial mesoderm precursors. Remarkably, no such increase in RA levels is observed in mouse embryos. Furthermore, a normal tail can form even in the absence of RA in the <italic>raldh2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it could be that in mouse, termination of the axis and hence tail formation, does not result from an active RA-dependent process but simply from exhaustion of paraxial mesoderm due to the shrinking of the PSM resulting from posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes effect on elongation. Whether this RA-dependent mode of axis termination can be more broadly generalized to species lacking a tail remains to be explored. What causes this difference is currently unknown but it could be that in chicken, specific genetic alterations of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes can trigger the late expression of radlh2 in the tail bud thus leading to premature termination of axis elongation. We now present these hypotheses in the Discussion of the revised version.</p><p><italic>7) The accuracy of the experimental approaches is difficult to assess, in particular, the accurate and reproducible targeting of the epiblast layer of the primitive streak by electroporation is not documented. It seems likely that there is some variability between embryos and that in some cases cells that are already ingressing are targeted. Furthermore, it seems possible that control cells are sometimes affected by Hox mis-expressing cells in the primitive streak, making this assay difficult to interpret with confidence, particularly when only a handful of embryos are analyzed for each gene. A data set demonstrating localized epiblast targeting reproducibility would strengthen the claims of the authors that they are assessing regulation of the ability of mis-expressing cells to ingress. It is also concerning that the arrow indicating the most rostral red fluorescent label in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>is mis-placed caudally</italic>.</p><p>We understand that this assay appears difficult and challenging and like microsurgical experiments, these electroporations require a significant training to position the electrode at the desired location appropriately. My lab has developed a significant expertise in the electroporation of paraxial mesoderm precursors which we pioneered (Dubrulle et al, Cell, 2001) and we have already published several papers based on this technique (Iimura an Pourquie, Nature, 2006; Iimura et al, PNAS, 2007; Benazeraf et al, Nature, 2010). Nicolas Denans has performed these electroporations on a regular basis for the last 6 years now and he can obtain very reproducible results as shown on the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, 6C, 9B. The electroporation success is first monitored 3 hours after by examining the embryos under a fluorescent stereomicroscope. Only embryos successfully electroporated in the PSM progenitors at the exact same antero-posterior level and the same medio-lateral level relative to the midline of the primitive streak are reincubated for about 20 more hours. About 10 to 20% of the embryos fail to develop because of the 2 consecutive injections/electroporations. The embryos that develop successfully are then examined for GFP expression and routinely more than 90% show restricted YFP expression in the paraxial mesoderm. Such a high level of success rate is obtained only after a long period of training. As can be seen on the embryos shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> or in the movies, virtually no cells are seen outside of the paraxial mesoderm meaning that the electroporation accurately targeted the anterior streak epiblast. Since expression of the constructs is driven by the ubiquitous CAGGS promoter, even a slight inaccuracy in positioning the electrode would result in expression in the neural tube or the lateral plate. To better illustrate the accuracy of the electroporation performed, we now present a movie showing expression of a control construct electroporated in the anterior epiblast and showing the ingressing PSM cells (Video 3).</p><p>Our experiments have been carefully quantified as shown on the DotPlot graphs. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>, when we overexpress a cherry control followed by a venus control, cells always end up at the same AP position (with very minimal variations) which shows that this assay is particularly robust. We electroporate one side of the PS with one construct and the other side of the PS with the other construct which largely prevents one cell to receive both plasmids. We agree that in some rare cases we could electroporate some ingressing cells. These rare cells are escapers and are found located much more anteriorly than the electroporated epiblast cells. We discard those rare cells in our quantifications and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is a good example of it. We have now introduced a more thorough discussion of these technical aspects in the text and in the Material and methods section.</p><p><italic>8) The time difference between</italic> “<italic>successive</italic>” <italic>electroporations should be clarified; if the first construct labels cells earlier then these will progress to a more rostral position than cells electroporated slightly later, which could result in a misleading conclusion that the second construct used delays ingression. It seems the control construct is always electroporated first</italic>; <italic>can the authors invert the order in which the constructs that induce a delay are electroporated and obtain the same result?</italic></p><p>We now better describe our successive electroporation procedure (which we renamed consecutive electroporation for clarity) in the Methods section. We first harvest and culture the embryos on filter paper on an agar plate at room temperature (EC culture) which “pauses” the development of the embryos. We then process to two consecutive electroporations. We microinject the first construct and immediately electroporate it and right after the first electroporation we proceed the same way for the second construct. The time delay between the 2 electroporations is about 10 seconds. Moreover as the experiments are carried out at room temperature, the embryo is paused and cells do not ingress until the embryo is reincubated at 37 C. The fact that when we overexpress 2 control constructs we find the cells at the same anterior position clearly shows that the sequence of electroporation does not affect the timing of ingression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig7">Figure 3B, 7K</xref>). In all cases we always invert the order of electroporations in the same batch of embryos (but not the side of electroporation for consistency) and do not observe any bias in the timing of ingression). We now provide a better description of the consecutive electroporation protocol in the text and Material and methods.</p><p><italic>9) There is no explanation at a molecular level for differences in the ability of posterior</italic> Hox <italic>genes to delay ingression nor for the effect of posterior dominance within the subset of posterior</italic> Hox <italic>genes that appear to affect ingression. How does collinear onset of posterior</italic> Hox <italic>genes lead to progressive loss of Wnt/FGF and T if this does not involve protein accumulation? Identifying these molecular mechanisms is needed to take the paper beyond the discovery of an interesting phenomenon.</italic></p><p>We agree that it is indeed a very interesting question. We designed chimeras of Hox proteins to determine which domain contains the region responsible for the repressive effect of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes on Brachyury using the cTprLuc assay as readout. These experiments show that the N-ter region of <italic>Hoxa13</italic> contain the repressive domain (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> in the revised version of the manuscript). Sequence alignment of the N-ter region of <italic>Hoxa9</italic>, <italic>d10</italic>, <italic>c11</italic> and <italic>a13</italic> shows limited conservation at the amino acid level suggesting that it is not a conserved amino acids domain but rather a structural domain that is responsible for the repression activity of these proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10–figure supplement1</xref>). The situation we describe is reminiscent of the recently described structural colinearity observed at the Hox protein level by Richard Mann’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slattery et al, 2011</xref>). A more thorough structure function analysis of the protein sequences for all these genes must be conducted but we feel like it falls beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p><italic>10) We are left at the end of the paper without a molecular explanation for how</italic> Hox <italic>genes influence the ingression of cells. It is surprising that a gene that leads to reduced Wnt and FGF signaling in primitive streak epiblast does not affect cell adhesion and E-cadherin expression (data for which is not shown) nor the balance of</italic> Sox2/T <italic>expression in this cell population which would lead to cells adopting a neural over a mesodermal fate. Previous work has shown that FGF signaling is upstream of E-cadherin downregulation, prompts EMT and formation of T expressing mesoderm at the mouse primitive streak (Ciruna and Rossant, 2001, Dev. Cell), while more recent work has demonstrated that high Wnt signaling promotes mesoderm differentiation from neuro-mesodermal (</italic>Sox2/T <italic>co-expressing) progenitors and that reduced Wnt signaling in this context leads to neural differentiation (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67"><italic>Tsakiridis et al, 2014</italic></xref><italic>, Dev;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27"><italic>Gouti et al, 2014</italic></xref><italic>, PLOS Biology).</italic></p><p>Ciruna and Rossant nicely showed that FGF positively regulates <italic>T</italic> and thus <italic>FGFR1</italic> mutation leads to T down-regulation consequently preventing ingression, which correlates perfectly with our observations. Our data suggest that a subset of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes trigger some down-regulation of Wnt/T and FGF signaling which does not completely prevent ingression but delays it. We do not claim that there is no overexpression of E-cadherin but only that we do not see ectopic E-cadherin in cells overexpressing the Hox constructs. Our model, proposes that <italic>Hox</italic> genes down-regulate <italic>T</italic> expression, delaying its accumulation which is required for triggering ingression of epiblast cells by breaking down the basement membrane and undergoing EMT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, when cells overexpressing posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes accumulate enough T protein they eventually ingress normally (like WT cells). As stated above, we do not see cells overexpressing posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes activating <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I-J</xref>) nor entering massively the neural tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> or supplementary videos) arguing against a conversion of epiblast cells to a neural fate by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Ingression of cells during gastrulation requires disruption of a RhoA-dependent mechanism required for stabilization of basal microtubules in epiblast cells (Nakaya Y et al, NCB, 2008). This ultimately leads to loss of cell basement membrane interaction and breakdown of the basement membrane allowing cell ingression. We now include experiments showing that co-overexpression of a Dominant-negative-RhoA construct rescues the ingression phenotype caused by <italic>Hoxa13</italic> overexpression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). This suggests that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes control the timing of ingression by stabilizing the connection between microtubules and the ECM rather than diverting epiblast cells to a neural fate. We now discuss these arguments in more detail in the revised text.</p><p><italic>Other work, in chick, analyzing the expression of</italic> Sox2 <italic>and T transcription throughout body axis elongation shows that strong T persists in the tailbud long after the 25 somite stage, declining only just prior to cessation of elongation at ∼ 44 somite after which T begins to decline and</italic> Sox2 <italic>is up regulated in tailbud cells, in a step that involves decreased FGF signaling (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"><italic>Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</italic></xref><italic>, PLOS Biology).</italic></p><p><italic>Indeed, Tenin et al, 2010, BMC Dev. Biol. show that elongation cessation takes place when the presomitic mesoderm is still present at HH24 (rather than having been used up by somites forming right to the tail tip), suggesting that the body axis does not end due to a lack of ingressed cells. This observation contradicts the main conclusion of this current paper that it is a lack of ingressed presomitic cells that underlies elongation arrest</italic>.</p><p>We do not claim that we have a complete downregulation of T but a slight decrease in expression over time which is not incompatible with the papers cited by the reviewers. The cited data has been obtained by ISH which is not a quantitative method. We now provide a quantitative PCR analysis of <italic>T</italic> expression between 10 and 25 somites showing that T mRNA is decreasing during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C-E</xref>).</p><p>Our study emphasizes the role of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in regulating axis elongation but does not address the arrest of somitogenesis per se even though our data suggest that both are linked. This reviewer is right in saying that it is unlikely to result from exhaustion of PSM precursors in the chicken embryo as there is still a small amount of PSM remaining when axis elongation stops. This might however be the case in mouse and we have amended our text accordingly. We have proposed that axis termination is caused by exposure of the tail bud to retinoic acid produced by the somitic region, which is made possible due to the shrinking of the PSM (Gomez et al, Nature, 2008). RA has been shown to down-regulate FGF signaling and to induce differentiation and death of the tail bud precursors leading to the arrest of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>, BMC Biol; Olivera Martinez et al, 2011, PLOS Biol). In line with this hypothesis, we found that Cyp26A1 which is involved in RA degradation is downregulated by <italic>Hoxa13</italic>, which was also observed by Deschamps’s group in mouse (Young et al, Dev Cell, 2009). Whether the raise in retinoids levels observed in the chicken embryo is caused by the shrinking of the PSM, which brings the RA-producing somitic region next to the tail bud or by another mechanism remains to be investigated. We now provide a more detailed description of these arguments in the new version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) The authors present only</italic> Sox2 in situ <italic>data (Figure 2–figure supplement 2) in whole mount embryos to support their claim that there is not a cell fate change when</italic> Hoxa13 <italic>is mis-expressed.

We tried the antibody published in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref>, PLOS Biology) but in our hands it only gives a strong background even if we dilute the antibody to 1/2000 (in the paper they use it at 1/200). It is a polyclonal antibody so it might be related to batches issues (we tried 2 batches). Importantly, the descendants of the epiblast cells overexpressing posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are always found in the paraxial mesoderm and rarely in the neural tube (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> or supplementary videos). This further indicates that Hox overexpressing cells do not convert to a <italic>Sox2</italic> positive neural fate. We have added this important argument to the text of the revised version.</p><p><italic>12) It is not clear why the authors provide</italic> in situ <italic>images for</italic> T <italic>and</italic> Fgf8 <italic>at HH14 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) using an intronic probe; other genes are not assessed in this way and no comment or explanation is provided in the text or figure legend. It is not clear how this data compares with published work showing strong and extensive T transcripts until the end of axis elongation. The authors need to address this difference with previous work, explain the significance of loss of active T transcription and consider how T transcripts continue to be regulated by FGF in the tailbud at these late stages (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"><italic>Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</italic></xref><italic>) if the gene is not actively transcribed. One logic may be that the effects of endogenous posterior</italic> Hox <italic>genes are very small and slow acting, however, the authors appear to argue that there is a step change as the tailbud forms and the image presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5F</italic></xref> <italic>implies that T transcripts are lost in the tailbud at this time.</italic></p><p><italic>T</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> are highly expressed genes and the exonic probes for these genes saturate extremely rapidly, even when we develop the embryos at 4 degrees, which makes it extremely difficult to quantify a slight change in gene expression. This is why we decided to use intronic probes which showed a downregulation of the signal which parallels the slowing down of axis elongation. We now also provide a quantitative PCR analysis for these genes from microdissected tail buds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig 8C-E</xref> that confirms our ISH data. This new data confirms small progressive downregulation of T with a significant drop at the 25 somite stage when the first <italic>Hox13</italic> genes are activated.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>[…] Overall, this paper presents a striking phenomenon in the regulation of cell ingression through the primitive streak by posterior</italic> Hox <italic>genes and some very interesting data that explain to some extent the molecular mechanisms at play here.

What does this mean if it is clear that, at least in the chick, body axis elongation ceases when the PSM is still present and there is room for more somites to be generated? How is ingression then associated with arrest of somitogenesis? Somitogenesis arrest is more likely linked to loss of Notch pathway oscillations in the remaining PSM (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66"><italic>Tenin et al, 2010</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the formulation was unclear and we have changed the last sentence of the Abstract into: “Due to the continuation of somite formation, this mechanism leads to the progressive reduction of PSM size. This ultimately brings the retinoic acid (RA)-producing segmented region in close vicinity to the tail bud, potentially accounting for the termination of segmentation and axis elongation”. We now expand on these notions in the Introduction and Discussion as discussed in point 3 below.</p><p><italic>3) In the Introduction the authors should mention the evidence that explanted chick tailbuds (i.e. without somites) are a demonstrated source of RA (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66"><italic>Tenin et al, 2010</italic></xref><italic>). This is an important finding, which bears on their hypothesis that shortening of the PSM is a major step in that brings retinoic acid to tailbud and so curtails body axis elongation. It may be that both mechanisms operate and I think this should be made clear upfront, rather than appearing later in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We have added these findings and discuss them more extensively in the Introduction. The following text has been added to the same part of the text:.</p><p>“In chicken and fish embryos, the arrest of axis elongation has been linked to the inhibition of FGF and Wnt signalling in the tail-bud which leads to the down-regulation of the transcription factor <italic>T/Brachyury</italic> and of the Retinoic Acid (RA)-degrading enzyme <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Kimelman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tenin et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</xref>).

They need to be more precise,</italic> Hoxb1-9<italic>.</italic></p><p>We agree and have modified the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) It would be informative to explain in the paper that the 25 somite stage is ∼when the tailbud forms and that this is when when cell ingression through the primitive streak ceases—refer to work from Susan Mackem's lab in chick showing cessation at HH stage16 (∼ 24-28 somites,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37"><italic>Knezevic et al, 1998</italic></xref><italic>, and see</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Catala et al, 1995</italic></xref><italic>, and also</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73"><italic>Wilson and Beddington, 1996</italic></xref><italic>, in the mouse). It seems likely that the mechanism identified by the authors is most functionally significant at this mid-way stage; from then on the PSM is added to from an</italic> “<italic>internalized</italic>” <italic>set of precursor cells. McGrew et al 2009 and</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"><italic>Olivera-Martinez et al, 2012</italic></xref> <italic>identify these cell populations by lineage analysis in the chick tail bud as the NMps (Sox/bra expressing cells) and also a transit amplifying cell population of mesodermal progenitors. I think the authors should explain this in the Discussion (and in the Introduction). As the paper currently reads it might be thought that ingression through the primitive streak continues until the end of axis elongation, when in fact in both chick and mouse embryos this ceases at somite 30 of ∼50-53 (chick, HH16) and 33 of 65 (mouse, E10.5). The cessation of ingression thus fits more closely with the establishment of the tailbud about half way through body axis elongation. As</italic> Hoxb <italic>and</italic> d13 <italic>begin to be expressed just after tailbud formation, they may contribute to conclusion of the ingression process, but this early role also leaves room for other actions for such</italic> Hox <italic>genes, including the regulation of cell proliferation in the tailbud mesoderm, described by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19"><italic>Economides et al 2003</italic></xref><italic>. I think these considerations are important to clarify that the regulation of ingression that they uncover is distinct from the model they originally proposed in which this was directly linked to</italic> “<italic>exhaustion</italic>” <italic>of PSM precursors and elongation arrest.</italic></p><p>Our model argues that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes regulate axis elongation by controlling cell ingression in the PSM (and also by regulating cell motility, independently of ingression) and thus makes the implicit assumption that this ingression process continues during axis elongation. Whether this is the case or not as raised by this comment is an excellent point. However, we do not agree with the assertion that in the chicken embryo, cell ingression ceases at stage 16HH (25-somite stage). While this has been published in the Knezevic paper in 98, since then Ohta et al (Gen Yamada’s lab) have published in 2007 in Development that ingression continues at the level of the Ventral Ectodermal Ridge (the remnant of the primitive streak which forms around the 25-somite stage) at least up to stage 20 HH (40-43 somites). More recent data from Kate Storey’s lab (Olivera-Martinez et al, PLOS Biol, 2012) also show ingression from the late chordo-neural hinge as late as stages 21-22HH (&gt;45 somites). Overall, very little is known about the movement of cells in the tail-bud after the 25-somite stage in the chicken embryo.</p><p>We now provide an extended discussion of the literature concerning ingression and paraxial mesoderm precursors. The text below has been added to the Discussion of the revised version:</p><p>“In the chicken embryo, PM precursors originate initially from the lateral epiblast which migrate toward the midline during formation of the primitive streak ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selleck and Stern, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hatada and Stern, 1994</xref>). […] Whether <italic>Hox13</italic> genes might regulate the late ingression of PM at the level of the VER as shown by Ohta or at the level of the CNH as proposed by Olivera-Martinez remains to be established.

However, as ingression has ceased and continued extension is due to the activity of internalized precursors it is difficult to see Hox regulation of cell ingression as a molecular explanation for axis arrest</italic>.</p><p>In mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington (1996)</xref> initially reported an arrest of ingression when the posterior neuropore closes at the 30-somite stage, but subsequently Wilson and Cambray (2002) provided evidence for mesoderm ingression after neuropore closure. In addition, we also show that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes act on cell motility in the PSM, which by itself might be sufficient to explain some slowing down of elongation.</p><p>To clarify this point, we have added the following text to the revised Discussion:</p><p>“In mouse embryos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington (1996)</xref> initially reported an arrest of ingression when the posterior neuropore closes at the 30-somite stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilson and Beddington, 1996</xref>), but Wilson and Cambray (2002) subsequently provided evidence for continued ingression of cells in the PM after this stage (Cambray and Wilson, 2002). Thus, in mouse embryos, termination of axis elongation could simply result from exhaustion of PM progenitors caused by the slowing of axis elongation triggered by posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes acting on cell ingression and motility.”</p><p><italic>7) The new data localize the region of</italic> Hox <italic>genes involved, but shows that this does not contain a conserved sequence that correlates with repressive activity. We are left with further speculation that this must be due to local protein structure. Similarly, the authors may have identified a further part of the molecular mechanism that regulates cell ingression, by rescuing</italic> Hox <italic>gene induced delay by co-expression with the DN-RhoA construct. However, this simply shows that de-stabilizing microtubules can force ingression and there is no molecular link made here from Brachyury to regulation of RhoA activity.

Together with our low magnification <italic>Sox2</italic> in situs that do not show upregulation of <italic>Sox2</italic> in overexpressing cells, we believe that this strongly argue against <italic>Hox</italic> genes maintaining cells in the epiblast by converting them to a neural fate. Furthermore as shown on the movies, we clearly see ingression of Hox expressing cells in the PSM.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: a further round of revisions was requested prior to acceptance, as described below</italic>.<italic>]</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some relatively minor but still important issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors have responded with some discussion of the literature on when ingression ceases, but this is not convincing. It is certainly debatable whether movement of cells from the late chordo-neural-hinge (CNH) to the PSM is considered an ingression; the CNH is the already internalized structure derived from the primitive streak. They should clarify their interpretation</italic>.</p><p>When it comes to ingression passed the primitive streak stage, the situation is extremely unclear. We have nevertheless attempted to clarify the situation as suggested by modifying the original conclusion paragraph as shown below:</p><p>“There is also some lineage continuity at the level of the PM precursors of the Node/primitive streak border […]. Overall, very little is known about the movements of cells in the tail-bud after the 25-somite stage in chicken and mouse embryos.”</p><p><italic>2) The response to comment 8 is confused; expression of</italic> Sox2 <italic>in epiblast cells that fail to ingress does not automatically lead to their contribution to the neural tube. Given the poor quality data (low magnification wholemount in situs which do not recapitulate published caudal expression of</italic> Sox2 <italic>even in the controls), they should be cautious with the interpretation.</italic></p><p>We have now modified the text in conclusion as shown below to add to more arguments against the fact that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes induce cells towards a <italic>Sox2</italic>-positive neural plate, hence preventing their ingression, namely the fact that <italic>Sox2</italic> is not detected in the microarray analysis of <italic>Hoxa13</italic> overexpressing cells and the fact that Hox-ingressing cells are clearly observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. As suggested, we have nevertheless added a sentence of caution at the end of the paragraph:</p><p>“Thus the Wnt repression experienced by epiblast cells in response to posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes overexpression could induce these cells toward a neural fate hence preventing them to ingress. However, <italic>Hoxa13</italic> overexpression does not lead to up-regulation of the neural marker <italic>Sox2</italic> in electroporated cells as detected by in situ hybridization and in our microarray analysis. Furthermore, electroporated cells are seen to enter the PM and do not enter the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and supplementary movies). This therefore suggests that posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes are unlikely to control cell ingression by promoting acquisition of a neural fate in epiblast cells. While we cannot completely rule out that a subpopulation of these cells remains in the tail-bud as <italic>Sox2</italic>-positive cells, it is unlikely that this contributes to the dramatic axis elongation slow-down observed after posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes overexpression.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
