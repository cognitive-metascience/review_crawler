This somatosensory attenuation occurs because the brain predicts the tactile consequences of our self-generated movements. To produce attenuation, the tactile predictions need to be time-locked to the movement, but how the brain maintains this temporal tuning remains unknown. Using a bimanual self-touch paradigm, we demonstrate that people can rapidly unlearn to attenuate touch immediately after their movement and learn to attenuate delayed touch instead, after repeated exposure to a systematic delay between the movement and the resulting touch. The magnitudes of the unlearning and learning effects are correlated and dependent on the number of trials that participants have been exposed to. We further show that delayed touches feel less ticklish and non-delayed touches more ticklish after exposure to the systematic delay. These findings demonstrate that the attenuation of self-generated touch is adaptive.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>somatosensory attenuation</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor delays</kwd><kwd>prediction errors</kwd><kwd>forward models</kwd><kwd>tickling</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship #704438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kilteni</surname><given-names>Konstantina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007464</institution-id><institution>Torsten Söderberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houborg</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Göranssonska Stiftelserna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrsson</surname><given-names>H Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The brain continuously updates the learned temporal relationship between motor commands and their associated somatosensory feedback, which determines the perceived intensity and ticklishness of self-touch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is theorized that the brain uses internal models to anticipate the sensory consequences of voluntary movements on the basis of a copy of the motor command (efference copy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bays and Wolpert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franklin and Wolpert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blakemore et al., 1998a</xref>). These sensory predictions are used to achieve efficient online motor control, to ensure movement stability and to reduce uncertainty, as the actual sensory feedback is delayed due to sensory transduction times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawato, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidson and Wolpert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>). In addition, the predictions of the internal models are also used for attenuating the perception of self-produced input, thereby increasing the salience of unpredicted external signals and facilitating the perceptual distinction between the self and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays and Wolpert, 2008</xref>). For example, when one actively touches one’s left hand with one’s right (self-touch), the touch feels less intense than identical touches applied to the left hand by another person or a machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>). This is because the self-induced touch has been predicted by the internal model.</p><p>Importantly, the predictions of the internal models are useful only if the models constitute accurate representations of the body and the current environmental dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolpert and Flanagan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haith and Krakauer, 2013</xref>). Biased predictions would not only be detrimental to motor performance but also prevent one from distinguishing the sensory feedback of one’s own movements from that produced by external causes. A good illustration of this sharp tuning of the internal models is that their predictions are temporally locked to the given movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left): for example, during self-touch, tactile feedback is expected at the time of contact between the hands, and touch that is artificially delayed (even by only 100 ms) shows reduced attenuation and is attributed to external causes rather than the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42888.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental Hypotheses, Procedures and Psychophysical Analysis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (<italic>Left</italic>) When the internal model is tuned to 0 ms as in natural situations, the probability distribution for the occurrence of touch on the left index finger (approximated as a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2005</xref>) based on the uncertainty in the predicted time of the touch arising from noise in motor and sensory systems) peaks at 0 ms after the movement of the right index finger. Touch presented at 0 ms shows the strongest attenuation, while touch at 100 ms is less attenuated because it is less likely to have been self-generated. (<italic>Middle</italic>) When exposed to systematic delays of 100 ms between the finger movement and the touch, the model parameter is gradually updated to 100 ms, which can be viewed as a simple incremental shift in the probability distribution by 100 ms. Before the exposure, there is an error associated with the touch predicted at 0 ms and presented at 100 ms but no error related to the naturally presented touch at 0 ms. During the learning period, this pattern gradually reverses: a prediction error for the touch presented at 0 ms appears and grows over exposure time, while the prediction error for the touch at 100 ms decays and reaches a minimum. (<italic>Right</italic>) After prolonged exposure, the touch at 0 ms has low probability, produces a large prediction error and will not be attenuated, whereas the touch at 100 ms has high probability, produces no prediction error and will be attenuated. (<bold>b</bold>) Participants were instructed to use their right index finger to tap a sensor (active tap) that delivered a tap on their left index finger (test tap). (<bold>c</bold>) In the <italic>exposure trials</italic>, participants simply tapped the sensor with their right index finger (RF) and received the tap on the left index finger (LF) with a 0 ms or a 100 ms <italic>exposure delay</italic> (intrinsic delay of the force setup ≅ 36 ms). In the <italic>response trials</italic>, participants received a second tap on their left index finger (comparison tap) and were required to indicate which tap was stronger: the test or the comparison tap.

Using a device that simulates bimanual self-touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), thirty subjects were initially exposed to 500 trials in which a systematic delay of 0 ms or 100 ms (<italic>exposure delay</italic>) was inserted between the voluntary tap of the right index finger and the resulting touch on the pulp of the relaxed left index finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stetson et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We reasoned that when repeatedly presented with the 100 ms discrepancy between the predicted and actual somatosensory feedback, the brain would be forced to retune the internal model in order to account for this delay and thus keep the predictions accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle). This hypothesis led to two specific predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right). First, when the 100 ms delay is removed after the exposure period, participants should have stopped predicting and therefore attenuating the sensation of the tap. Second, when the delay is maintained after the exposure period, the participants should have started predicting and thus attenuating the delayed tap. We tested both of these predictions in a psychophysical task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2005</xref>) performed immediately after the initial exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) (see also Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In the response trials of the task, participants were presented with two taps on the left index finger – one test tap of 2 N presented at 0 ms or 100 ms after the right finger’s active tap (<italic>test delay</italic>) and one comparison tap of variable magnitude – and their task was to indicate which one felt stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

In line with this pattern, the immediate tap felt significantly less intense than the delayed one (paired Wilcoxon test between [0 ms, 0 ms] and [0 ms, 100 ms], <italic>n</italic> = 30, <italic>V</italic> = 18, p&lt;0.001, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.183,–0.09]). Importantly however, the pattern of results reversed after exposure to a 100 ms delay: the attenuation of the immediate tap significantly decreased (paired t-test between [100 ms, 0 ms] and [0 ms, 0 ms], <italic>t</italic>(29) = 2.73, p=0.011, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.018, 0.128], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 4.241). This decrease in attenuation of immediate touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) indicates that participants <italic>unlearned</italic> to predict touch at the time of contact. Moreover, the attenuation of the immediate tap was no longer significantly different from the baseline (paired t-test between [100 ms, 0 ms] and baseline, <italic>t</italic>(29) = −1.88, p=0.070, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.129, 0.005]) although the Bayesian analysis did not provide compelling evidence regarding the presence or absence of such difference (<italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.916). In contrast, the attenuation of the delayed tap significantly increased (paired t-test between [100 ms, 100 ms] and [0 ms, 100 ms], <italic>t</italic>(29) = −3.29, p=0.003, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.142,–0.033], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 14.311). This shift in attenuation of the delayed touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) indicates that participants <italic>learned</italic> to predict the touch at the delay to which they were exposed. Moreover, a statistical trend for a difference in the attenuation of the delayed tap from the baseline was detected (paired t-test between [100 ms, 100 ms] and baseline, <italic>t</italic>(29) = −1.98, p=0.057, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.153, 0.002]) but without any conclusive evidence from the Bayesian analysis (<italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 1.077). Importantly, the extent to which participants unlearned to predict the immediate touch was significantly positively correlated with the extent to which participants learned to predict the delayed one (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.471, <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.83, p=0.009, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.136, 0.712], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 6.150); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), implying a temporal shift in the probability distribution of the tactile consequences in line with our hypothesized model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle and right). Finally, we noted that there were no significant differences in the participants’ discrimination ability, that is just noticeable difference, between conditions (paired t-test between [0 ms, 0 ms] and [100 ms, 0 ms], <italic>t</italic>(29) = −0.76, p=0.452, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.035, 0.016], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.254); paired t-test between [0 ms, 100 ms] and [100 ms, 100 ms], <italic>t</italic>(29) = 0.82, p=0.418, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.018, 0.043], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 0.265)). This finding excludes the presence of response sensitivity differences between conditions as an alternative explanation of the present results. Taken together, these findings suggest that the internal model generating the tactile predictions that produce the somatosensory attenuation can be temporally retuned.</p><p>To quantitatively strengthen our conclusion that the abovementioned findings are due to the retuning of the internal model, we performed an additional experiment in which we explicitly tested our theoretical prediction that the longer the participants are exposed to the systematic delays between movement and touch, the larger the temporal shift in the probability distribution of the internal model will be, and therefore the larger the perceptual effects on somatosensory attenuation will be (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle). Two new groups of fifteen participants each were continuously presented with 100 ms exposure trials while being tested for the attenuation of immediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) or delayed touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) after 0, 50, 200 and 500 exposure trials. The results revealed a significant interaction between the number of exposure trials and the delay tested (<italic>F</italic>(3,56) = 3.89, p=0.013). More specifically, the attenuation of immediate touch [100 ms, 0 ms] decreased significantly as the number of exposure trials increased (<italic>F</italic>(3,42) = 3.64, p=0.020), while the attenuation of delayed touch [100 ms, 100 ms] increased significantly as the number of exposure trials increased (<italic>F</italic>(3,42) = 4.86, p=0.005). Replicating our previous results, the pairwise comparisons indicated a significant decrease in the attenuation of immediate touch after 200 exposure trials (<italic>t</italic>(14) = −2.45, p=0.028, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.168,–0.011], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 2.403) and 500 exposure trials (<italic>t</italic>(14) = −2.82, p=0.014, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.198,–0.027], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 4.344) compared to the initial performance after 0 exposure trials, as well as a significant increase in the attenuation of the delayed touch after 50 exposure trials (<italic>t</italic>(14) = 2.98, p=0.010, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.019, 0.113], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 5.627), 200 exposure trials (<italic>t</italic>(14) = 2.82, p=0.014, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.022, 0.160], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 4.324) and 500 exposure trials (<italic>t</italic>(14) = 3.38, p=0.004, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [0.034, 0.151], <italic>BF<sub>10</sub></italic> = 10.833) compared to the initial test. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the retuning of the internal model underlying somatosensory attenuation occurs through error-driven processes that evolve over time in response to repeated exposure to unexpected delays in the sensorimotor system.</p><p>Somatosensory attenuation is considered one of the reasons for which we cannot tickle ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blakemore et al., 1998b</xref>). Accordingly, self-tickling sensations are cancelled because the somatosensory feedback of our movement matches the tactile prediction of the internal model and thus gets attenuated. In contrast, ticklish sensations arise from discrepancies (prediction errors) between the predicted feedback of the internal model and the actual somatosensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blakemore et al., 2000a</xref>). An earlier study showed that participants rated their self-generated touch as more ticklish when a delay greater than 100 ms was introduced between the movement of one hand and the resulting touch on the other, compared to when a 0 ms delay was introduced. We hypothesized that after exposure to systematic delays the delayed self-generated touch would feel less ticklish because the retuning of the internal model of somatosensory attenuation would reduce this delay-induced prediction error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, middle). Conversely, natural (non-delayed) self-generated touch would feel more ticklish since the prediction error between the delayed prediction and the immediate tactile feedback would increase after the exposure.</p><p>To this end, we performed an additional experiment in which a new group of thirty participants moved the arm of a robot with their right hand to apply touch on their left forearm through a second robot. The second robot (slave) copied the movement of the first robot (master) either with a 0 ms or a 150 ms delay (intrinsic delay of the robots’ setup ≅ 44 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As expected from the literature, after exposure to the 0 ms delay participants judged more frequently the delayed touch as being more ticklish than the immediate touch (median frequency = 0.8, mean frequency = 0.73). Critically, after exposure to the 150 ms delay, this frequency significantly dropped (median frequency 0.6, mean frequency 0.65): Wilcoxon singed rank test, <italic>n</italic> = 30, <italic>V</italic> = 88, p=0.046, <italic>CI<sup>95</sup></italic> = [−0.2,–0.00002] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). That is, the delayed touch was rated significantly less frequently as the more ticklish one, or, reversely, the immediate touch was rated significantly more frequently as the more ticklish one. This result suggests that ticklishness sensations depend on the same learning mechanism that supports the attenuation of self-touch, thereby generalizing our findings beyond force intensity perception and suggesting a universal role of the sensory predictions –generated by a continuously retuned internal model– in the perceptual discrimination of self and non-self.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42888.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Methods and Results from the tickling experiment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Participants were instructed to move the stylus of a robot with their right hand (master robot).

Our findings are strongly consistent with a gradual updating of the internal model during exposure to systematic delays between the movement and the tactile feedback from the resulting self-touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). After exposure to such delays, the delayed touch was predicted and thus attenuated, while the immediate (non-delayed) touch was not predicted and thus not attenuated. Moreover, the magnitudes of these effects were correlated and dependent on the number of exposure trials, in line with our proposal that the retuning of the internal model was driven by a prediction-error-based learning process. Finally, we demonstrated that this dynamic retuning of the internal model influences the perceived ticklishness of tactile stimulation, so that delayed touches feel less ticklish and non-delayed touches more ticklish after exposure to systematic delays. This demonstrates that the predictive learning process under discussion affects the perceptual quality of touch as being self- or externally generated beyond the mere intensity of the somatosensory feedback. Taken together, the present study brings compelling evidence that somatosensory attenuation is an adaptive phenomenon.</p><p>We propose that the internal model underlying somatosensory attenuation during normal temporal conditions is dynamically retuned in presence of systematic delays, to encode the new temporal relationship between the motor command and the tactile consequence. Rather than the adaptation of an existing internal model, it could be argued that the exposure to the delays leads to the acquisition of a new internal model instead. In a bimanual object manipulation task, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Witney et al. (1999)</xref> demonstrated a significant grip force modulation after repeated exposure to a systematic delay between the movement of one hand and the resulting effects on the other hand, in a direction that is consistent with the acquisition of new internal model rather than the update of an existing one. According to this proposal, the brain would learn different internal models for the different delays and would switch between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert and Kawato, 1998</xref>). Our data cannot differentiate between these two hypotheses since in both scenarios we would expect a decrease in the attenuation of the immediate touch and an increase in the attenuation of delayed touch. Moreover, it is not known whether the same internal model underlies the anticipatory grip force modulation during object manipulation and the sensory attenuation during self-touch. Nevertheless, based on the correlation between the shifts in the attenuation of immediate touch and the attenuation of delayed touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>), we consider that a shift in the predicted temporal distribution towards the newly predicted timing (update of an existing internal model) is more likely than the acquisition of a new one.</p><p>Our study goes beyond earlier studies on crossmodal lag adaptation and sensorimotor temporal recalibration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Vroomen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohde and Ernst, 2016</xref> for reviews). By employing the self-touch paradigm, we kept the relationship between the movement and its feedback from the body natural, in contrast to previous studies that provided participants with artificial feedback, for example visual flashes on the screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stetson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2012</xref>) or white noise bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heron et al., 2009</xref>) in response to keypresses. Most importantly, rather than measuring changes in the perceived order of the participants’ movements and those associated external events – effects present in mere crossmodal asynchronies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vroomen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujisaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>) in the absence of movement– we measured the attenuation of self-generated touch that requires active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bays et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kilteni et al., 2019</xref>) and thus, efference-copy-based predictions.</p><p>What could be the neural mechanism of the temporal retuning of the internal model underlying somatosensory attenuation? We speculate that a candidate brain area could be the cerebellum, given its involvement in the implementation of the internal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>), its well-established relationship with motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>) and somatosensory attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blakemore et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2019</xref>) and its relevance to time perception and temporal coordination of movement according to evidence from nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>), cerebellar patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ivry and Keele, 1989</xref>) and healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jueptner et al., 1995</xref>). Given that maintaining unbiased sensorimotor predictions is the root of motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011</xref>), we propose that the observed effects are a new form of learning that represents the updating of the internal model’s parameter specifying the temporal relationship between the motor command and its sensory feedback from the body. In contrast to the classically studied motor (force-field and visuomotor) adaptation paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011</xref>), the present learning occurs in the temporal rather than the spatial domain, and it serves to keep the sensorimotor predictions regarding one’s own body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kilteni and Ehrsson, 2017</xref>) temporally tuned. This space-time analogy becomes more apparent when we consider that our observed temporal aftereffects – that is the reduced attenuation observed during 0 ms delay after exposure to the 100 ms – mirror the classic spatial aftereffects (e.g. reaching errors) observed in force-field and visuomotor adaptation after removing the spatial perturbation participants have been exposed to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The adaptive nature of sensory attenuation has broad implications for cognitive neuroscience beyond motor control. Accurate comparisons of predicted and actual sensory feedback underpin the distinction of self and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakemore and Frith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>), the perception of ticklishness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>) and the sense of agency, that is the sense of being the author of voluntary action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haggard, 2017</xref>). The present results reveal how such fundamental cognitive distinctions between the self and external causes are supported by a dynamic and flexible error-driven learning process. Indeed, the data from our tickling experiment submit that it is possible to learn to tickle oneself: after the retuning of the internal model to the delay, natural (non-delayed) self-touch feels more intense and more ticklish, as an external touch does.</p><p>Our findings on learning and unlearning mechanisms could have important clinical relevance for schizophrenia research. In healthy subjects, reduced sensory attenuation was associated with a high tendency towards delusional ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Teufel et al., 2010</xref>), and the frequency of passivity experiences in non-pathological subjects with high schizotypal traits was related to increased ticklishness ratings for self-produced touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemaitre et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, schizophrenic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shergill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shergill et al., 2014</xref>) and patients with auditory hallucinations and/or passivity experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blakemore et al., 2000b</xref>) were shown to exhibit reduced attenuation of their self-generated touches with respect to matched controls, with the severity of the schizophrenic patients’ hallucinations being a predictor of their reduced somatosensory attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shergill et al., 2014</xref>). This relationship between somatosensory attenuation and schizophrenia was proposed to reflect deficits in the patients’ internal models mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frith, 2005</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Whitford et al. (2012)</xref> proposed that schizophrenia is related to an abnormal myelination of frontal white matter that produces delays in the generation of the predicted consequences based on the efference copy (internal model). That is, the predicted timing of the sensory feedback lags the movement and feedback time and therefore, non-delayed feedback (0 ms) comes before its predicted time and it is not attenuated, thereby producing uncertainty about the origin of the signal (the self or the others). In agreement with this view, a study using encephalography showed that schizophrenic patients exhibited reduced cortical suppression of self-generated sounds when these were presented without delay but normal attenuation when presented with a delay, compared to heathy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whitford et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, we theorize that schizophrenic patients would perceive their delayed touch as less intense and less ticklish, reflecting an internal model erroneously tuned at that delay; a prediction that should be tested in future experiments.</p><p>More fundamentally, since our study suggests that sensory attenuation relies on online updating prediction estimations it opens up for the possibility that it could be this learning process that is impaired in schizophrenia. We therefore speculate that schizophrenic patients might have no problem in generating motor commands or generating sensory predictions as such, but it is the continuous updating of these predictions that is impaired. In other words, rather than a structural change per se causing the changes in sensory attenuation, it might be that it is the inability to retune the internal model to compensate for these changes in the brain that is causing the cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms. We therefore propose that future computational psychiatry research should specifically investigate the capacity of these individuals to learn and unlearn new temporal relationships between their movements and their sensory feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>In all conditions, participants rested their left hand, palm up, with the left index finger placed inside a molded support.

After a random delay of 800–1500 ms from the test tap, a second tap (comparison tap) was delivered to the left index finger, and participants were required to indicate using a foot pedal which tap (the test tap or the comparison tap) was stronger. The test tap was always set to 2 N, while the intensity of the comparison tap was systematically varied among seven different force levels (1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5 or 3 N). Trials at which the test tap did not have the proper intensity (2 N) – because for example the participants moved their left index finger during the tap – were rejected from the analysis. Specifically, we allowed a range between 1.85 N and 2.15 N. According to this criterion, we rejected 296 trials out of 11550 total trials (2.6%). The intensity of the comparison taps was always assigned to the closest value from the predefined intensities (for example, a comparison tap of 2.61 N was assigned the 2.5 N value). Both test and comparison taps had a fixed duration of 100 ms each.

We also compared all the movement conditions with the baseline condition. To calculate the correlation coefficient between the attenuation shift of immediate touch (unlearning, i.e., PSE at [100 ms, 0 ms] - PSE at [0 ms, 0 ms]) and the attenuation shift of delayed touch (learning, i.e., PSE at [0 ms, 100 ms] - PSE at [100 ms, 100 ms]), we used the Pearson correlation coefficient, since the data were normally distributed.

Two robots (Touch Haptic Devices, 3D systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.3dsystems.com/haptics-devices/touch">https://www.3dsystems.com/haptics-devices/touch</ext-link>) were placed in front of the participants with a distance of 10 cm between them. Participants rested their left arm palm up within a forearm support made of sponge, just beneath the stylus of a robot (<italic>slave</italic> robot). The tip of the stylus was covered with sponge to reduce its sharpness. Participants rested their right elbow on an arm support and held with their right hand the stylus of another robot (<italic>master</italic> robot). The lower part of the stylus of the master robot could freely move within a sinusoidal 3D printed path. The distal point of the path (the one closest to the hand) served as a starting point. Each trial lasted three seconds and upon an auditory cue, participants were asked to move the stylus from the distal point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) to the proximal point along the path, and back to the distal point. In two different conditions, participants performed 50 exposure trials with a systematic delay of 0 or 150 ms between the movement of the master robot and the movement (and stimulation) of the slave robot (<italic>exposure delay</italic>). In the response trials, as in the exposure trials, participants performed two consecutive trials (the first with a 0 ms and the second with a 150 ms delay). Immediately afterwards, they were asked to report which of the two stimulations on their left forearm (the first or the second) felt more ticklish to them. As in the previous experiments, each response trial followed five re-exposure trials. There were 10 response trials per condition. The order in which the volunteers participated in the conditions was counterbalanced. We calculated the frequency at which participants judged the second (150 ms) touch as more ticklish in the two conditions. Since the data were bounded, we performed the planned comparison using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p><p>In the tickling experiment, we chose a delay of 150 ms and not a delay of 100 ms as in the sensory attenuation experiments. This was because our pilot tickling experiments indicated that a 100 ms delay was not sufficient to differentiate the perception of a delayed stroke on the arm from that of an immediate stroke. We consider that this asymmetry of the delay sensitivity between attenuation and tickling should not be surprising: a 100 ms delay would be more salient for a self-induced tap of 100 ms duration than a continuous stroke of 3 s duration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Intrinsic delays in the experimental setup</title><p>As a technical side note, we measured the intrinsic delays of both experimental setups. For the force-setup, we recorded the delay between a tap applied by the right index finger on the force sensor and the corresponding tap the motor produced in response on the left index finger, in 20 consecutive trials. The estimated delay was: (mean ± SD) 36.2 ± 9.8 ms. Therefore, the experimental conditions labeled ‘0 ms’ and ‘100 ms’ actually correspond to effective delays of 36 ms and 136 ms. Similarly, for the robots’ setup we recorded the difference between the time at which the stylus of the master robot reached the furthest position along a straight path along the depth axis and the time at which the stylus of the slave robot was at the corresponding position, in 20 consecutive paths. The estimated delay was: (mean ± SD) 44.2 ± 19.1 ms. Therefore, the experimental conditions labeled ‘0 ms’ and ‘150 ms’ in the tickling experiment actually correspond to effective delays of 44 ms and 194 ms. In both cases, the presence of the intrinsic delays does not alter the interpretation of the results since it only implies a further shift of the initial distribution at a time point later than the movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Konstantina Kilteni was supported by the Marie Sk<bold>ł</bold>odowska-Curie Intra-European Individual Fellowship (#704438).

work on sensory attenuation, the experience that the sensed force of an actively produced tap is felt as less intense compared to when the tactile stimulus is not the result of a volitional action. Previous studies have demonstrated that this effect is predictive, based on cancellation of the expected sensory input – and one would therefore predict it should be adaptive to changes in the contingency between action and sensation, but this has not previously been demonstrated. The experimental design to explore this question is appropriate and the results convincingly show that this attenuation process is subject to temporal adaptation. This study extends our understanding of the adaptive nature of the nervous system on a rapid timescale, with our sensory experience modified to optimize information based on the current context.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid learning and unlearning of predicted sensory delays in self-generated touch&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, with Richard Ivry serving as the Reviewing and Senior editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Marc Ernst (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>We all found the study to provide an interesting extension to the work on sensory gating, the experience that the sensed force of an actively produced tap is usually felt less intense than when the tactile stimulus is not the result of a volitional action. Previous studies have demonstrated that this effect is predictive, based on cancellation of the expected sensory input – and one would therefore predict it should be adaptive to changes in the contingency between action and sensation, but this has not previously been demonstrated. The experimental design to explore this question is appropriate and the results convincingly show that this gating process is subject to temporal adaptation. The finding that, after adaptation, the tactile stimulus is felt as less intense when presented at the adapted delay compared to when presented simultaneously, is especially compelling. The generalization work was also viewed as a strength of the paper, increasing the impact value.</p><p>There are a few issues that should be addressed in revision. We don't foresee any of the problems being difficult to address. They mostly relate to the statistical analyses. These could, in principle, affect the conclusions that can be drawn. However, we anticipate that the data are robust enough to withstand more conservative statistical tests. This needs to be demonstrated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Experiment 1 and also some of the following experiments, paired t-tests are used in many of the analyses. Even though these were planned comparisons, is there any correction done for multiple comparisons? In general it would have probably been better to use a GLMM and test all conditions and participants at ones, which should increase statistical power (e.g. Moscatelli et al. Journal of Vision 2012 (Modeling psychophysical data at the population-level: The generalized linear mixed model).</p><p>2) In Experiment 2 ANOVAs have been performed, but no direct comparison between the two conditions (the one with the data going up and the other with the data going down). Why not analyze all data with a between subject ANOVA and look for an interaction?</p><p>3) Figure 2E and F, were fitted with an exponential model. Please explain the choice of this model, what parameters were used and whether the parameters differ across the two conditions (which they clearly seem to do).</p><p>4) In Figure 3B you plot frequency data ranging from 0 to 1. You write you tested for normality and thus did a t-test. It seems that a more conservative, non-parametric test is more appropriate here. The data are bounded and the some of the frequencies are close to 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42888.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>We all found the study to provide an interesting extension to the work on sensory gating, the experience that the sensed force of an actively produced tap is usually felt less intense than when the tactile stimulus is not the result of a volitional action.

We think that two points in these comments need further clarification from our side.</p><p>First, we did not study sensory gating but sensory attenuation, and we consider these to be two different phenomena.</p><p>- Sensory gating refers to the suppression of any cutaneous stimuli (both self-generated and externally generated touches/vibrations) presented on a moving limb (Chapman et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1998).</p><p>- Somatosensory attenuation refers to the suppression of exclusively self-generated stimuli (not externally generated) on a moving limb but also on a passive limb that receives a touch, such as in case of bimanual interaction (e.g., touching one hand with the other) (Bays and Wolpert, 2008).</p><p>Please note that these two tactile phenomena are different (Bays and Wolpert, 2008; Palmer et al., 2016),but unfortunately, the terms are sometimes erroneously mixed up in the literature.</p><p>Second, we did <italic>not</italic> show that ‘the tactile stimulus is felt as less intense when presented at the adapted delay compared to when presented simultaneously’ anywhere in our text.</p><p>- With respect to force attenuation, we showed that (a) the delayed tactile stimulus feels less intense after exposure to that delay than after exposure to a 0 ms delay, and (b) the immediate tactile stimulus feels stronger when presented without delay after exposure to a 100 ms delay than after exposure to a 0 ms delay.</p><p>- With respect to tickling, we showed that the delayed tactile stimulus is reported less frequently as the ticklish stimulus after exposure to that delay than after exposure to a 0 ms delay.</p><p>The conclusions of our manuscript are consistent with our findings, but we consider that these clarifications might be useful to future readers.</p><p>References:</p><p>Chapman, C.E., Bushnell, M.C., Miron, D., Duncan, G.H., and Lund, J.P.

We have now reanalyzed the data with a generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) using the mixed psychophysics toolbox MERpsychophysics (Moscatelli et al., 2012).</p><p>We first created a model with two fixed effects – a continuous effect reflecting the intensity of the comparison tap and a categorical effect reflecting the experimental condition – and one random effect, i.e., a random intercept per subject. We then contrasted this model with a second model that included the two fixed effects and two random effects, i.e., a random intercept and a random slope. When contrasting the models, it was revealed that the model with the two random effects was better; that is, the model had a lower Akaike information criterion value and a lower Bayesian information criterion value, and a chi-square test suggested that the model with two random effects was significantly better than that with only one random intercept (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

Specifically,</p><p>1) We decided to apply a conservative criterion, keeping only the experimental trials in which the test tap (2 N) was within the range of [1.85, 2.15 N]. This criterion led to the rejection of few trials (2.6% in Experiment 1 and 3.6% in Experiment 2).</p><p>2) We further binned the comparison taps to their closest experimental value [1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, and 3 N].</p><p>3) We now report the Bayes factors for all the results in the parametric tests to provide information about the level of support for the experimental hypothesis against the null hypothesis.</p><p>By doing so, across both experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), all significant comparisons remained significant (and vice versa), except one; the comparison [100 ms, 100 ms] versus baseline became a nonsignificant trend (<italic>p</italic> = 0.057). However, the Bayesian analysis is inconclusive about the absence of an effect. To summarize, none of the conclusions in our manuscript changed.</p><p>Moreover, to illustrate the goodness of our model fitting, we now show all individual fits for all conditions of Experiment 1 in a new figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have now added text in the Materials and methods to illustrate these changes (subsections “Response trials”, Data and Statistical Analysis”, “Participants, Procedure and Analysis in the Effect of Exposure Experiment”), and we have updated all statistical tests and Figure 2 to illustrate the new results (Results and Discussion, second and third paragraphs and Figure 2 legend).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Moscatelli, A., Mezzetti, M., and Lacquaniti, F.
