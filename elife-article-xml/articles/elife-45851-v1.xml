Structures of chicken ASIC1 in three conformations have advanced understanding of proton-mediated gating; however, a molecular mechanism describing desensitization from open and pre-open states (steady-state desensitization or SSD) remains elusive. A distinct feature of the desensitized state is an 180<sup>o</sup> rotation of residues L415 and N416 in the β11- β12 linker that was proposed to mediate desensitization; whether and how it translates into desensitization has not been explored yet. Using electrophysiological measurements of injected <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, we show that Q276 in β9 strand works with L415 and N416 to mediate both types of desensitization in ASIC1a, ASIC2a and ASIC3. Q276 functions as a valve that enables or restricts rotation of L415 and N416 to keep the linker compressed, its relaxation lengthens openings and leads to sustained currents. At low proton concentrations, the proposed mechanism working in only one of three subunits of the channel is sufficient to induce SSD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ASIC</kwd><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>b11-b12 linker</kwd><kwd>Q-valve mechanism</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R21MH10746402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canessa</surname><given-names>Cecilia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010871</institution-id><institution>Thousand Talents Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canessa</surname><given-names>Cecilia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Three residues work together as a valve-like mechanism to control desensitization from pre-open and open states in the ion channels ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC3.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ASICs are sodium channels gated by external protons expressed in neurons. In the peripheral nervous system activation of ASICs induces pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) while in the central nervous system modulates synaptic plasticity influencing the generation of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coryell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wemmie et al., 2003</xref>) and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Pathological activation of ASICs contributes to neuronal damage induced by ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>) and inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friese et al., 2007</xref>). A characteristic of human ASICs is that protons act not only as agonists but also as strong inhibitors by inducing two types of desensitization: low-pH desensitization shuts channels from the open state, and steady-state desensitization (SSD) shuts channels from pre-open closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>). SSD in hASIC1a is almost complete at pH 7.0, whereas maximal activation requires pH &lt;6.5. Desensitization shapes the time course of currents in distinct ways in each of the three functional ASIC isoforms and is important to limit depolarization of neurons under global states of acidosis or local ischemia. Although mutations in many domains of the protein alter desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liechti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Roy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>), there is still incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and how it controls channel function. The atomic structures of chicken ASIC1 in closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>), open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>), and low-pH desensitized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>) have paved the way to address the molecular underpinning of desensitization. A distinct feature of the low-pH desensitized channel is a swap of side chain orientation of L414 and N415 located in the β11-β12 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>) that led Gouaux et al. to hypothesize that the linker uncouples the upper ECD from the lower channel – it works as a molecular clutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>) - allowing the pore to adopt the non-conducting conformation of the desensitized state.</p><p>Here, we used human ASIC1a to test such hypothesis and shed further light on the molecular basis underlying desensitization. We found that the highly conserved residue Q276, located in the middle of the β9 strand works together with L415 and N416 to desensitize ASIC1a, ASIC2a and ASIC3. We propose a valve-like mechanism, named here Q valve in reference to the central role of Q276, wherein rotation of L415 and N416 and compression of the β11-β12 linker are locked by Q276 stabilizing the desensitized state and ensuring both complete SSD and low-pH desensitization. Substitutions of any of the three essential components result in a leaky valve leading to incomplete or no desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Q276 is a key residue involved in desensitization of human ASIC1a</title><p>Q276 is located midway β9 strand in the palm of hASIC1a with the side chain facing the interior of the central vestibule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>); it is conserved in the four mammalian ASIC isoforms and in other vertebrate species sequenced to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutations in this position changed channel desensitization kinetics. All substitutions generated functional channels with currents averaging 22 ± 6 µA/cell with the exception of Q276D that had small currents (1.5 ± 1.1 µA/cell); all exhibited either slow desensitization rates or various magnitudes of sustained current that did not desensitize completely. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows normalized current traces of a few representative mutants superimposed on wild-type channels.

and Q276N that exhibit mainly sustained current or peak and sustained currents, respectively. Most patches contained many channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) only a few (8 out of 30) had one to three channels enabling detection of individual opening events. These lasted many seconds, in some instances up to 80 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). A histogram of the duration of individual events to determine the exact value of the mean open time was not feasible owing to the few observed events, some sweeps showed only 3 to 8 opening events during 3-min recordings at pH 6.5. Nevertheless, the duration of mutant openings was markedly longer than that of wild-type channels. For comparison <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows three successive weeps of a patch expressing wild-type hASIC1a containing three channels. Openings are brief ranging from 4 to 230 ms with a mean of 83.5 ± 99 ms in the example, and are followed by desensitization as others and our group have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sutherland et al., 2001</xref>). Long openings arise from a decrease in the transition rate from the open to desensitized state that is mutant channels do not enter the desensitized state as readily as wild-type channels. Openings were either uninterrupted long-lived open states or interrupted by transient closures. These closures were too brief to represent desensitized states, suggesting that desensitized channels rapidly return either to the open or to brief sojourns to the close state. The scheme of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> is used to describe kinetics of inactivating channels with strong pre-open inactivation such as Kv4.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähring and Covarrubias, 2011</xref>), but it could also be applied to describe qualitatively the time course of hASIC1a. Thick arrows indicate a dominant effect of the <italic>k<sub>ODo</sub></italic> rate constant that drives open channels to desensitize completely with a macroscopic time constant of ~1.8 s. <italic>k<sub>ODo</sub></italic> of Q276 mutants must be significantly reduced to explain the long openings. For any reaction loop the clockwise product of rates around the loop must be equal to the counterclockwise product that is other rate constant(s) must also change. Such rate constant is likely <italic>k<sub>CDc</sub></italic>. As we will show in the next section, Q276 mutations also markedly decrease SSD that is controlled by <italic>k<sub>CDc</sub></italic>. Decreased values of those rate constants contribute to the generation of sustained currents as mutant channels that reach the desensitized states D<sub>oH+</sub> or D<sub>cH+</sub> can return to the open state directly or by transitioning first to the closed state (C<sub>H+</sub>) enabling re-openings as long as protons are present.

The mechanisms to achieve desensitization vary and are distinct to each class of channel, either voltage- or ligand-gated, but all are designed to shut the pore by closing either the opening gate or a secondary gate.</p><p>Significant insight in the molecular mechanism mediating proton gating of ASICs has been obtained from the crystal structures of cASIC1 in close, open and low-pH desensitized conformations. However, a mechanism describing desensitization, both SSD and low-pH desensitization, is not yet fully resolved. Here, we found that residue Q276 located in the rigid β9 strand -that does not undergo movements between conformations- has a profound effect on the desensitization process of ASIC1a, ASIC2a and ASIC3s, the three functional mammalian isoforms. The size of the side chain in this position relates to the magnitude of the functional effects: if very large or very small desensitization is impaired and in the Q276G mutant it is mostly abolished. Underlying this effect is a marked lengthening of the opening events consistent with Q276 determining the transition rate from the open to the desensitized state. Noticeable, other channel properties such as proton-mediated activation, ion selectivity and conductance were not affected indicating that Q276 functions specifically in the desensitization process. We also show that substitutions of the two residues L415 and N416 located in close proximity to Q276 in the β11- β12 linker also disrupt desensitization by lengthening the opening events and that size of the side chains is also an important factor in determining the magnitude of the effects: small and large side chains were more effective in disrupting desensitization, in a pattern similar to substitutions of Q276. Contrary to Q276, some mutations in the linker also modified proton-gating namely shifted the pH<sub>50A</sub> to more acidic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) likely owing to the β11- β12 linker participation in transducing conformational changes from the upper ECD to the pore gate during proton-mediated activation.</p><p>To explain the prominent role of Q276 in desensitization and similar functional effects of substitutions in the linker we propose a molecular mechanism for desensitization wherein the side chain of Q276 operates as a valve that allows or restricts rotation of L415 and N416. In the proposed mechanism, the pathway of movement of L415 and N416 faces Q276 that is it is inward rather than outwards as was originally suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>). This configuration enables transient functional interactions of the three key residues and makes the mechanism highly reliant on their respective sizes. A competent valve –one that ensures complete desensitization- requires concerted work of the three conserved residues; changing any of them introduces steric hindrance that leads to a leaky valve manifested as incomplete or absent desensitization. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and the movie of <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>. An inward pathway of the rotation also provides a means of locking the valve to prevent back swings during desensitization.

Red cross shows the valve closed and how Q276 could prevent backward rotation of L415, which in turn would relax the linker preventing full desensitization. Predicted intermediate states and direction of rotation are derived from functional analysis of substitutions in the three key residues making the valve.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45851-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><media id="fig7video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-45851-fig7-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45851.015</object-id><label>Figure 7—video 1.</label><caption><title>From analysis of the functional data of mutant channels and cASIC1 structures it emerges a possible mechanism for desensitization wherein the central elements are three residues: Q276 located in the middle of β9 strand and L415 and N416 in the β11- β12 linker.</title><p>In the closed conformation, the β11- β12 linker is relaxed and the side chains of Q276 and N416 are in proximity keeping the Q-valve closed. Proton-induced activation separates the β strands of the lower palm and compresses the β11- β12 linker leading to opening of the Q-valve and enabling 180<sup>o</sup> rotation of L415 and N416 in opposite directions with their side chains facing Q276. We speculate that the conformational change produced by the full rotation of L415 and N416 propagates downward through the β12 strand to TM2 to close the gate of the pore. In the desensitized conformation Q276 blocks L415 from flipping back, it remains trapped in the desensitized state. This proposed mechanism explains why Q276G cannot close the valve because L415 can rotate back preventing desensitization. Conversely, when bulky side chains substitute Q276, rotation of N416 and L415 are hindered also preventing or slowing desensitization. Without full and sustained compression of the β11- β12 linker the gate remains open explaining the long mean open times of the mutants and absence of desensitization. This mechanism is also consistent with cross-linking of C276 with C416 or C415 both prevent rotation of residues in the β11- β12 linker leading to inhibition of desensitization.</p></caption></media></fig-group><p>This mechanism applies not only to desensitization from the open state but also from pre-open closed states that exist at pH 7.2 to 7.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this pH range, protons bind in average to only one subunit of the trimer or at most two subunits. The protonated subunit(s) may adopt the open conformation or another as yet unknown conformation; however, steric hindrance imposed by non-protonated neighboring subunits may prevent opening of the gate. Thus, at low proton concentrations, there is predominantly asynchronous protonation of subunits leading to SSD rather than channel openings (left loop <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, at high proton concentrations (pH 6.5–6.0), the three subunits bind protons simultaneously enabling concerted conformational changes of the subunits that lead to channel opening. Results from trimers with fixed stoichiometry of wild type and Q276G subunits support this notion, as the presence of a single wild type subunit in the hASIC1a channel was sufficient to induce complete SSD.</p><p>Overall our results are consistent with previous reports of mutations and modifications of cysteine substitutions in the β1-β2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coric et al., 2003</xref>) and β11-β12 linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Springauf et al., 2011</xref>), in the β1 strand forming the lower palm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cushman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Roy et al., 2013</xref>), TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2010a</xref>) and even the thumb domain that makes contact with the upper part of TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krauson and Carattino, 2016</xref>). Recent structural and functional data have informed that those regions are the ones that undergo the largest conformational changes, and all are located between the Q-valve and the pore, consistent with transducing conformations to the gate. Hence, experimentally introduced mutations or evolution guided species-specific substitutions in any of those domains can alter desensitization and even enable sustained currents (as indicated in the kinetic schemes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This explains why not all channels that have the tried Q276-L415-N416 exhibit identical kinetics of desensitization.</p><p>This study provides experimental support for the original suggestion that the β11- β12 linker is essential for ASIC1 desensitization and that it disengages the upper and lower ECD; however, we found that it does not work alone but needs residue Q276 to keep the linker compressed during desensitization.</p><p>In summary, we combined the insight drawn from the structures together with functional analysis of key residues to propose a dedicated and parsimonious mechanism to control desensitization of ASICs. Further proof of this mechanism could be obtained by structural analysis of the mutant Q276G channel that remains in the proton-induced open conformation for long times. Such analysis could reveal the linker caught in intermediate states as predicted by Q-valve mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cells were placed in a fast exchange perfusion chamber with high flow delivered by gravity. Perfusion solutions had the following composition in mM: 100 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5 MES, pH was adjusted to desired values with n-methyl-d-glucamine. When indicated, CaCl<sub>2</sub> was omitted from the solutions. Pipette resistances were 0.5–1 MΩ when filled with 3M KCl. Oocytes were voltage clamped at −60 mV unless indicated. ASIC currents were activated by changing the external solution from a conditioning pH of 7.4 -or any other indicated value- to a more acidic test pH for 5 s to 30 s until currents completely desensitized –that is reached the zero current level- or the sustained current reached a plateau. The external solution was returned to pH 7.4 or changed to the indicated pre-conditioning pH for 15 to 30 s, short time for non-desensitizing and long for desensitizing mutants. To calculate the pH<sub>50a</sub>, each mutant channel was first activated with solutions in the pH range from 6.9 to 4.5. Lower pH values induced a sustained endogenous current in oocytes. Most channels reached Imax around pH 6.0 to 6.5, peak currents decreased as pH was lowered further. Thus, we used a pH range from no activation to the one that induced maximal current for the mutant tested. Channels with pH<sub>50a</sub> markedly shifted to the right, the range was extended to pH 4.5.

Membrane potential was held at −60 mV. Patches were perfused with a solution of pH 7.4 to establish the baseline current, followed by activation with a solution of pH 6.5 using a fast-exchange perfusion system (SF-77B perfusion-step, Warner Instruments). Experiments were conducted at room temperature. For determination of ion permeabilities, 100 mM NaCl was replaced with 100 mM KCl or CsCl. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was omitted from the solutions in these experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

The key finding is that some mutations at three conserved residues Q276, L415 and N416 can virtually abolish both types of desensitization, with minimal impact on other parameters, such as pH50, conductance or ion selectivity. The authors also show that at least the role of Q276 is conserved across other mammalian isoforms, suggesting a broadly applicable mechanism. Lastly, they propose that a single WT subunit is sufficient to induce both types of desensitization. Although a recent structural study had already suggested the involvement of at least L415 in desensitization from open states, the present work is novel and of high relevance to the field. Not least by strongly suggesting that both types of desensitization appear to have the same physical origin and/or converge on to the same pathway. In the past, the lack of ASIC mutations that strongly inhibit or even abolish desensitization has been a major hindrance in studying state-dependence in e.g. pharmacological studies or those focusing on functional mechanisms. Therefore, the results of the present study are likely to enable numerous future studies. Undertaking the following essential and minor revisions will considerably strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose a relatively detailed mechanism by which they envision desensitization to occur. However, we are not convinced their functional data (even in combination with the available structural data) allows them to draw these detailed conclusions. For example, the authors state &quot;…changing any of them ((G276, L415, N416)) introduces steric hindrance that leads to a leaky valve..&quot; and &quot;…makes the mechanism reliant on their respective sizes.&quot;…, yet for example L415G/A are just effective at preventing desensitization as are L415F/Y/R. The conclusions regarding the details of the mechanism should therefore be revised to better reflect the data. Additionally, it is not clear why they coin the term &quot;Q valve&quot; with reference to only the role of Q276, when mutations at positions L415 and N416 can have very similar effects. This should be reconsidered and possibly revised to something like &quot;QLN desensitization gate/hub&quot; or similar. In addition, it would be good for the authors to discuss alternative possible mechanisms.</p><p>2) The authors use concatemeric constructs to assess how many WT subunits are necessary to observe full desensitization. But there are two issues with their results: first, they need to show what happens functionally in the Q276G-Q276G-Q276G triple mutant trimer (and the WT-WT-WT trimer). Based on their findings, one would expect Q276G-Q276G-Q276G to resemble that of the regular Q276G mutant, but concatemeric ion channel constructs are notorious for producing unexpected results (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12488557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29382698). This is particularly important in light of the second issue, which is that the present functional and biochemical data (in Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) does not exclude the possibility of a significant population of partial concatemers, i.e. individual WT or mutant subunits that result from incomplete translation. Another very valuable control would be to show that a single WT subunit supports desensitization independently of whether it is present in the first, second or third protomer.</p><p>3) The current version of the manuscript does not contain any tables for pH50 or Hill coefficient values for activation and SSD. They need to be included, in particular because some of the data shown in a number of figure panels are virtually impossible to distinguish (e.g. Figure 3A/B; Figure 5E/G/H/J; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A/C etc). &quot;Additional representative examples of other mutants are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.&quot; Additional examples of the same mutants shown in Figure 1 do not add much. It would be helpful if the authors include representative traces of the ones that are excluded in Figure 1 (e.g. Q276L). There is no figure legend for Figure 5H-J. It is also not clear how many cells were tested in some cases. Please add n values to all the figure legends, including supplemental figures and tables.</p><p>4) &quot;Nevertheless, the duration of mutant openings was markedly longer than that of wild type channels…&quot; It is difficult to gauge what &quot;markedly longer&quot; means without a wild type control. A representative wild type trace in Figure 2 would be helpful. The same is also true for Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We understand that the properties of WT ASICs have been reported previously, but WT controls under the same experimental conditions are necessary for evaluating the effects of the Q276G mutation.</p><p>5) Figure 3A and others; it is unclear how those SSD experiments were done (e.g. duration of preconditioning, at what pH the reported current was measured, how Imax was obtained, etc). Include a brief description in figure legends and a more thorough methodology in Materials and methods.</p><p>6) Generally, the Discussion section should place the work into a wider context. However, in its present form, the discussion lacks detail and should be expanded to include a more in-depth discussion on previous work (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12947112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17389250), including comments or speculation on mechanisms of desensitization in non-mammalian ASICs (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064854).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45851.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose a relatively detailed mechanism by which they envision desensitization to occur.

Each of these residues rotates in opposite direction phasing Q276. The data show that if the side chain in position 276 is larger or smaller than Q, rotations of the two residues in the β11- β12 linker (L4215, N416) are impaired in various degrees. For instance, if the side chain in 415 is very large (F, Y, W) steric hindrance prevents full rotation diminishing desensitization whereas very small side chains (G, A) enable backward rotation because they cannot be locked by Q276 in the desensitized conformation. This makes the valve ‘leaky’. For position N416, large residues here produce steric hindrance decreasing desensitization whereas small residues can pass without obstruction. Because N416 does not participate in locking the valve, small residues are tolerated in this position i.e. they enable desensitization. The cartoon of Figure 7C and the supplementary video illustrate how the proposed valve mechanism operates and predicts the functional effects of mutations in each of the three elements of the valve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it is not clear why they coin the term &quot;Q valve&quot; with reference to only the role of Q276, when mutations at positions L415 and N416 can have very similar effects.

In addition, it would be good for the authors to discuss alternative possible mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the term valve-like mechanism as a simple and short way to describe how the three essential residues operate together and to highlight the central role of Q276, which is a residue that does not tolerate substitutions i.e. all other amino acids impair in some degree desensitization.</p><p>From the English dictionary a ‘valve’ is a device that regulates the flow of gases, liquids or other materials through apertures by opening, closing or obstructing passageways. We thought that the most descriptive and accurate term is a valve because Q276 regulates the movement of L415 and N416 but Q276 is not an element that moves in the proposed mechanism. We cannot argue other ways to describe the relative movements of these residues; we just have not come up with better words to describe it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use concatemeric constructs to assess how many WT subunits are necessary to observe full desensitization.

Wt-wt-wt and Q276G-Q276G exhibit currents with properties identical to channels made by injection of single subunits. We have also replaced the previous western blot in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 with a new one that contains the four concatamers blotted with three antibodies (each for one of the monomers in the concatamer): anti-Fl, anti-V5 and anti-HA in order to visualize any abnormal size products that could represent monomers or dimers. As demonstrated in the blots, only bands of molecular size corresponding to a trimer -three hASIC1a in a single protein- were detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The current version of the manuscript does not contain any tables for pH50 or Hill coefficient values for activation and SSD.

For mutants with markedly decreased proton affinity for SSD the values are reported as &lt;pH 6.0 and the n could not be estimated owing to overlap of activation and desensitization currents.</p><p>We have added representative traces of mutants Q276A and Q276L in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Figure legends of Figure 5 H-J have been included. In the Materials and methods section under Data analysis is indicated that each data point represents the average of 5-8 independent cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Nevertheless, the duration of mutant openings was markedly longer than that of wild type channels…&quot; It is difficult to gauge what &quot;markedly longer&quot; means without a wild type control.

Seven opening events can be discerned from the three traces; they have durations ranging from 4 to 230 ms with a mean of 83.5 ± 99 ms and are followed by complete desensitization concordant with previously published results and are in sharp contrast to the duration of mean open times of the mutants. The new data are shown in Figure 2D. Notice that the time scale for WT is 0.2 s whereas for Q276G and Q276N is 10s and 5s, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3A and others; it is unclear how those SSD experiments were done (e.g. duration of preconditioning, at what pH the reported current was measured, how Imax was obtained, etc).

It describes the methods used to calculate pH50a and pH50ssd.</p><p>“ASIC currents were activated by changing the external solution from a conditioning pH of 7.4 -or any other indicated value- to a more acidic test pH for 5s to 30s depending on the desensitization rate of the channel tested. After activation and complete desensitization –return of the current to the zero value- or after the sustained current reached a plateau, the solution was changed to pH 7.4 or the indicated preconditioning pH for 15 to 30 s, short for non-desensitizing and long for desensitizing mutants. To calculate the pH50a each mutant channel was first activated with solutions in the pH range from 6.9 to 4.5. Lower pH values induced a sustained endogenous current in oocytes. Most channels reached Imax around pH 6.0; peak currents decreased at lower pH. Thus, we used a pH range from no activation to one that induced maximal current for the mutant tested. Channels with pH50a markedly shifted to the right, the range extended to pH 4.5.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Generally, the Discussion section should place the work into a wider context. However, in its present form, the discussion lacks detail and should be expanded to include a more in-depth discussion on previous work (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12947112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17389250), including comments or speculation on mechanisms of desensitization in non-mammalian ASICs (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064854).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the paragraph in the Discussion explaining why mutations in domains different from the Q-valve could affect desensitization and/or permit sustained currents as follows:</p><p>“Overall our results are consistent with previous reports of mutations and modifications of cysteine substitutions in the β1-β2 (Coric et al., 2003) and β11-β12 linkers (Springauf et al., 2011), in the β1 strand forming the lower palm (Cushman et al., 2007; Roy et al., 2013), TM1 (Li et al., 2010a) and even the thumb domain that makes contact with the upper part of TM1 (Krauson and Carattino, 2016). Recent structural and functional data have informed that those regions are the ones that undergo the largest conformational changes, and all are located between the Q-valve and the pore, consistent with transducing conformations to the gate. Hence, experimentally introduced mutations or evolution guided species-specific substitutions in any of those domains can alter desensitization and even enable sustained currents (as indicated in the kinetic schemes of Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This explains why not all channels that have the tried Q276-L415-N416 exhibit identical kinetics of desensitization.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
