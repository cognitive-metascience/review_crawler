While many important functions have been attributed to adiponectin under high-fat diet conditions, little is known about its essential role under regular chow. Employing a mouse model with inducible, acute β-cell ablation, we uncovered an essential role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions to maintain minimal lipid homeostasis. When insulin levels are marginal, adiponectin is critical for insulin signaling, endocytosis, and lipid uptake in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. In the absence of both insulin and adiponectin, severe lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia lead to lethality. In contrast, elevated adiponectin levels improve systemic lipid metabolism in the near absence of insulin. Moreover, adiponectin is sufficient to mitigate local lipotoxicity in pancreatic islets, and it promotes reconstitution of β-cell mass, eventually reinstating glycemic control. We uncovered an essential new role for adiponectin, with major implications for type 1 diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03851.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03851.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03851.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fat tissue is essential for health. Fat cells store energy and release it when it is needed; they also release hormones that are important for the health of our heart and for regulating our metabolism. One of these hormones, adiponectin, helps cells to remove fat molecules from the bloodstream. This allows the body to maintain appropriate cholesterol levels and prevents fatty build-ups from blocking blood vessels, which is associated with heart disease. Adiponectin also helps cells respond to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, and thus helps to prevent diabetes.</p><p>Despite this hormone's important roles in health, mice that lack adiponectin can thrive under normal conditions. Adiponectin becomes essential, however, when blood sugar or fat levels are considerably altered. For example, when mice without adiponectin are fed a high fat-content diet, they become insulin-resistant. Moreover, certain diabetes drugs that boost insulin sensitivity only work if adiponectin is present in the body.</p><p>Adiponectin helps to keep the β-cells that produce insulin alive. In patients with diabetes, β-cells slowly die, and this leads to a poor insulin response and an imbalance in the amount of fats and sugars in the cells. This is toxic to the β-cells; and as more β-cells die, less insulin is produced to control sugar levels, and the condition worsens. Adiponectin appears to protect the β-cells against this vicious cycle, but the details of how it does so are unclear.</p><p>Ye et al. used a mouse model in which β-cells were destroyed to see what adiponectin does when insulin is in short supply. When insulin levels were extremely low, adiponectin was found to help one type of fat tissue absorb fat molecules from the bloodstream, which reduced blood cholesterol levels. It also protects fat cells from being destroyed when insulin levels are low. Ye et al. also found that mice that lack both insulin and adiponectin lose excessive amounts of fat tissue and develop high blood cholesterol levels, which lead to death.</p><p>Increasing adiponectin levels in insulin-deficient mice, however, improves their blood cholesterol levels and protects β-cells from being destroyed. This allows the β-cells to begin regenerating. As the β-cells regenerate, the insulin-deficient mice developed better control over their blood sugar.</p><p>Many people with type-1 diabetes (which is caused by their own immune system destroying their β-cells) currently rely on insulin injections and restricted diets to manage their condition. Ye et al.'s findings might lead to new strategies to restore β-cell production and blood sugar control; as such these findings will have important implications for the management of type-1 diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03851.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03851.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone exerting pleiotropic beneficial effects on metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ye and Scherer, 2013</xref>). Increased circulating adiponectin improves the metabolic flexibility of adipose tissue and confers systemic tolerance to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asterholm and Scherer, 2010</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, adiponectin promotes plasma lipid clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Combs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Qiao et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Paradoxically however, even though many important functions have been attributed to this circulating factor in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shetty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Turer and Scherer, 2012</xref>), adiponectin is not essential for life under normal physiological conditions. Genetic deletion of adiponectin in rodents leads to mild or moderate insulin resistance, which is exacerbated upon high-fat diet challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kubota et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>). Adiponectin is required for PPARγ agonist-mediated improvements in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nawrocki et al., 2006</xref>). Based on many published studies, adiponectin function under normal physiological function is dispensable, and it starts to play a more prominent role under hyperglycemic and, most importantly, dyslipidemic conditions.</p><p>The failure of insulin-producing β-cells is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The ongoing loss of β-cells under these conditions is associated with a failure to effectively regenerate β-cell mass. This can be attributed not only to the low capacity for replication and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bouwens and Rooman, 2005</xref>) but also the detrimental cytotoxic environment that the cells are exposed to due to the dysregulation of the balance between insulin and glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Robertson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Unger and Cherrington, 2012</xref>). Insulin deficiency results in hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, both of which trigger β-cell glucotoxicity and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Poitout and Robertson, 2008</xref>), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fonseca et al., 2009</xref>), and lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kusminski et al., 2009</xref>). Tissue culture data suggested that adiponectin regulates β-cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Holland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rao et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that adiponectin protects β-cells against lipotoxicity and apoptosis, both in cultured cells and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Holland et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we took advantage of the PANIC-ATTAC transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). After extensive β-cell ablation, adiponectin becomes essential for survival. In the context of insulin deficiency, the lack of adiponetin aggravates the lipoatrophy and hyperlipidemia to lethal levels. The critical role of adiponectin in maintaining minimal lipid homeostasis is recapitulated in the streptozotocin-treated (STZ) mouse model. Specifically, adiponectin is required for lipid uptake into subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Under normal conditions, the action of adiponectin can be mediated through enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity and intracellular fatty acid translocation. However, under insulinopenic conditions, the primary adiponectin-mediated effect relies on enhanced insulin sensitivity and endocytic activity. While insulin deficiency and widespread loss of β-cells lead to augmented intracellular lipotoxicity, adiponectin overexpressing mice effectively overcome the resulting intracellular lipotoxicity in β-cells by ameliorating lipid metabolism and thereby paving the way for β-cell mass recovery.</p><p>Our findings reveal a novel role of adiponectin as a housekeeping protein under insulinopenic conditions, and augmentation of adiponectin is sufficient to promote β-cell regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adiponectin is required for minimal lipid homeostasis and survival in PANIC-ATTAC mice</title><p>To investigate the physiological role of adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions, we crossed adiponectin null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nawrocki et al., 2006</xref>) to the homozygous PANIC-ATTAC background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The PANIC-ATTAC transgene allows us to eliminate a defined number of β-cells. Starting with similar β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), 8-week old male homozygous PANIC-ATTACs with adiponectin wild type (<italic>P-Adn</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup>) or knockout (<italic>P-Adn</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) were treated with the same high-dose of dimerizer AP20187 to induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. 2 weeks after the initial dimerizer administration, the insulin positive areas of <italic>P-Adn</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>P-Adn</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice decreased down to &lt;15% of their starting levels and further decreased down to &lt;10% around 10 weeks post β-cell ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Different from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Holland et al., 2011</xref>), we have used a fairly stringent ablation protocol to obtain a very high level of β-cell loss in both genotypes. In this setting, both the <italic>P-Adn</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>P-Adn</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed sustained glucose levels above ∼500 mg/dl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We addressed whether changes in hepatic lipid secretion may be the underlying reason. We treated the mice with the lipoprotein lipase inhibitor tyloxapol (WR-1339) and monitored serum lipid accumulation, a classical test to assess VLDL secretion. Compared to <italic>WT</italic> control mice, adiponectin null mice demonstrated only a minor trend towards an increase in serum triglyceride content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and rate of accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also examined a panel of metabolic gene expression in the livers of STZ-treated <italic>Adn</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Adn</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and observed no significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Insulin regulates fat metabolism in adipocytes by both enhancing FFA uptake and inhibiting lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holm et al., 2000</xref>). Does adiponectin play a role in suppressing lipolysis under conditions of low insulin? To address this question, we administered a low dose of insulin to STZ-treated mice (0.1 mU/g body weight), and measured circulating glycerol levels under these conditions. This small amount of insulin substantially reduced serum glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), while it only minimally affected circulating triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>) and NEFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Intriguingly, compared to <italic>WT</italic> mice, adiponectin null mice were resistant to the action of insulin, with minimal impact on glycerol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This suggests adiponectin is critical for insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis under insulinopenic conditions. The enhanced lipolysis in STZ-treated adiponectin null mice might, at least in part, account for the reduced fat mass seen in the <italic>Adn</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adiponectin is required for lipid uptake specifically in subcutaneous white adipose tissues in STZ-treated mice</title><p>Yet another site of action could be at the level of plasma lipid clearance. We examined whole body and tissue-specific uptake of circulating triglycerides using <sup>3</sup>H-triolein. No apparent differences between <italic>WT</italic> and adiponectin null mice were noted prior to STZ treatment. In contrast, post STZ treatment, adiponectin null mice showed a 39% lower whole body clearance rate of labeled triolein compared to <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among the nine tissues examined, we observed significant differences of triolein uptake only in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT, 50% lower in STZ-treated null mice than in STZ-treated <italic>WT</italic> mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Consistent with a primary site of action on subcutaneous fat pads, we have reported that after long-term high-fat diet exposure, adiponectin promotes preferentially subcutaneous WAT expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asterholm and Scherer, 2010</xref>). We also partitioned the tissue-specific <sup>3</sup>H-triolein uptake into incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) vs oxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The difference in triolein uptake in subcutaneous WAT was primarily the result of a reduced level of incorporation. In agreement with the <sup>3</sup>H-triolein uptake assay, histological analysis of adiponectin knockouts demonstrated a major reduction of adipocyte size in subcutaneous WAT and trends towards smaller cell size in brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, no such reduction was found in gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Compared to the euglycemic wild-type controls, STZ-treated animals showed elevated signals for apolipoproteins. Interestingly, most of the ApoA1 and ApoE signals, as well as part of the ApoB signal, located adjacent to endomucin, a marker for venous and capillary endothelial cells, reflecting apolipoproteins in circulation. The endomucin signal itself demonstrated increased vascular density in subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated lipoatrophic animals, which was also observed in gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3 fig3s4 fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 3–5</xref>). Furthermore, adiponectin knockout-induced ApoA1 accumulation was significant in subcutaneous WAT and BAT, but not in gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Compared to STZ-treated wild-type mice, adiponectin null mice showed trends towards an increase in ApoB signal in both subcutaneous and gonadal WATs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). As for the ApoE signal, there was a trend towards an increase in subcutaneous WAT, but not in gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest an overall accumulation of apolipoproteins in the local circulation of adipose tissues of STZ-treated mice, which is exacerbated by adiponectin depletion predominantly in subcutaneous WAT.</p><p>Insulin promotes lipid storage in adipose tissue via stimulating the intracellular insulin signaling cascades leading to enhanced extracellular lipoprotein lipase activity. A low dose of insulin treatment (0.2 mU/g body weight) markedly suppressed the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) serine-660 phosphorylation, a marker positively associated with lipolysis, by 57% and induced Akt serine-473 phosphorylation by 8.6-fold in subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated wild-type mice. However, STZ-treated adiponectin nulls showed a blunted response in HSL inhibition (41%), and an abolished Akt activation (13%), as compared to the same animal prior to insulin injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The unchanged post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) is unlikely to be a major contributing factor to the impaired lipid uptake in the STZ-treated adiponectin null animals. The fatty acid translocase CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) are also unlikely contributors, both of which show comparable distributions between genotypes. Expression of Scavenger Receptor Class B Member 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, was enhanced in STZ-treated adiponectin knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which could reflect a compensatory response for the HDL accumulation in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03851.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Adiponectin is important for caveolar structures and Caveolin-1 expression in subcutaneous white adipose tissue of STZ-treated mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots of insulin signaling molecules, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, serine 660 phosphorylated and total) and Akt (serine 473 phosphorylated and total) in inguinal subcutaneous WAT. 1 week after STZ treatment, overnight fasted mice were subjected to a tail vein injection of insulin (0.2 mU/g BDW).

In contrast, this upregulation of vesicle density was abolished in the adiponectin nulls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). These changes were consistent with the <sup>3</sup>H-triolein uptake data, which measured the lipid uptake capacity per gram tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Caveolin-1, one of the major components in the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network, was detectable in the majority of subcutaneous adipocytes in wildtype mice after STZ treatment. In contrast, in STZ-treated adiponectin null mice, the caveolin-1 signal was almost completely depleted in subcutaneous adipocytes, and the majority of the signal was associated with the endomucin-positive endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) under those conditions. These changes were not observed in either the euglycemic controls or the gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that under conditions of limited insulin availability, adiponectin plays an important role in potentiating insulin sensitivity, supporting endocytic activity for triglyceride, and promoting lipid storage specifically in subcutaneous WAT.

When insulin levels decrease by &gt;90% after intensive β-cell loss, adiponectin ensures the minimal homeostasis for lipid metabolism. Consistent with insulin action promoting lipid storage in adipose tissue, adiponectin exerts a similar effect on lipid uptake, but does so by distinct mechanisms. First, adiponectin mediates lipid uptake specifically in subcutaneous WAT, but not in epididymal WAT. Hepatic VLDL secretion and fatty acid metabolism are unchanged. Second, adiponectin regulates neither lipoprotein lipase activity under insulinopenic conditions nor the intracellular translocation of fatty acids. Rather, caveolin-1 is reduced, thereby reducing endocytosis of lipids. This is in agreement with our previous reports on caveolin-1 knockout mice, which show significantly lower body weight and fat mass than wild-type controls under both regular chow and high-fat diet regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Razani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, our adiponectin knockout mice with insulin deficiency recapitulate the lipodystrophic phenotypes reported in caveolin-1 null mice, including impaired triglyceride clearance, hyper-triglyceridemia, adipocyte hypotrophy, without a change in lipoprotein lipase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Razani et al., 2002</xref>). Third, adiponectin potentiates insulin signaling and the suppression on lipolysis mediated by the trace levels of insulin present. It is tempting to speculate that adiponectin exerts autocrine/paracrine actions on subcutaneous adipose as a hormone, motivating future studies on signaling pathways and transcriptome/proteome analysis under insulinopenic conditions. The generation of mouse models allowing for conditional elimination of both adiponectin receptors adipoR1 and adipoR2 should be insightful. In cases where both insulin and adiponectin are depleted, fat mass becomes critically low, accompanied by exceedingly high triglycerides and ketone bodies in circulation, resulting in major mortality.</p><p>Our findings also underscore adiponectin as a messenger for the crosstalk between adipose tissue and pancreatic β-cells, especially under insulinopenic conditions. Massive pancreatic β-cell failure leads to hypoinsulinemia and dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dunn, 1992</xref>). The ensuing aggravated lipotoxicity further impairs β-cell function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lupi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kusminski et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that adiponectin can disrupt this vicious cycle at multiple levels and, in so doing, promote potent regenerative effects on functional β-cell mass. Adiponectin improves lipid storage in adipose tissue and improves systemic lipid metabolism. These general improvements in dyslipidemia may contribute, at least in part, to the reduction of β-cell lipotoxicity in the adiponectin overexpressing mouse, as reflected by ceramide measurements. The reduced level of local lipotoxicity may mediate β-cell survival and proliferation. Overexpression of adiponectin is sufficient to regenerate β-cells and regain glycemic control. Taken together, our data highlight the link between lipid metabolism and β-cell maintenance and identify adiponectin as a key mediator of this process. This does not exclude a direct effect of adiponectin on β-cells, since adiponectin is avidly binding to β-cells in vivo and exerts potent cytoprotective effects on β-cells under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Holland et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The major impediments for effective β-cell regeneration may not only relate to the inherently low proliferation rate of β-cells, but also due to the systemic highly lipotoxic environment due to severe hyperlipidemia, both in type 1 diabetes as well as late stage type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments have provided strong evidence that lipotoxicity can impair β-cell function and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Maedler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rakatzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hoppa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Holland et al., 2011</xref>). Unger and colleagues demonstrated in rats that pancreatic islets transplanted into the hepatic portal area were destroyed by the local hyperlipidemic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 2007</xref>) and islets from Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats are subject to lipotoxic destruction via ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shimabukuro et al., 1998</xref>). Poitout and colleagues have established that wild-type islets similarly develop ceramide-induced impairments in islet function under hyperlipidemic/hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kelpe et al., 2003</xref>). In the PANIC-ATTAC model, the prolonged β-cell loss in adiponectin wild-type and adiponectin null mice is unlikely due to prolonged exposure to dimerizer, which has a half-life in mice of ∼5 hr. Rather, this is the result of glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and/or ER stress. In the PANIC-ATTAC islets, we did not detect any differences in oxidative stress and ER stress markers between adiponectin wild-type and transgenic adiponectin overexpressing mice (data not shown). However, we did see differences at the level of lipotoxic intermediates as judged by the results from the islet ceramide assays that revealed a reduction of lipotoxic ceramides as well as their precursors and derivatives. Ultimately, this improved microenvironment allows for increased recovery of islet mass.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were bred and maintained on a 12-hr dark/light cycle, with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and regular chow diet (#5058; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO).

Per 0.2 ml reaction, 10 μl of plasma was incubated with a triglyceride emulsion containing ∼10<sup>7</sup> cpm/ml <sup>3</sup>H-triolein (#NET431001MC; PerkinElmer) at 37°C water bath for 90 min for total lipase activity, or with 1.5 M NaCl for hepatic lipase activity. Reaction was terminated by addition of 3.25 ml methanol:chloroform:heptane (1.41:1.25:1) and 1.05 ml K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (pH 10.5). After vigorous agitation and centrifugation, 1 ml of the NEFA-containing aqueous phase was transferred and assayed for <sup>3</sup>H radioactivity on a scintillation counter. Serial dilutions of a lipoprotein lipase (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng, #L9656; Sigma) were parallel assayed as standard controls, and the lipase activities of plasma samples were calculated as equivalents of the standard lipase. The plasma lipoprotein lipase activity was calculated by subtracting the hepatic lipase activity from the total.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Tissues were processed at the UTSW Electron Microscopy Core Facility.

The membrane was subsequently processed with the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Isolation of pancreatic islets</title><p>Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation following isoflurane anesthesia, and pancreatic islets were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ye et al., 2010b</xref>). Immediately after euthanasia, the major duodenal papilla of the mouse was blocked with a micro bulldog clamp. Ice-cold digestion solution, that is, Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with 0.1 g/l Liberase TL (#05401020001; Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 0.1 g/l DNase I (#10104159001; Roche), 2.5 mM HEPES, 8 mM glucose, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.2–7.4, was inject via the common bile duct into the pancreatic duct. The inflated pancreas was transferred into a scintillation vial with digestion solution on ice. Subsequently, the vial was incubated at 37°C water bath for 25 min and shaken vigorously to disperse the pancreas. The digested content was resuspended with ice-cold HBSS and settled on ice for 2–5 min, and supernatant was removed without disturbing the precipitate. The wash was repeated until the supernatant became clear, and the content was transferred into a 6-cm Petri dish with ice-cold HBSS plus 2.5 mM HEPES, 8 mM glucose, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.2–7.4. Under a dissection microscope, islets of Langerhans were picked with a 200-μl pipette to new dishes until free of exocrine pancreas content. The freshly isolated islets were either frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen followed by −80°C storage for sphingolipid assays, or transferred to culture medium for in vitro insulin secretion assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Sphingolipid quantitation in pancreatic islets</title><p>Frozen mouse pancreatic islet samples (70–130 islets per sample) were homogenized in 0.5 ml aqueous buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 6.8) using a sonic dismembrator system equipped with a 1/8-inch probe. The samples were kept on ice during the homogenization process. 50 μl of the homogenate was taken for protein determination by BCA assay, and the remaining sample was added to 2 ml of organic extraction mixture (isopropanol/ethyl acetate 15:85; vol:vol). Immediately afterward, 20 µl of internal standard solution (diluted 1:4 in ethanol, #LM6005; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added. The mixture was vortexed and sonicated in ultrasonic bath for 10 min at 40°C. The samples were then allowed to reach room temperature and centrifuged at 3500 rpm in Sorvall Legend XTR (#75004521; Thermo Scientific). The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the aqueous phase was re-extracted. Supernatants were combined and evaporated under nitrogen. The dried residue was reconstituted in 200 µl of HPLC solvent B (methanol/formic acid 99:1; vol:vol containing 5 mM ammonium formate) for LC-MS/MS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>In vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion</title><p>The freshly isolated pancreatic islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotics, 8 mM glucose, and 0.2% BSA. 10–15 islets per sample were equilibrated in 1 ml secretion assay buffer (SAB) with 3 mM glucose for 1 hr and then transferred to 1 ml SAB with 3 mM glucose. After 1 hr incubation, 0.15 ml of SAB was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for insulin assay, and islets were transferred to 1 ml SAB with 16 mM glucose. After 1 hr incubation, 0.15 ml of SAB was sampled for insulin assay as previously, and islets were picked into 200 μl of 1 M acetic acid with protease inhibitors (#11836170001; Roche). Islets were subjected to 30 s sonication on ice, and 5 μl of the islet lysate were diluted 1:500 in 1 M acetic acid with protease inhibitors for insulin assay. 20 μl of 10 N NaOH was added to neutralize the remained islet lysate and then mixed with 300 μl of 100% isopropanol. DNA was precipitated after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4°C for 15 min, rinsed briefly with 70% ethanol, and re-suspended in 100 μl 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.5). DNA concentration was determined by SYBR green incorporation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-tailed student's <italic>t</italic> test was applied for all pairwise comparisons.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, two of whom are members of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were in agreement that the work was exciting and potentially of interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. All of the reviewers felt that the discovery of new role for adiponectin is likely to have major impact. At the same time, there was also consensus that the mechanistic aspects of the work could be further developed. Given that the mechanism linking ceramide levels to beta-cell toxicity was previously reported, it seems that a reasonable strategy for revision would be to provide additional insight into the mechanism by which adiponectin is affecting adipocyte lipid uptake.</p><p>Specific suggestions: Cell biology: 1) Just showing the absence of vesicular structures and the loss of caveolin1 does not directly demonstrate that this is the mechanism of disrupted lipid uptake. So far this is correlative data. Do isolated adipocytes from the adiponectin KO/STZ mice or adiponectin KO/PANIC-ATTAC mice show poor uptake in the absence of insulin? Can adiponectin overcome such decreased activity? Are lipids actually in the vesicles that are defective in the experimental mice? Does the caveolin1 KO mouse show the same phenotype?</p><p>2) The studies showing increased ApoA-I staining in adipose tissue require clarification. The authors describe this as increased “lipoprotein” but they measure a single apolipoprotein and provide no information on lipids. There is no data presented showing that lipoproteins per se are increased in the vasculature. Do the authors see evidence of this by EM? ApoA-I is primarily carried on HDL, which does not have a major role in triglyceride delivery to adipose tissue. What about ApoE or ApoB? Is CD36 or SRB-I expression altered?</p><p>Signaling: 1) An important implication of the data is that insulin signaling is amplified by adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions. But there is no data to show p-AKT or other signaling nodes are indeed enhanced by insulin under these conditions. Is it this signaling pathway that is potentiated by adiponectin, or is it the lipolytic machinery that is more receptive to insulin suppression?</p><p>2) Through which receptors is adiponectin acting to mediate these effects? Are the effects of adiponectin on adipose responsiveness to insulin mediated through the classic adiponectin receptors through ceramide regulation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03851.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Cell biology: 1) Just showing the absence of vesicular structures and the loss of caveolin1 does not directly demonstrate that this is the mechanism of disrupted lipid uptake.

Adiponectin KO exhibited significantly lower BODIPY accumulation in adipocytes compared to wildtype controls, while adiponectin transgenic overexpression dramatically increased the lipid uptake <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Although our EM images do not allow us to visualize lipids, caveolin-1 KO mice do indeed recapitulate the lipodystrophic phenotypes including lower body weight and fat mass, impaired triglyceride clearance, hypertriglyceridemia, adipocyte hypotrophy, and no change in lipoprotein lipase activity as demonstrated by our own, previously published papers (Razani et al., JBC, 2002; Wernstedt Asterholm et al., Cell Metabolism, 2012). These reports support the role of caveolin-1 in lipid endocytosis, and are discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The studies showing increased ApoA-I staining in adipose tissue require clarification. The authors describe this as increased “lipoprotein” but they measure a single apolipoprotein and provide no information on lipids. There is no data presented showing that lipoproteins per se are increased in the vasculature. Do the authors see evidence of this by EM? ApoA-I is primarily carried on HDL, which does not have a major role in triglyceride delivery to adipose tissue. What about ApoE or ApoB? Is CD36 or SRB-I expression altered</italic>?</p><p>We performed immunofluorescence and quantitation of ApoB (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3–figure supplement 4</xref>) and ApoE (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplement 5</xref>) to have an overview on the <italic>in situ</italic> distribution of apolipoproteins. In agreement with our observations on ApoA1, adiponectin KO exhibited stronger ApoB and ApoE signals associated with the vasculature marker endomucin compared to wildtype controls. We agree with the reviewer that apolipoproteins are only part of the lipoproteins, and our data on fractionation of circulating lipoproteins show increased triglyceride and cholesterol in VLDL in STZ-treated adiponectin KO relative to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>). The accumulation of apolipoproteins in local vasculature of adipose tissue is consistent with the lipid uptake deficiency in STZ-treated adiponectin KO, and may account for, at least in part, the elevation of VLDL lipid content observed.</p><p>Although we are not able to draw conclusions on vascular lipoproteins from the EM images, as suggested, we have examined the expression of CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and observed no difference. Interestingly, expression of SR-B1 was increased in the subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated adiponectin KO mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which could reflect a compensatory response for the accumulation of HDL component ApoA1 in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Signaling: 1) An important implication of the data is that insulin signaling is amplified by adiponectin under insulinopenic conditions. But there is no data to show p-AKT or other signaling nodes are indeed enhanced by insulin under these conditions. Is it this signaling pathway that is potentiated by adiponectin, or is it the lipolytic machinery that is more receptive to insulin suppression</italic>?</p><p>We have analyzed the molecules downstream of insulin signaling in the subcutaneous WAT of STZ-treated mice (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). To mimic the insulinopenic conditions, mice were stimulated with a low dose of insulin (0.2 mU/g body weight). Akt phosphorylation was evident in wildtype mice, but completely abolished in adiponectin KO, where we also observed a trend towards reduced inhibition of HSL. Therefore, under insulinopenic conditions, adiponectin is required for insulin signaling, and supports the suppression of lipolysis.</p><p><italic>2) Through which receptors is adiponectin acting to mediate these effects? Are the effects of adiponectin on adipose responsiveness to insulin mediated through the classic adiponectin receptors through ceramide regulation</italic>?</p><p>Investigation on the roles of adiponectin receptors awaits conditional knockout mouse models for both adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, to eliminate their compensatory effects on each other. This is discussed in the revised manuscript. The conventional knockout mouse models available in our laboratory result in non-viable double knockouts, with embryonic death between days 12 and 14 (our own unpublished observations).</p><p>Our laboratory has on-going efforts in comprehensive analyses of ceramides and other sphingolipids in multiple tissues under different pathophysiological conditions. We present a comprehensive survey of these lipid species in islets in our revised manuscript; however, we do not have adipose tissue available any more to determine adipocyte sphingolipid content.</p></body></sub-article></article>
