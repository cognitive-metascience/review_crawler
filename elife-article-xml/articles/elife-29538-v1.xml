Elucidating mechanisms underlying ISC activation during regeneration and tumorigenesis can help uncover the underlying principles of intestinal homeostasis and disease including colorectal cancer. Here we show that <italic>miR-31</italic> drives ISC proliferation, and protects ISCs against apoptosis, both during homeostasis and regeneration in response to ionizing radiation injury. Furthermore, <italic>miR-31</italic> has oncogenic properties, promoting intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, <italic>miR-31</italic> acts to balance input from Wnt, BMP, TGFβ signals to coordinate control of intestinal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis. We further find that <italic>miR-31</italic> is regulated by the STAT3 signaling pathway in response to radiation injury. These findings identify <italic>miR-31</italic> as a critical modulator of ISC biology, and a potential therapeutic target for a broad range of intestinal regenerative disorders and cancers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29538.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells lining the inner wall of the gut help to absorb nutrients and to protect the body against harmful microbes and substances. Being on the front line of defense means that these cells often sustain injuries. Specialized cells called intestinal stem cells keep the tissues healthy by replacing the damaged and dying cells.</p><p>The intestinal stem cells can produce copies of themselves and generate precursors of the gut cells. They also have specific mechanism to protect themselves from cell death. These processes are regulated by different signals that are generated by the cell themselves or the neighboring cells. If these processes get out of control, cells can easily be depleted or develop into cancer cells. Until now, it remained unclear how intestinal stem cells can differentiate between and respond to multiple and simultaneous signals.</p><p>It is known that short RNA molecules called microRNA play an important role in the signaling pathways of damaged cells and during cancer development. In the gut, different microRNAs, including <italic>microRNA-31</italic>,help to keep the gut lining intact. However, previous research has shown that bowel cancer cells also contain high amounts of <italic>microRNA-31</italic>.</p><p>To see whether <italic>microRNA-31</italic> plays a role in controlling the signaling systems in intestinal stem cells, Tian, Ma, Lv et al. looked at genetically modified mice that either had too much <italic>microRNA-31</italic> or none. Mice with too much <italic>microRNA-31</italic> produced more intestinal stem cells and were able to better repair any cell damage. Mice without <italic>microRNA-31</italic> gave rise to fewer intestinal stem cellsand had no damage repair, but were able to stop cancer cells in the gut from growing.</p><p>The results showed that <italic>microRNA-31</italic> in intestinal stem cells helps the cells to divide and to protect themselves from cell death. It controlled and balanced the different types of cell signaling by either repressing or activating various signals. When Tian et al. damaged the stem cells using radiation, the cells increased their <italic>microRNA-31</italic> levels as a defense mechanism. This helped the cells to survive and to activate repair mechanisms. Furthermore, Tian et al. discovered that <italic>microRNA-31</italic> can enhance the growth of tumors.</p><p>These results indicate that <italic>microRNA-31</italic> plays an important role both in repairing gut linings and furthering tumor development. A next step will be to see whether cancer cells use <italic>microRNA-31</italic> to protect themselves from chemo- and radiation therapy. This could help scientists find new ways to render cancerous cells more susceptible to existing cancer therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>miR-31</kwd><kwd>intestinal stem cell</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR061474-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andl</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR067273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plikus</surname><given-names>Maksim V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR069653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plikus</surname><given-names>Maksim V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31370830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jinyue</given-names></name><name><surname>Shuai</surname><given-names>Jianwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11675134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jinyue</given-names></name><name><surname>Shuai</surname><given-names>Jianwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81572614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhengquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31271584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhengquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81772984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhengquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>miR-31 drives proliferation of intestinal stem cells, and protects intestinal stem cells against apoptosis both during homeostasis and regeneration in response to ionizing radiation injury, and promotes intestinal tumorigenesis through regulation of multiple signaling pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The intestinal epithelium is one of the most rapidly renewing tissues, undergoing complete turnover in approximately 3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leblond and Walker, 1956</xref>). This rapid turnover protects against insults from bacterial toxins and metabolites, dietary antigens, mutagens, and exposure to DNA damaging agents including irradiation. Upon insult, the rapid intestinal regeneration is particularly important as impaired regeneration can result in epithelial barrier defects that can lead to rapid dehydration and translocation of intestinal microbiota into the bloodstream. The processes of normal tissue turnover and intestinal regeneration are driven by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that reside at the bottom of crypt and generate the precursors for the specialized differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Clevers, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It has been extensively reported that ISC compartment includes two functionally and molecularly distinct stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Clevers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gehart and Clevers, 2015</xref>): The active crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>) and a more dormant, reserve ISC population that reside above the crypt base and exhibit no Wnt pathway activity, also referred as +4 cells due to their position at the crypt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montgomery et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). The CBCs often identified and isolated based on the expression of <italic>Lgr5</italic>, a Wnt target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>). During homeostasis, steady-state proliferation of CBCs is driven by extrinsic niche signals – high canonical Wnt activity promotes CBC self-renewal and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyoshi, 2017</xref>) while BMP signals antagonize it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kosinski et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to the active CBCs, the reserve ISCs represent a slow-cycling population of stem cells that are resistant to high doses of ionizing radiation and appear dispensable for homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yousefi et al., 2016</xref>). These reserve ISCs are identified through <italic>CreERT</italic> knockin reporter alleles at the <italic>Bmi1</italic> and <italic>Hopx</italic> loci, as well as by an <italic>Tert-CreERT</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montgomery et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Reserve ISCs do not have an active Wnt signaling pathway and are refractory to Wnt signals in their resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Although the activity of the BMP pathway has never been directly examined specifically in reserve ISCs, indirect evidence suggests that it may help to promote their dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishimoto et al., 2015</xref>). During epithelial regeneration upon stresses, reserve ISCs give rise to Wnt<sup>high</sup> Lgr5<sup>+</sup> CBCs that generate the precursor cells of the specialized differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it has been documented that Lgr5<italic>-CreERT</italic>- or Bmi1<italic>-CreERT</italic>-marked cells can act as the cells of origin of intestinal cancer in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2009</xref>). However, it remains unclear how ISCs differentially sense and respond to multiple signals under both physiological and pathological conditions, and whether these signals contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><p>MicroRNAs represent a broad class of 18–22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the stability and translation of target mRNAs. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs play important roles in stress-activated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung and Sharp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mendell and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emde and Hornstein, 2014</xref>) and in control of somatic stem cell fate and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gangaraju and Lin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun and Lai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yi and Fuchs, 2011</xref>). Hundreds of microRNAs have been identified in the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>). Global ablation of microRNA activity through genetic deletion of the microRNA processing enzyme <italic>Dicer</italic> demonstrated that microRNAs are critical for homeostasis of intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, numerous reports demonstrate that specific microRNAs play important roles in the complex intestinal immune system and in the epithelium during homeostasis including <italic>miR-155</italic>, <italic>miR-29</italic>, <italic>miR-122</italic>, <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-146a</italic> and <italic>miR-143/145</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Runtsch et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly, <italic>miR-143/145</italic> are essential for intestinal epithelial regeneration after injury, acting non cell-autonomously in sub-epithelial myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chivukula et al., 2014</xref>), indicating potential importance of microRNA activity in intestinal regeneration.</p><p>In the ISC compartment, the function of <italic>miR-31</italic> is of a particular interest, as it becomes overexpressed in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandrés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottonham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) and increases during the progression of inflammation-associated intestinal neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olaru et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that <italic>miR-31</italic> is enriched in mammary stem/progenitor cells, suggesting a potential role in somatic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ibarra et al., 2007</xref>). Here we utilized gain- and loss-of-function mouse models to show that a damage-responsive microRNA, <italic>miR-31</italic> drives proliferative expansion of both active and dormant ISCs, and acts as an oncogene promoting intestinal tumorigenesis in different models. Our findings implicated <italic>miR-31</italic> as a potential high-value therapeutic target for a broad range of intestinal regenerative disorders and cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MiR-31</italic> expression pattern in intestine under physiologIcal and pathological conditions</title><p>Elevated <italic>miR-31</italic> expression has been previously observed in colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandrés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottonham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), however its expression in normal intestinal epithelium, particularly in ISCs, remains unclear. To begin addressing a potential role for <italic>miR-31</italic> in the intestinal epithelium and ISCs, first we examined its expression pattern in intestine. <italic>MiR-31</italic> expression levels are the highest in the Lgr5-GFP<sup>high</sup>crypt base columnar stem cells, intermediate in Lgr5-GFP<sup>low</sup> transit-amplifying cell population and the lowest in Lgr5-GFP<sup>neg</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Higher level of <italic>miR-31</italic> was also found in Hopx<sup>+</sup> reserve ISCs than that in bulk epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), based on isolation with <italic>Hopx-CreERT;mTmG</italic> alleles from mice 15 hr after tamoxifen injection. Consistently, in situ hybridization revealed that <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels are generally higher in the crypts than villi. <italic>MiR-31</italic> is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of intestinal crypt, including stem cells and transit amplifying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we examined <italic>miR-31</italic> expression in response to intestinal injury. Mice were exposed to 12 Gy γ-IR and then <italic>miR-31</italic> expression was examined at various timepoints during the recovery phase. <italic>MiR-31</italic> levels transiently and markedly drop by 24 hours (coincident with full proliferative arrest/DNA damage response), and then sharply upregulated 48 hours post-γ-IR (during initiation of regenerative proliferation from the radioresistant ISCs), and then return to baseline levels within one week (after full recovery) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In situ hybridization reveals <italic>miR-31</italic> expressing cells to be located in the regenerative foci known to exhibit high Lgr5 expression and Wnt pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these data suggest a role for this microRNA in ISC-driven regeneration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29538.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>MiR-31</italic> promotes turnover of intestinal epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic picture of intestinal crypt showing Lgr5<sup>+</sup> CBCs and Hopx<sup>+</sup> cells. qRT-PCR for <italic>miR-31</italic> in Lgr5-GFP<sup>high</sup>, Lgr5-GFP<sup>low</sup>, Lgr5-GFP<sup>neg</sup>, Hopx<sup>-</sup> and Hopx<sup>+</sup> sorted intestinal epithelial cells. n = 4 biological replicates.

Dox treatment of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice for 2 weeks resulted in expansion of intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

The expanded crypts were also found in the <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> duodenum and ileum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The length of intestinal crypts in the control <italic>M2rtTA</italic> mice was not significantly altered at different time points in response to Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).

These results suggest that <italic>miR-31</italic> induction accelerates the conveyer-belt movement of proliferative cells exiting the cell cycle and progressing into the villi to ultimately be shed into the lumen, which could comprise the differentiation of specialized intestinal cell types.</p><p>Next, we examined the consequence of <italic>miR-31</italic> loss in both <italic>miR-31</italic> germline knockout (KO) and <italic>Villin-Cre</italic>-driven intestinal epithelial conditional KO (cKO) mice.

No differences in the body weight and intestinal length were found between control and <italic>miR-31</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>), and the transmission of <italic>miR-31</italic> knockout alleles generally followed Mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Despite this, loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> led to a significant reduction in crypt height with fewer proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C,D</xref>). Interestingly, loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> gave rise to a certain number of apoptotic cells throughout the crypt-villus axis, while apoptotic cells are predominantly presented at the tip of control villi and very rare apoptotic cells are presented in crypt-villus axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C,D</xref>). Deletion of <italic>miR-31</italic> also led to increased numbers of enteroendocrine and Paneth cells, while the number of goblet cells remained unaltered in <italic>miR-31</italic> KO intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>). Moreover, the phenotype of shortened crypts with fewer proliferative cells was also found in cKO intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A,B</xref>). Loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> gave rise to more apoptotic cells in cKO intestinal epithelium, including in cKO crypts, while cleaved-caspase3<sup>+</sup> apoptotic cells were nearly entirely absent from control crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C,D</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>miR-31</italic> loss functions within intestinal epithelium. We further analyzed DNA synthesis and migration of epithelial cells along the crypt-villus axis after a single pulse of BrdU.

Interestingly, we observed that <italic>miR-31</italic> induction via <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> was sufficient to maintain crypt organoid growth and budding in the absence of R-spondin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>) and that the Dox-treated <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> organoids can be normally passaged at least five times, similar to the organoids cultured with R-spondin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).

We analyzed a 2 kb region upstream of the transcription start site of the <italic>miR-31</italic> gene locus for the potential binding sites of transcription factors using the JASPAR database and identified one STAT3 and two NF-κB binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Interestingly, the STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways were shown to be activated in response to γ-IR, evidenced by p-STAT3 and p65 levels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). The activation of the STAT3 pathway occurred mainly in the regenerative foci where <italic>miR-31</italic> is highly induced, while NF-κB was more prominently activated in villi where little <italic>miR-31</italic> is present and not in the regenerative foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This suggested a link between STAT3 activity and <italic>miR-31</italic> upon irradiation. To verify whether active STAT3 signaling could induce <italic>miR-31</italic> expression, mICc12 intestinal epithelial cells were treated with IL-6, a known activator of the STAT3 signaling. Indeed, <italic>miR-31</italic> expression was significantly induced upon IL-6 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), concomitant with the activation of the STAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of STAT3 signaling with Stattic prominently dampened <italic>miR-31</italic> induction response to IL-6 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), and reduced STAT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

Those Lgr5<sup>+</sup> CBC stem cells residing at the base of crypts maintain the proliferative capacity necessary to meet this demands of high-turnover tissue, which is driven by activation of the canonical Wnt pathway, as well as repression of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Clevers, 2010</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kosinski et al., 2007</xref>). Wnt pathway activity and BMP inhibition are believed to be the niche for cycling CBCs. However, it is largely unknown how those Lgr5<sup>+</sup> CBCs integrate the signals of Wnt antagonists and activators of BMP and TGFβ. Here we show that the <italic>miR-31</italic> activates Wnt signaling by directly repressing a cohort of Wnt antagonists <italic>Dkk1</italic>, <italic>Axin1</italic> and <italic>Gsk3b</italic>, and represses BMP/TGFβ signaling by directly inhibiting activators of the pathways, <italic>Smad3</italic>, <italic>Smad4</italic> and <italic>Bmpr1a</italic>, pointing to an important role of <italic>miR-31</italic> acting as a rheostat to integrating niche signals sensed by cycling CBCs. In agreement with this point, our in vivo analysis demonstrated that <italic>miR-31</italic> induction increases the number of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> CBCs whereas <italic>miR-31</italic> deletion reduces CBC frequency. Niche Wnt signals likely originate from sub-epithelial telocytes whose presence is required for CBC activity, and possibly to a lesser extent from Paneth cells, who secrete Wnt ligands but are dispensable for CBC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">San Roman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabiri et al., 2014</xref>). BMP antagonists noggin and gremlin are similarly secreted by sub-mucosal tissues below the crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kosinski et al., 2007</xref>), repressing the BMP signaling in CBCs. Thus, sub-epithelial mesenchyme constitutes an extrinsic niche for cycling ISCs. In contrast to secretory signals from an extrinsic niche, <italic>miR-31</italic> appears to be an intrinsic coordinator of these extrinsic niche signals, supporting canonical Wnt and represses BMP/TGFβ signals within CBCs. Thus, we identify <italic>miR-31</italic> as a cell-autonomous post-transcriptional regulator of the ISC niche, maintaining proliferative capacity of cycling CBC cells. In addition, we also noticed that <italic>miR-31</italic> loss resulted in an increased apoptosis in CBC cells, suggesting the importance of <italic>miR-31</italic> in maintaining cell survival. The molecular mechanism by which <italic>miR-31</italic> protects against apoptosis warrants future study.</p><p>The response to high dose of γ-IR can be separated into two distinct stages. First, within 24 hours, the majority of CBCs die via apoptosis and subsequent mitotic death, caused by residual misrepaired and unrepaired of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hua et al., 2012</xref>). Next, between 24 hours and 4 days after γ-IR, rare surviving CBCs and quiescent reserve ISCs enter the cell cycle and form regenerative foci that produce mitotically active Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells that repair lost epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yousefi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hua et al., 2012</xref>). We assume that reserve ISCs also undergo the same process, although lack of direct evidence. In line with this, <italic>miR-31</italic> is dramatically reduced within the first 24 hours post γ-IR, most likely due to loss of CBCs. Loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> led to an marked increase in apoptosis in both CBCs and +4 cells 2 hours post-γ-IR. Based on our data, we conclude that during the first stage <italic>miR-31</italic> acts as an anti-apoptotic factor, protecting CBCs and reserve ISCs against apoptosis. During the second stage, the surviving stem cells start proliferating to repopulate the depleted intestinal epithelium. The surviving stem cells are relatively damage-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yousefi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ritsma et al., 2014</xref>), a property attributed to their quiescence, a state likely maintained by BMP/TGFβ signaling and inactivation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yousefi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2004</xref>). We show that <italic>miR-31</italic> is prominently induced at the regenerative foci 36 hr post-γ-IR and that <italic>miR-31</italic> activates Wnt, and represses BMP/TGFβ activities. This points to the potential importance of <italic>miR-31</italic> in activating the surviving ISCs. Given BMP/TGFβ inhibiting ability of <italic>miR-31</italic>, we speculate that the homeostatic insensitivity of reserve ISCs to Wnt ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2012</xref>) results from their having active BMP and TGFβ pathways, that must be suppressed for cells to become competent to respond to Wnt ligands. Our findings suggest that <italic>miR-31</italic> functions as an activator of dormant reserve ISCs. We also want to mention that the expression patterns of <italic>Bmi1</italic> and <italic>Hopx</italic> are not specific to +4 position, as both of these transcripts are found non-specifically throughout the crypt base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itzkovitz et al., 2011</xref>). This means that <italic>miR-31</italic>-activated stem cells represent a complex population including +4 cells, surviving Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells, and those TA cells dedifferentiated in response to irradiation. Taken together, our findings suggest that <italic>miR-31</italic> functions as the anti-apoptotic factor in ISCs during the early post-γ-IR stage, and, potentially, serves as the cell-intrinsic activator of surviving ISCs regenerative foci promoting regeneration. Future studies will be needed to comprehensively test this idea.</p><p>Many reports have showed that <italic>miR-31</italic> is overexpressed in CRC tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandrés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottonham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and increases in progressively during progression from normal to inflammatory bowl disease (IBD) to IBD-related neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olaru et al., 2011</xref>). We demonstrate that <italic>miR-31</italic> promotes tumor development using several models, including cancer cells xenografting, AOM- and DSS- induced inflammation-driven tumors, and <italic>Apc</italic>-loss driven tumors, characterized by activated Wnt, and repressed BMP/TGFβ signalings. Indeed, several reports showed that <italic>miR-31</italic> is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandrés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottonham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Wnt signaling is aberrantly up-regulated in CRCs, which due primarily to mutations in the Wnt antagonist <italic>APC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Novellasdemunt et al., 2015</xref>). Our current study suggests that <italic>miR-31</italic> up-regulation might also contribute to Wnt activation in CRCs. In addition, decreased BMP and TGFβ signaling is also often found in CRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellam and Pasche, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardwick et al., 2008</xref>), and can be the consequence of <italic>miR-31</italic> upregulation. As such, our data suggests that <italic>miR-31</italic> acts as the oncogenic microRNA in CRCs. Moreover, tight association between <italic>miR-31</italic> induction and STAT3 pathway activation in intestinal tissues is worth noting. Our molecular data suggest direct activation of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression by STAT3 signaling pathway. Indeed, many reports showed that constitutive activation of STAT3 is frequently detected in primary human colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kusaba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corvinus et al., 2005</xref>) and contributes to invasion, survival, and growth of colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsareva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, our current study suggests a signaling pathway involving STAT3, <italic>miR-31</italic> and WNT/BMP/TGFβ that promotes colorectal tumorigenesis.</p><p>In summary, we propose a model in which <italic>miR-31</italic> functions as a cell-intrinsic master modulator of the intestinal stem cell niche signaling during normal homeostasis, regeneration and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). During homeostasis, <italic>miR-31</italic> functions to integrate niche signals, supporting canonical Wnt activity and represses BMP/TGFβ signaling pathways within cycling CBC stem cells. <italic>MiR-31</italic> is stress inducible and plays an important role in epithelial regeneration. In response to high dose of γ-IR, <italic>miR-31</italic> is markedly induced via STAT3 signaling pathway, and appears capable of regulating the activation state of a population of dormant, radiation resistant reserve ISCs during regeneration. Further, we demonstrate that <italic>miR-31</italic> acts as an oncomiR in promoting tumor growth.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29538.041</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The <italic>miR-31</italic> working model in intestinal epithelial regeneration and tumorigenesis.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29538-fig9-v1"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>All mouse experiment procedures and protocols were evaluated and authorized by the Regulations of Beijing Laboratory Animal Management and strictly followed the guidelines under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Agricultural University (approval number: SKLAB-2011-04-03).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>To generate <italic>TRE-miR-31</italic> transgenic mice, the <italic>mmu-miR-31</italic> sequence was amplified using the following primers: Forward 5’-CTCGGATCCTGTGCATAACTGCCTTCA-3’ (BamHI site was added), and Reverse 5’-CACAAGCTTGAAGTCAGGGCGAGACAGAC-3’ (HindIII site was added), and was inserted into <italic>pTRE2</italic> vector (Clontech) to generate a <italic>pTRE2-miR31</italic> construct. <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> transgenic mice were produced using standard protocols and crossed with <italic>Rosa26-rtTA</italic> mice which harboring the modified reverse tetracycline transactivator (<italic>M2rtTA</italic>) targeted to and under transcriptional control of the Rosa26 locus.

Your article has been evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers find your work of interest but they raise substantial concerns as well. At this moment, these concerns preclude us from accepting the manuscript. If you think however that you can address the comments from the reviewers in a satisfactory and timely manner, we will consider a revised version for another round of reviews.</p><p>Specifically, we urge to use functional readouts rather than relying on changes in marker expression in analyzing the consequences of <italic>miR-31</italic> genetic manipulation on intestinal stem cells. This could possibly be done by in vivo lineage tracing assays and/or by quantified organoid assays. We also urge you to be specific on which part of the intestinal track you are examining: the small intestine, colon or both. As an additional point, you need to be more accurate in detailing the endogenous expression of the <italic>miR-31</italic> together with the short-term and long-term effects of modifying <italic>miR-31</italic> expression on the epithelium using lineage markers, IHC/in-situ hybridization.</p><p>In the individual reviews, you will find other detailed comments that when addressed should improve your manuscript significantly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors make the interesting observation that one microRNA, <italic>miR-31</italic> controls the fate of intestinal stem cells. <italic>miR-31</italic> does so during homeostasis, regeneration and in cancer. It targets both Wnt and BMP signaling, activating Wnt and repressing BMP. The function of <italic>miR-31</italic> is assessed by loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mutant mice.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> – the authors heavily focus on the localization of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells, however they do not show whether this transcript is also expressed in other cell populations in the intestine under normal conditions. For example, is <italic>miR-31</italic> expressed in the +4 stem cell population under normal conditions? A higher magnification of the in situ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1——figure supplement 1A</xref> may help clarify this issue.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-L</xref> – the authors show a decrease in intestine Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>miR-31</italic> deletion mouse model and an increase in the <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression model. However, they do not fully describe the consequences of these changes in stem cell numbers under normal circumstances. Is intestine tissue homeostasis affected? Are there changes in other intestine cell populations (enterocytes, goblet cells, paneth cells, entero-endocrine cells)? The phenotypes of these models under are important to characterize before making conclusions about injury or tumorigenesis. Also, what happens to mice overexpressing <italic>miR-31</italic> for an extended amount time (beyond 2 weeks)? This question is also relevant to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> – to demonstrate that <italic>miR-31</italic> induction is sufficient to maintain organoid growth in the absence of R-spondin, the authors should also perform a cell propagation assay over a period of a few passages.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – the authors claim that <italic>miR-31</italic> plays an oncogenic role in intestinal cancer, however they do not show what happens to the intestine when <italic>miR-31</italic>, itself, is overexpressed for an extended period of time? Is amplification of <italic>miR-31</italic>, itself, oncogenic or just leads to hyperproliferation? This is especially interesting to know if one where to do <italic>miR-31</italic> agonism experiments to induce regeneration during damage or restore barrier function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Tian et al. describes an analysis of the role of <italic>miR-31</italic> in physiological and stress-induced intestinal epithelial proliferation, uncovering a novel role for this miRNA as a cell-autonomous positive regulator of epithelial proliferation in this tissue. These effects correlate with induction of Wnt signaling and repression of TGFb/BMP signaling by <italic>miR-31</italic>. A few targets of <italic>miR-31</italic> that may explain these effects (negative regulators of Wnt signaling and components of the TGF/BMP pathways) were validated. <italic>miR-31</italic> is also shown to be a direct target transcript of STAT and NF-κB transcription factors, which can explain its upregulation in multiple models of intestinal injury. The strength of this study is the analysis of robust gain- and loss-of-function mouse models which convincing support the proposed role for <italic>miR-31</italic> in intestine. Despite the somewhat superficial mechanistic analyses (simply showing regulation of a few targets in the Wnt/TGFb/BMP pathways), the overall findings are significant and, in principle, appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, many aspects of the study are sloppy or poorly described, so major revisions and additional experiments are needed prior to publication, as described in detail below.</p><p>1) The phrase &quot;…<italic>miR-31</italic> is the master modulator of intestinal stem cells…&quot; in the title is hyperbolic and should be toned down (perhaps, &quot;a major modulator&quot; would be more appropriate).</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>: In situ hybridizations require negative controls (ideally <italic>miR-31<sup>-/-</sup></italic> sections).</p><p>3) A better characterization of the <italic>miR-31</italic> transgenic and knockout alleles is needed. For example, in what tissues is the <italic>miR-31</italic> transgene expressed upon Dox administration? Are there any overt phenotypes associated with acute <italic>miR-31</italic> induction or germline <italic>miR-31</italic> deletion?

The images showing BrdU staining in <italic>miR-31<sup>+/-</sup></italic> vs. <italic>miR-31<sup>-/-</sup></italic> crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) do not look overtly different.</p><p>5) The finding of reduced <italic>Hopx</italic>-derived crypts after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) can be fully explained by the finding of increased apoptosis in +4 cells after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This should be acknowledged in the text.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>: Simple growth curves (i.e. cell counts over time) would be preferable to these Ki67 stains of cultured cells. Since these cells are uniformly proliferating, albeit possibly at different rates, they all should be Ki67 positive. In addition, a description of this cell line is needed in the Materials and methods (how was Dox-inducible <italic>miR-31</italic> established in these cells?). Also, what is the &quot;control&quot; condition used in this experiment (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H-I</xref>)? It is unlikely that the same control would be appropriate for anti-<italic>miR-31</italic> and Dox. The former needs a scrambled anti-<italic>miR</italic> and the latter needs untreated cells.</p><p>7) In multiple experiments, &quot;scrambled RNA&quot; is used as a negative control for anti-<italic>miR-31</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>, etc.). The source of the anti-<italic>miR-31</italic> is not described (please add), but it is unlikely that a scrambled RNA molecule would be the appropriate control.

Evidence is presented for <italic>miR-31</italic> modulating Wnt, BMP and TGF-β signaling pathway activity to levels compatible with efficient homeostasis, regeneration and disease in vivo. These findings are proposed to identify <italic>miR-31</italic> as a valuable new therapeutic target for intestinal disease.</p><p>Overall, there are some interesting findings presented that clearly define an important role for <italic>miR-31</italic> in the intestine. However, the major claim that <italic>miR-31</italic> exerts its effects via specifically regulating stem cell activity in vivo is poorly substantiated.</p><p>1) The experiment data are mainly relate to the intestine but there is sporadic inclusion of data from the colon. Analyses should either be extended to include both organs or the focus restricted to only one of them to make it easier for the reader to follow.</p><p>2) In-situ hybridization panels for <italic>miR-31</italic> throughout the manuscript are difficult to interpret and need replacing with much higher resolution images to accurately document the location and relative levels of endogenous <italic>miR-31</italic> expression in the small intestine and colon. Is expression confined to the crypt base (stem cells + Paneth cells) or present throughout the TA compartment Perhaps RNAscope would help here? Intestinal tissue from the <italic>miR-31</italic> null mice should be included as a negative control.</p><p>3) The up-regulation of <italic>miR-31</italic> seems to occur at relatively late phase (4-5 days after damage-induced stress). Is there any reason that it does not express in acute phase despite it apparently being such a critical modulator of epithelial regeneration? Wouldn't you expect rapid induction of expression to effect epithelial repair and establish barrier function?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – where does <italic>miR-31</italic> expression accumulate in the intestinal epithelium following irradiation? Is it uniform across the epithelium in regenerating areas or is it restricted to certain lineages? Again, high quality in-situ hybridization analysis is needed here.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> – why was analysis of the <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression phenotype only conducted after 2 weeks? A detailed time-course with early time-points is needed to determine when the phenotype first presents and in which cell-type (using lineage markers) – is it selectively driven from the stem cell compartment? Any apoptosis apparent following gain/loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression? Any effect on the Paneth cells (important regulators of stem cell activity)?</p><p>6) What happens to the villi in the mice with hyperproliferative crypts? One would assume they increase in length if no additional apoptosis is present at the villus tips. Are the phenotypes observed following modulation of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression consistent throughout the small intestine? Does the length of the intestine/colon change in the various <italic>miR-31</italic> mouse strains?</p><p>7) Why was HCT116 chosen for the in vitro gain/loss of function experiments? Is the phenotype also consistent for other colon cancer cells harboring different mutation spectra (for example APC mutations in place of the β-catenin mutation)?</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref> – the increased movement of crypt cells in the <italic>miR-31</italic> gain/loss experiments is not at all evident to me from the BrdU pulse-chase experiment figure panels. Entire crypt/villus units should be included here to document the more rapid emergence of BrdU-labelled cells onto the villi from the crypts. Do the villi get longer as a result of the enhanced cell migration or is there more apoptosis at the villus tips?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> – the observed increase in Lgr5-driven GFP expression following overexpression of <italic>miR-31</italic> does not necessarily indicate increased stem cell numbers/activity as claimed. If <italic>miR-31</italic> is indeed a potent Wnt enhancer, then overexpression may simply be activating Lgr5 expression (as a Wnt target gene) on non-stem cells. To properly document an increase in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cell activity, in vivo lineage tracing must be performed. One would then expect an increase in the number of long-term tracing units observed or an increase in the organoid forming frequency of isolated crypts or sorted GFPhi cells.</p><p>The increased organoid budding depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> is not very convincing – there appears to be a very modest increase in relation to the observed several fold-increase in putative Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells in vivo. A better way to functionally evaluate the proposed increase in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> Stem cells would have been to sort for EGFPhi cells and to determine their organoid forming capacity in comparison to GFPhi cells isolated from crypts with endogenous <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels.</p><p>Is the increase in apoptosis observed in the organoids following loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression evident in vivo?</p><p>10) What is the <italic>miR-31</italic> loss/gain phenotype in the colon? Any changes to the frequency of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells with tracing/organoid forming capacity?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> – does overexpression of <italic>miR-31</italic> increase the regeneration rate of the small intestine and colon following sub-lethal doses of γ-irradiation? Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells have actually been found to be quite radioresistant (Hua et al., Gastroenterology 2012) and Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells are indispensable for crypt regeneration following irradiation (Metcalfe et al., Cell Stem cell 2014) – these observations argue that Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells are driving crypt regeneration rather than reserve stem cell populations. Considering this, does Lgr5 expression change in response to <italic>miR-31</italic> gain/loss of expression following irradiation?</p><p><italic>Bmi1</italic> has been shown to be expressed throughout the entire crypt (including stem cells) and <italic>Hopx</italic> expression is enriched in the Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cell compartment (Munoz et al., EMBOJ 2012). This should at least be discussed/noted in the manuscript rather than referring to these markers as being irrefutable +4/reserve stem cell markers.</p><p>12) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> – it is very difficult to conclude anything from this <italic>Hopx</italic>-tracing experiment. What are the figure panels meant to be showing? All I can surmise from this is that <italic>Hopx</italic>-derived tracing from the crypt base is absent in <italic>miR-31</italic> null mice, which is to be expected from the increase in apoptosis observed at the crypt base (harboring the <italic>Hopx<sup>+</sup></italic> cells) following irradiation. I don't see how you can conclude that <italic>miR-31</italic> is required for reserve stem cell activity. I think it far more likely that <italic>miR-31</italic> expression is a general proliferation driver proliferation within the crypt, including TA cells which can re-acquire stem cell functions to drive regeneration (see recent papers on plasticity observed within secretory/absorptive progenitors following damage).</p><p>Do <italic>Hopx</italic> expression levels change in response to modulation of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels? Accordingly, does <italic>Hopx</italic>-driven lineage tracing change?</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> – is colonic regeneration following DSS withdrawal accelerated in <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpressing mice?</p><p>14) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> – phenotype needs far better characterization, incorporating a proper time-course. What happens within the epithelium following <italic>miR-31</italic> deletion? Is the phenotype more general TA cell driven or does it originate from within the stem cell compartment? Apoptosis evident as observed with the <italic>miR31</italic> null mice?</p><p>15) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – <italic>Axin2</italic> expression isn't completely abrogated following loss of <italic>miR-31</italic>, so it is not correct to claim that Wnt signaling is absent. Since <italic>Axin2</italic> expression encompasses both the stem cell and TA cell compartments in the crypt, the dramatic down-regulation throughout the crypt supports a more general effect on the entire proliferative crypt compartment rather than selectively on the stem cells.</p><p>I would like to see IHC for β-catenin performed on the intestines of the different <italic>miR-31</italic> mice lines (including an early time-point for the <italic>miR-312</italic> overexpression line) to document the effects on Wnt signaling status (including nuclear β-catenin) on the different crypt/villus compartments.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>/D – Although the effects on Wnt signaling are well documented, I would like to have seen a more unbiased approach towards deciphering the direct result of modulating <italic>miR-31</italic> expression in the intestine – comparative microarray expression profiling of WT vs. <italic>mir-31</italic> null vs. <italic>mir31</italic>-overexpressing crypts would likely have shed additional light onto the pathways being directly regulated by <italic>miR-31</italic>. Such analyses at early time-points would also have indicated which cell types are initially being affected. Better validation in the form of IHC/In-situ analysis of expression changes to Wnt pathway targets (and targets of the BMP/TGF-β pathways) would also have helped to clarify which cells are responding to the changes in <italic>miR-31</italic> expression within the crypts/villi. Are the target genes first changing within the stem cell compartment or is it a more general response? Are similar changes found in both the small intestine and colon?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref> – please accurately quantify the organoid data.</p><p>16) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> – again, a time-course would be helpful here to determine which genes are likely responding directly to <italic>miR-31</italic> expression changes. Since there are obviously working antibodies available for some of the target genes, it would also be nice to see IHC validation of changes occurring in the epithelium in the absence of irradiation. This would document where the changes are taking place within the intestinal epithelium. Are the findings also applicable to the colon?</p><p>17) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> – the tumor-suppressive effect of <italic>miR-31</italic> loss is clear, although not surprising given the proliferative block imposed on the cells. Does increased <italic>miR-31</italic> expression enhance tumor formation in this model? Given the increased expression of <italic>miR-31</italic> expression in human colon tumors, it would be interesting to see the effect of deleting <italic>miR-31</italic> in established mouse intestinal tumors – this would be more indicative of the therapeutic potential of blocking <italic>miR-31</italic> expression.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> – again, why was HCT116 chosen for this experiment.

This could possibly be done by</italic> in vivo <italic>lineage tracing assays and/or by quantified organoid assays.</italic></p><p>As the editors suggested, we first performed new organoid culture assays with control and <italic>TRE-miR31 (miR-31</italic> overexpressing) crypts. Both control and <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice were pretreated with Dox for two weeks. Compared to the controls, <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> crypts gave rise to more budding organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting an increase of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> crypts. In our original manuscript, we showed that deleting <italic>miR-31</italic> within the intestinal epithelium results in a higher frequency of apoptotic organoids and compromised budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Together, our findings strongly support the notion that <italic>miR31</italic> functionally promotes expansion of the ISCs.</p><p>Furthermore, we took advantage of <italic>Lgr5-eGFP-CreERT;R26-LSL-LacZ</italic> mice to perform lineage-tracing assay following 2, 4 and 7 days of <italic>miR-31</italic> induction. It revealed that <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression increases the height of LacZ<sup>+</sup> units at different time points, suggesting it promotes generation of new lineages from Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), From this we conclude that <italic>miR-31</italic> increases Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cell numbers. We also noticed that the number of individual LacZ<sup>+</sup> units derived from Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells is not significantly altered in <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpressing intestine, as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We believe that this observation can be explained by the mosaic and inefficient activation of Cre in the inducible <italic>Lgr5-eGFP-CreERT;R26-LSLLacZ</italic> mouse model and that <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression does not alter its efficiency.</p><p><italic>We also urge you to be specific on which part of the intestinal track you are examining: the small intestine, colon or both.</italic></p><p>This is a great suggestion. For this revision, we decided to focus the manuscript on the role of <italic>miR-31</italic> in small intestine during homeostasis, epithelial regeneration and tumorigenesis. Due to many differences between small intestine and colon, the DSS-treated colon data, while important, likely requires further in-depth investigation. Thus, in order to keep the manuscript focused on the core set of findings in the small intestine, for this revision we opted to remove the colon data.</p><p><italic>As an additional point, you need to be more accurate in detailing the endogenous expression of the miR-31.</italic></p><p>To address this criticism, we performed cell sorting to isolate Lgr5-GFP<sup>high</sup>, Lgr5-GFP<sup>low</sup>, Lgr5-GFP<sup>neg</sup> cell subpopulations using <italic>Lgr5-eGFP-CreERT</italic> mice, and also isolate Hopx<sup>+</sup> and Hopx<sup>-</sup> cells, which is based on <italic>Hopx-CreERT;mTmG</italic> mice 15 hours after Tamoxifen injection. We quantified <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels in isolated cells using qRT-PCR and found that <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels are the highest in the Lgr5-GFP<sup>high</sup> cell population with high progenitor potential, intermediate in Lgr5-GFP<sup>low</sup> transient amplifying progenitor cells and the lowest in Lgr5-GFP<sup>neg</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, higher levels of <italic>miR-31</italic> were also found in Hopx<sup>+</sup> reserve stem cells as compared to Hopx<sup>-</sup> epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we performed <italic>miR-31</italic> in situhybridization. It shows that <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels are generally higher in the crypts than in the villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together with the qRT-PCR results, these findings suggest that <italic>miR-31</italic> is broadly expressed in epithelial cells of the intestinal crypt and peaks inLgr5<sup>high</sup> ISCs.</p><p><italic>Together with the short-term and long-term effects of modifying miR-31 expression on the epithelium using lineage markers, IHC/in-situ hybridization.</italic></p><p>To address this criticism, we examined the effect of <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression on different types of differentiated cells following 2-weeks (short-term) and 1-year (long-term) of Dox induction, respectively. Dox treatment of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice for 2 weeks resulted in (i) proliferative expansion of intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>), (ii) reduction of differentiated cells such as enteroendocrine, goblet and paneth cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and (iii) increase in apoptotic cells at the tip of the <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Surprisingly, sustained <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression for 1 year resulted in very similar phenotypes as the 2-week induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the long-term effects of <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpression are quite similar to its short-term effects.</p><p>Next, we examined the effect of <italic>miR-31</italic> deletion on intestinal development at two weeks, two and eight months of ages. At these different time points, <italic>miR31</italic> deletion also produces consistent intestinal phenotypes that can be summarized as follows:</p><p>i) Deletion of <italic>miR-31</italic> significantly reduces crypt height and causes fewer proliferative cells in the crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>ii) Deletion of <italic>miR-31</italic> induces apoptosis throughout thecrypt-villus axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). At the same time, apoptotic cells were predominantly present at the tips of control villi and very rare apoptotic cells appear in the control crypt-villus axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>).</p><p>iii) Deletion of <italic>miR-31</italic> increases the number of enteroendocrine and Paneth cells, without the significant effect on goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A, B</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the 2-week-old <italic>miR-31</italic> KO mice, 2- and 8-month-old mutant mice exhibit slightly stronger phenotypes in terms of the changes in crypt height and apoptotic cell levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). The mutant phenotypes are quite similar between 2- and 8-month-old animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A, B</xref>).</p><p><italic>In the individual reviews, you will find other detailed comments that when addressed should improve your manuscript significantly.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> – the authors heavily focus on the localization of miR-31 expression in Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells, however they do not show whether this transcript is also expressed in other cell populations in the intestine under normal conditions.

The phenotypes of these models under are important to characterize before making conclusions about injury or tumorigenesis.</italic></p><p>This is an important point! To address it, we first characterized the phenotypes of <italic>miR-31</italic> overexpressing transgenic mice. Our findings were summarized below:</p><p>i) Following 2-week Dox induction, <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice exhibited a significant reduction in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and their intestines were moderately, but significantly shorter than in controls (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</italic></p><p>ii) <italic>miR-31</italic> induction resulted in expansion of intestinal crypts with more proliferative cells (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref></italic>). Also, more apoptotic cells were detected at the tips of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting enhanced epithelial cell turnover. However, the length of villi was mildly reduced in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice, and the length of crypt/villus was not significantly altered in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice, as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>iii) We pulse-chased epithelial cells along the crypt-villus axis after a single dose of BrdU.

Analyses should either be extended to include both organs or the focus restricted to only one of them to make it easier for the reader to follow.</italic></p><p>We appreciate reviewer’s criticism. Following additional considerations, we made a strategic decision to solely focus our revised manuscript on the role of <italic>miR-31</italic> in small intestine during homeostasis, epithelial regeneration and tumorigenesis. Thus, all colon data has been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) In-situ hybridization panels for miR-31 throughout the manuscript are difficult to interpret and need replacing with much higher resolution images to accurately document the location and relative levels of endogenous miR-31 expression in the small intestine and colon. Is expression confined to the crypt base (stem cells + Paneth cells) or present throughout the TA compartment Perhaps RNAscope would help here? Intestinal tissue from the miR-31 null mice should be included as a negative control.</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included higher magnification images of <italic>miR-31</italic> in situ hybridization under both homeostatic and injury conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>). As the reviewer suggested, we have used <italic>miR-31</italic> KO intestinal sections as negative control. We also used <italic>TRE-miR31 (miR-31</italic> overexpressing) intestinal sections as positive control. The in situ assay reveals that <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels are generally higher in the crypts than in the villi and that <italic>miR-31</italic> is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of intestinal crypt, including Lgr5<sup>+</sup> and Hopx<sup>+</sup> stem cells, and transit amplifying cells. These data is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>.</p><p>RNAScope is an excellent method for detecting RNA species at a higher resolution. We have consulted with the company producing these reagents. However, it does not work for mature microRNAs due to its short nucleotide sequence. We thus have to detect <italic>miR-31</italic> expression using traditional digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes (Exiqon) following the manufacturer’s protocol, as well as qRT-PCR.</p><p><italic>3) The up-regulation of miR-31 seems to occur at relatively late phase (4-5 days after damage-induced stress). Is there any reason that it does not express in acute phase despite it apparently being such a critical modulator of epithelial regeneration? Wouldn't you expect rapid induction of expression to effect epithelial repair and establish barrier function?</italic></p><p>In response to DSS treatment, <italic>miR-31</italic> level is continuously upregulated with time, while it is not significantly changed within the first 24 hours. In our original manuscript, we have shown that <italic>miR-31</italic> is regulated by both NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways, which are important inflammation signals. We believe that those inflammation signals are not activated within 24 hours after DSS treatment, resulting in no significant change of <italic>miR-31</italic> level. Considering the revised manuscript focuses on the role of <italic>miR-31</italic> in small intestine, we have removed the colon data.</p><p>Following 12 Gy γ-IR, <italic>miR-31</italic> levels transiently and markedly drop by 24 hours (full proliferative arrest/DNA damage response) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and then sharply upregulated 48 hours post-γ-IR (during initiation of regenerative proliferation from radioresistant ISCs), returning to baseline levels within one week (after full recovery) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We believe that reduction in <italic>miR-31</italic> levels during early phase results from severe loss of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells. Indeed, most Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells, that highly express <italic>miR-31</italic>, were depleted within 24 hours following 12 Gy γ-IR. However, between 24 to 48 hours post-IR <italic>miR-31</italic> becomes markedly upregulated, and this coincides with the <italic>miR-31</italic> promoter activation by STAT3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We hope that this clarifies the causes behind the observed <italic>miR-31</italic> dynamics.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – where does miR-31 expression accumulate in the intestinal epithelium following irradiation? Is it uniform across the epithelium in regenerating areas or is it restricted to certain lineages?

It revealed that the heights of intestinal crypts in the control <italic>M2rtTA</italic> mice were not significantly altered at different time points in response to Dox treatment. In contrast, crypts were significantly expanded in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice following 14 days of Dox treatment, and the height of expanded crypts stabilized and was maintained for up to 1 year upon continuous Dox induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-E</xref>). Given that crypt elongation reached it maximum levels within 2-weeks of Dox induction, we thus conducted most of the subsequent assays at this timepoint.</p><p><italic>A detailed time-course with early time-points is needed to determine when the phenotype first presents and in which cell-type (using lineage markers) – is it selectively driven from the stem cell compartment?</italic></p><p>To address this question, we characterized the phenotypes of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice following 7, 10 and 14 days of Dox induction. No apparent phenotypes were found in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice following 7-day Dox induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, E</xref>). The phenotype of crypt expansion started presenting in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice after 10 days of Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, E</xref>). Next, we examined various differentiated cells using lineage markers and found that the numbers of Paneth cells in the crypts were prominently reduced, while goblet and enteroenderocrine cells reduced mildly, yet significantly in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>).

Based on the above findings, we conclude that the effect of <italic>miR-31</italic> induction on intestine is extensive, and not restricted to Lgr5<sup>+</sup> ISCs only.</p><p><italic>Any apoptosis apparent following gain/loss of miR-31 expression?</italic></p><p>To address this question, we performed immunohistochemistry for cleaved Caspase 3 in intestine from both <italic>miR-31</italic> KO and <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice. We found that loss of <italic>miR-31</italic> gave rise to a certain number of apoptotic cells throughout <italic>miR-31</italic> KO crypt-villus axis, while apoptotic cells are predominantly presented at the tip of control villi and very rare apoptotic cells are presented in crypt-villus axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). Consistently, we also found that conditional deletion of <italic>miR-31</italic> gave rise to a certain number of apoptotic cells in cKO crypt-villus axis, particular in the crypt region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C, D</xref>), while only rare cleaved-caspase3<sup>+</sup> apoptotic cells were found in control crypts, and apoptotic cells was also mainly located at the tip of control villi. Morphometric analysis revealed that ectopic apoptosis was mainly restricted to the CBC cells of cKO crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). By contrast, more apoptotic cells were found at the tip of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> villi as compared to controls, while no significant change were found for apoptotic cells throughout crypt-villus axis between both control and <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Conversely, more Paneth cells were found in <italic>miR-31</italic> KO intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A, B</xref>). Considering that the Paneth cells were thought to be the niche of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells (Sato et al., 2011), the reduction of Paneth cells is contrary to the increased number of Lgr5<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice. Thus, we do not believe that the expansion of intestinal stem cells in <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice is dependent on the niche signals from Paneth cells. This also brings up recent findings that conclusively show that Paneth cells are not actually important regulators of ISC activity or a critical source of Wnt ligands, as Paneth cell ablation, or ablation of Wnt production in all epithelial cells (via porcupine deletion) has no adverse effect on ISCs (Durand et al., 2012) (Kim et al., 2012) (Aoki et al., 2016) (San Roman et al., 2014).</p><p><italic>6) What happens to the villi in the mice with hyperproliferative crypts?

The mutation in HCT116 cells (deletion of codon 45) results in loss of highly conserved serine residues in the region of the protein that may be a target for the enzyme GSK3β. However, prior works showed that Wnt activity in HCT116 cells is regulated by both Gsk3β (Kaler et al., 2009), and Wnt3a (Wu et al., 2012) (Voloshanenko et al., 2013). Thus, although heterozygous for β-Catenin mutation, HCT116 cells are still responsive to Wnt signaling modulation, rather than having Wnt pathway constitutively and highly active.</p><p>For these three reasons, we believe that HCT116 cell line is suitable for studying <italic>miR-31</italic> functions.</p><p><italic>Is the phenotype also consistent for other colon cancer cells harboring different mutation spectra (for example APC mutations in place of the β-catenin mutation)?</italic></p><p>To address whether <italic>miR-31</italic> also functions in APC mutated cells, we examined the effect of <italic>miR-31</italic> mimics and the inhibitor on LOVO colorectal cancer cells.

Since there are obviously working antibodies available for some of the target genes, it would also be nice to see IHC validation of changes occurring in the epithelium in the absence of irradiation. This would document where the changes are taking place within the intestinal epithelium. Are the findings also applicable to the colon?</italic> </p><p>To address this question, we have carefully performed immunohistochemistry for <italic>miR-31</italic> target genes such as Dkk1, Axin1, Gsk3β and Bmpr1a in intestines from <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice following 7 and 14 days of Dox induction during homeostasis. No apparent phenotype is present in the <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice following 7-day Dox induction. However, we found that the target genes are prominently reduced in intestinal crypts of <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice at 7-day time point, and that these changes persist at 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Conversely, these genes are generally upregulated in <italic>miR31<sup>-/-</sup></italic> intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). No apparent difference of these genes was found in intestinal villi from <italic>M2rtTA</italic> and <italic>TRE-miR31</italic> mice, as well as control and <italic>miR-31</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>). The results suggest that these target genes are primarily responded to <italic>miR-31</italic> expression changes within intestinal crypts, which is consistent to higher expression level of <italic>miR-31</italic> in crypts. Together, these findings support the notion that the above genes are the direct targets of <italic>miR-31</italic>. To further confirm this notion, we performed RNA crosslinking, immunoprecipitation, and RT-PCR (CLIP-PCR) assays with Ago2 antibodies. The results show that transcripts of <italic>Axin1, Dkk1, Gsk3</italic>β, <italic>Smad3, Smad4</italic> and <italic>Bmpr1a</italic> are highly enriched in Ago2 immunoprecipitates, and that increasing <italic>miR-31</italic> activity augments their enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), providing evidence that <italic>miR-31</italic> directly binds to these transcripts.

We agree with the reviewer that it would be very interesting to investigate <italic>miR-31</italic> expression levels according to therapeutic status. However, human inflamed intestinal tissues and their corresponding inflammation-suppressed ones are not available to us using our resource (we attempted, unsuccessfully, to collaborate with local clinical researchers).
