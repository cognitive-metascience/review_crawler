According to two-stage accounts, memory traces are gradually translocated from hippocampus to neocortex during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. Mechanistically, this information transfer is thought to rely on interactions between thalamocortical spindles and hippocampal ripples. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed intracranial and scalp Electroencephalography sleep recordings from pre-surgical epilepsy patients. We first observed a concurrent spindle power increase in hippocampus (HIPP) and neocortex (NC) time-locked to individual hippocampal ripple events. Coherence analysis confirmed elevated levels of hippocampal-neocortical spindle coupling around ripples, with directionality analyses indicating an influence from NC to HIPP. Importantly, these hippocampal-neocortical dynamics were particularly pronounced during long-duration compared to short-duration ripples. Together, our findings reveal a potential mechanism underlying active consolidation, comprising a neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical reactivation loop initiated by the neocortex. This hippocampal-cortical dialogue is mediated by sleep spindles and is enhanced during long-duration hippocampal ripples.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>spindles</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107672/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staresina</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fell</surname><given-names>Juergen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Triggered by (long-duration) hippocampal ripples, spindles facilitate communication between the hipppocampus and neocortex during natural sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Information transfer during sleep is thought to rely on systematic interactions of the cardinal non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>): First, the cortical &lt;1 Hz slow oscillation (SO) opens windows of neuronal excitability and inhibition (up- and down-states, respectively) in cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Isomura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Timofeev, 2011</xref>).

SW-Rs are transient network oscillations in the hippocampal CA1 subfield emerging from recurrent interactions within CA3 and consist of a brief 80–200 Hz ripple-burst superimposed on a sharp wave, with the latter characterized by a peak frequency of ~3 Hz in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axmacher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Norman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>).

That is, spindles might synchronize the hippocampus (sender) and cortical target sites (receiver) during reactivation events and thereby induce synaptic changes in neocortex for long-term storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sejnowski and Destexhe, 2000</xref>).

In HIPP, we found an extended cluster of significant power increases encompassing two distinct components (p=0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): First, an increase in spindle power (12–18 Hz), peaking at ~300 ms after SW-Rs.

The concurrent spindle power increase in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) around HIPP SW-R might indicate a role of spindles in mediating cortical-hippocampal communication (see next section).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hippocampal and neocortical spindle activity coincides during SW-Rs.</title><p>Statistical maps (t-values) contrasting ripple-locked vs. control TFRs within HIPP (<bold>A</bold>) and NC (<bold>B</bold>).

Conversely, ~17% and 22% of HIPP ripples exhibited an overlap with NC and HIPP sleep spindles, respectively (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). This highlights that only a fraction spindles coincides with HIPP ripples, raising the interesting question whether the remainder of spindles might serve different functions. That said, the precise numbers of event overlap depend on the detection thresholds for spindles and ripples and, for the latter, might have been reduced by the exclusion of physiological ripples coinciding with artifactual, epileptic activity. Moreover, it is likely that a certain amount of NC spindles overlap with ripples emerging in parts of HIPP not captured by our chosen contact.</p><p>While theoretical and empirical work also implicates SOs/slow-waves in the hippocampal-neocortical dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maingret et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sejnowski and Destexhe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>), our ripple-locked TFR analyses revealed no significant effect at ~1 Hz. However, this might result from our control procedure, which extracts matched NREM epochs without HIPP SW-Rs. That is, the prevalence of SOs throughout NREM sleep (and thus also in control epochs) might obscure SO-related effects aligned to SW-Rs. Corroborating this notion, comparing ripple-locked and NREM control event TFRs with control events from REM sleep confirmed a significant global increase in SO power (1–1.5 Hz) during NREM both in NC and HIPP (ripple-locked vs. REM control events: t<sub>(3617)</sub> &gt; 11.441, p&lt;0.001; NREM control vs. REM control events: t<sub>(3974)</sub> &gt; 54.177, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). No difference was seen between ripple-locked events and NREM control events (t<sub>(3747)</sub> &lt; 1.559, p&gt;0.118). These results suggest that any clustering of SOs around hippocampal ripples might be concealed by the strong prevalence of SOs throughout NREM sleep. That said, these results might also indicate that SOs do not mediate hippocampal-cortical interactions around ripples directly, but indirectly by coordinating sleep spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, a recent human iEEG study showed that coupling between prefrontal cortex spindles and medial temporal lobe ripples was greater when prefrontal spindles were nested in the up-state of concomitant SOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, spindle coupling between neocortex and hippocampus was found to be increased at particular SO-phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2020</xref>). This coordinating role of SOs notwithstanding, our results emphasize that spindles group around hippocampal ripples above and beyond background NREM spindle activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cortical-hippocampal spindle coupling around SW-Rs</title><p>Next, we asked whether the cross-regional co-activation in the spindle band around HIPP SW-Rs may indeed reflect an increase in functional coupling between NC and HIPP. To this end, we calculated ripple-locked spectral coherence between NC and HIPP. Based on the concurrent power increases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, we determined coherence specifically for the observed spindle cluster around SW-Rs (for extended time-frequency resolved coherence analysis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, spindle-band coherence between NC and HIPP was indeed significantly increased compared to control events (z-value = 2.12, p=0.034). Examination of time-resolved 12–16 Hz coherence confirmed a significant increase reaching its maximum shortly after the SW-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Identical results were obtained using amplitude- or phase-based connectivity measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), that is, orthogonalized power correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>) and phase-locking value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>), which validated the robustness of our coherence-based approach (which is impacted by both amplitude and phase) and - more importantly - ruled out any influence of volume conduction or spurious correlations due to a common referencing scheme. Note though that while power correlations and phase-locking are differentially sensitive to amplitude- and phase covariations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>), they are not entirely independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palva and Palva, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siems and Siegel, 2020</xref>).

As a measure of directionality, we used partial directed coherence (PDC). Extending the concept of coherence, that is, an assessment of mutual synchrony based on phase and amplitude, PDC examines the relative timing of these features between two regions of interest. This approach allows quantifying whether the current state of a target region may be influenced by the past of the other region by taking into account the predictive information of both, the past of the other region and the past of the target region itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baccalá and Sameshima, 2001</xref>). Calculating PDC again for the cluster of concurrent HIPP-NC spindle power increase around SW-Rs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; for extended time-frequency resolved PDC analysis see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) revealed an increase in directional influence primarily from neocortex to the hippocampus in comparison to control events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, z = 4.76, p&lt;0.001). The inverse directionality (HIPP - &gt; NC) was diminished around SW-Rs in comparison to control events (z = −3.17, p=0.002). The direct comparison of the directional influence between cortical and hippocampal spindles revealed an almost two-fold influence of neocortical spindles on hippocampal spindles than vice versa. Inspecting the temporal dynamics of PDC within the spindle range suggests that the top-down influence sets in before the occurrence of HIPP SW-Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To further pinpoint the origin of the directional influence of NC on HIPP spindles, we extracted the onset latencies of discrete spindles in both regions with respect to HIPP SW-Rs. Note that while the TFR analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> highlighted significant increases in amplitude, this analysis is particularly geared toward discrete spindle events obtained via algorithmic detection methods. One advantage of this approach is that it bypasses some of the temporal ambiguities of TFRs due to filter smearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iemi et al., 2017</xref>). The histograms of spindle onset times with respect to hippocampal ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) revealed a maximum (significantly increased in comparison to control events) in both regions before the SW-Rs. Importantly though, this maximum occurred from −250 to −200 ms prior to the hippocampal ripple in NC and from −100 to −50 ms prior to the ripple in HIPP. Together, these results suggest a directional influence of NC spindles on HIPP spindles prior to the SW-R. It deserves explicit mention though that conclusive evidence for a driving or causal role of NC spindles would require experimental perturbation of the system. Therefore, interpretive caution is warranted for results from directional connectivity analyses as employed here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hippocampal-neocortical coupling emerges preferentially during long-duration ripples</title><p>Our study is guided by the tacit assumption that ripple-locked hippocampal-neocortical interactions are instrumental for memory consolidation. However, without an explicit pre-sleep learning and post-sleep testing component, this assumption is rather conjectural. Interestingly though, while the critical role of ripples for memory-related processes has been established in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>), a recent study further demonstrated that longer-duration ripples bear greater relevance for memory-related processes than short-duration ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). That is, replay of newly encoded information was associated with longer duration ripples and experimental ripple prolongation or perturbation of the late ripple component enhanced or diminished memory performance, respectively. We therefore reasoned that if our results reflect hippocampal-neocortical interactions in service of memory consolidation, they should be more pronounced for longer duration compared to shorter duration hippocampal ripples.</p><p>To assess this possibility, we divided, separately for each patient to ensure matching event numbers, all ripple events into tertiles based on their duration and categorized the first tertile as short-duration and the third tertile as long-duration SW-Rs (mean ± SEM tertile thresholds = 0.046 ± 0.001 s and 0.059 ± 0.002 s for short and long-duration SW-Rs, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Examining the neocortical TFR locked to different-duration hippocampal ripples again revealed a significant increase in spindle power with respect to matched control events, but only for long-duration ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In fact, directly contrasting power values in the joint NC/HIPP spindle cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) around long- vs. short-duration ripples revealed greater NC spindle power during longer ripples (t<sub>(2937)</sub> = 1.76, p=0.039, one-sided independent samples t-test in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). The same held true for the comparison of hippocampal spindle power locked to long- vs. short-duration ripples (t<sub>(2937)</sub> = 4.68, p&lt;0.001, one-tailed). Additionally, we correlated – for each patient separately – ripple duration with spindle power in the joint spindle cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) across events in both NC and HIPP. Resulting correlation values were Fisher z-transformed and tested against zero via a one-sample t-test across patients. Correlation values were reliably positive in both regions (NC: average Spearman r = 0.05, t<sub>(13)</sub> = 2.63, p=0.021; HIPP: average Spearman r = 0.19, t<sub>(13)</sub> = 5.75, p&lt;0.001). Next, we repeated the PDC analyses focusing on the 12–16 Hz spindle band and found the previously observed increase in neocortical to hippocampal information transfer around the SW-Rs, but again only for long- and not short-duration ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cortical-hippocampal communication is enhanced during long ripples.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Top</italic>: histogram of ripple durations pooled across all patients.

According to the ‘active systems consolidation’ framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Born and Wilhelm, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>), sleep spindles are thought to open fine-tuned windows of opportunity for cross-regional synchronization and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Born and Wilhelm, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niethard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seibt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sejnowski and Destexhe, 2000</xref>). Consistent with this notion, recent work has demonstrated increased functional connectivity during sleep spindles across neighboring cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laventure et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings showed an increase in functional BOLD connectivity between hippocampus and neocortex during sleep spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade et al., 2011</xref>). However, none of these studies have linked spindle-mediated connectivity to hippocampal ripples, the putative electrophysiological marker of memory reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kudrimoti et al., 1999</xref>). In rodents, hippocampal ripples have been shown to coincide with spindles in prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>). Similarly, we and others have shown a temporal nesting of SW-Rs within spindles observed in human hippocampus or parahippocampal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). However, it has remained unclear whether hippocampal-neocortical communication indeed increases during hippocampal ripples and what the directional dynamics of such interactions might be. Here, we analyzed EEG data acquired during NREM sleep both in hippocampus (HIPP) and at scalp electrode Cz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the latter integrating across fronto-parietal neocortical (NC) networks. Time-locking the continuous EEG to individual HIPP SW-Rs, we first showed that spindle power (~12–16 Hz) increases not only in HIPP around SW-Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), but also in NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More importantly, using (directional) coherence analyses (and thus moving beyond mere co-occurrences), we were able to show a ripple-locked increase in (directional) NC-HIPP coupling in the spindle band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results dovetail with a recent iEEG study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>, who showed a ripple-locked, driving influence from electrode contacts in PFC to contacts in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in the spindle band. While MTL contacts in that study also included entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex, we here pinpoint the influence from NC directly to posterior hippocampus. Together, these results support the idea that spindles serve as the mechanistic vehicle to synchronize the hippocampus with neocortical target sites at the time of hippocampal memory reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antony et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It deserves explicit mention though that we did not employ a pre-sleep learning task, rendering the notion of hippocampal memory reactivation during SW-Rs rather speculative. That said, recent rodent work demonstrated that specifically long-duration ripples are linked to neural replay and are particularly critical for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). If our observed hippocampal-cortical interactions reflect - at least in part - mnemonic information transfer, they should thus be more pronounced during longer relative to shorter ripples. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we found a selective increase in hippocampal-neocortical communication during long-duration compared to short-duration ripples. Nevertheless, conclusive evidence for memory reactivation would of course require well-designed memory tasks around the sleep recordings.</p><p>An important remaining question is how this hippocampal-neocortical dialogue is initiated in the sleeping brain, that is what governs the interplay between spindles and SW-Rs. One intuitive scenario is that upon spontaneous SW-Rs in HIPP, sleep spindles – projected from the thalamus to both HIPP and NC – synchronize the two regions. Indeed, rodent recordings have shown that prefrontal cortex neurons fire after HIPP neurons during slow wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siapas and Wilson, 1998</xref>), and the stronger the hippocampal firing burst, the more likely a spindle event is to be observed in PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wierzynski et al., 2009</xref>). An alternative scenario, however, is that HIPP-NC interactions are initiated in neocortex, perhaps ensuring that cortical target sites are in a state conducive to plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rothschild, 2019</xref>). Rodent recordings from NC and HIPP have shown that the NC spindles indeed trigger HIPP firing and associated ripples (with NC spindles emerging ~200 ms before HIPP ripples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sirota et al., 2003</xref>) and are prevalent in both regions thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, a recent rodent study showed evidence for a cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop. Engagement of task-relevant NC sites first predicted neural activation patterns of HIPP assemblies by ~200 ms, and activation patterns in HIPP in turn predicted activation in NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>). Our current results show a remarkable overlap with these studies regarding the onset of NC-HIPP coupling relative to HIPP ripples (~200 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), highlighting the role of spindles in synchronizing NC and HIPP prior to SW-Rs. Moreover, we were further able to show a directional influence of NC to HIPP. In particular, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, partial directed coherence (PDC) pointed toward top-down influence from NC to HIPP in the spindle band. Corroborating the PDC analysis, we show that the prevalence of spindle onsets rises significantly in both HIPP and NC prior to ripples, but does so sooner in NC than in HIPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In sum, these results suggest that the spindle-mediated hippocampal-neocortical dialogue is initiated in NC and is sustained for an extended period after the SW-Rs, allowing for the hypothesized transfer of memory traces reactivated during HIPP SW-Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in the rodent study mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>), the authors were also able to bias the NC-HIPP-NC loop experimentally by playing sounds related to wake learning episodes. Specifically, presentation of the sound triggered cortical representations in relevant NC sites, which predicted hippocampal patterns during SW-Rs. The hippocampal signal in turn predicted neocortical activation patterns (although the sound was no longer present). This casts an intriguing light on some recent targeted memory reactivation (TMR) studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiner et al., 2018</xref>). Using multivariate decoding methods on scalp EEG data, these studies indicated two phases of memory-related reinstatement after auditory cues: An initial peak within the first second and another peak at ~2 s after cue onset, with concomitant increases in spindle power around both peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>). In light of the results reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref> and in conjunction with our current findings, one possibility is that hippocampal reactivation occurs between the two cortical spindle/reactivation events. Indeed, examination of NC spindle onsets around HIPP ripples hints toward a biphasic spindle increase (one before and one after the HIPP ripple; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), although the second peak did not reach significance compared to the control events. A recent comprehensive examination of cortical spindles and their temporal alignment to hippocampal ripples showed that spindles in some cortical areas precede hippocampal ripples, whereas spindles in other areas follow them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2019b</xref>). While the pre-ripple spindles may thus reflect a first (coarse) cortical initiation of a reactivation event, post-ripple spindles in other cortical regions might reflect more detailed reinstatement following the hippocampal contribution. In particular, hippocampal reactivation during SW-Rs might enrich the cortically reactivated memory trace with spatio-temporal episodic details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis and Bendor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rothschild, 2019</xref>). This idea is also consistent with a recent TMR study that revealed a cortical spindle refractory period during which the delivery of reminder cues was relatively ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antony et al., 2018</xref>). In other words, hippocampal engagement between two cortical spindles might be dedicated to mnemonic (re)processing, resulting in limited resources for the processing of additional memory cues.</p><p>While our interpretation of results has been largely guided by the active systems consolidation framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>), some of our findings are also consistent with alternative accounts. For instance, in line with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>), a recent rodent study showed that hippocampal SW-Rs trigger synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Norimoto et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, experimental perturbation of ripple activity not only halted synaptic down-regulation but also lead to an impairment of memory consolidation. Accordingly, rather than initiating memory transfer, hippocampal SW-Rs might shape memories, brought online via preceding NC spindles, by pruning irrelevant mnemonic elements. The refined memory trace might then be transferred back to neocortical sites via co-activation in the spindle band.</p><p>To conclude, our findings suggest that – ignited by neocortex - sleep spindles mediate cortical-hippocampal communication around SW-R. However, to what extend this interaction might underlie the reorganization of hippocampal information to neocortical structures for long-term memory or a synaptic down-scaling remains an intriguing open question for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>EEG data from 14 patients (35.4 ± 3.0 years of age, seven females) suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy were analyzed, which were recorded at the Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn.

Accordingly, whenever the difference signal exceeds this threshold a gradient artifact was scored. To identity high-frequency bursts emerging from arousals or movement, the EEG signal was high-pass filtered at 150 Hz and the root mean square (RMS) signal calculated based on a window length of 100 ms. Again, an individual threshold was determined by the median + 4 * interquartile range of the RMS signal and time points were marked as high frequency burst if the RMS signal exceeded the corresponding threshold for at least 100 ms. All detected artifact samples were then padded by ±250 ms. Furthermore, artifact-free intervals shorter than 3 s were also marked as artifacts. The threshold used are based on previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Axmacher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>) and automated detection was followed by a visual inspection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Offline detection of discrete spindle and ripple events</title><p>Discrete spindles and ripples were detected during artifact-free NREM sleep using offline algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>). For spindle detection, the NC- and HIPP-signals were band-pass filtered at 12–16 Hz and the root mean square signal (RMS) was calculated based on a 200 ms windows followed by an additional smoothing with the same window length. A spindle event was identified whenever the smoothed RMS-signal exceed a threshold, defined by the mean plus 1.25 times the standard deviation of the RMS-signal across all NREM data points, for at least 0.4 s but not longer than 3 s. Importantly, time points exceeding an upper threshold determined by the mean RMS-signal plus 5 times its the standard deviation were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stark et al., 2014</xref>). The upward and downward threshold crossings represent the onset and end of a spindle event. Sleep spindles are commonly separated into frontally dominant slow (9–12 Hz) spindles and centro-parietal fast spindles (12–15 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Gennaro and Ferrara, 2003</xref>). Here, we focus on fast spindles, which have been consistently shown to nest SW-Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>) and, specifically in conjunction with SOs, contribute to plastic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niethard et al., 2018</xref>) and sleep-dependent memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ngo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Detection of discrete ripple events in the hippocampal depth recordings followed the same procedure, except that the EEG signal was band-pass filtered from 80 to 120 Hz, encompassing the ripple frequency at ~90 Hz in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bragin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Staba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), and both RMS calculation and smoothing were based on 20 ms windows. Detection and upper cut-off threshold were defined by the mean of the RMS-signal plus 2.5 or 9 times the standard deviation, respectively. Potential ripple events with a duration shorter than 38 ms (corresponding to 3 cycles at 80 Hz) or longer than 500 ms were rejected. Additionally, all ripple events were required to exhibit a minimum of three cycles in the raw EEG signal. For subsequent analysis, all ripple events were segmented into 2 s epochs centered on their positive peak.</p><p>Finally, to ensure that both spindle and ripple events were not caused by spurious broadband power increases but reflect discrete events within our frequency range of interest, we implemented a routine to discard false positives based on their frequency profile. To this end, we calculated a time-frequency representation time-locked to the maximum of each spindle or ripple event (spindles: frequencies from 9 to 19 Hz in 0.5 Hz steps, time window of ±750 ms in 2 ms steps; ripples: frequencies from 65 to 135 Hz in 2 Hz steps, time window of ±100 ms in 2 ms steps) and extracted the frequency profile by averaging along the time dimension from −0.5 to +0.5 s for spindle events or from −0.05 to +0.05 for ripple events. A spindle/ripple event was rejected as a false positive whenever the frequency profile did not exhibit a prominent peak, that is a decline in amplitude on both sides of at least 20% with respect to its maximum value (determined with the prominence output of the MATLAB function ‘findpeaks’), within the frequency range of interest, that is, between 12 and 16 Hz or 80 and 120 Hz, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ripple-free control events</title><p>To statistically assess of the dynamics of spectral power and functional connectivity around sharp-wave ripples, we used carefully matched control events in which no ripples were observed but without any restrictions on the occurrence of sleep spindles (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helfrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klinzing et al., 2016</xref> for a similar approach). One advantage of this procedure is that it avoids the arbitrary decision of what constitutes a proper pre-ripple baseline period. In particular, for each participant’s <italic>n</italic> observed ripple events, we derived <italic>n</italic> non-ripple events, that is artifact-free NREM epochs matching the duration of each individual event including an additional padding of 1.5 s before and after in which our ripple detection algorithm did not indicate the presence of a ripple. Furthermore, to ensure that signal properties are maximally matched between target events and surrogates, control events were only drawn from a 10 min time window before and after the corresponding ripple event. The probability underlying the randomized selection of control events within such a 10 min interval was modulated according to a normal distribution. Epochs once assigned to control events were discarded from subsequent iterations to exclude overlapping non-events. This procedure was repeated 100 times. These 100 sets of matched control events were averaged for power comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), that is each empirical ripple event is paired with one control event averaged across the 100 iterations, allowing for paired t-tests. For connectivity metrics, which are derived across events, the 100 iterations were used to build a control event distribution of 100 values against which to compare the empirical value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Furthermore, it is important to note that the choice of detection criteria influences the absolute number of detected events (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>), which in turn impacts any subsequent analyses. Using matched control events thus mitigates the potential bias by differences in trial numbers and represent a stringent statistical assessment for functional connectivity measures. Visualization of spindle and sharp-wave ripples waveform as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was performed by averaging the EEG signals time-locked to the minimum spindle trough or maximum ripple peak segmented into ±1 s and ±0.5 s epochs, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Time-frequency representations</title><p>Ripple-locked TFRs were calculated on the epoched ripple-events across all patients using Morlet wavelets for frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz with a 0.5 Hz resolution in 20 ms steps. For frequencies ≥ 5 Hz, the number of cycles was set adaptively to half of the corresponding frequency (or rounded up to the next integer value) but at least 5 cycles, resulting in time windows of approximately 500 ms. For frequencies below 5 Hz, that is 1 to 4.5 Hz, cycle numbers were reduced to values ranging from 2 to 4, reducing the window size and thereby increasing availability of artifact-free segments. TFRs on control events were calculated with an identical procedure. Of note, for the <italic>f<sub>Spindle</sub></italic> = 12–16 Hz spindle range, Gaussian-shaped Morlet wavelets are based on <italic>n<sub>cycles</sub></italic> = 6–8 cycles, which corresponds to a temporal resolution of <italic>σ<sub>t</sub></italic>t0.167 s on average (<italic>σ<sub>t</sub></italic>t<italic>n<sub>cycles</sub></italic>/(π · <italic>f<sub>Spindle</sub></italic>)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tallon-Baudry et al., 1996</xref>).

Time-resolved coherence from −1 to +1 centered on ripple events was calculated for frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz using cross-spectral densities from complex time-frequency representations (ft_connectivityanalysis function with method-parameter = ‘coh’ in FieldTrip). Statistical analysis was initially restricted to the concurrent spindle increases in HIPP and NC obtained from the previous TFR analyses, which encompasses a time interval from −220 to 460 ms around the ripple maximum and a frequency range between 11.5 to 18 Hz. To this end, the empirical value for coherence around ripples was obtained by averaging across our window of interest and tested for significance by means of a z-statistics using the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding coherence from the 100 control datasets:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The z-values were than transformed into p-values, with a significance threshold of z-values greater or smaller than +/- 1.96. Furthermore, to illustrate the temporal dynamics of coherence in the spindle range, we first averaged the resulting coherence representation across the frequency dimension from 12 to 16 Hz to obtain a coherence time series and then performed a z-transformation with the corresponding time series from the control data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Partial directed coherence</title><p>To examine directionality in the cortical-hippocampal communication we calculated partial directed coherence (PDC, ft_connectivityanalysis function with method-parameter = ‘pdc’ in Fieldtrip). PDC extends the concept of coherence of mutual synchrony, by decomposing the underlying temporal relationship into a directional influence between the regions of interest, that is, to what extent does the past of NC predict present activity in HIPP and vice versa. The concept of PDC reflects a frequency-domain representation of Granger causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baccalá and Sameshima, 2001</xref>). In order to resolve directionality in time, we computed PDC on complex power spectra obtained on 512 ms long intervals shifted from −1 to +1 s around detected ripple events in 20 ms steps. Subsequently, statistical analyses focused on mean PDC values obtained from the significant cluster reflecting the conjoint spindle increases in HIPP and NC. Again, to illustrate the temporal evolution of PDC in the spindle range, we first extracted the corresponding time series by averaging from 12 to 16 Hz and then calculated a z-score with respect to the control data. Finally, we subtracted the resulting z-scores for the two directions, that is NC driving HIPP minus HIPP driving NC. Thus, positive values indicate a directional influence of neocortical on hippocampal spindle activity and vice versa for negative values. Given the ambiguity of any directional influence in the absence of functional coupling, we restrict display and interpretation of PDC to time/frequency bins exhibiting positive spectral coherence in the preceding analysis. Note that PDC calculations employed here follow a non-parametric approach, that is, they are not based on a previous autoregressive (AR) model of the EEG signals but are directly derived from wavelet-based methods. This approach was chosen due to lacking an a priori hypothesis for the AR order, and more importantly, to base all our analyses on the same wavelet framework.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Amplitude- and phase-based connectivity</title><p>Our examination of mutual and directed connectivity based on spectral and partial directed coherence has the advantage that both rely on the same mathematical framework and thus allow for internally consistent statistical assessments (i.e. PDC informing on the directionality of the observed spectral coherence). Nonetheless, we asked to what extend hippocampal-neocortical communication is mediated by cross-regional amplitude or phase-relationships. To disentangle this, we additionally calculated the power-power correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>) and phase locking value (PLV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>) between HIPP and NC during ripples and control events.</p><p>It is important to note that connectivity measures are prone to volume conduction (despite long distances between regions of interest) or spurious coupling effects introduced by a common reference. To mitigate this concern, we removed signal components exhibiting identical instantaneous phase by orthogonalizing our data before calculating the power-power correlation between HIPP and NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>). More specifically, for each ripple/control event, the complex TFR for NC was orthogonalized with respected to HIPP (NC ⊥ HIPP) and HIPP orthogonalized with respect to NC (HIPP ⊥ NC) prior to computing the absolute power. Next, for each time-frequency point we calculated the correlation between NC and (HIPP ⊥ NC) and between (NC ⊥ HIPP) and HIPP across all trials and averaged both resulting correlation maps.</p><p>Finally, we examined phase-locking between HIPP and NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lachaux et al., 1999</xref>). Based on complex TFRs for frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz and between −1 s and +1 s around ripple/control events, the PLV (ft_connectivityanalysis function with method-parameter = ‘plv’ in Fieldtrip) extracts the phase information and evaluates the variation in phase-difference between HIPP and NC for a given frequency and time point across all ripple and control events, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Peri-event histograms of spindle onsets</title><p>Finally, given our findings on the directional influence between NC- and HIPP-spindles we inspected the timing of spindle onsets within both regions of interest. To this end, we created peri-event histograms (bin size = 50 ms) of the onsets of discrete spindle events time-locked to ripple and control events occurring between −0.5 and +0.5 s. The resulting histograms were normalized by the total number of detected spindle onsets (multiplied by 100). Identical to our previous analyses, statistical comparison with the control data was performed by calculating a z-value with respect to the mean and standard deviation of the control distribution for each region and bin. Note that discrete spindle events may co-occur with more than one SW-R, resulting in multiple inclusion in the peri-event histogram. However, the percentage of such events is ~0.2% and thus negligible.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn (reference number 042/16).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57011-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw EEG data (from NC and HIPP) and all results presented in all figures have been uploaded to the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3HPVR">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3HPVR</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Markus Werkle-Bergner (Reviewer #2); Sara Mednick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. Especially, please note (and address adequately throughout the manuscript) the potential concern w.r.t. to potential overlap/incrementality to other papers the research group has published or is about to publish on these data (see Essential revisions #1 below).</p><p>Overall, this is a timely manuscript exploring an important physiological mechanisms in humans that was so far only demonstrated in animal models. The statistical and signal processing methods are sound. In addition, the manuscript is very well written with a nicely balanced take on the strength and weaknesses of the experimental approach taken. The first description of different effects of short and long ripples in humans constitutes the main novelty of the paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present manuscript, Ngo et al., report an extensive reanalysis of a previously published dataset (Staresina et al., 2015), which collectively suggests that frontal spindles (as measured at scalp electrode Cz) trigger hippocampal activity, which is thought to reflect mnemonic content.

In brief, none of the mentioned studies examined ripple-locked hippocampal-neocortical interactions and none distinguished long- vs. short-duration ripples. In Staresina et al., (2015), we reported ripple-locked intrahippocampal dynamics, but not ripple-locked hippocampal-neocortical interactions. In Cox et al., (2019), we explored phase-amplitude coupling in the continuous (i.e., not event-locked) signal across a wide range of frequencies, regions and across sleep stages. No functional interactions between hippocampus and neocortex were examined and no ripple-locked analysis was conducted. In Cox et al., (2019, 2020), we investigated phase-based communication between hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex, and again cross-frequency coupling was examined in the continuous signal and not locked to ripples.</p><p>We now explicitly highlight these differences to previous publications based on the same dataset in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>Subsection “Participants”:</p><p>“[…] Table 3 lists the MNI coordinates for the included contacts. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Bonn.”</p><p>Note that although the data analyzed here have been used in previously publications, the current study was guided by different questions and all analyses reported here are novel. Specifically, in Staresina et al., (2015) we reported intrahippocampal dynamics between SOs, sleep spindles and ripples, but did not focus on ripple-locked inter-regional dynamics. Cox et al., (2019 and 2020) examined the overall coupling between a wide range of frequencies and regions using phase-based approaches on the continuous signal, rather than on ripple-locked events. In short, none of these previous studies examined functional interactions between hippocampus and neocortex time-locked to SW-Rs, nor the specific role of sleep spindles in mediating these interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors say they use matched surrogate data, and point out a couple of advantages, which may potentially be real.

Note that this is a commonly used approach when examining sleep event-based effects (e.g., Helfrich et al., 2019; Klinzing et al., 2016) and we now make explicit reference to other studies using this approach in the Materials and methods section. In general, we believe that our implementation of this control events approach is particularly well-suited for the current analyses for a number of reasons. First, we designed our algorithm such that for each target event (i.e., ripple), non-overlapping ripple- and artifact-free intervals are detected in close temporal proximity. This ensures that overall signal properties are carefully matched, with the only difference being the presence vs. absence of a hippocampal ripple. It is therefore arguably the most stringent approach to query the role of ripples for hippocampal-cortical dynamics. Second, and specifically for time-frequency based analyses, the control event approach relieves the researcher from the burden of choosing an appropriate pre-event baseline interval, a choice that is usually somewhat arbitrary. Third, basing all analyses on the same set of control events allows us to use a unified statistical framework throughout, i.e., for ripple-locked TFRs (Figure 2) as well as for connectivity analyses (Figure 3).</p><p>Nevertheless, we followed the reviewers’ suggestion and repeated the coherence analyses by constructing a more conventional surrogate distribution. Specifically, we held hippocampal intervals constant but shuffled NC intervals prior to connectivity analysis. This means that HIPP and NC data do not stem from the same time period any longer. This shuffling procedure was repeated 100 times. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> we plot time-frequency resolved coherence time-locked to the detected ripple events (left) and averaged across all repetitions of the shuffled data (middle). Furthermore, we plot, analogous to Figure 3A in our original manuscript, the histogram of the coherence for the shuffled data and the observed NC-HIPP coherence based on the central spindle cluster (right). These results indicate that shuffling the NC-HIPP allocation might render the statistical comparisons in the current data too liberal.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Time-frequency resolved NC-HIPP coherence obtained for observed ripple events (A) and after shuffling the corresponding NC-intervals and averaged across 100 realizations (B).</title><p>(C) HIPP-NC coherence determined for the cluster of concurrent spindle power around HIPP SW-Rs (see Figure 2).

This is now described in more detail in the Materials and methods section. In particular, we generated 100 unique sets of control data, which were either averaged for direct TFR comparison with real events (Figure 2) or retained to build a distribution against which the empirical values were compared. 100 (rather than 1000s of) iterations were used because we wanted to keep the set of ripple-free intervals in each iteration non-overlapping with the other sets.</p></body></sub-article></article>
