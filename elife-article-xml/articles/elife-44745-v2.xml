We found that the transcription factor Hey supervises the identity of differentiated enterocytes (ECs) in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. Lineage tracing established that Hey-deficient ECs are unable to maintain their unique nuclear organization and identity. To supervise cell identity, Hey determines the expression of nuclear lamins, switching from a stem-cell lamin configuration to a differentiated lamin configuration. Moreover, continued Hey expression is required to conserve large-scale nuclear organization. During aging, Hey levels decline, and EC identity and gut homeostasis are impaired, including pathological reprograming and compromised gut integrity. These phenotypes are highly similar to those observed upon acute targeting of Hey or perturbation of lamin expression in ECs in young adults. Indeed, aging phenotypes were suppressed by continued expression of Hey in ECs, suggesting that a Hey-lamin network safeguards nuclear organization and differentiated cell identity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell identity</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>nuclear organization</kwd><kwd>hey</kwd><kwd>lamin</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003973</institution-id><institution>Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>739/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orian</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBF 688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gessler</surname><given-names>Manfered</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Flinkman-Marandy Cancer Research Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orian</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TPA 16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gessler</surname><given-names>Manfered</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hey together with LaminC continuously supervise nuclear organisation and differentiated enterocyte identity, a regulation that is lost upon ageing, resulting in loss of gut homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experiments such as nuclear transfer and reprogramming of differentiated fibroblasts into pluripotent cells (iPS) have changed the classical view of a rigid ‘terminally-differentiated’ cell state to a more plastic one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gurdon, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morris, 2016</xref>), suggesting that once established, differentiated cells must actively maintain their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blau and Baltimore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Natoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bitman-Lotan and Orian, 2018</xref>). Indeed, failure to maintain a differentiated identity is associated withn altered physiological properties of post-mitotic cells and tissues, resulting in disease such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwitalla et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recently it was shown that loss of identity is a hallmark of the aging <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Differentiated cells maintain their identity by multiple mechanisms, including tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) and the control of high-order chromatin structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cobaleda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Natoli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin and Murre, 2013</xref>). Additionally, nuclear lamins are essential in establishing a nuclear organization that is unique to the differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kohwi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015</xref>). These mechanisms likely serve as a barrier against pathological reprograming and are highly relevant to human disease and regenerative medicine. While differentiated cells exhibit distinct chromatin and nuclear organization, the mechanisms by which identity supervisors establish, maintain, and orchestrate these multi-levels of identity regulation are less clear.</p><p>One tissue used to study how differentiated cells maintain their identity in the context of a highly regenerating tissue in vivo is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferate within the adult gut epithelia of both flies and vertebrates to either self-renew or differentiate into mature differentiated gut cells. Differentiated gut cells are characterized by functional diversity and a short lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Neves et al., 2015</xref>). One of the most studied <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut regions is the midgut, which is further divided into sub-regions. While each sub-region has specific characteristics, key regulatory principles are common along the entire midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>). In the midgut epithelium, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) either self-renew or mature into enteroblasts (EBs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>), which in turn differentiate into large absorptive polyploid enterocytes (ECs). A smaller population of ISCs differentiate into secretory enteroendocrine cells (pre-EE and subsequently EEs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beehler-Evans and Micchelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sallé et al., 2017</xref>). As in vertebrates, <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut homeostasis requires extensive signaling between different epithelial gut cells as well as crosstalk with cells in neighboring tissues. Well-conserved signaling pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, EGF, Jak-Stat, and JNK, govern stem cell differentiation and are activated by diverse physiological changes, such as regeneration upon injury or response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>). During aging, gut homeostasis is impaired, resulting in aberrant signaling, loss of EC physiology, and mis-differentiation of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44745.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Hey is required for maintaining EC identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of major <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut cell types.

High levels of Notch activity are required for ISC differentiation and the acquisition of an EC fate. Part of the Notch activity is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved HES (hairy/enhancer of split) and HES-related bHLH-transcription factors. In progenitor cells, HES limits ISC self-renewal and promotes differentiation by inhibiting the expression of the Notch ligand, Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perdigoto et al., 2011</xref>). Here we report that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hey, a HES-related transcription factor, is a critical supervisor of ECs' differentiated identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Housden et al., 2013</xref>). In vertebrates, Hey proteins (Hey1, Hey2, HeyL) regulate cell fate decisions during cardiogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis, as well as within the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes a single Hey protein (CG11194) that is required for embryonic development and larval neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zacharioudaki et al., 2012</xref>). While a wealth of data has accumulated on Hey protein function during development, little is known regarding its function in differentiated cells within adult tissues. We found that Hey supervises the identity of fully differentiated ECs in the adult midgut by continued regulation of nuclear lamins expression. In concert with Lamin C (LamC, <italic>Drosophila</italic> A-type lamin), Hey maintains a nuclear architecture unique to the differentiated ECs. Moreover, misexpression of nuclear lamins in non-relevant cells overrides the endogenous cell identity programs. Remarkably, the level of Hey in ECs decline with aged and forced expression of Hey in aged ECs restores ECs identity, suppressing aging phenotypes. Thus, the continued supervision of chromatin and nuclear organization by Hey is critical for maintaining cell identity, tissue homeostasis, and organismal survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hey is required to maintain the differentiated state of ECs</title><p>Our initial step in assessing the role(s) of Hey in adult intestinal epithelia was to determine the protein expression of endogenous Hey in the gut epithelia cells using an anti-Hey antibody together with cell-specific GFP reporters and cell-specific markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–P</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>).

A third phenotype was the ectopic expression of the Notch ligand Delta, which is normally expressed only in ISCs and immature EE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,J’</xref>). This ectopic Delta expression was observed on the surface of large polyploid cells resembling ECs, in part not expressing <italic>MyoIA</italic>::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I’</xref> and quantified 1J, J’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).

The loss of MyoIA::GFP expression, ectopic Delta expression and overall gut morphology phenotypes were also observed in males, along the entire midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D’</xref>), and were suppressed by over-expression of UAS-Hey, but not by a control transgene, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,C’</xref>).

Using pathway-specific reporter transgenes, we observed that loss of Hey in ECs resulted in hyper-activation of stress and regeneration-related pathways such as JAK/STAT and Notch including in polyploid cells (PPCs) in which these pathways are normally silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref> and see also Figure 6). Thus, we conclude that maintaining EC identity and tissue homeostasis requires continuous Hey expression in ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hey loss in ECs impairs EC identity and progenitor differentiation</title><p>We hypothesized that the above-mentioned phenotypes may originate either from inability of ECs to maintain differentiated identity, and/or due to activation of stress response of ISCs resulting in enlarged progenitors, that fail to fully differentiate into ECs in the absence of Hey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shaw et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to determine the fate of individually targeted ECs and to assess the cellular composition of the gut upon Hey loss in ECs, we used ‘G-TRACE’, a method for lineage tracing of non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2009</xref>). In brief, a UAS-RFP marker is expressed via the EC-specific promoter/driver <italic>MyoAI-</italic>Gal4, which is active only in fully differentiated ECs (red). The same <italic>MyoIA-</italic>Gal4 also drives the expression of a UAS-flipase that induces a recombination event that activates permanent GFP expression, which serves as a ‘history marker’. This GFP ‘history marker’ is expressed in fully differentiated ECs and their progeny regardless of the cell’s current differentiation state. Indeed, <underline>all</underline> ECs in control guts were both RFP and GFP positive (RFP<sup>+</sup>, GFP<sup>+</sup>) and appeared orange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and quantitated in 2F). In contrast, twenty-four and forty-eight hours after Hey targeting in ECs, we observed diverse fluorescence populations of polyploid cells (PPCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, and dynamic analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–A””</xref>): After forty-eight hours 48% of PPCs expressed both RFP<sup>(+)</sup>, and GFP<sup>(+)</sup> (similar to control EC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C1</xref>). 37% expressed only GFP, but not RFP (PPC<sup>GFP(+), RFP(-)</sup> termed PPC**; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>’2). We also observed 11% PPCs that were negative for both RFP and GFP (PPC <sup>GFP(-), RFP(-)</sup>) and were characterized by large, polyploid nuclei (termed PPC*; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>’3). Finally, we detected few (4%) PPCs that were RFP<sup>(+)</sup>, GFP<sup>(-)</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>’4), likely reflecting ECs in which the recombination event did not take place. By the nature of the G-TRACE tracing lineage system we suggest that PPC are highly similar to control ECs, PPC** are former ECs that no-longer express the MyoIA &gt;RFP and are likely former EC that no longer maintain EC identity. Likely PPC* are rapidly developing mis-differentiated progenitors/young PPCs that did not activate the marking system. Using G-TRACE, we further characterized the properties of the different PPCs. We found that PPC** cells as well as PPC* ectopically expressed the ISC marker Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,E’</xref>). Moreover, PPC** did not express the enterocyte founder transcription factor Pdm1, nor they express EC-specific genes like Odd-skipped and Snakeskin, a septate junction-related protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I’</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the overall ploidy of PPCs cells was only minimally affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

For example, Delta, <italic>maelstrom (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>), and <italic>γ-tubulin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K–L</xref>), which are normally repressed by Hey, were ectopically upregulated in polyploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, G’, I and I’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–P</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Bona fide EC-specific genes <italic>pdm1, odd-skipped, snakeskin, MESH, fasciclin,</italic> which require Hey for their expression, exhibited reduced expression (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G,G’</xref> (Pdm1); 2H, H’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M,N</xref> (Odd); 2I, I’ (SSK); 6E, F (MESH); Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (Fas, SSK, Dlg); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These gene signatures are consistent with other studies that depict cell-specific gene profiles of midgut cells and regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Korzelius et al., 2014</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flygut.epfl.ch/expressions">https://flygut.epfl.ch/expressions</ext-link>). Moreover, loss of Hey resulted in the ectopic expression of progenitors and non-gut-related programs such as neurogenesis (12 genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which is exemplified by the ectopic expression of the neuronal marker 22C10 in PPCs* (PPCs <sup>GFP(-) RFP(-)</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1O,P</xref>). Targeting Hey in ECs also effected the cellular composition of the gut and resulted in the emergence of new cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G’</xref>). For example, RecQ4, a Hey-regulated target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), is a DNA helicase that is co-expressed with LamC in fully differentiated ECs but not in ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Following Hey knockdown in ECs, we observed small cells expressing only RecQ4, without LamC but with Delta (RecQ4<sup>(+)</sup>, Delta<sup>(+)</sup>, LamC<sup>(-)</sup>). We also observed that 17% of PPCs are RecQ4<sup>(+)</sup>, Delta<sup>(+)</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G,G’</xref>). These population of cells were not observed in control guts.</p><p>In parallel, we identified a group of Hey-regulated genes in progenitors (predominantly EBs) using an enriched affinity purification protocol. To identify Hey-regulated genes in progenitors, we expressed the CD8-GFP molecule on the surface of progenitors using the Hey-Gal4 (that is expressed predominantly EBs), along with control (UAS-GFP) or UAS-Hey RNAi (see detailed in Materials and methods). This surface labeling enabled us to affinity purify progenitors via CD8 magnetic beads and to compare the gene expression signature of control or Hey RNAi purified progenitors. We observed that three hundred and forty-five genes exhibited Hey-dependent regulation and were involved in progenitor maturation and EB identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found that the expression signature of Hey in ECs is unique and overlaps only minimally with Hey-regulated genes in progenitors with only 10% (40) shared genes, suggesting cell-specific functions of Hey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The transcriptional analysis of Hey-regulated genes in progenitors is consistent with our genetic experiments: upon cell-specific RNAi reduction of Hey in either ISC, EB, or both, the number of ECs declined and many progenitor cells were unable to maintain proper identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, <italic>hey</italic>-deficient clones generated by MARCM did not survive and were likely rapidly outcompeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). In accordance, forced expression of Hey in progenitor cells resulted in the rapid differentiation of progenitors to PPCs, and ectopic endoreplication of <italic>esg</italic>::GFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors together with reduced Delta expression (but not Pdm1 expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E,F</xref> and not shown).</p><p>To identify putative direct transcriptional effects of Hey, we mapped the genomic loci bound by Hey using DamID chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Orian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>). We were unable to generate Dam-Hey transgenic lines, preventing the mapping of Hey-DamID in gut cells. Instead, we performed DamID mapping in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc167c cells. Overall, we identified ~4000 Hey-associated genomic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Hey-bound loci were enriched for non-canonical HES/Hey-related binding motif, which was also shown to be a preferred binding motif for mammalian Hey proteins (CANNTG, e = 5.4×10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heisig et al., 2012</xref>). We found that Hey bound the genomic regions of 32% (127/370) and 35% (127/345) of Hey-regulated genes in ECs and progenitors, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). By comparing Hey-DamID with Hey-regulated genes, we identified distinct sets of putative Hey targets in progenitors and ECs with only 10 shared targets, further supporting cell-specific functions of Hey. Moreover, in each group, about ~70% of Hey-regulated genes that were bound by Hey in DamID required Hey for their expression.

For example, Hey binding was observed in predicted enhancer regions of <italic>delta, pdm1, lamC, lamDm0, broad, γ-tubulin,</italic> and <italic>pointed,</italic> th only residual expression in ISCs a their expression in ECs was shown to be regulated by Hey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>). A detailed analysis of DamID results will be presented elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hey regulates chromatin and nuclear organization of ECs</title><p>At the chromatin level, Hey binding correlated with genomic regions enriched for histone tail modifications associated with gene activation, such as the dual histone marks H3K4me1<sup>+</sup>/H3K27ac<sup>+</sup>, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H4K16ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). In contrast, Hey binding was not correlated with histone marks associated with poised enhancers (H3K4me1<sup>+</sup>/H3K27ac<sup>-</sup>), or silenced chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>; modENCODE, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>, and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smith and Shilatifard, 2014</xref>). Indeed, we found that Hey regulates histone tail modifications associated with gene activation in vivo. In this set of experiments, we used the regional 103–555 Gal4 driver, which is active only in enterocytes within a sub-gut region, while neighboring ECs outside the targeted region served as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). Regional downregulation of Hey reduced the H3K27ac signal only in ECs located within the targeted zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and C’</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar results were also observed upon inactivating Hey using the general EC MyoIA<sup>ts</sup>Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3H–K</xref>). Furthermore, H3K27ac protein levels were reduced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider S2R cells transduced with Hey RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that Hey may be required to maintain H3K27ac.

This methylation is endogenously minimal in differentiated somatic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. The methylated dinucleotides are subsequently detected using 5mCmAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2010</xref>). Only minimal 5mC methylation was detected in control gut ECs (9%, n = 206), but upon Hey knockdown, a significant increase in 5mC was detected in PPCs using immunofluorescence with the 5mC antibody likely (22% n = 406; p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref> and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3G</xref>).</p><p>While Hey proteins are sequence-specific transcription factors that regulate the expression of distinct genes, these observations led us to test whether loss of Hey affected global organization of differentiated EC nuclei. We therefore examined the expression and localization of proteins that are associated with chromatin regions and non-chromatin subnuclear organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–Z</xref> and qauntified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3L</xref>). RNAi-mediated depletion of Hey resulted in impaired expression and distribution of heterochromatin protein 1 c (HP1c), which was no longer localized to the chromocenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). It also resulted in an increased distribution of Nop60B and Coilin, which mark the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–N</xref>). We also observed impairment in the nuclear localization of LSM11 that is associated with the histone locus bodies (HLBs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O,P</xref>). At the nuclear periphery, localization of Mtor, a nuclear envelope component, was distorted. Alongside we observed changes in the expression of nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q–V</xref>). We observed reduced expression of Lamin C and increased expression of LamDm0.

In addition, Hey promotes the expression of EC gene signatures, including Pdm1 and LamC, the latter inhibits the expression of stem cell- and non-gut-related genes in ECs. Hey loss during aging or upon its acute genetic ablation in young midguts, results in ectopic expression of LamDm0 and subsequently silencing of EC programs including critical EC TFs (e.g. Pdm1 and Odd-skipped).

In general, A-type and B-type lamins are co-expressed in many tissues within the same cell, yet form separate filament networks. In the midgut, however, while ISCs and EEs predominantly express the B-type lamin LamDm0, EBs and ECs express the A-type lamin LamC, likely defining a unique nuclear organization in each cell type. Interestingly, a sequential role of lamins in the establishment of facultative heterochromatin was reported in vertebrates. During the development of the mouse retina, early expression of Lamin-B receptor (LBR) is replaced by LamA during later stages of neuronal (rods) differentiation and, accordingly, LBR and LamA reciprocally regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes during myoblast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Solovei et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our study established that in each cell type, the dominant lamin is required in order to inhibit the expression of non-relevant programs. In EBs and differentiated ECs, LamC mediates silencing of non-EC genes. This is likely a conserved role for A/C-type lamins, as human LamA inhibits the transcription of non-adipocyte programs in differentiated adipocytes by binding in the vicinity of TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lund et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, loss of LamC in ECs resulted in ectopic expression of Delta in PPCs<sup>*</sup> as well PPCs**, exemplifying its role in repressing progenitors-related genes. Over-expression of LamC in Hey-targeted ECs was not, however, sufficient to repress ectopic Delta expression (data not shown), suggesting that the repressive activity of LamC may require the presence of Hey or a Hey-regulated protein(s) on these gene regions. Furthermore, silencing of stem cell-related genes in EC likely requires other proteins that may likely be polycomb group proteins (PcG), which are involved in anchoring chromatin to the nuclear lamina and in the generation of facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cesarini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gonzalez-Sandoval and Gasser, 2016</xref>).

Our work using ISC and EB specific markers further established that in progenitors high levels of LamC are present in EBs and only minimal amount is expressed in ISCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cell-specific roles for Hey, gut homeostasis, and the impact of Hey loss during aging</title><p>Hey is highly expressed in EBs where it is required for establishing EB identity and promoting Notch-dependent progenitor differentiation to ECs, similar to other HES proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perdigoto et al., 2011</xref>). Notch activity is not, however, detected in ECs under normal physiological conditions. The observed Notch-reporter activity in PPCs upon Hey targeting in ECs, may reflect stress-increased ISC proliferation and Notch activation in enlarged progenitors. Alternatively, this ectopic activity may suggest that Hey limits Notch activity in ECs. Moreover, targeting <italic>Notch</italic> or <italic>Su(H)</italic> in ECs had no detectable phenotype. The function of Hey in ECs resembles the Notch-independent function of Hey1, that is maintaining pillar cell fate in the organ of Corti and in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doetzlhofer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wöltje et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, while Hey is required for EC and EB identity, it is not required in order to maintain EE identity. Unlike ECs, EEs express predominantly LamDm0 and only minimally express LamC. Thus, the differentiated identity of EEs is independent of Hey and is likely maintained by other mechanisms.</p><p>The phenotypic changes following Hey knockdown are rapid, last for days, and are only partially reversible. In addition, regional targeting experiments showed that the response to targeting Hey in ECs is observed on progenitors adjacent to, but outside of the targeted region. This non-autonomous progenitor response likely involves diffusible factors secreted from PPCs<sup>**</sup> or other gut cells by ligands that induce ISC self-renewal such as unpaired (UPD1, UPD2). Indeed, upon Hey or LamC loss in ECs we observed enhanced activity of a JAK-STAT pathway reporter in progenitor cells as well as in polyploid cells. The regenerative process may similarly involve additional pathways that regulate stem cell regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Foronda et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of Hey, this regenerative response results in abnormal differentiation of progenitors (PPC*). Mis-differentiation was also observed during direct mammalian cell reprogramming, where reprogrammed cells were incapable of fully differentiating and expressed gene signature remnants of previous fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cahan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our study and other reports suggest that differentiated cells have an inherent ability to reactivate de-differentiation, trans-determination, and in some cases, trans-differentiation programs. This propensity, which appears to be a shared property of cells with rapid turnovers, may have resulted from a lack of evolutionary pressure on these cells, or alternatively developed as an advantageous coping mechanism under challenging physiological conditions (e.g. stem cell exhaustion, infection). It was recently shown that under severe stress conditions, polyploid enterocytes evolve into functional stem cells in a process termed amitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lucchetta and Ohlstein, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cell identity, aging, and pathological plasticity</title><p>Loss of identity is a hallmark of aging, and rejuvenating of aged organisms, tissues and cells is a long-standing challenge. The mechanisms involved in regulating the differentiated identity are relevant for premature aging syndromes and aging-related diseases. iPS therapies are currently at the heart of rejuvenation strategies for aged tissues. For example, general, conditional, and transient expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) suppressed cellular and physiological hallmarks of aging and prolonged lifespan in a mouse model of HSPG progeria and premature aging syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Along this line, our study highlights the importance of identity guardians acting within the differentiated cell and preventing aging. We found that changes in aged ECs and in gut tissue are in part preventable and reversible. Thus, the development of strategies supporting the expression and maintaining the functionality of identity supervisors together with gene delivery systems may result in tissue rejuvenation that protects the integrity and physiological properties of both individual cells and the entire tissue.</p><p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate aging, or under various stress conditions, differentiated cells in the gut, pancreas, and tracheal epithelium behave similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biteau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tata and Rajagopal, 2016</xref>), reflecting a general principle. This loss of identity, however, is intimately associated with pathological plasticity, which is highly relevant to a host of maladies including cancer. Thus, at least in some contexts, supervisors of identity such as Hey establish a barrier to tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of nuclear lamins in the differentiated nucleus. Indeed, mutations in human lamins and lamin-binding proteins are associated with heritable diseases and premature aging syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bione et al., 1994</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butin-Israeli et al., 2012</xref>). One well-studied case is that of human LamC ortholog, LamA, which is mutated in Progeria, a disease associated with premature aging and loss of physiological properties of differentiated cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hegele, 2003</xref>). However, further studies are needed in order to link loss of identity and premature aging in progeria models and patients, to the consequences of physiological aging. Therefore, the identification of conserved mechanisms underlying the regulation of identity networks in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> has broad implications for addressing pathological conditions in humans, and specifically age-related diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>Or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td valign="top">w<italic><sup>-</sup></italic>, <italic>Hey</italic>-Gal4, UAS-CD8-GFP/FM7;+;+</td><td valign="top">Orian lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pBac{WH}Hey<italic><sup>f06656</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington</td><td valign="top">#18997</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">P{neoFRT}42D pwn1 P{Car20y}44B/CyO</td><td valign="top">Bloomington</td><td valign="top">#5260</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">yw, hs-flp<italic><sup>122</sup>, Tub-Gal4,Uas-</italic> <break/><italic>GFP, FRT42D Tub-Gal80/Cyo</italic></td><td valign="top">Edgar Bruce lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">y, w<sup>-</sup>, hs-flp<sup>122</sup>, <italic>Tub-Gal4</italic>, <italic>UAS GFP</italic>/+;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

If you are able to address all the main issues raised by the reviewers we may consider a new version as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors investigate the role of Hey, a bHLH transcription factor that is related to the Notch pathway, in differentiation of Enterocytes (EC) cells in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut. Hey appears to play a Notch independent role, in maintaining the differentiation state of ECs. Following a combination of genetics, cell biological and bioinformatics methods, the authors conclude that Hey is crucial in mediating and maintaining EC differentiation (in addition to its context specific role in other cell types of the lineage, i.e. EB cells). The story culminates to the point where Hey regulates a developmental switch in lamins, lamDm0 and lamC, which are expressed in EBs and terminally differentiated ECs respectively. In fact the authors manage to show that:</p><p>a) Lamins appear to share a network of target genes they coregulate with Hey, albeit they do so via a different mechanisms, i.e. by maintaining nuclear architecture as opposed to Hey maintaining Acetylation of histones and</p><p>b) RNAi knockdown or overexpression of lamDm or lamC confirms the directionality of action in the lamins-Hey circuitry.</p><p>The manuscript is full of data, but the organization of the presentation was a bit difficult to follow. Nevertheless, the data are clear and they create new possibilities for future experiments. Indeed, the authors have managed to use existing tools and even make new ones (Hey MARCM stock, Hey Gal4, etc.) that can benefit their future studies as well as the studies of other groups looking into stem cell biology or maintanance of differentiation.</p><p>Major point:</p><p>Can the authors rescue Hey-RNAi phenotypes, such as the reduced survival and leakage of food in the abdominal cavity, by repressing laminDm or overexpressing lamin C?</p><p>Does overexpression of lamDm0 or repression of lamC cause phenotypes like Hey RNAi with regard to gut homeostasis, such as STAT reporters activity, Notch activity, upregulation of Dlg and Arm?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This study by Orian and colleagues examines phenotypic consequences of hey perturbation in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut and transcriptional control by Hey in the midgut and in cell culture. The authors chief conclusions are that (1) Hey is a core terminal transcription factor for maintaining enterocyte identity and that (2) Hey executes this function by remodeling the nuclear architecture of enterocytes via control of lamin switching.</p><p>Overall, I feel that the data presented--although substantial in volume--unfortunately fall far short of providing convincing support for these conclusions. In my view, the revisions necessary to substantiate the authors' claims would be quite a major undertaking.</p><p>My concerns involve what I see as significant issues regarding data interpretation and study design:</p><p>1) Hey acts broadly in multiple cell types, but the study does not offer insight into how Hey achieves cell type-specific regulation. Specifically, Hey is expressed in all midgut cells and has pleiotropic roles in stem cells, enteroblasts, and enterocytes. Without knowing the mechanisms that underlie cell type specificity, I am not sure whether Hey is actually a core transcription factor or merely an accessory co-factor.</p><p>2) A major element of the authors' model is that the switch from LamDm0 to LamC during enterocyte differentiation produces widespread changes in gene expression by promoting different nuclear architectures. However, the study does not include any assessment of nuclear organization, lamina-chromatin association, or other lamin-influenced structural feature for any midgut cell type (either normal or genetically manipulated enterocytes and enteroblasts). As far as I can tell, the authors' conclusions that Hey and LamC &quot;remodel the nuclear architecture&quot; and &quot;determine a nuclear organization that is unique to ECs&quot;, although provocative, are not supported by either direct or indirect evidence.</p><p>3) The datasets that are used to draw conclusions about cell type-specific transcriptional signatures and enhancer activity are not themselves specific to the relevant cell types.</p><p>a) To isolate enteroblasts for microarray analysis (Figure 4A), the authors sort cells for UAS-GFP under control of a GAL4 driver comprising the 3'UTR of hey. They state that this driver is expressed &quot;predominantly&quot; in enteroblasts. However, many Δ-expressing stem cells appear to express hey&gt;GFP (Figure S4A), and many cells that express hey&gt;GFP do not express the enteroblast-specific Notch reporter (Figure S4B). These features raise questions as to the specificity of the &quot;enteroblast&quot; datasets.</p><p>b) Hey enhancer activity is inferred from DamID of cultured Kc167 cells, not of midgut cells. The authors state they were unable to perform DamID in midgut cells (although some precedents do exist: Korzelius et al., 2014, Loza-Coll 2014, Jin 2015, Chen 2018). Given that Hey has different targets in different cell types even within the midgut, it seems tenuous to extrapolate enhancer binding in Kc167 cells to midgut enterocytes.</p><p>4) It is not clear to me that hey-knockdown enterocytes truly &quot;lose their differentiated identity&quot;, as stated by the authors and as would be expected if Hey is a core terminal factor.</p><p>a) Morphologically, the knockdown enterocytes still resemble enterocytes and not any other cell type.</p><p>b) Physiologically, not evidence that enterocytes downregulate digestive enzymes or nutrient transporters or otherwise attenuate their digestive function.</p><p>c) The phenotypic effects of hey knockdown (e.g. elevated JAK-STAT, expression of Notch reporters, loss of H3K27Ac, lamin mis-expression) appear partial, which is inconsistent with the notion that Hey is centrally important. (These partial effects do not appear to correlate with the extent of Myo1A driver activity, as far as I can gauge by co-expression of GFP in the images that are shown.)</p><p>d) Many effects of hey knockdown resemble the well-characterized hallmarks of regeneration and ageing (e.g. elevated JAK-STAT, expression of Notch reporters, disorganization, leakiness). Indeed, I might interpret the hey knockdown phenotype as simply recapitulating the normal enterocyte response to damage and stress-not as wholesale reprogramming of enterocyte identity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The transcription factor Hey and nuclear lamins specify and maintain cell identity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The manuscript went back for review to the previous reviewers but one reviewer was unable to re-review the manuscript. We therefore decided to send it out to another reviewer. Based on the comments of this reviewer we believe that upon making the suggested changes the manuscript may be suitable for publication. However, we would like to see a detailed rebuttal. The new reviewer provides many useful suggestions, particularly on data quantification and on the writing, that should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript of Flint-Brodsly et al. is an exciting manuscript. The authors have improved the flow of the manuscript and strengthened their conclusions, by performing multiple additional experiments, while correcting the phrasing of certain points throughout the manuscript at the same time.</p><p>The manuscript describes the pleiotropic role of Hey TF in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut, focusing mostly on its role in the active maintenance of the differentiated state of the EC cells. The techniques the authors used range from genetic and cell biology experiments to multiple RNAseq and DamID experiments. The authors have addressed this reviewers' remarks.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>A major problem that I have in evaluating this work is the general lack of quantification throughout the manuscript. The adult gut is a very dynamic tissue that responses rapidly to subtle environmental changes. Because of this, it is especially important that careful quantification be performed as it is very rare that any phenotype is black and white. Therefore, while there are some potentially interesting findings (changes in Lamins during differentiation; a role of Hey in EC LamC expression; potential regulatory roles for Lamins in controlling fate genes), it is impossible to judge from the data presented whether the anecdotal images are representative of all guts, all regions of the gut, males or females, etc. Ideally, all data should be rigorously quantified, with data points plotted--not just an average, and compared with appropriate statistics. In particular, the effect on Pdm1 expression of Hey knockdown with Myo1AGal4 looks more subtle than some other phenotypes, which raises the issue of how direct or indirectly certain phenotypes are. Proper quantification of the data will make this more clear.</p><p>Another major issue that I have is that because the RNAi of Hey in ECs generates a proliferative response, many of the effects the authors detect could be secondary due to this. This should be addressed.</p><p>Finally, the paper could be more streamlined to improve readability. There are some things that seem irrelevant and could be removed (Figure 2E', Figure 6S, T). Also, it seems to me that the characterization of the proliferative response in Figure 6 needs to come much earlier in the manuscript as it is important to interpret the rest. The &quot;hyperplasia&quot; is mentioned but not shown then or quantified.</p><p>1) Quantification throughout, n= should be somewhere in legends or figures.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 1B-D. What% of cell types are marked by Hey?</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 1E, E', G, G': How frequent is the large Dl+ cell phenotype. One example is shown- please quantify% of Dl+ cells that are Pdm1+. This phenotype might be linked to the proliferative state of the gut producing more newly made ECs. Their data do not show that the EC which downregulates Hey actually re-expresses Dl. Another hypothesis is that Hey knockdown in ECs triggers stress and activates ISC proliferation, in which conditions ISCs are known to be enlarged (for example upon yki overexpression, see Shaw et al., 2010, Figure 1H-J).</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 1F, F', H, H4- what% of ECs lose Pdm1 staining up Hey RNAi expression compared to controls? Can they co-stain with Hey to see if there is a direct relationship between Hey disappearance and Pdm1 disappearance?</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 2 F, Figure 5I: the n should be put in the figure.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 3 D-G: What% of Dl+ cells express RecQ4 in Myo1A&gt;Hey RNAi and please compare to controls.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 4C, C'; Figure 5A-B- Importantly a control is missing: the same region of guts expressing no RNAi. Due to the regional differences, I am not convinced one can compare across compartment boundaries like in the wing disc. Please add control and quantify% of cells altered for both.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 4D-G: These phenotypes could be due to differences in proliferation between HeyRNAi and wild-type. Newly produced ECs will inherit LacZ and may have more accessible chromatin. What does the LacZ line look like in wild-type MARCM clones that would similarly be proliferative tissue? In any event, these phenotypes need quantification.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 4I-CC; Figure 5G-Q: Please show the% of cells show these phenotypes, compared to controls, with stats.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 6: some quantification must be done here. The effect on MESH looks much stronger than the effect of Hey knockdown, in terms of% of ECs losing Hey. Why is this? Quantification of PH3 with &gt;15 guts.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Figure 6UV: They state in the legend that 22% of flies have a smurf phenotype upon Hey RNAi. It would be helpful to write this on the figure so it is clear.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Idem for the rest of the figures and supplementary figures.</p><p>2) An important part of the manuscript is the finding that Lamin types switch from the progenitors to the EC and that Hey is required for maintenance of expression of the LamC in the EC. This finding seems to directly contradict recent data of Petrovsky and Großhans, 2018 that observe that LamC is uniformly expressed in the epithelial cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine. What is the difference in experimental set up or interpretation? The authors should minimally discuss this contradictory finding that goes against their model.</p><p>3) Important interpretations were made using GO term analysis. I am concerned that the results obtained are biased toward genes expressed in the ECs. My understanding is that when performing GO term analysis, the background gene set should be the expressed genes in the tissue or cell type. If this is not used, a bias will be obtained towards these genes since, the genes altered are those expressed in the tissue. The authors should use the background gene set from the gut epithelia plus surrounding muscle, which can be obtained at Flygut-seq for the analysis in Figure 3 and S8 to see if the categories of genes altered in HeyRNAi or LamDm0 overexpression are still statically enriched over the gene set of intestine genes (and not the whole genome).</p><p>4) I feel that the authors overinterpret the data presented in Figure 2A-I'. It is also written in a very confusing manner- please start by outlining the experiment and the expected results, then give the results without an interpretation of what the different colors of cells are. Then speculate on the potential meaning. They should not refer to the GFP+RFP- cells as &quot;no longer fully differentiated&quot;. Similarly, do not refer to the RFP+GFP- cells as &quot;early ECs&quot; or the GFP-RFP- cells as &quot;potentially mis-differentiated&quot;. These interpretations should be kept separate from the data and then substantiated with additional markers. A timecourse would be helpful as these populations should evolve over time. Also, given the difference in proliferation of control and knockdown, could the results be explained by altered kinetics in a regenerating gut? They could see if infection or damage conditions show a similar effect, which would argue against their model.</p><p>-Similarly, I believe they have misinterpreted the phenotype of Hey RNAi with respect to Notch signaling. Discussion, &quot;The ectopic activity of a Notch-reporter observed in EC-NFD upon Hey targeting in ECs suggests that Hey limits Notch activity in ECs.&quot; This is likely only due to a secondary effect on causing stress in the gut, driving ISC proliferation, and therefore making more, new EB cells that express the Su(H)-GBE reporter. It is unclear in the gut whether Hey has any impact on Notch signaling, is regulated by Notch, or is simply parallel.</p><p>5) Did the authors show data of LaminC RNA decrease in S2 cells?</p><p>6) &quot;These phenotypes were suppressed by over-expression of UAS-Hey, but not by a control transgene (Figures S1C, C4).

Please show some quantification.</p><p>7) It should be clearly stated in the text that microarrays are used to assess transcriptomes. Quantification of the numbers of hey-Gal4 expressing cells should be done in the different backgrounds (controls vs heyRNAi). PCA plots should be shown.</p><p>8) P7 &quot;Overall, the transcriptional signature of guts in which Hey was targeted in ECs largely resembled the signature of control purified progenitors&quot;</p><p>- &quot;Hey knockdown was induced&quot; would be more clear</p><p>Also, it is not at all clear to me what is being compared here: is it the genes that change in Myo1A&gt;GFP vs Myo1A&gt;hey RNAi compared to the genes that are expressed in &quot;heyGal4+ cells&quot;? What are the heyGal4+ cells compared to? Whole guts? These are primarily EBs. The interpretation of these data are not clear to me? The microarray of whole gut while knocking down in ECs will give ISC, EB and EE genes altered in a non-autonomous fashion as well as EC genes altered.</p><p>9) As mentioned above, quantification of the effects seen in Figure 4F-G; What% of guts show the effect? Figure 4 I-CC, what% of ECs show these effects? There is undoubtedly variability in these data- what is the level? Could these effects be due to different ages of EC cells? More new EC cells are likely made in Hey knockdown conditions- is it only new EC cells that show this? They could for example make MARCM clones and look at 3 day old ECS in wild-type to see if the chromatin marks are established or if they come during maturation of the EC.</p><p>10) Figure 5G-I- they should also quantify what happens to Dl+ cells- here they lose both Dl+ cells and LaminDm0+ esg+ cells.</p><p>11) The data in 5J are not convincing on their own. This does not look like Dl staining, which is usually vesicular. Please show some additional images and quantification. Similarly, 5M is not convincing: in this context, clearly there are more ISC divisions, leading to more esg+ cells, which are likely not all ISC/EBS, but newly produced ECs, which therefore express Pdm1. How do the authors identify progenitors in Figure 5M?</p><p>12) PCA plots of the RNAseq data should be shown. They should state to what they are comparing the Myo1A&gt;LamD0 data (UAS-GFP?).</p><p>13) I disagree with the following statement in the Introduction and Discussion, that I do not feel is supported by their references:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, multiple lines of evidence have established that failure to maintain a differentiated identity is a hallmark of aging…&quot; (Schwitalla et al., 2013; Deneris and Hobert, 2014; Ocampo et al., 2016)</p><p>To me, none of these references really strongly support the idea that differentiated cell fates decline during normal aging, which is what stated as fact.

If they do not see an impact on these marks, this would definitively rule out that the effect of Hey knockdown on ECs is merely indirect through rapid production of new ECs. For example, the effect on Arm that they find is also seen upon increased proliferation in the gut. Newly-made ECs upon rapid ISC proliferation are different from those made under homeostatic conditions. I do realize that this is extra work, but honestly, if this were my own paper, I would at least want to know this result and comment on whether or not this is likely indirect via proliferation stimulation. The alternative which may be more complicated genetically is to block proliferation in the Hey RNAi contexts and see if the effects on LamC or LamDm0 are still seen.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44745.051</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors investigate the role of Hey, a bHLH transcription factor that is related to the Notch pathway, in differentiation of Enterocytes (EC) cells in the adult Drosophila midgut. Hey appears to play a Notch independent role, in maintaining the differentiation state of ECs. Following a combination of genetics, cell biological and bioinformatics methods, the authors conclude that Hey is crucial in mediating and maintaining EC differentiation (in addition to its context specific role in other cell types of the lineage, i.e. EB cells). The story culminates to the point where Hey regulates a developmental switch in lamins, lamDm0 and lamC, which are expressed in EBs and terminally differentiated ECs respectively. In fact the authors manage to show that:</p><p>a) Lamins appear to share a network of target genes they coregulate with Hey, albeit they do so via a different mechanisms, i.e. by maintaining nuclear architecture as opposed to Hey maintaining Acetylation of histones and</p><p>b) RNAi knockdown or overexpression of lamDm or lamC confirms the directionality of action in the lamins-Hey circuitry.</p><p>The manuscript is full of data, but the organization of the presentation was a bit difficult to follow. Nevertheless, the data are clear and they create new possibilities for future experiments. Indeed, the authors have managed to use existing tools and even make new ones (Hey MARCM stock, Hey Gal4, etc.) that can benefit their future studies as well as the studies of other groups looking into stem cell biology or maintenance of differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised and re-wrote entire manuscript, simplified the presentation, reduced data load, revised supplemental figures and data. We were very strict on data interpretation. We have removed parts of the genomic data, that while interesting, distracted the reading flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major point:</p><p>Can the authors rescue Hey-RNAi phenotypes, such as the reduced survival and leakage of food in the abdominal cavity, by repressing laminDm or overexpressing lamin C?</p><p>Does overexpression of lamDm0 or repression of lamC cause phenotypes like Hey RNAi with regard to gut homeostasis, such as STAT reporters activity, Notch activity, upregulation of Dlg and Arm?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested experiments:</p><p>1) As expected, we demonstrate that perturbation in Lamin expression resulted in changes in gut homeostasis including ectopic activation of signaling pathway, as well as distinct changes in expression of cell adhesion molecules, loss of gut integrity and overall survival (New Figure 6). We specifically show that loss of LamC results in ectopic JAK-STAT activity, as well as expression of the stem cell related adhesion co-factor Armadillo (Arm), but had no effect on the expression of EC adhesion molecules like MESH. Inversely expression of LamDm0 in ECs resulted in reduced expression of EC genes like MESH but had no effect on Arm expression. We also show that expression of LamDm0 in EC, reduces the overall lifespan. Moreover we show that this regulation of lamins expression is impaired during aging. Remarkably, aging-dependent loss of LamC and the ectopic expression of LamDm0 are suppressed by over expression of Hey in ECs of aged flies (new Figure 7).</p><p>2) Expression of LamC or elimination of lamDm0 each one by itself, or in combination was not sufficient to rescue the phenotype of loss of Hey. Since Hey is situated above the two lamins and act also directly on Pdm1, this inability is not surprising.The transcriptional activation by Hey of EC genes is mediated by itself and Pdm1, and therefore is not compensated by expression of LamC or loss of LamDm0 that act only on the repressive armof Hey activity.</p><p>3) Moreover expression of LamC was not sufficient to inhibit the ectopic expression of Δ. we relate and describe this in the discussion: “Over-expression of LamC in Hey-targeted ECs was not, however, sufficient to repress ectopic Δ expression (data not shown), suggesting that the repressive activity of LamC may require the presence of Hey or a Heyregulated protein(s) on these gene regions.” Thus, Hey activity is more broad than just the regulation of nuclear lamins, it is likely required for lamin-dependent repression and its activity is essential for both repression and gene activation</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall, I feel that the data presented--although substantial in volume--unfortunately fall far short of providing convincing support for these conclusions. In my view, the revisions necessary to substantiate the authors' claims would be quite a major undertaking.</p><p>My concerns involve what I see as significant issues regarding data interpretation and study design:</p><p>1) Hey acts broadly in multiple cell types, but the study does not offer insight into how Hey achieves cell type-specific regulation. Specifically, Hey is expressed in all midgut cells and has pleiotropic roles in stem cells, enteroblasts, and enterocytes. Without knowing the mechanisms that underlie cell type specificity, I am not sure whether Hey is actually a core transcription factor or merely an accessory co-factor.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the following experimental evidence that Hey is a core transcription factor and not an accessory/redundant transcription factor:</p><p>1) Loss of Hey in ECs cannot be compensated by the expression Pdm1.</p><p>2) Increasing the amount of Hey by its Expression in stem cells represses the expression of ISC-specific genes like Δ and LamDm0 as well as likely promotes premature endoreplication. All features that are characteristics of differentiated ECs.</p><p>3) Hey regulated genes in ECs and in Progenitors are very different with only minimal overlap, suggesting for specific hey-regulated signature in the different cells. (Figure 3H)</p><p>4) As discussed for Rev.1 loss of LamDm0 or expression of LamC cannot suppress Hey phenotype. Taken together these data suggest that Hey has a key role in EC differentiation and is a pivotal transcription factor in maintaining EC identity. Thus, its activity is not “an accessory” cofactor, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major element of the authors' model is that the switch from LamDm0 to LamC during enterocyte differentiation produces widespread changes in gene expression by promoting different nuclear architectures. However, the study does not include any assessment of nuclear organization, lamina-chromatin association, or other lamin-influenced structural feature for any midgut cell type (either normal or genetically manipulated enterocytes and enteroblasts). As far as I can tell, the authors' conclusions that Hey and LamC &quot;remodel the nuclear architecture&quot; and &quot;determine a nuclear organization that is unique to ECs&quot;, although provocative, are not supported by either direct or indirect evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s criticism is correct. Therefore, in the current manuscript we have now extensively addressed this issue of large-scale organization of the EC nucleus upon Hey knockdown in ECs.</p><p>I) We show that loss of Hey in EC resulted in increased global chromatin accessibility in ECs (new Figure 4).</p><p>II) We show that loss of Hey affected global organization of EC nuclei (new Figure 4).</p><p>Specifically, we show:</p><p>I) “We therefore investigated whether loss of Hey in ECs results in a global change in chromatin conformation using an M. SssI methylation-based chromatin accessibility assay (Figure 4F, G; Rincon-Arano et al. 2012). In brief, the M. SssI enzyme efficiently methylates CpG dinucleotides in vitro depending on chromatin accessibility. This methylation is endogenously minimal in differentiated somatic Drosophila cells. The methylated dinucleotides are subsequently detected using 5mCmAb (Bell et al., 2010). Only minimal 5mC methylation was detected in control gut ECs (9%, n=206), but upon Hey knockdown, a significant increase in 5mC was detected in polyploid cells using immunofluorescence with the 5mC antibody likely found in ECNFD or PMD cells (22% n=406; p&lt; 0.001) (Figure 4F, G and quantitated in Figure 4—figure supplement 3G)”.</p><p>II) “RNAi-mediated depletion of Hey resulted in impaired expression and distribution of heterochromatin protein 1c (HP1c), which was no longer localized to the chromocenter (Figure 4I, J). It also resulted in an increased distribution of Nop60B and Coilin, which mark the nucleolus and Cajal bodies, respectively (Figures 4K-N). We also observed impairment in the nuclear localization of LSM11 that is associated with the histone locus bodies (HLBs) (Figure 4O, P) and at the nuclear periphery, localization of Mtor, a nuclear envelope component, was distorted. Alongside changes in the expression of nuclear lamins (Figure 4Q-V). We observed reduced expression of Lamin C and increased expression of LamDm0. We also observed increased expression of the LamDm0 binding protein, Otefin, as well as its redistribution to the nuclear periphery (Figures 4W-X’, 4H). In contrast, the immunofluorescence signal of the co-repressor dSin3A, which functions in HESmediated repression, was identical in both Hey-RNAi- and control-targeted gut (Figures 4Y, Z, Figure 1—figure supplement 3K, L).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The datasets that are used to draw conclusions about cell type-specific transcriptional signatures and enhancer activity are not themselves specific to the relevant cell types.</p><p>a) To isolate enteroblasts for microarray analysis (Figure 4A), the authors sort cells for UAS-GFP under control of a GAL4 driver comprising the 3'UTR of hey. They state that this driver is expressed &quot;predominantly&quot; in enteroblasts. However, many Δ-expressing stem cells appear to express hey&gt;GFP (Figure S4A), and many cells that express hey&gt;GFP do not express the enteroblast-specific Notch reporter (Figure S4B). These features raise questions as to the specificity of the &quot;enteroblast&quot; datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Hey-GAL4 drives expression also in ISCs (albeit to a much lesser amount that EBs). We therefore revised our statements and agree that this should be considered as a “progenitor driver”. We now relate to these cells a “progenitors” and not purified EBs. We have extensively modified the text and data to accurately present the experiments, as well as their interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Hey enhancer activity is inferred from DamID of cultured Kc167 cells, not of midgut cells. The authors state they were unable to perform DamID in midgut cells (although some precedents do exist: Korzelius et al., 2014, Loza-Coll 2014, Jin 2015, Chen et al., 2018). Given that Hey has different targets in different cell types even within the midgut, it seems tenuous to extrapolate enhancer binding in Kc167 cells to midgut enterocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and due to the concerns raised and in the current manuscript we do not discuss a potential role of Hey on enhancers. We also limited the discussion regarding the results of the DamID experiment. However for few genes that show binding in DamID, that we experimentally validated in ECs, and are important for ECs identity we show binding to predicted enhancer regions. These include genes like Pdm1, Δ, LamDm0, and LamC. Experimentally, we also show that the M5-4 enhancer reporter line of the stem cell esg gene that is active only in stem cells is ectopically activated in ECNFD (Figure 2 and Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear to me that hey-knockdown enterocytes truly &quot;lose their differentiated identity&quot;, as stated by the authors and as would be expected if Hey is a core terminal factor.</p><p>a) Morphologically, the knockdown enterocytes still resemble enterocytes and not any other cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>While morphologically they still resemble polyploid ECs, a long the manuscript we bring evidences both by transcriptional analysis as well and using G-TRACE-confocal analysis that ECNFD fail to express many ECs specific genes including the key transcription factor Pdm1, EC specific adhesion molecules (Figure 2), and many putative digestive enzymes (S6). Moreover, these targeted ECs exhibit abnormal cell cycle phasing likely re-entering aberrant endoreplication visualized in vivo using an RGB cell cycle tracer line. For simplicity we did not relate to changes in cell cycle in the manuscript (see an example at end of point by point).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Physiologically, not evidence that enterocytes downregulate digestive enzymes or nutrient transporters or otherwise attenuate their digestive function.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show in Table S6 that more that 50 putative digestive enzymes are not expressed upon loss of Hey in ECs. This data is based with an extensive detailed excellent analysis of gut transcriptomics. In addition GO analysis of Hey downregulated genes show classical EC physiological groups such as transporters lipases, metabolic enzymes etc (Figure 3B, Table S2). We also show aberrant lysosomal activity using lyzo-tracker, and loss of gut integrity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The phenotypic effects of hey knockdown (e.g. elevated JAK-STAT, expression of Notch reporters, loss of H3K27Ac, lamin mis-expression) appear partial, which is inconsistent with the notion that Hey is centrally important. (These partial effects do not appear to correlate with the extent of Myo1A driver activity, as far as I can gauge by co-expression of GFP in the images that are shown.)</p></disp-quote><p>The phenotype of loss of Hey are actually extremely strong. The gut structure is strongly affected and hard to dissect even after 72-100 h. Therefore we performed experiments after 48h hours. Under these experimental conditions many cells but not all lose identity as shown nicely in G-TRACE experiments (Figure 2). However as in many cases with RNAi this is not a null. Indeed using MARCAM we show that Hey deficient clones are hardly generated and they do not mature into full differentiated ECs. Thus, Hey is critical for establishing and maintaining EC identity, we therefore believe that the impression of the reviewer in this case is not correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Many effects of hey knockdown resemble the well-characterized hallmarks of regeneration and ageing (e.g. elevated JAK-STAT, expression of Notch reporters, disorganization, leakiness). Indeed, I might interpret the hey knockdown phenotype as simply recapitulating the normal enterocyte response to damage and stress-not as wholesale reprogramming of enterocyte identity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the above criticism and in the current manuscript focused on aging. Indeed, we noticed that Hey protein levels in ECs decline with age (Figures 7A, B). Moreover, the phenotypes resulting from acute conditional knockdown of Hey in young flies (2-4 days old) are highly similar to the phenotypes observed in wildtype guts derived from aged flies (3-4 weeks old). As seen in NEW Figures 7C-J, aging ECs exhibit a reduction in the MyoIA-GFP signal, a decline in Pdm1 and LamC expression, along with ectopic expression of Δ and LamDm0 and overall reduced gut integrity (Figures 7C, 7E, 7G, 7I, 7K). Indeed, continued expression of Hey in aged ECs using MyoIAts-Gal4 prevented the ectopic expression of Δ and LamDm0 (Figures 7D, 7J), restored the expression of Pdm1 (Figures 7E, 7F), of LamC (Figures 7G, 7H), and of overall EC morphology, compared with control. Finally, expression of Hey prevented loss of gut integrity as revealed by the “smurf” assay (Figures 7K, 7L).Thus, we bring novel physiological role for Hey in maintaining aged dependent loss of EC identity.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript of Flint-Brodsly et al. is an exciting manuscript. The authors have improved the flow of the manuscript and strengthened their conclusions, by performing multiple additional experiments, while correcting the phrasing of certain points throughout the manuscript at the same time.</p><p>The manuscript describes the pleiotropic role of Hey TF in the Drosophila gut, focusing mostly on its role in the active maintenance of the differentiated state of the EC cells.

The adult gut is a very dynamic tissue that responses rapidly to subtle environmental changes. Because of this, it is especially important that careful quantification be performed as it is very rare that any phenotype is black and white. Therefore, while there are some potentially interesting findings (changes in Lamins during differentiation; a role of Hey in EC LamC expression; potential regulatory roles for Lamins in controlling fate genes), it is impossible to judge from the data presented whether the anecdotal images are representative of all guts, all regions of the gut, males or females, etc. Ideally, all data should be rigorously quantified, with data points plotted - not just an average-- and compared with appropriate statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed below we performed all the quantifications and statistics as suggested. As stated in the text, we have performed all the experiments in females. In addition, in the revised version we added analysis of Hey loss also in males (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B), and show the impact of Hey loss on the entire gut (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D’). Rigorous quantification is now presented along the entire manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, the effect on Pdm1 expression of Hey knockdown with Myo1AGal4 looks more subtle than some other phenotypes, which raises the issue of how direct or indirectly certain phenotypes are.

Please note that the reduction in Pdm1 expression was observed using different methodologies (global, and G-TRACE analyses of knockdown of Hey). Pdm1 was identified as a putative direct target of Hey by DamID (Hey binds to its predicted enhancer).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major issue that I have is that because the RNAi of Hey in ECs generates a proliferative response, many of the effects the authors detect could be secondary due to this.

Importantly, that G-TRACE analysis presented in Figure 2E’ shows that it is the PPCs that are GFP (+) and RFP (-) (PPC **) that express Δ on their surface. Based on the G-TRACE technique and since the expression of GFP is the result of a recombination event driven by active MyoGal4 (an activation that takes place only in the differentiated ECs), it is highly suggestive that PPC GFP(+) RFP(-) were EC initially, are currently not maintaining EC identity (hence are RFP negative) but express the GFP history marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1F, F', H, H4- what% of ECs lose Pdm1 staining up Hey RNAi expression compared to controls?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed that 82% of cells lose Pdm1expression upon targeting Hey.

In addition, we presented similar results using the MyoIA-Gal4ts system that acts globally in the midgut; demonstrating that loss of Hey resulted in reduction of H3AK27ac, LamC and increased expression of lamDm0 (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 3H-K, Figure 5—figure supplement 1F-I).

This finding seems to directly contradict recent data of Petrovsky and Großhans, 2018 that observe that LamC is uniformly expressed in the epithelial cells of the Drosophila intestine. What is the difference in experimental set up or interpretation? The authors should minimally discuss this contradictory finding that goes against their model.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper was published after our manuscript was sent to review and therefore was not cited. In this work the authors identified that the expression of LamC in all cells based on the correlation with progenitor cells expressing the Esg-gal4 driver. This driver marks both EB and ISCs, but does not discriminate between them. This is in agreement with our observations that clearly show high levels of LamC in progenitors; low level in ISC and higher in EBs see Figure 4CC.</p><p>In the current version we relate and cite their work: “As our manuscript was under review Petrovsky and Großhans also characterized the expression of nuclear lamins in the midgut (Petrovsky and Großhans, 2019). Similar to our observations they reported that LamDm0 and Otefin are enriched in progenitor cells. They also reported the expression of LamC in progenitors cells. Our work using ISC and EB specific markers further established that in progenitors high levels of LamC are present in EBs and only minimal amount is expressed in ISCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Important interpretations were made using GO term analysis. I am concerned that the results obtained are biased toward genes expressed in the ECs. My understanding is that when performing GO term analysis, the background gene set should be the expressed genes in the tissue or cell type. If this is not used, a bias will be obtained towards these genes since, the genes altered are those expressed in the tissue. The authors should use the background gene set from the gut epithelia plus surrounding muscle, which can be obtained at Flygut-seq for the analysis in Figure 3 and S8 to see if the categories of genes altered in HeyRNAi or LamDm0 overexpression are still statically enriched over the gene set of intestine genes (and not the whole genome).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we compared our gene expression data to the Flygut dataset to a “top hits per region” available at: https://flygut.epfl.ch/expressions. We find that the categories of genes altered in Hey RNAi or LamDm0 overexpression are still statically enriched over the gene set of intestine genes. We added this new data along the text and present it in Figure 3—figure supplement 4Q and Figure 5—figure supplement 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I feel that the authors overinterpret the data presented in Figure 2A-I'. It is also written in a very confusing manner- please start by outlining the experiment and the expected results, then give the results without an interpretation of what the different colors of cells are. Then speculate on the potential meaning. They should not refer to the GFP+RFP- cells as &quot;no longer fully differentiated&quot;. Similarly, do not refer to the RFP+GFP- cells as &quot;early ECs&quot; or the GFP-RFP- cells as &quot;potentially mis-differentiated&quot;. These interpretations should be kept separate from the data and then substantiated with additional markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this correct suggestion and critic. We extensively revised this section in the text and relevant figures and show analysis with markers. we now call these cells PPCs (polyploid cells). We now refer to the GFP+RFP- cells as PPC**, and GFP- RFP- as PPC* and only at the end of the section we suggest interpretation based on the G-TRACE system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A timecourse would be helpful as these populations should evolve over time.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we show G-TRACE analysis within 24h and 48h time points. Quantification of this is presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A’-A”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, given the difference in proliferation of control and knockdown, could the results be explained by altered kinetics in a regenerating gut? They could see if infection or damage conditions show a similar effect, which would argue against their model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript focused on how ECs maintain identity, but rather in young adults or during normal aging. We strongly feel that how cell identity is maintained upon infection or DNA damage – while highly interesting – is outside of the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similarly, I believe they have misinterpreted the phenotype of Hey RNAi with respect to Notch signaling. Discussion, &quot;The ectopic activity of a Notch-reporter observed in EC-NFD upon Hey targeting in ECs suggests that Hey limits Notch activity in ECs.&quot; This is likely only due to a secondary effect on causing stress in the gut, driving ISC proliferation, and therefore making more, new EB cells that express the Su(H)-GBE reporter. It is unclear in the gut whether Hey has any impact on Notch signaling, is regulated by Notch, or is simply parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point. We have changed the text to better reflect this point:</p><p>“The observed Notch-reporter activity in PPCs upon Hey targeting in ECs, may reflect stress-increased ISC proliferation and Notch activation in enlarged progenitors. Alternatively, this ectopic activity may suggest that Hey limits Notch activity in ECs.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Did the authors show data of LaminC RNA decrease in S2 cells?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we have not analyzed mRNA levels of nuclear lamins in S2 cells (LamDm0 or LamC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;These phenotypes were suppressed by over-expression of UAS-Hey, but not by a control transgene (Figures S1C, C4). Moreover, RNAi knockdown of Notch, Suppressor of Hairless, other HES TFs, and HES-related cofactors did not phenocopy Hey loss in ECs (Figures S2A-J).&quot;</p><p>– what phenotypes are being assessed. Please show some quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained better the phenotypes in the text and showed quantifications (Figure 1J, J’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It should be clearly stated in the text that microarrays are used to assess transcriptomes. Quantification of the numbers of hey-Gal4 expressing cells should be done in the different backgrounds (controls vs heyRNAi). PCA plots should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now stated in the Results section and not only in Materials and method section. PCA plots are presented in new Figure 3—figure supplement 4D, E and Figure 5—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) P7 &quot;Overall, the transcriptional signature of guts in which Hey was targeted in ECs largely resembled the signature of control purified progenitors&quot;</p><p>– &quot;Hey knockdown was induced&quot; would be more clear</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we replaced this statement</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not at all clear to me what is being compared here: is it the genes that change in Myo1A&gt;GFP vs Myo1A&gt;hey RNAi compared to the genes that are expressed in &quot;heyGal4+ cells&quot;? What are the heyGal4+ cells compared to? Whole guts? These are primarily EBs. The interpretation of these data are not clear to me? The microarray of whole gut while knocking down in ECs will give ISC, EB and EE genes altered in a non-autonomous fashion as well as EC genes altered.</p></disp-quote><p>We now better explain the gene expression experiment in the text. We also describe the potential alteration in gene expression due to non-autonomous effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) As mentioned above, quantification of the effects seen in Figure 4F-G; What% of guts show the effect? Figure 4 I-CC, what% of ECs show these effects?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above we quantified all these phenotypes see Figure 4—figure supplement 3L.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is undoubtedly variability in these data- what is the level? Could these effects be due to different ages of EC cells? More new EC cells are likely made in Hey knockdown conditions- is it only new EC cells that show this? They could for example make MARCM clones and look at 3 day old ECS in wild-type to see if the chromatin marks are established or if they come during maturation of the EC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point. However, it is still the case that Hey regulates chromatin accessibility during EC maturation and in its absence, chromatin is more accessible and adopts a more “open” structure. These effects are now quantified in Figure 4—figure supplement 3E-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 5G-I- they should also quantify what happens to Dl+ cells- here they lose both Dl+ cells and LaminDm0+ esg+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This quantification is now presented in revised Figure 5I where it is shown that only 10% of progenitors (Esg&gt;GFP+) that express Hey co-express Dl and LamDm0 compare to 100% in control</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The data in 5J are not convincing on their own. This does not look like Dl staining, which is usually vesicular. Please show some additional images and quantification. Similarly, 5M is not convincing: in this context, clearly there are more ISC divisions, leading to more esg+ cells, which are likely not all ISC/EBS, but newly produced ECs, which therefore express Pdm1. How do the authors identify progenitors in Figure 5M?</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced these figures with better representative images and show quantification in Figure 5T-W.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) PCA plots of the RNAseq data should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>PCA data is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 4D, E and Figure 5—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should state to what they are comparing the Myo1A&gt;LamD0 data (UAS-GFP?).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is the case and it is now clearly stated in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) I disagree with the following statement in the Introduction and Discussion, that I do not feel is supported by their references:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, multiple lines of evidence have established that failure to maintain a differentiated identity is a hallmark of aging…&quot; (Schwitalla et al., 2013; Deneris and Hobert, 2014; Ocampo et al., 2016)</p><p>To me, none of these references really strongly support the idea that differentiated cell fates decline during normal aging, which is what stated as fact. I would not say that this is a well-established notion. However, one paper that does support this is from the fly gut field and is not cited (Li, Qi and Jasper, 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we revised the text: “Indeed, failure tomaintain a differentiated identity is associated altered physiological properties of post-mitotic cells and tissues resulting in disease such as diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Deneris and Hobert, 2014; Ocampo et al., 2016). We also added the relevant reference (Li, Qi and Jasper, 2016)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the Discussion section on Cell identity, aging, and pathological plasticity. &quot;During Drosophila and vertebrate aging, or under various stress condition, differentiated cells in the gut, pancreas, and trachael epithelium behave similarly, reflecting a general principle.&quot; While, I agree published data suggest plasticity in cancer or pathological cell loss in these tissues, a function of loss of identity during normal aging is less obvious to me and should be better supported by published literature. Mutant contexts such as Progeria syndromes are not equivalent to wild-type aging.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text:</p><p>“One well-studied case is that of human LamC ortholog, LamA, which is mutated in Progeria, a disease associated with premature aging and loss of physiological properties of differentiated cells and tissues (Hegele, 2003). However, further studies are needed in order to link loss of identity and premature aging in progeria models and patients, to the consequences of physiological aging. Therefore, the identification of conserved mechanisms underlying the regulation of identity networks in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> has broad implications for addressing pathological conditions in humans, and specifically age-related diseases.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The proposed experiment at the end of this reviewers critique seems easy to do and should be informative”. “What I was suggesting that the authors do was not a 6 months experiment, but a simple treatment of flies with some damaging agent that induces a similar proliferative response to that seen upon Hey RNAi in ECs (one of: Ecc15, Pe, paraquat), and assess some of their nuclear phenotypes (LamC, LamDm0). If they do not see an impact on these marks, this would definitively rule out that the effect of Hey knockdown on ECs is merely indirect through rapid production of new ECs…I do realize that this is extra work, but honestly, if this were my own paper, I would at least want to know this result and comment on whether or not this is likely indirect via proliferation stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we performed the experiment that is now shown in new Figure 5—figure supplement 2I-P. We have evaluated the changes in expression of LamC, lamDm0, and Mtor upon exposure to paraquat, that induces a rapid proliferative response.</p><p>We have performed this experiment using MyoIA &gt;GFP marking ECs, and similar to the experiment where we knockdown Hey using Hey RNAi. Paraquat treatment resulted in progenitors proliferation and formation of polyploid cells. However unlike in the case of targeting Hey, or during aging, the ECs in the gut retained the expression of MyoIA-GFP as well as LamC. They did not ectopically express LamDm0. Nor did they show changes in the expression of Mtor. Thus, this experiment strongly suggest that the effect observed upon loss of Hey is directly affecting ECs, and not merely reflecting only proliferative stimulation of progenitors.</p><p>We now added in the text:</p><p>“Importantly, the changes observed in LamC, LamDm0, expression and nuclear organization (such as localization of Mtor), were not observed upon paraquat exposure, that induces rapid progenitor proliferation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2I-P; Chatterjee et al., 2009). Thus, these changes are directly related to loss of Hey supervision in ECs”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
