(SPNs), thus shaping striatal output. Schemes of basal ganglia circuit dynamics generally consider striatal PV+ interneurons to be homogenous, despite considerable heterogeneity in both form and function. We demonstrate that the selective co-expression of another calcium-binding protein, secretagogin (Scgn), separates PV+ interneurons in rat and primate striatum into two topographically-, physiologically- and structurally-distinct cell populations. In rats, these two interneuron populations differed in their firing rates, patterns and relationships with cortical oscillations in vivo. Moreover, the axons of identified PV+/Scgn+ interneurons preferentially targeted the somata of SPNs of the so-called ‘direct pathway’, whereas PV+/Scgn- interneurons preferentially targeted ‘indirect pathway’ SPNs. These two populations of interneurons could therefore provide a substrate through which either of the striatal output pathways can be rapidly and selectively inhibited to subsequently mediate the expression of behavioral routines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

between populations of interneurons and spiny projection neurons (SPN) of striatum are critical for the expression of many basal ganglia-dependent behaviors. One major type of GABAergic striatal interneuron expresses parvalbumin (PV). Striatal PV+ interneurons can form axo-somatic synapses with SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koos and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</xref>), allowing them to powerfully inhibit SPNs of both the so-called ‘direct pathway’ and ‘indirect pathway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Planert et al., 2010</xref>). These interneurons exhibit short-latency responses to powerful excitatory inputs from afferents originating in distinct cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramanathan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>), providing a mechanism for rapidly stopping or delaying SPN spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mallet et al., 2005</xref>) and, in turn, modulating striatal outputs. Consistent with this, physiologically-classified (putative) PV+ interneurons in striatum, often called ‘fast-spiking interneurons’ (FSIs), appear to have a specific role in ‘selecting’ motor programs, firing most intensely at the choice execution/decision making point of a given task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gage et al., 2010</xref>). The functional importance of striatal PV+ interneurons is further illustrated by the severe movement deficits that result from their loss or selective disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burguière et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gittis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In cortical circuits, PV+ GABAergic interneurons comprise multiple cell types with distinct structural, neurochemical and physiological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). In contrast, striatal PV+ interneurons are usually treated as a single functionally-homogenous population that is enriched within dorsolateral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerfen et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kita et al., 1990</xref>). There is some evidence, however, of anatomical, physiological and molecular heterogeneity within this population, suggesting that distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneuron could exist within the striatum. Striatal PV+ interneurons in rats can be broadly divided into two subtypes based on the sizes of their axonal and dendritic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawaguchi, 1993</xref>), and the ratio of synapses formed with SPN somata and dendrites varies considerably between individual PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</xref>). Physiologically, identified PV+ interneurons in rats display highly variable firing rates and patterns in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that such variance or diversity could arise from the blinded sampling of functionally-distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneurons. Moreover, studies in mouse striatum indicate that almost half of all PV+ interneurons express serotonin receptor subunit 3A, again highlighting possible functional disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Munoz-Manchado et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In cortical circuits, combinations of molecular markers have been crucial for defining neuronal diversity. In certain specialized cases, the combinatorial expression of calcium-binding proteins, together with other markers such as transcription factors and neuropeptides, has been used to disambiguate interneuron types that had been previously defined by structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viney et al., 2013</xref>). Combinations of similar molecules could thus be used to systematically demarcate different populations of PV+ interneurons in striatum. Secretagogin (Scgn), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rogstam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpár et al., 2012</xref>), is a particularly promising candidate marker of striatal interneuron heterogeneity, as it is expressed by some (sparsely distributed) non-cholinergic striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulder et al., 2009</xref>). Using a combination of immunohistochemistry, stereological cell counting and in vivo recordings of identified interneurons, we demonstrate that Sgcn is co-expressed in a segregated and specialized population of striatal PV+ interneurons in rats and primates, but not in mice. Our findings suggest that distinct subpopulations of PV+ interneurons could enable corticostriatal afferents to orchestrate SPN activity in a topographically- and output pathway-selective manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective expression of secretagogin divides the PV+ interneuron population in rat striatum but not in mouse striatum</title><p>In the adult mouse, the calcium-binding protein secretagogin (Scgn) is expressed by some GABAergic, but not cholinergic, striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulder et al., 2009</xref>). To test whether these neurons also express PV, we examined the expression of Scgn and PV across the mouse dorsal striatum using unbiased stereological methods. All striatal Scgn+ cells co-expressed the ‘pan-neuronal’ marker NeuN, but not the SPN-specific marker Ctip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arlotta et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), indicating that Scgn is exclusively expressed by interneurons. However, interneurons that co-expressed PV and Scgn were rare. Indeed, the vast majority of Scgn+ interneurons did not co-express PV and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

We next tested whether the patterns of Scgn expression in mice also held true for rats. As in mice, Scgn-expressing cells in rat dorsal striatum were interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). However, in comparison to mice, Scgn+ interneurons in rat dorsal striatum could more readily be observed, with or without co-expression of PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Across all striatal sections, about one half of Scgn+ interneurons also expressed PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and about one quarter of PV+ interneurons also expressed Scgn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These findings suggest that, in rats, Scgn is a candidate marker for a subtype of PV-expressing interneuron. Moreover, Scgn+ interneurons were relatively common overall, with a density that was about two thirds of that of PV+ interneurons, indicating that Scgn is itself a novel marker of a major class of striatal interneuron in the rat. We found this divergence in Scgn immunoreactivity between rodent species using two antibodies raised against different epitopes of Scgn that have 100% and 95% sequence homologies for rat and mouse, suggesting that the relative paucity of Scgn+ interneurons in mice was not a result of differences in antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16088.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Primary antibodies used in this study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16088.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16088.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Molecular Marker</th><th valign="top">Host Organism</th><th valign="top">Dilution used</th><th valign="top">Source and catalog number</th><th valign="top">Research Resource Identifier (RRID)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Choline acetyltransferase</td><td valign="top">Goat</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Millipore <break/>AB144P</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2079751">AB_2079751</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ctip2</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Abcam <break/>AB18465</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2064130">AB_2064130</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32 <break/>(DARPP-32)</td><td valign="top">Goat</td><td valign="top">1:100</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology <break/>SC-8483</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_639002">AB_639002</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gephyrin</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems <break/>147021</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2232546">AB_2232546</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN)</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">1:200</td><td valign="top">Millipore <break/>MAB377</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2298772">AB_2298772</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Nitric Oxide Synthase</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Sigma <break/>N2280</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_260754">AB_260754</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Neuropeptide Y</td><td valign="top">Rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:5000</td><td valign="top">ImmunoStar <break/>22940</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2307354">AB_2307354</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Parvalbumin</td><td valign="top">Guinea Pig</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems <break/>195004</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2156476">AB_2156476</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Preproenkephalin</td><td valign="top">Rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:5000</td><td valign="top">LifeSpan Biosciences <break/>LS-C23084</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_902714">AB_902714</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Secretagogin</td><td valign="top">Goat</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td><td valign="top">R&amp;D Systems <break/>AF4878</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2269934">AB_2269934</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Secretagogin</td><td valign="top">Rabbit</td><td valign="top">1:500</td><td valign="top">Abcam <break/>AB111871</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10864618">AB_10864618</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Striatal afferents (and efferents) are topographically organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>). Thus, if a given cell population has a biased spatial distribution across striatum, it will likely receive privileged inputs from a specific subset of all striatal afferents. With this in mind, we next tested whether the two molecularly-distinct populations of PV+ interneuron, i.e. those that co-expressed Scgn (PV+/Scgn+) and those that did not (PV+/Scgn-), were preferentially localized to discrete striatal regions in the rat. The density of PV+/Scgn- interneurons remained relatively constant along the rostro-caudal axis of dorsal striatum, at least until the most caudal aspects where density decreased by around 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ai,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). However, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons displayed a strikingly different pattern of localization, being more sparsely distributed across most striatal levels, except in the most caudal aspects where their density was around three times higher than that of PV+/Scgn- interneurons in any other plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The two populations of interneurons were also differentially distributed along the medio-lateral axis of the striatum; PV+/Scgn- neurons were evenly distributed, whereas PV+/Scgn+ interneurons tended to distribute more laterally in the rostral striatum but more medially in caudal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This particular pattern of bias in the distribution of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is highly unusual in that it has not been described for any other striatal cell population. Along the dorso-ventral axis, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were more likely than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons to display a slight dorsal bias in their localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

When all rat PV+ interneurons were grouped together for analysis, and all coronal planes were considered, there was no consistent bias in their relative positions along the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). However, the relative medio-lateral positions of all PV+ interneurons varied along the rostral-caudal axis; they tended to be laterally positioned in those coronal planes rostral of Bregma, but medially positioned in planes caudal to Bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The distribution biases of all PV+ interneurons were thus similar to those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), suggesting the presence of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons biases the entire PV+ interneuron population. In line with this, there was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of PV+/Scgn- interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that, in rat dorsal striatum, the biased medio-lateral distributions of PV+ interneurons can be largely explained by the selective expression of Scgn. To further explore this notion, we analyzed the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons in the mouse dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), which contains a tiny number of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). There was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of all PV+ interneurons in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and, as such, their distribution pattern closely resembled that of PV+/Scgn- interneurons in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), but not that of all PV+ interneurons in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These observations were supported by quantitative comparisons of the differences in medio-lateral positions across coronal planes of all mouse PV+ interneurons, all rat PV+/Scgn- interneurons and all rat PV+ interneurons; the differences in the latter were significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). The relatively uniform distribution of PV+ interneurons in mouse striatum thus tallies with their relative lack of Scgn expression. These data serve to reinforce that Scgn is a useful and highly-relevant marker for dividing PV+ interneuron populations.</p><p>In summary, rat PV+/Scgn+ interneurons have a highly unusual spatial distribution, transitioning from predominantly lateral to medial positions as the rostro-caudal axis of dorsal striatum is traversed; their biased positioning accounts for much of the non-uniform distribution of all PV+ interneurons in rats. However, in contrast to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luk and Sadikot, 2001</xref>), we found no quantitative evidence of a consistent ‘dorsolateral’ bias in the distribution of all PV+ interneurons in the striatum of rats. This discrepancy presumably arises from differences in the cell-counting methodologies and analyses used, including the extent to which different regions of dorsal striatum were sampled; we calculated the relative position of each neuron counted in 13 coronal planes, rather than calculating cell densities according to arbitrary ‘quadrants’ in 1 coronal plane (Luk and Sadikot, 2001).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selective secretagogin expression divides the PV+ interneuron population in the primate caudate and putamen</title><p>Our data in rats and mice show that the co-expression of Scgn by striatal PV+ interneurons is not highly conserved across rodent species. Because Scgn+ neurons have also been reported in the primate striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mulder et al., 2009</xref>), we further explored the possibility of phylogenetic conservation by analyzing the co-expression of PV and Scgn in interneurons of the monkey (rhesus macaque) striatum. Secretagogin was expressed by some neurons in both the caudate nucleus and putamen of monkeys; it was frequently co-expressed with PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Compared to the rat, co-expression of PV and Scgn was more common in primates; about three quarters of PV+ interneurons in caudate nucleus and putamen also expressed Scgn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Thus, Scgn is itself a novel marker of a major class of striatal interneuron in both monkeys and rats. Along the rostro-caudal axis of monkey striatum, but most notably in the caudate nucleus, there was a marked increase in the density of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in caudal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), mirroring the biased rostro-caudal distribution of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in the rat striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The density of PV+/Scgn- interneurons remained relatively constant across the rostro-caudal extent of monkey striatum, which is again in line with our observations in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>.). Interestingly, the distribution of PV+/Scgn- interneurons, but not PV+/Scgn+ neurons, was laterally biased throughout rostro-caudal aspect putamen, but not caudate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). When taken together, the data from monkey and rat not only show that a substantial proportion of striatal PV+ interneurons co-express Scgn, a population enriched in caudal striatum, but also that these novel constituents of the striatal microcircuit are phylogenetically conserved to some extent.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16088.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons have different biases in their distributions in the caudate and putamen of macaque monkey.</title><p>(<bold>Ai</bold>, <bold>Aii</bold>) Confocal micrographs of the macaque striatum showing PV-expressing interneurons that co-expressed (<bold>Ai</bold>) and did not co-express (<bold>Aii</bold>) Scgn (arrow).

In order to quantify this observation, we calculated correlations between the interspike interval (ISI) distributions of pairs of interneurons of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>). We analyzed firing pattern homogeneity of all PV+ interneurons (irrespective of Scgn expression) as compared to that of cholinergic (ChAT+) interneurons, which fire with a relatively narrow range of ISIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>). In line with our previous observations, correlations between the ISI histograms of ChAT+ interneurons often result in r-values close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>). In contrast, while correlations between PV+ interneurons could also yield strong correlations, many ISI histograms differed, thereby producing lower r-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,F</xref>). Across all recorded neurons, the ISI histograms of ChAT+ interneurons were significantly more positively correlated than those of PV+ interneurons during both SWA and cortical activation (Mann Whitney, SWA; p=0.001 × 10<sup>−37;</sup> Act: p&lt;0.025 × 10<sup>−36</sup>), confirming that PV+ interneurons have more heterogeneous firing patterns than ChAT+ interneurons.</p><p>If PV+ interneurons encompass multiple neuron types, and Scgn is a marker of a single subpopulation of PV+ interneurons, pairs of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons should display more homogeneity in their firing patterns than the population as a whole. To test this hypothesis, we computed correlations between the ISI histograms of pairs of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons and pairs of PV+/Scgn- interneurons. During both SWA and cortical activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), the r-values for pairs of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were significantly higher than those of PV+/Scgn- pairs (p&lt;0.05 for both Kruskal–Wallis ANOVAs and <italic>post hoc</italic> Dunn's tests), but not significantly different from pairs of ChAT+ interneurons.

Thus, we next examined whether PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons fired differently with respect to the phase of cortical population oscillations (as recorded in ipsilateral, frontal ECoG) across frequencies from 0.4–80 Hz in SWA and cortical activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As suggested by the raw data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), both PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons tended to fire around the peaks of cortical slow oscillations (0.4–1.6 Hz) during SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Although the firing of all PV+ interneurons was significantly locked to cortical slow oscillations to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), the locking across the population was stronger in the PV+/Scgn- neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In line with these results, the vector length of firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons was around twice that of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; Mann Whitney, p=0.04). Similarly, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons was more strongly locked to cortical spindle oscillations (7–12 Hz), which was reflected in both a greater number of significantly locked neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>) and greater vector length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, Mann Whitney, p=0.008). In contrast, the firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was more tightly locked to cortical gamma (30–80 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), and a greater proportion of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were significantly locked to gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Fully delineating the role of any neuron type requires an understanding of not only its neurochemical/molecular properties and the temporal organization of its activity, but also of the cellular targets that it innervates. With the latter in mind, some of the recorded and neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons (n = 4 and 4, respectively) were used to gain insight into whether these two cell populations target the same types of SPN to the same extent. We thus compared the prevalence of appositions of the terminal-like axonal varicosities ('boutons') of neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn+ or PV+/Scgn- interneurons with the cell bodies of SPNs (selectively labeled with DARPP-32). In agreement with previous descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawaguchi, 1993</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>), PV+ interneurons exhibited dense local axonal arborizations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that often formed varicosities in close proximity to (i.e. were apposed to) the somata of SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Whether or not these appositions indicated the presence of functional axo-somatic synapses between PV+ interneurons and SPNs was investigated by simultaneously detecting the presence of gephyrin, which is highly enriched in the post-synaptic membranes of GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sigal et al., 2015</xref>). Quantification of the overlap between gephyrin puncta and axonal varicosities revealed that appositions between neurobiotin-labeled axonal boutons and SPNs were often the sites of putative GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Indeed, 69.2 ± 2.4% of appositions (n = 104) made by the axons of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (n = 3) with SPN somata were associated with discrete puncta of gephyrin immunoreactvity, while 75.5 ± 6.6% of appositions (n = 94) made by the axons of PV+/Scgn- neurons (n = 2) were associated with discrete gephyrin+ puncta. These data suggest that, at the site of an apposition of a PV+ interneuron axonal bouton with a SPN soma, there is a high probability of a GABAergic synapse being formed.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16088.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Appositions formed by the axons of PV+ interneurons with the somata of SPNs are associated with the post-synaptic marker gephyrin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal micrograph stack of an SPN cell body, labeled with DARPP-32 (purple), that is apposed by the boutons of a neurobiotin (NB)-labeled axon of a PV+/Scgn+ interneuron (blue).

Next we examined whether any of this variability could be explained by systematic differences in innervation of SPN somata by the two populations of PV+ interneuron. Neurobiotin-labeled boutons of PV+/Scgn- interneurons (neurons = 4, boutons = 347) were almost twice as likely as those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (neurons = 3, boutons = 709) to appose the somata of SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; Fisher Exact Test, p&lt;0.001. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>).

Thus, we next examined whether there was any bias in the proportion of appositions formed between the PV+ interneuron axons and the somata of SPNs of the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Somatic co-expression of DARPP-32 and preproenkephalin (PPE) was used to identify iSPNs, whereas those SPNs that did not express PPE were considered to be dSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). The axons of individual PV+/Scgn- interneurons could readily be observed to form multiple basket-like appositions around PPE+ iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas the axons of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons appeared to more often target PPE- dSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed that these two populations of PV+ interneurons significantly differed in their preferential targeting of the somata of iSPNs and dSPNs (Fisher Exact Test, p&lt;0.0001). More specifically, the axonal boutons of PV+/Scgn- interneurons (n = 119 boutons from 4 interneurons) were more commonly apposed to iSPN somata than to dSPN somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, the axons of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (n = 238 boutons from 4 interneurons) preferentially targeted dSPN somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>). In tissue sections containing the neurobiotin-labeled axons of PV+ interneurons, approximately half of all SPNs located within 30 µm (i.e. approximately 2 SPN cell body diameters) of an axonal bouton were iSPNs. This meant that the mean ratio of dSPNs to iSPNs in each section containing labeled interneuron axon was close to 1.0 (ratios of 1.04 ± 0.07 and 1.00 ± 0.12 for sections containing axons of PV+/Scgn+ or PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively). This indicates that the preferential targeting of dSPNs and iSPNs by the axons of PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively, was not the result of a preferential distribution or enrichment of dSPNs or iSPNs in these specific tissue sections. Taken together, these results show that not only do PV+/Scgn- interneurons and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons target SPN somata to different extents, but also that these two types of interneuron preferentially innervate the somata of distinct populations of SPNs. By virtue of these biased connections, PV+/Scgn- interneurons might be better positioned than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons to selectively shape the activity of SPNs of the indirect pathway, whereas PV+/Scgn+ neurons might be better positioned to selectively influence SPNs of the direct pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differ in their temporal relationships with striatal projection neurons of the direct and indirect pathways</title><p>Striatal PV+ interneurons are often considered to provide 'feedforward' inhibition to SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silberberg and Bolam, 2015</xref>).

Our analysis of neurobiotin-labeled PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons suggests these two cell types selectively innervate iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. When our observations are placed within a framework of feedforward inhibition in vivo, one might predict that, first, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs, and secondly, that the firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of dSPNs than iSPNs.</p><p>To test these predictions, we compared the spike timing of identified SPNs (n = 48) and PV+ interneurons (n = 26) recorded in anesthetized rats during SWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A subset of recorded and neurobiotin-labelled SPNs (n = 36 of 48) were tested for their expression of PPE, which led to the identification of 18 dSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ai</xref>) and 18 iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Bi</xref>).

As a common reference point for the temporal analysis of all striatal neuron firing, we used the peak of the slow oscillation (~1 Hz) present in the inverted striatal local field potential (iLFP) that was simultaneously recorded with the single-unit activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Aii,Bii</xref>). The slow oscillation in the iLFP is of particular relevance because it is a proxy signal for the cortically-driven synchronized 'up states' of many SPNs in the vicinity of the electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goto and O'Donnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stern et al., 1998</xref>).

These observations agree with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mallet et al., 2005</xref>), and are further supported by the fact that the median firing times of the SPN and PV+ interneurons were not different (Mann Whitney, p=0.55. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). However, when the subsets of identified dSPNs and iSPNs were separately analyzed, their firing probability profiles only partly overlapped; dSPNs tended to fire before the center of the iLFP peak whereas iSPNs fired on or slightly after the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Cii</xref>). Accordingly the median firing time of dSPNs significantly preceded that of the iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). To give further context to this spike timing difference, we separately analyzed the firing of the identified PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. The firing probability profiles of the two types of PV+ interneuron diverged substantially; the profile of PV+/Scgn- interneurons was sharp with a maximum well before the center of the iLFP peak, whereas the profile of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was broad and maximal around the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ciii</xref>). Analysis of median firing times confirmed that PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired significantly earlier than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>), thus highlighting further disparities in the in vivo firing properties of these two types of PV+ interneuron. When the firing times of PV+/Scgn- interneurons, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, dSPNs and iSPNs were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>), it was evident that PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired significantly earlier than iSPNs but not dSPNs, whereas PV+/Scgn+ interneurons did not fire before iSPNs or dSPNs (their firing was significantly delayed as compared to dSPNs). There were no significant differences in the peak times, lengths or amplitudes of the iLFP peaks between the different neuron groups (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with post-hoc Dunn tests), suggesting that the differences in firing times of the distinct neuron types were not due to systematic biases in the LFPs recorded with each population.</p><p>These electrophysiological data verify the first prediction above with respect to possible substrates for feedforward inhibition, that is, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is indeed more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs. This result is consistent with our anatomical data showing that, in the context of targeting SPN somata, PV+/Scgn- interneurons exhibit a considerable bias towards innervating iSPNs. The firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing with respect to dSPN firing did not validate the second prediction; the spike timings of this type of interneuron are not consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory connection to either type of SPN. Again, this result resonates with our anatomical data showing that, although PV+/Scgn+ interneuron preferentially target dSPNs, these interneurons form fewer putative somatic synapses and fewer appositions on a given SPN soma. Taken together, these observations suggest that the diverse properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons position them to fulfil different roles in the striatal circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Hierarchical clustering of striatal interneurons using electrophysiological parameters is highly correlated with their molecular identities</title><p>The analyses above show that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differ in several of their electrophysiological properties, suggesting they are discrete cell types. These analyses were necessarily based on comparisons of two sets of PV+ interneurons that were first divided according to their selective expression of Scgn. This raises the issue of whether PV+ interneurons can be segregated into two or more discrete groups on the basis of their electrophysiological properties alone. If they can be segregated, this raises the further issue of whether the discrete interneuron groups differ with respect to their expression of Scgn. To address these issues, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses of the electrophysiological parameters of PV+ interneurons (omitting information on whether or not they expressed Scgn) together with those of cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic interneurons that co-express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We included ChAT+ interneurons and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons because they are widely accepted to be discrete cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tepper and Bolam, 2004</xref>) and, as such, can be used as comparators; if PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons can be distinguished to the same degree as ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons can be distinguished (from each other and/or from the subpopulations of PV+ interneurons), then this would support the notion that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are discrete cell types. Another key advantage of including ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons is that they facilitated the unbiased selection of the electrophysiological parameters to analyze; parameters were thus selected according to their utility for segregating one or more of the populations of ChAT+ interneurons, PV+ interneurons (as a whole) and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, rather than their ability to distinguish PV+/Scgn- from PV+/Scgn+ interneurons per se.</p><p>Eighty three percent of the cholinergic interneurons and all of the NOS+/NPY+ interneurons used here have been reported in previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doig et al., 2014</xref>). Because the firing rates and patterns of striatal interneurons varies considerably between SWA and cortical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>), we performed separate cluster analyses for parameters recorded in each brain state. For activity during SWA, we analyzed a total of 65 interneurons; 36 ChAT+, 12 NOS+/NPY+ and 17 PV+ interneurons. Three measures of interneuron firing regularity/pattern (Log ISI 10, CV ISI and CV2 ratio; see Materials and methods) and 4 measures of interneuron locking to population oscillations in the ECoG (LFP peak, SWA Vec., Spin. Vec and Gam. Vec; see Materials and methods) were used for clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Ai</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>). When these 7 parameters were analyzed across all interneuron populations, 5 significant clusters emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). After assignment of molecular identities, it was evident that two of these clusters were predominantly composed of cholinergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The three remaining clusters were composed of a clear majority of PV+/Scgn-, PV+/Scgn+ or NOS+/NPY+ interneurons. The PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were therefore segregated to a similar degree as the ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons. When the ChAT+ interneurons were removed and the analysis repeated, the GABAergic interneurons segregated into 3 significant clusters with a slightly improved clustering of the NOS+/NPY+ interneurons and a similar separation of the two PV+ populations to the larger analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). With the removal of NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, the segregation of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn- interneurons was largely maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). When only the 4 measures of interneuron locking were used in the analysis, PV+ interneurons were segregated into two significant clusters with &gt;85% correlation with Scgn expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).

Six measures of interneuron firing regularity/pattern (Log ISI 10, Log ISI 50, Log ISI 85, mean firing rate, CV2 ratio and CV2 mean; see Materials and methods) were used for clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10Aii</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>). When these 6 parameters were analyzed across all interneuron populations, 4 significant clusters emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>).

Here we demonstrate that, in rats and primates, co-expression (or lack thereof) of a second calcium-binding protein, secretagogin, divides PV+ interneurons into two functionally-specialized subpopulations by virtue of their different structural, topographical and physiological properties.</p><p>Neurons of the same cell type deliver identical neuroactive substances to a matching range of postsynaptic targets in the same temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Somogyi, 2010</xref>). These properties can be defined using molecular, structural and physiological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature et al., 2008</xref>). Exemplars of the utility of such a multi-level definition of GABAergic cell type include the discrimination of myriad types of hippocampal interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>) and the cellular dichotomy recently revealed in the external globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mallet et al., 2012</xref>). In both of these cases, a specific combination of molecular markers can be used as the primary or sufficient indicators of the unique set of structural and physiological properties. Combinations of markers have also proved useful for parsing some types of GABAergic interneuron in the rodent striatum. For example, interneurons expressing NPY can be separated according to whether or not they also express NOS and/or somatostatin; those expressing NPY, but not NOS, have a completely distinctive anatomical and physiological phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ibanez-Sandoval et al., 2011</xref>) and specific role in the microcircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">English et al., 2012</xref>) as compared to NPY+/NOS+ interneurons. In contrast, striatal PV+ interneurons have generally been treated as a homogenous population. The findings presented here describing the molecular profiles, distribution, structure and firing of striatal PV+ interneurons converge to suggest that striatal PV+ interneurons in rats and monkeys comprise at least two discrete cell types. The unsupervised cluster analysis of PV+ interneuron firing during cortical activation suggested this heterogeneity may extend further.</p><p>We compared PV and Scgn expression across three species in which the amino acid sequence of Scgn is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gartner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pruitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zierhut et al., 2005</xref>). While PV+/Scgn+ interneurons constituted around 30% and 75% of all PV+ interneurons in rats and primates respectively, Scgn was only expressed by a small minority of PV+ interneurons (&lt;1%) in mice. Because Scgn-expressing neurons could be observed in other brain regions of mice, the scarcity of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in mouse striatum was thus unlikely to be due to a technical/detection issue. The paucity of Scgn co-expression in mouse PV+ interneurons suggests the molecular diversity we elucidate here does not tally with that defined by the selective, but more widespread, expression of serotonin receptor subunit 3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Munoz-Manchado et al., 2016</xref>). However, it would be important to test in the future whether Scgn expression in rat and primate striatum correlates with expression of this receptor subunit. It is possible that mouse striatum still contains a sub-population of PV+ interneurons that have the same anatomical and physiological properties as the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in rats. Even if this scenario were true, however, the fact that such mouse interneurons lack Scgn suggests they would handle calcium differently compared to rat/primate interneurons that co-express Scgn. Moreover, given the increasing use of genetically-altered mice for identifying and manipulating specific neuronal populations based on their selective gene expression, the finding that a combination of molecular markers is so prominent in the rat and primate but absent in the mouse striatum is noteworthy. Indeed, further study of the functional properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons using, for example, cell-type-specific optical or pharmacogenetic methods, would likely require a double-transgenic rat, the generation of which would present a considerable technical challenge. However, this does not alter the likelihood that, although many elements of striatal circuits are likely conserved across mice, rats and primates, a focus on mice as a model organism could potentially miss important substrates of interneuron diversity that are conserved along different phylogenetic paths.</p><p>The corticostriatal projection is topographically organized and (depending on the precise cortical areas of origin) partly overlapping, with different striatal territories receiving specific combinations of cortical afferents that impart diverse functionality. As the predominant excitatory (glutamatergic) input to striatal PV+ interneurons is from cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lapper et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramanathan et al., 2002</xref>), the origin of these inputs is likely to be particularly important in defining their function. In rat, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were distributed across the entire striatum, but their density dramatically increased in caudal aspects (such that they outnumbered PV+/Scgn- interneurons by &gt;10 to 1). These caudal striatal territories receive converging inputs from, in particular, most areas of prefrontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoover and Vertes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>), entorhinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>), prelimbic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faull et al., 1986</xref>) and auditory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGeorge and Faull, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were evenly distributed throughout striatum, with the exception of caudal territories where they were sparse. Thus, corticostriatal neurons in areas of rat cortex that heavily innervate caudal striatum could gain privileged access to PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. On the other hand, in rostral and central territories of striatum, which receive denser and more widespread inputs from somatosensory and motor cortical areas, PV+/Scgn- interneurons outnumbered PV+/Scgn+ interneurons by at least 3:1. Thus, corticostriatal neurons in ‘somato-motor’ areas of rat cortex are particularly well positioned to engage PV+/Scgn- interneurons.</p><p>Primate corticostriatal projections differ in several ways to those of rats and mice. The somatosensory/motor cortical areas in primates comprise a far smaller fraction of the entire cortical mantle than in rodents, particularly in relation to prefrontal, association and visual cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brodmann, 1909</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner and Krienen, 2013</xref>). In line with this change in relative cortical volume, combinations of afferents from prefrontal, association and visual cortices of primates innervate large areas of the caudate and putamen across most of their rostro-caudal axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calzavara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeterian and Pandya, 1998</xref>), whereas corticostriatal neurons in motor and somatosensory cortical areas primarily target the lateral putamen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flaherty and Graybiel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inase et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parent and Parent, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takada et al., 1998</xref>). These differences in the sources and sizes of corticostriatal innervation are partly correlated with the relative densities and distributions of the two populations of striatal PV+ interneurons in the primate. Unlike in the rat, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in primates were three times as dense as PV+/Scgn- interneurons across the entire rostro-caudal extent of striatum. In further contrast to the rat, PV+/Scgn- interneurons were clustered in lateral aspects of the putamen. Thus, the relative switch in prevalence of the two PV+ interneuron populations in the two species is roughly in line with the relative difference in prevalence of somatosensory/motor corticostriatal projections versus prefrontal, associative, visual and auditory corticostriatal projections. There was another notable similarity between rat and macaque, namely that the density of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons increased in caudal territories. Both rat caudal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faull et al., 1986</xref>) and primate caudal caudate receive dense inputs from visual cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gattass et al., 2014</xref>), which could possibly explain this shared relationship.</p><p>In hippocampus, PV is expressed by at least four distinct types of GABAergic interneuron (axo-axonic, basket, bistratified and O-LM cells) that selectively innervate different compartments of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). Approximately 50% of PV-immunoreactive terminals in the striatum form symmetric synapses with putative SPN somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett and Bolam, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kita et al., 1990</xref>). While some of these terminals could originate from neurons in external globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bevan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mallet et al., 2012</xref>), a much larger proportion are likely to originate from PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koos and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</xref>). Thus, PV+ interneurons in striatum have generally been thought to play a similar circuit role to basket cells in cortex. We found that, as compared to outputs of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, the PV+/Scgn- interneurons formed almost twice as many putative somatic synapses and formed more appositions on a given SPN soma. From our experiments, we can only speculate on the identities of other targets innervated by PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons. While it seems likely that these interneurons form some synapses with SPN dendrites, we cannot rule out that the somata and/or dendrites of interneurons are also targeted. Whatever their targets, our results suggest that different subpopulations of striatal PV+ interneuron could also underlie the considerable variability in the cellular compartments targeted by individual PV+ interneuron axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubota and Kawaguchi, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The targeting of SPN somata is an important factor in the ability of PV+ interneurons to powerfully inhibit SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Planert et al., 2010</xref>). Bursts of spikes in PV+ interneurons can considerably delay or even prevent SPN spiking, and inhibition mediated by PV+ interneurons is considerably stronger than that mediated by other GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koos and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Planert et al., 2010</xref>). We demonstrate that the axon of a single PV+ interneuron most commonly forms 2–4 putative synapses with a single SPN soma. Thus, in addition to several PV+ interneurons forming basket-like contacts with an SPN soma, our results indicate that an axon from an individual PV+ interneuron can form sufficient synaptic contacts to powerfully inhibit a single SPN.</p><p>In vitro electrophysiological recordings in mice have suggested that PV+ interneurons provide either approximately equal inhibition to dSPNs and iSPNs, or have a slightly greater influence on dSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Planert et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that the innervation of SPNs by PV+ interneurons in the rat and primate is considerably more complex. In the context of targeting SPN somata, we found that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons had a considerable bias towards innervating iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. The terminals of corticostriatal neurons show little selectivity for the two SPN populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kress et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wall et al., 2013</xref>). The biased innervation of SPNs by two different types of PV+ interneuron may, therefore, provide a novel mechanism through which corticostriatal neurons can selectively influence one or the other output pathway. The utility of this mechanism would be further enhanced by the high sensitivity of PV+ interneurons to cortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mallet et al., 2005</xref>) and/or by any differences in the temporal organisation of PV+/Scgn- and PV/Scgn+ interneuron activities. We observed that the firing of these two types of PV+ interneuron was temporally distinct with respect to the slow oscillations present in the striatum during SWA; PV+/Scgn- interneurons fired earlier than PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. Selective innervation of iSPNs by PV+/Scgn- interneurons might thus explain why the firing of iSPNs was delayed compared to that of dSPNs. In contrast, the relative timing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing and dSPN firing would not be consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory circuit. In the future, in vitro recordings of synaptically-connected pairs of PV+ interneurons and SPNs should provide further insights into the predicted functional impact of the selective targeting of the somata of dSPNs and iSPNs.</p><p>Innervation of the somatic compartments of pyramidal neurons by some types of cortical PV+ interneurons is a key factor contributing to the role of these interneurons in the generation of network oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). The strong temporal relationships between the firing of PV+ interneurons or FSIs to cortical oscillations is also well described in striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berke, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2009</xref>). Thus, it was notable that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons displayed differences in the incidence, strengths and timings of their phase-locked firing to different cortical rhythms. This could be the result of these two interneuron populations receiving different cortical inputs with different oscillatory signatures. Alternatively, variance in the intrinsic properties of these interneurons could result in a different output in response to the same oscillatory inputs. Whatever the underlying mechanism, our results highlight that the physiological differences of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons extend to their disparate engagement in behaviorally-relevant network oscillations in the corticostriatal circuit. In addition, the firing pattern within the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons was as similar to each other as to that of cholinergic interneurons, which have relatively homogenous firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, PV+/Scgn- interneurons displayed considerable variability in their firing patterns, which could indicate that they represent more than one subtype of interneuron.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that PV+/Scgn- interneurons and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons play different roles in the feedforward inhibition of striatal outputs, which are in turn likely to underpin specialized contributions to the control of behavior. A recent study in mice demonstrated feedforward inhibition of SPNs in striosomes, but not matrix compartment, of rostro-medial striatum by afferents from prelimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>). Optogenetic manipulation of this corticostriatal/inhibitory-interneuron pathway specifically altered performance in cost/benefit decision making, illustrating that inhibitory interneurons can enable cortical afferents from a single area to selectively mediate a subset of striatal outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that PV+/Scgn+ interneurons may instantiate a similar mechanism, whereby associative, visual and auditory cortical inputs can selectively inhibit dSPNs. Consistent with this idea, the caudal striatum of rats has been shown to mediate the association of auditory stimuli with rewarding actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>). The proliferation of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in the macaque striatum could reflect the increase in such decision-making capabilities required by the corticostriatal system of primates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Indirect immunofluorescence of rat and mouse tissue</title><p>The experimental procedures described below were carried out using 36 adult (3–4 months old, 280–350 g) male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River) and 7 adult (3–4 months old) C57Bl/6J male mice (Charles River) in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (UK). After being deeply anaesthetized using isoflurane (4% v/v in oxygen), each rat was given a lethal dose of pentobarbitone (1.3g/kg; i.p.) and transcardially perfused with approximately 50 ml of 0.05 M phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4 (PBS), followed by 300 ml of fixative (4% w/v paraformaldehyde with 0.1% w/v glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH7.4 (PB)).

A version of design-based stereology, the ‘modified optical fractionator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2015</xref>), was used to generate unbiased cell counts, determine the relative expression of molecular markers, and map distributions of striatal interneurons. In all procedures performed, the accuracy of these estimates was ensured by performing counts throughout the entirety of the striatum within a given rostro-caudal plane. This allowed for an accurate description of their distribution within the striatum. The analysis of dorsal striatal expression of specific molecular markers was performed using 13 coronal striatal planes in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>). For protocols performed using mouse striatum, 9 coronal planes were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franklin and Paxinos, 2008</xref>). As our aim was to investigate the distribution of interneurons across specific coronal planes in a quantitatively and statistically robust manner, chosen sections from all animals were matched with one another such that sections representing the same distance from Bregma (±50 µm) were chosen. This ensured that the results from all animals studied could be averaged to produce more accurate results regarding the number of counted neurons within a given coronal plane.</p><p>Once the chosen striatal coronal planes were identified and the immunofluorescence protocol carried out, the dorsal striatum was delineated using a Zeiss Imager M2 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, AxioImager.M2) equipped with a 20X (Numerical Aperture = 0.8) objective and StereoInvestigator v9.0 software (MBF Biosciences). In order to image each fluorescence channel, the following sets of filter cubes were used: AMCA (excitation 299–392 nm, beamsplitter 395 nm, emission 420–470 nm); AlexaFluor-488 (excitation 450–490 nm, beamsplitter 495 nm, emission 500–550 nm); Cy3 (excitation 532–558 nm, beamsplitter 570 nm, emission 570–640 nm); and DyLight 649 (excitation 625–655 nm, beamsplitter 660 nm, emission 665–715 nm). Imaging was subsequently performed by capturing a series of completely tessellated, z-stacked images (each 1 µm thick) at depths from 2 to 12 µm from the upper surface of each section at the level of the striatum (thereby defining a 10 µm-thick optical disector). As counts were performed across the entirety of the dorsal striatum within a given rostro-caudal plane, the grid size and counting frame were set to the same size of 420 x 320 µm. In order to calculate the coefficient of error associated with each count (CE – also referred to as the Gundersen coefficient), the point counting method option of the StereoInvestigator 9.0 software (MBF Biosciences) was applied. In all trials, the mean CE was 0.03.</p><p>To minimize confounds arising from surface irregularities, neuropil within a 2 µm ‘guard zone’ at the upper surface was not imaged. A neuron was counted if the top of its nucleus came into focus within the disector. If the nucleus was already in focus at the top of the 10 µm-thick optical disector the neuron was excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>). As strongly fluorescent cytoplasmic/nuclear markers can obscure nuclear boundaries, delineation of these boundaries was achieved when necessary by incubating the tissue for 10 min in a solution (1:100,000) of the DNA dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For a given molecular marker, X, positive immunoreactivity (confirmed expression) is denoted as X+ while undetectable immunoreactivity (no expression) was denoted as X–. In all fluorescence analyses a neuron was classified as not expressing the tested marker only when positive immunoreactivity could be observed in other cells on the same optical section as the neuron in question. Each immunofluorescence protocol was repeated in a minimum of three adult rats/mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Calculations of section area, volume and estimates of total cell number</title><p>Once the number of neurons expressing a marker or markers had been counted and recorded for a given coronal plane, the volume of the striatum in which these neurons had been counted (i.e. the optical disector) was first calculated. The cross-sectional area of a given delineated region was calculated using StereoInvestigator 9.0 software (MBF Biosciences). Since each set of counts was performed within the confines of an optical disector of a depth of 10 µm, the cross sectional area could be multiplied by this depth in order to obtain the volume of striatum in which the counts were performed for a given section. Because each count represents the total number of immunoreactive neurons (i.e. it is not an estimate) within this volume, dividing this number by the calculated volume yields the absolute density of immunoreactive neurons in that specific volume.</p><p>In order to calculate an estimate of the total number of neurons in the striatum, the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oorschot, 1996</xref>) was used:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where N is the estimate for the total number of neurons in the structure, Nv is the numerical or volume density and V(ref) is the volume of that structure.</p><p>The volume of the dorsal striatum in rats and mice was calculated using the Cavalieri direct volume estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gundersen and Jensen, 1987</xref>) with the following equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oorschot, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">West, 1999</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where P is the number of points counted within a delineated contour, a(p) is the area represented by each point and t is the fixed distance between each section. When calculated in this manner across the striatum of 9 rats, the mean volume of the dorsal striatum was determined to be 23.2 ± 2.1 mm<sup>3</sup>. This value is similar to previous estimations for the volume of the dorsal striatum in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oorschot, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rymar et al., 2004</xref>). In a similar manner, the mean volume of the dorsal striatum of 3 mice was calculated to be 9.40 ± 0.29 mm<sup>3</sup>. Once the value of V(ref) for the dorsal striatum in each animal is determined, multiplying that volume by the absolute neuronal density yields an estimate for the total number of neurons for that animal. Because most neuronal counts were performed across 3 animals (a sample that is typical of stereological studies), in depth statistics were deemed inappropriate, and so the value calculated from each animal is plotted along with the mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Topographical and statistical analysis of interneuron distribution</title><p>In order to gain a quantitative understanding of any spatial biases in cell distributions, data obtained using StereoInvestigator regarding the position of individual interneurons and the volume of striatum imaged in a given coronal section were imported into MATLAB software (Mathworks, version: R2014b) for analyses with well-established Matlab toolboxes (see below). Due to the striatum’s irregular shape across its 3 dimensions, horizontal and vertical lines were first 'drawn' from the position of each interneuron within a given coronal plane to the contours of striatum. Each interneuron was then assigned a value of between -1 and 1 according to its relative distance from the lateral and medial borders of striatum at that same coronal plane and to its distance from dorsal and ventral borders. A value of 0 indicated that an interneuron was positioned equidistantly from both striatal borders (e.g. the medial and lateral borders of striatum for the medio-lateral axis). Notably, all distance values were calculated according to the first points along the striatal contours that were contacted by the horizontal and vertical lines drawn from each interneurons position. In this manner, the definition of 'medial' and 'lateral' striatum was shifted depending on the position of the interneuron in the dorso-ventral plane; due to the irregular shape of the striatum. Likewise, the definition of 'dorsal' and 'ventral' striatum was also shifted depending on an interneuron’s position in the medio-lateral plane.</p><p>As each counted interneuron in a section is given a value for each axis analyzed, and these values were subsequently pooled together, the sample size was large enough for the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test in order to determine if the mean relative value of a neural population in a given coronal plane differed significantly from 0, a value indicating an unbiased distribution along a given axis. In order to compare the mean positional values of two different interneuron populations along the medio-lateral or dorso-ventral axis within a given coronal plane, the Mann-Whitney U test was performed. When a section contained ≤5 neurons of a given type, positional analysis was not performed in either plane as variance became too great to give meaningful averages. Multiple comparisons were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method in order to avoid false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noble, 2009</xref>). The minimum significance level for all statistical tests was taken to be p≤0.05. To compare the variance in the distribution of neurons in the medio-lateral and dorso-ventral planes across the rostrocaudal axis, the difference in the mean normalised ML and DV values for a single coronal section and all other coronal sections was averaged. The absolute value of this measure could then be used to compare the variances of ML and DV positions of different interneuron types across different species using a Kruskal Wallis ANOVA. This measure was thus sensitive to changes in the mean position across the different coronal sections, but would yield low values if there was a consistent bias across all sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Preparation of monkey tissue for indirect immunofluorescence</title><p>Monkey tissue used for stereological cell counting was obtained from two female adult rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, 4.5–8.5kg) from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center colony.

Wound margins were infiltrated with local anesthetic (0.5% w/v bupivacaine; Astra). A stereotaxic frame (Kopf) was used to fix the animal in place, and a homeothermic heating device (Harvard Apparatus) was used to maintain the animal’s temperature at 37 ± 0.5°C.

Prior to acquisition, recordings of the ECoG subsequently underwent bandpass filtration (0.3–1500 Hz, −3dB limits) and amplification (2000X; DPA-2FS filter/amplifier; npi electronic). Using a computer-controlled stepper motor (IVM-1000; Scientifica), glass electrodes (10–30 MΩ in situ with a tip diameter of approximately 1.5 μm) filled with a 0.5 M solution of NaCl containing neurobiotin (1.5% w/v; Vector Laboratories) were lowered into the dorsal striatum under stereotaxic guidance. The depth of the electrode was constantly monitored and recorded at a resolution of 0.1 μm. Action potentials of striatal neurons (i.e. single-unit activity) were subsequently recorded after being amplified (Axoprobe-1A amplifier; Molecular Devices), AC-coupled, bandpass filtered at 300–5000 Hz (DPA-2FS filter/amplifier) and then amplified one more time by a factor of one hundred.

The initial molecular marker tested was guided by the labeled cell’s somatodendritic structure, and once a positive expression for one of these markers was established, no other classical marker was tested since these molecules are rarely co-expressed, except for NOS and NPY (Kawaguchi et al., 1995).

For each section, absence of bleed through or cross talk between channels was investigated and was ensured by taking sequential and separate images. Importantly, neurons were declared 'negative' for a given marker if other neurons along the same focal plane were shown to express the marker under investigation.

We included only those neurons that fired ≥40 spikes during the analyzed epoch. Phase histograms were constructed using 20 phase bins and used to construct pseudocolor plots of probability of firing as a function of phase for each frequency band. These neurons were then tested for significant phase-locked firing in each frequency band (defined as having p&lt;0.05 in Rayleigh’s Uniformity Test). The null hypothesis for Rayleigh’s test was that the spike data were distributed in a uniform manner. The power of the ECoG in the SWA band was compared in data epochs used for analyses of phase-locked striatal neuron firing to test whether they were significantly different between groups. For frequencies below 5 Hz, Rayleigh tests were only carried out after any phase non-uniformities of the slow oscillations were corrected with the empirical cumulative distribution function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>iLFP peak histogram analysis</title><p>To investigate the timing of the activity of different striatal neuron populations in relation to local synchronized events, we calculated histograms of action potential firing times in relation to the slow oscillation (~1 Hz) present in the LFP recorded in striatum (using the same glass electrode that was used to simultaneously record single-unit activity). The polarity of the LFP was inverted (iLFP) so that peaks in the slow oscillation would correspond to the synchronized peaks in the membrane potential of many SPNs, often referred to as 'up states' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goto and O'Donnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 1990</xref>). iLFP signals containing robust SWA were first filtered, using a neutral-phase bandpass filter (2nd order Butterworth filter) between 0.4 and 1.6 Hz. The instantaneous phase of the LFP slow oscillation the analytic signal obtained via the Hilbert transform. iLFP peaks were then defined as the period between each trough (i.e. –π to π). Each iLFP peak was then divided in to 100 time bins, irrespective of the total length of the peak in time, and a histogram of action potential firing was calculated for over these time bins (nominally assigned values from −1 to 1). Using this 'normalized time' approach, the time of action potential firing was not dependent on the duration of the iLFP peak, which can vary considerably between cycles. iLFP peaks that were shorter or longer than the period corresponding to the boundaries of the filter (i.e. 0.625 s and 2.5 s) were discarded. The median firing time of all spikes on the normalized time scale was used to compare the relationship of each neuronal population to the iLFP peak using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks with post-hoc Dunn tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Hierarchical cluster analysis</title><p>Unsupervised clustering was performed to define the degree to which interneuron types could be segregated by their electrophysiological activity and the correlation between this functional segregation and their molecular identity. Clustering was performed using squared Euclidean distance in multidimensional space with Ward’s linkage method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sosulina et al., 2010</xref>). The number of clusters was established using a resampling variant of Thorndike’s method, whereby the largest difference between successive within-cluster distances was used to determine the cutoff point. Clustering was performed on 10000 surrogate data sets created by randomly shuffling the value for each electrophysiological parameter and the differences between within cluster distances calculated for each surrogate. This null distribution, therefore, gave the within-cluster differences that would occur if the electrophysiological parameters were distributed randomly and was used to calculate p-values for the real data (i.e. the probability that the difference between successive within-cluster distances occurred by chance). The threshold for cluster separation was taken as the midpoint between the two within-cluster distances whose difference produced the lowest p-value &lt; 0.05. Importantly for this study, using this criteria allowed for there to be a result where there were no significant clusters (i.e no p-value below 0.05).</p><p>Separate analyses were performed for SWA and cortical activation as interneuron rate, pattern and locking to cortical oscillations vary considerably between these brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al, 2012</xref>). For SWA the following parameters were included in the analysis: the log of the 10th percentile of interspike interval (Log. ISI 10), the ratio of the proportion CV2 values lower than 0.2 and higher than 1.85 (CV2 ratio), the median firing time of spikes in relation normalized iLFP peak (iLFP peak), the vector length of the phases of all action potentials in relation to the ECoG slow (0.4–1.6 Hz), spindle (7–12 Hz) and gamma (30-48 Hz) oscillations (ECoG SWA vec, ECoG spin. vec, ECoG gam vec., respectively). For cortical activation, Log. ISI 10 and CV2 ratio were also used in addition to the log of the 50th percentile of interspike interval (Log. ISI 50), the log of the 85th percentile of interspike interval (Log. ISI 85), the mean of the CV2 (CV2 mean) and the mean firing rate (Rate). These parameters were chosen based on their ability to separate previously established categories of striatal interneuron with well-defined molecular, structural, and electrophysiological features, (cholinergic/choline acetyltransferase-expressing (ChAT+) interneurons, GABAergic nitric oxide synthase /neuropeptide Y-expressing (NOS+/NPY+) interneurons and PV+ interneurons, irrespective of Scgn-expression), and were based on previous analyses of the firing of these of these cell types in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharott et al, 2012</xref>). This approach allowed us to evaluate the clustering of PV+/Scgn+ against well-established interneuron types using parameters that were generally effective for classifying interneurons, rather than being selected to discriminate specific populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Identification and quantification of axonal boutons of juxacellularly-labeled interneurons</title><p>After in vivo recordings and effective juxtacellular labeling of select interneurons, all sections containing intense Cy3 signal for neurobiotin were isolated. The section(s) containing the cell body were separated from those containing neurobiotin-filled dendrites or axons. These cell body containing sections were then subject to tests for PV and Scgn immunohistochemistry in order to determine whether the labeled cell expressed one, both or neither of these proteins. If a cell was determined to be PV+/Scgn+ or PV+/Scgn-, all sections containing the neurobiotin filled axons of the corresponding cell were incubated with the following primary antibodies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for details): goat anti-DARPP-32, rabbit anti-preproenkephalin (PPE) and mouse anti-gephyrin using the same 2-step incubation method described above for stereological cell counting. As simultaneous detection of these 3 markers (in addition to the detection of the neurobiotin signal) was not possible due to technical limitations, some axon containing sections were incubated with antibodies against DARPP-32 and gephyrin while others were incubated with antibodies against DARPP-32 and PPE. The presence of a DARPP-32 signal was used to mark the somata of spiny projection neurons. Gephyrin, a post-synaptic protein involved in the anchoring of inhibitory receptors to the neuron’s cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charrier et al., 2006</xref>) was used as a marker of putative GABAergic synapses. For protocols involving DARPP-32 and gephyrin detection of gephyrin expression at the point of contact between a neurobiotin-filled axon bouton and the edge of the DARPP-32 signal was used as indirect evidence of the existence of synapses between axonal boutons and SPN somata. For protocols involving DARPP-32 and PPE, the expression of PPE was used to determine whether a DARPP-32 expressing SPN was of the direct pathway (PPE-) or indirect pathway (PPE+).</p><p>After one final wash in PBS, each section was mounted on a glass slide in Vectashield and multiple single-plane confocal images (or stacks) were acquired using a 1 µm optical disector and a 63X objective lens (Numerical Aperture = 1.4) of a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 710). Appropriate sets of laser beams and emission windows were used for Alexa Fluor 488 and DyLight 488 (excitation 488 nm, emission 492–544 nm), Cy3 (excitation 543 nm, emission 552–639 nm), and Cy5 and DyLight649 (excitation 633 nm, emission 639–757 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis and quantification of appositions made by the axons of identified interneurons</title><p>Captured images of axon containing sections were analyzed using Zeiss imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, GmbH). Sections incubated with antibodies against DARPP-32 and gephyrin were analyzed in order to establish how often the swelling of an axonal bouton apposed to a DARPP-32 expressing SPN soma was co-localized with a positive gephyrin signal, signifying that these appositions likely indicated the presence of putative synapses. Other sections containing neurobiotin-filled axons were incubated with antibodies against DARPP-32 and PPE. In such sections, putative synapses made between the axons of labelled interneurons and SPNs could not be identified using gephyrin, and appositions were instead defined when an axonal bouton (a swelling of the axon) was in close proximity (~0.1 µm) to the cell body of a DARPP-32+ SPN. These appositions could be viewed in 3 planes using the software to ensure that the swelling of the axon defined as a bouton was consistent in 3 dimensions and was not the result of overexposure of the neurobiotin signal. Appositions were established after verification that there were no detectable pixels between the cell body signal and the neurobiotin signal of the axonal bouton. For each section, the number of boutons on the neurobiotin-filled axon of an identified striatal interneuron was counted.</p><p>These counts included those boutons that apposed the cell bodies of SPNs as well as those that did not. In cases where a bouton contacted an SPN cell body, the expression of PPE (or lack thereof) was used to determine whether that SPN was of the direct pathway (PPE– SPN) or the indirect pathway (PPE+ SPN). The number of appositions with PPE– and PPE+ somata was counted along with the total number of PPE+ and PPE– SPNs that were positioned within a 30 µm radius from any neurobiotin filled axons.</p><p>In total, the neurobiotin-filled axons of 4 PV+/Scgn- and 4 PV+/Scgn+ interneurons were assessed in this manner, which allowed for the counting of 100 s of boutons. This encompassed all juxtacellularly-labelled neurons with well-labelled axon on 3 or more sections and any section from these neurons with ≥10 axonal swellings was included in 1 or more protocols. For each neuron, boutons were classified as either apposed to SPN cell bodies or not apposed. Those boutons that were apposed were further classified as apposed to PPE+ or PPE- cell bodies. The counts for each neuron were averaged with those of other neurons belonging to the same group (i.e. PV+/Scgn- or PV+/Scgn+). Statistical comparisons comparing whether one group significantly differed from another were performed using the Fisher exact test. The minimum significance level for these statistical tests was taken to be p≤0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Medical Research Council UK (MRC; awards MC_UU_12020/5 and MC_UU_12024/2 to PJM, and award MC_UU_12024/1 to AS), a Marie Curie European Re-integration Grant (SNAP-PD) awarded by the European Union, and the Wellcome Trust (Investigator Award 101821 to PJM).

They describe a differential anatomical distribution and proportion of this newly described striatal populations when comparing it to the PV positive /Scgn negative striatal interneurons in the rat. Interestingly they report a bigger proportion of the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneuron in the primate caudate-putamen. Furthermore by performing electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats they show that the spiking of the PV/Scgn positive vs. the PV positive /Scgn negative striatal interneuron is differently locked to cortical oscillations. Finally by performing elegant immunofluorescence experiments from some of the recorded/labeled cells in vivo they identify that the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneurons targeted preferentially the direct pathway SPN. Based on the analysis of the presented results, the fact that this newly described population of striatal interneurons is described in the absence of genetically modified manipulations in primates and rodents, and that the results fulfill the current requirements to describe a population of neurons (anatomical marker and functional specificities) make this reviewer incline to accept this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> considering the following comments and when stated further experiments.</p><p>1) The anatomical experiments presented in this manuscript are very convincing however a functional demonstration of the specific targeting of the newly described population of striatal interneurons on the direct pathway SPN is needed, otherwise this argument must be presented as a suggestion rather than a conclusion.</p><p>2) As in point 1 the argument to claim that the newly described PV/Scgn positive striatal interneurons target preferentially the dendrites rather than the soma must be addressed with functional experiments otherwise must be presented as suggestion rather than a conclusion.</p><p>3) There is a recently published paper by Muñoz-Manchado et al., (PMID: 25146369) describing that the PV striatal interneurons are composed of more than one single population of interneurons in mice (based on the expression of the 5HT receptor). The findings presented in that paper must be place into consideration when discussing here the PV/Scgn positive striatal cells as a new population of striatal interneurons and further discussion about which will be the requirements in the future to define a population of striatal interneurons may be included.</p><p>4) The description of the new population of PV/Scgn positive striatal cells in rats/primates but not in mice, raised the following: Does the absence of the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneuron in mice remain if using animals of different ages? Scgn has been used as marker for migrating cells. I noted that in the experiment presented rats were older than mice…</p><p>5) May a more complete anatomical comparison of the axonal and dendritic arborization be presented to judge whether the two different populations may impact on different quantities of SPN.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study investigates the properties of subpopulations of PV+ interneurons identified on the basis of co-expression of Secretagogin (Scgn) using anatomical and neurophysiological methods. The results demonstrate convincing anatomical and electrophysiological differences between the two neuron populations confirming that the differential expression of Scgn reveals the existence of functionally distinct cell types.</p><p>Critique:</p><p>This is an outstanding and highly interesting study, providing the first demonstration of the existence of a functionally significant division within the population of PV expressing striatal interneurons in the neostriatum. The demonstration of distinct PV+ neurons may help to clarify outstanding issues about the role of previously considered FSIs both in vitro and in vivo. The data are very high quality and the large number of observations provide extra confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>I have only minor points of criticism:</p><p>1) Since 1/4 of PV+ cells are Scgn+ and most of them are caudal, and further, as the Scgn- PV neurons are evenly distributed in the medial-lateral directions the observations seem to be at odds with the previously reported difference in PV cell density between the medial and lateral striatum. The authors should discuss why their results are different from previous observations (e.g.: Luk and Sadikot 2001; etc.).</p><p>2) It would be of great interest if the authors could comment on the morphological difference between the 2 types of PV neurons, in particular with respect to relative extent of axonal their arborization. Do these cell types correspond to the previously suggested local and extended FSIs (Kawaguchi 1993)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>A small set of calcium-binding proteins (CBPs e.g. calbindin, calretinin &amp; parvalbumin) has been traditionally used to label and categorize neuronal subpopulation – among them principal cells as well as interneurons. Facilitated by comparatively high expression levels and excellent commercially available antibodies, these makers are still very useful and popular – however mainly as heuristic tools. For advanced cell-type classification this small set of markers are not state-of-the-art anymore and have been succeeded by more comprehensive neuronal classifications based on in-depth and combined analysis of functional properties, connectivity and – importantly – co-expression of much larger gene set up to full single-cell transcriptomes.</p><p>As has been noted before (Mulder et al. 2009, PNAS) – sectretagogin (SCGN) is differentially co-expressed in certain neuronal populations across different species (mouse, rat, primate). However, with its functional significance remaining obscure, this fact remains little more than an oddity that is not unique to striatal interneurons as reported by Garas and colleagues. The differential regional distribution of SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ interneurons across the caudal-rostral axis of the striatum is interesting but – in the current state of the study – again does not lead to further insights or testable hypothesis. Thus, like many other results of this study – all technically sound and interesting findings in their own right – they are interesting starting points in need of further more focused exploration. The electrophysiological characterization of the SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ neurons presented by the authors and the respective coupling to cortical activity states does show partial overlap and argues rather for gradual differences between striatal interneurons than presenting a strong case for categorical differences – as for comparison is well established for distinct PV+ subpopulations in hippocampus. Also, the differential innervation of putative direct versus indirect pathway medium spiny neurons is another interesting starting point of an in depth study evaluation the functional consequences of this finding. In summary, this study is a – relatively loose – collection of interesting findings – however, none of them is really followed up to reveal important novel insights about distinct functional classes of striatal interneurons – expected to be delivered to warrant publication in a top journal and of interest to wide readership. As it stands, it is a useful data collection for experts interested in novel tools to segregate striatal interneurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16088.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The reviewers agree that there are distinct populations of PV interneurons in striatum, but there are concerns about using Scgn as the main marker for this division.

It should be noted, however, that not all data sets are amenable to such cluster analysis. We have now performed an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of the electrophysiological parameters of interneurons we recorded in vivo (see below). Although we were not able to perform a cluster analysis of our anatomical (cell count) data, we have nevertheless performed a new complementary analysis to address the spirit of the reviewer’s comment here. More specifically, we have now provided careful estimates of whether and to what extent the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons as a whole could be explained by the selective expression of Scgn (see Results subsection “Selective expression of secretagogin divides the PV+ interneuron population in rat striatum but not in mouse striatum”, last two paragraphs and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-J</xref>). We now show in rats that the distribution biases of all PV+ interneurons are similar to those of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, suggesting the presence of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons biases the entire PV+ interneuron population. In line with this, there was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of PV+/Scgn- interneurons. To further explore the notion that the biased distributions of rat PV+ interneurons can be largely explained by Scgn expression, we also analyzed the spatial distributions of all PV+ interneurons in the mouse dorsal striatum, which contains a tiny number of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. There was no consistent or strong bias in the relative positions of all PV+ interneurons in mice. Thus, we can now conclude from this new analysis, that: (1) the highly unusual spatial distribution of rat PV+/Scgn+ interneurons accounts for much of the non-uniform distribution of all PV+ interneurons in rats; and (2) mouse PV+ interneurons lack Scgn and are more uniformly distributed. Taken together, these data serve to reinforce that Scgn is a useful and highly relevant marker for dividing PV+ interneuron populations.</p><p>In our original submission, we provided evidence of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differing in several of their electrophysiological properties, suggesting they are discrete cell types. To increase confidence in these initial results, we have now performed an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses of the electrophysiological parameters of PV+ interneurons (omitting information as to whether or not they expressed Scgn) together with those of cholinergic interneurons and GABAergic interneurons that co-express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). We included ChAT+ interneurons and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons because they are widely accepted to be discrete cell types and, as such, can be used as comparators; if PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons can be distinguished to the same degree as ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons can be distinguished (from each other and/or from the subpopulations of PV+ interneurons), then this would support the notion that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are discrete cell types. Another key advantage of including ChAT+ and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons is that they facilitated the unbiased selection of the electrophysiological parameters to analyze; parameters were thus selected according to their utility for segregating one or more of the populations of ChAT+ interneurons, PV+ interneurons (as a whole) and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, rather than their ability to distinguish PV+/Scgn- from PV+/Scgn+ interneurons per se. The cluster analysis was performed with standard methods (Squared Euclidian Distance, Ward’s method) together with non-parametric resampling-based version of Thorndike's method to provide a probabilistic evaluation of the number of clusters (which, importantly, using this method could be 1. i.e. no segregation). As now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and reported in the Results (subsection “Hierarchical clustering of striatal interneurons using electrophysiological parameters is highly correlated with their molecular identities”), the cluster analysis showed that interneurons segregated into significant clusters. After assignment of molecular identities, it was evident that these clusters were predominantly composed of ChAT+ interneurons, NOS+/NPY+ interneurons, PV+/Scgn+ interneurons, and PV+/Scgn- interneurons, respectively. The cluster analysis also showed that PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons are as distinct from each other as either subpopulation is from NOS+/NPY+ or ChAT+ interneurons. In brief, these unsupervised cluster analyses confirm not only that PV+ interneurons can be segregated into two discrete groups on the basis of their electrophysiological properties alone (in two brain states), but also that these discrete interneuron groups differ with respect to their Scgn expression. Taken together, these data further support the notion that rat PV+ interneurons are comprised of two main subpopulations, and that selective expression of Scgn is a robust and useful metric for distinguishing between them.</p><p>We would like to emphasize for the reviewers that the recording and juxtacellular labelling of single interneurons in striatum in vivo is extremely challenging, not least because interneurons make up such a small proportion of all striatal cells. Indeed, the rat interneuron data we present in this paper required 100+ experiments carried out over 5+ years. Thus, it is reasonable to state that electrophysiological recordings from identified PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in mice are well beyond the scope of this study (and the journal’s timeline for re-submission). This being the case, we cannot explore a population division in mice beyond our careful quantification of Scgn expression. The results of our anatomical analysis are unambiguous; Scgn expression is very rare in mouse PV+ interneurons. However, we have taken care to state in the Discussion (third paragraph) that it is still possible that mouse striatum contains a sub-population of PV+ interneurons that have the same anatomical and physiological properties as the PV+/Scgn+ interneurons in rats.</p><p><italic>2) The reviewers suggest that the main claims of connectivity be checked electrophysiologically, namely a) the differential innervation of putative direct versus indirect pathway medium spiny neurons; and b) the claim that the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneurons target preferentially the dendrites rather than the soma.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for these interesting suggestions. We foresee that one might adopt in vitro and/or in vivo strategies to provide electrophysiological correlates of the selective innervation of iSPNs and dSPNs.</p><p>In terms of an in vitro strategy, intracellular recordings of synaptically-connected pairs of PV+ interneurons and SPNs in brain slices could provide important insights. However, with respect to our study, which is necessarily focused on the use of wildtype adult animals, there are several major obstacles to be overcome in such experiments: (1) PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- neurons in living slices cannot be visualised in advance to guide the recordings. This means that less than 1 in 100 intracellular recordings would yield an interneuron of the desired type. It would take much time to gather a sufficiently robust sample of interneurons; (2) There is a confounding combinatorial factor, in that 4 types of connection would have to be studied before firm conclusions could be drawn, i.e. PV+/Scgn- to dSPN, PV+/Scgn- to iSPN, PV+/Scgn+ to dSPN and PV+/Scgn+ to iSPN; (3) The synaptic connections in question are selective, not specific. This means that statistical verification of preferential connectivity would require many pairs exhibiting each of the 4 types of connection. (4) Synaptic connectivity can be sparse in slices. The relevant literature suggests that synaptic connectivity will not be detected in a substantial number of paired recordings; (5) The molecular identities of all record neurons would have to be verified post hoc; and (6) All recordings would have be made in slices taken from adult animals. In summary then, it is clear that such in vitro work is far beyond the technical and temporal scope of the current study. However, we have now highlighted in the Discussion (eighth paragraph) that, in the future, in vitro recordings of synaptically-connected pairs of neurons should provide useful insights.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ comment, we have thus adopted an in vivo strategy that does not necessitate paired or intracellular recordings of neurons. Our new experiments and analyses are not only designed to provide electrophysiological correlates of the selective innervation of iSPNs and dSPNs, but also to simultaneously address an influential concept, namely that striatal PV+ interneurons are considered to provide “feedforward” inhibition to SPNs. Our anatomical data suggest that PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons selectively innervate iSPNs and dSPNs, respectively. When our anatomical observations are placed within a framework of feedforward inhibition in vivo, one might predict that, first, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs, and secondly, that the firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons is more likely to precede the firing of dSPNs than iSPNs. To test these predictions, we have recorded robust samples of identified dSPNs and iSPNs in anesthetized rats during cortical SWA (i.e. under conditions identical to those under which the PV+ interneurons were recorded). We then quantitatively compared the spike timings of these SPNs with those of the PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. As now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and reported in the Results (subsection “PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differ in their temporal relationships with striatal projection neurons of the direct and indirect pathways”), we have discovered that: (1) the spike timings of dSPNs and iSPNs are distinct; (2) the spike timings of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons are distinct; (3) PV+/Scgn- interneurons fire significantly earlier than iSPNs but not dSPNs; and (4) PV+/Scgn+ interneurons do not fire before iSPNs or dSPNs. These electrophysiological data verify the first prediction above with respect to possible substrates for feedforward inhibition, that is, the firing of PV+/Scgn- interneurons is indeed more likely to precede the firing of iSPNs than dSPNs. This result is consistent with our anatomical data. The firing of PV+/Scgn+ interneuron firing with respect to dSPN firing is not consistent with a powerful feedforward inhibitory connection to either type of SPN. Again, this result resonates with our anatomical data showing that, although PV+/Scgn+ interneuron preferentially target dSPNs, these interneurons form fewer putative somatic synapses and fewer appositions on a given SPN soma. Taken together, these new experiments provide a compelling corroboration of our anatomical data, and further reinforce our original conclusion that the diverse properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons position them to fulfil different roles in the striatal circuit.</p><p>In the original submission, we were careful not to claim any preferential innervation of the dendrites of any striatal cell type. Nevertheless, in the Discussion (sixth paragraph), we have now made it clear that we can only speculate on the identities of other targets innervated by PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- interneurons.</p><p><italic>The reviewers assess that these data could be collected/analyzed in a timely manner.</italic></p><p><italic>Below are their individual comments for your benefit.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The anatomical experiments presented in this manuscript are very convincing however a functional demonstration of the specific targeting of the newly described population of striatal interneurons on the direct pathway SPN is needed, otherwise this argument must be presented as a suggestion rather than a conclusion.</italic></p><p>As described above, we have added a new data set (based on in vivo recordings of identified SPNs) that support some of our predictions of the functional impact of selective targeting of SPNs by PV+/Scgn- and PV/Scgn+ interneurons.

In the Discussion (third paragraph), we now put our findings in context of interneuron heterogeneity defined by selective expression of 5HT receptor subunits, and highlight some lines of investigation for the future.</p><p><italic>4) The description of the new population of PV/Scgn positive striatal cells in rats/primates but not in mice, raised the following: Does the absence of the PV/Scgn positive striatal interneuron in mice remain if using animals of different ages? Scgn has been used as marker for migrating cells. I noted that in the experiment presented rats were older than mice.</italic></p><p>In our original submission, we stated the age of the mice as 6 weeks. This was incorrect, please accept our apologies. The adult mice used in this study were 3-4 months old. We have now corrected this error in the Methods section (first paragraph). Importantly then, the ages of the mice and rats were equivalent, suggesting that the lack of Scgn expression in mouse striatum cannot be attributed to any potential differences in ‘developmental stage’. The focus of our paper is on adult animals; quantifying Scgn expression across the life course of multiple species is beyond the scope of this work.</p><p><italic>5) May a more complete anatomical comparison of the axonal and dendritic arborization be presented to judge whether the two different populations may impact on different quantities of SPN.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment here. However, we would like to emphasise that accurate reconstruction of the axons and dendrites of several PV+/Scgn+ interneurons as well as several PV+/Scgn- interneurons is needed to address this point. Drawing on our experience of cell reconstructions, and having consulted with experts in the field (Paul Bolam, Gilad Silberberg) who have attempted to reconstruct the axons of striatal PV+ interneurons, we conservatively estimate that each interneuron reconstruction would take several weeks of full-time work to complete. In short, the required constructions cannot be delivered in a timely manner and that would be compliant with the journal’s request to re-submit our paper within two months.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>I have only minor points of criticism:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Since 1/4 of PV+ cells are Scgn+ and most of them are caudal, and further, as the Scgn- PV neurons are evenly distributed in the medial-lateral directions the observations seem to be at odds with the previously reported difference in PV cell density between the medial and lateral striatum. The authors should discuss why their results are different from previous observations (e.g.: Luk and Sadikot 2001; etc.).</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point here: According to Luk &amp; Sadikot (2001), the density of PV+ interneurons in rat “dorsolateral striatum” is higher than that in “ventromedial striatum”. To address the reviewer’s comment, we have performed an additional analysis of the distributions of all PV+ interneurons irrespective of Scgn expression (as Luk &amp; Sadikot would have counted). The results of our new analysis are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-J</xref> and discussed in the Results subsection “Selective expression of secretagogin divides the PV+ interneuron population in rat striatum but not in mouse striatum”, last two paragraphs. In short, we found no quantitative evidence of a consistent or clear “dorsolateral” bias in the distribution of all PV+ interneurons in the striatum of rats. This discrepancy with respect to Luk &amp; Sadikot (2001) presumably arises from differences in the extent to which different regions of striatum were sampled as well as in the cell-counting methodologies/analyses used in each study. For example, we sampled from 13 coronal planes (rather than 1 plane as used by Luk &amp; Sadikot) and we calculated the relative position of each counted neuron in the mediolateral or dorsoventral axes (rather than calculate densities, which would require binning of counts into arbitrarily defined areas, such as the “quadrants” used by Luk &amp; Sadikot). Our method of quantifying biases in spatial distributions is comprehensive and objective, thus offering several advantages as compared to previous methods.</p><p><italic>2) It would be of great interest if the authors could comment on the morphological difference between the 2 types of PV neurons, in particular with respect to relative extent of axonal their arborization. Do these cell types correspond to the previously suggested local and extended FSIs (Kawaguchi 1993)?</italic></p><p>It would be premature for us to comment further on the structural properties of the interneurons we have recorded and labelled in vivo. Accurate reconstruction of the dendrites and axons of several PV+/Scgn+ interneurons as well as several PV+/Scgn- interneurons is needed to address this point (please see above for explanation why z-stacks are challenging and could be misleading). Drawing on our experience of cell reconstructions, and having consulted with experts in the field (Paul Bolam, Gilad Silberberg) who have attempted to reconstruct the axons of striatal PV+ interneurons, we conservatively estimate that each interneuron reconstruction would take several weeks of full-time work to complete. Given the journal’s request to re-submit our paper within two months, the required constructions cannot be delivered in a timely manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>A small set of calcium-binding proteins (CBPs e.g. calbindin, calretinin &amp; parvalbumin) has been traditionally used to label and categorize neuronal subpopulation – among them principal cells as well as interneurons. Facilitated by comparatively high expression levels and excellent commercially available antibodies, these makers are still very useful and popular – however mainly as heuristic tools. For advanced cell-type classification this small set of markers are not state-of-the-art anymore and have been succeeded by more comprehensive neuronal classifications based on in-depth and combined analysis of functional properties, connectivity and – importantly – co-expression of much larger gene set up to full single-cell transcriptomes.</italic></p><p><italic>As has been noted before (Mulder et al. 2009, PNAS) – sectretagogin (SCGN) is differentially co-expressed in certain neuronal populations across different species (mouse, rat, primate). However, with its functional significance remaining obscure, this fact remains little more than an oddity that is not unique to striatal interneurons as reported by Garas and colleagues. The differential regional distribution of SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ interneurons across the caudal-rostral axis of the striatum is interesting but – in the current state of the study – again does not lead to further insights or testable hypothesis. Thus, like many other results of this study – all technically sound and interesting findings in their own right – they are interesting starting points in need of further more focused exploration. The electrophysiological characterization of the SCGN+/PV+ and SCGN-/PV+ neurons presented by the authors and the respective coupling to cortical activity states does show partial overlap and argues rather for gradual differences between striatal interneurons than presenting a strong case for categorical differences – as for comparison is well established for distinct PV+ subpopulations in hippocampus. Also, the differential innervation of putative direct versus indirect pathway medium spiny neurons is another interesting starting point of an in depth study evaluation the functional consequences of this finding. In summary, this study is a – relatively loose – collection of interesting findings – however, none of them is really followed up to reveal important novel insights about distinct functional classes of striatal interneurons – expected to be delivered to warrant publication in a top journal and of interest to wide readership. As it stands, it is a useful data collection for experts interested in novel tools to segregate striatal interneurons.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the comprehensive classification of cell types often requires one to progress further than the analysis of a small set of molecular markers and thus, to employ a combined analysis of other functional properties such as electrophysiological activity and connectivity. We emphasise that this combined and correlative analysis is exactly what we have provided here for PV+ interneurons of the striatum. The advanced multidisciplinary approach we have used is not only rigorous and quantitative, but is also particularly well suited to deployment in studies of wildtype animals. Indeed, we view the comparative use of wildtype animals of three species to be a key strength of our paper. One can imagine using additional techniques if the appropriate genetically-altered animals were available for study (but, as we highlight in the Discussion, they are not available).</p><p>Although single-cell transcriptomics would add a new dimension, such an approach is not necessary or feasible in this study. With regards to necessity, our new hierarchical cluster analysis (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) has confirmed that not only can the PV+ interneuron population be segregated on the basis of physiological parameters alone, but also that this segregation correlates very well with the selective expression of just one additional marker, that is, secretagogin. Furthermore, our new anatomical analyses (see above and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) has verified that the non-uniform spatial distribution of all PV+ interneurons in rat striatum can be explained by selective Scgn expression. Thus, in support of our original conclusions, selective Scgn expression is sufficient for discriminating between functionally diverse subpopulations of PV+ interneurons. With respect to feasibility, it would not be possible to complete a transcriptomics analysis of striatal interneurons of three different species in a timely manner. Again, we are mindful that many applications of single-cell transcriptomics in the central nervous system rely on the use of genetically-altered animals. Indeed, laser-capture microdissection of striatal neurons in double-immunolabeled fixed tissue (as would currently be required to identify PV+/Scgn+ and PV/Scgn- neurons in wildtype animals) would be extremely challenging.</p><p>The differential regional distributions of PV+/Scgn+ and PV+/Scgn- has provided some key new insights, especially when one considers the topographical organisation of corticostriatal projections. We have endeavoured to be clear on this point in the Discussion. In further exploring this discovery, we have now tested and verified the hypothesis that the highly unusual distribution of PV+/Scgn+ interneurons can explain the non-uniform distribution all PV+ interneurons in striatum. Thus, our data will give further momentum to a growing notion that not all cell types are distributed equally in the striatum and thus, that the striatum is likely composed of a series of functionally-specialized ‘domains’.</p><p>Yes, there is partial overlap in the physiological properties of PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons. We have been clear to highlight this in the paper. Nevertheless our new cluster analysis shows that, based on electrophysiological parameters alone, PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons segregate to the same extent as other interneuron types that experts agree are enormously different (i.e. cholinergic interneurons and NOS+/NPY+ interneurons). It is a challenge to determine whether PV+ interneurons of the hippocampus would yield similarly clear results when subjected to a hierarchical cluster analysis; to our knowledge, we are the first to perform such an analysis on multiple types of interneurons recorded in vivo.</p><p>With respect to the functional consequences of a selective innervation of dSPNs and iSPNs, we have now followed up on our original observations by: (1) stating two firm predictions in the context of feedforward inhibition of SPNs; and (2) testing them with new vivo recordings of identified SPNs. See Results subsection “PV+/Scgn- and PV+/Scgn+ interneurons differ in their temporal relationships with striatal projection neurons of the direct and indirect pathways” and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. As we have detailed, our analysis of these new SPN recordings verified the prediction for PV+/Scgn- interneurons. The analysis did not validate a second prediction for PV+/Scgn+ neurons, but instead supported an important new concept, namely that PV+/Scgn+ interneurons might not be as well positioned as PV+/Scgn- interneurons to provide classical feedforward inhibition in the striatal microcircuit.</p><p>With our extensively revised paper, we have good reason to suggest that it provides the most detailed correlative ex vivo/in vivo analyses of the properties of striatal PV+ interneuron types to date. We have detailed a large number of novel insights. We have thus delivered much evidence of our paper being a cohesive account of important discoveries that will be of great interest to a wide audience.</p></body></sub-article></article>
