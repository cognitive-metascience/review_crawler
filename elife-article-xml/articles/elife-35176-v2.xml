CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72 seem to mediate proton transfer between enzyme and transporter, but CAII-His64, the central residue of the enzyme’s intramolecular proton shuttle, is not involved in proton shuttling between the two proteins. Instead, this residue mediates binding between MCT and CAII. Taken together, the results suggest that CAII features a moiety that exclusively mediates proton exchange with the MCT to facilitate transport activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>monocarboxylate transporter</kwd><kwd>proton antenna</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>breast cancer cells</kwd><kwd>proton-sensitive micro electrodes</kwd><kwd>pH imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE 4310/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Holger M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004346</institution-id><institution>Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz für Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>961-386261/957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Holger M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Initiative BioComp</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deitmer</surname><given-names>Joachim W</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Holger M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Landesschwerpunkt Membrantransport</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deitmer</surname><given-names>Joachim W</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Holger M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Carbonic anhydrase II features a surface proton antenna that exclusively mediates proton exchange with monocarboxylate transporters to facilitate proton-coupled lactate transport in cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many tumor cells, especially those that reside in a hypoxic environment, rely on glycolysis to meet their increased demand for energy and biosynthetic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulze and Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence, they produce considerable amounts of acid and lactate, which have to be removed from the cell so as to prevent intracellular lactacidosis and suffocation of their metabolism. Lactate efflux from cancer cells is mediated primarily by the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 (<italic>SLC16A1</italic>) and MCT4 (<italic>SLC16A3</italic>), both of which transport lactate together with a proton across the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poole and Halestrap, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). This MCT-mediated H<sup>+</sup> efflux can exacerbate extracellular acidification and thus support the formation of a hostile environment, which favors tumor growth and allows tumor cells to escape conventional cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy and Dewhirst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parks et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillies et al., 2012</xref>). Expression of MCT1 is not altered with varying oxygen tension, whereas expression of MCT4 has been shown to be upregulated in different cancer cells under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ullah et al., 2006</xref>). However, expression of the two isoforms strongly varies among different tumor species and cell lines. In the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, used in this study, lactate flux is exclusively mediated by MCT1 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another family of key proteins in tumor acid/base regulation is the carbonic anhydrases, which catalyze the reversible hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> to HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>. The role of the cancer-specific isoform CAIX in tumor development and progression has been studied extensively, but physiological data on CAII in cancer cells are still relatively scarce. CAII has been found in different types of brain tumors, with the most malignant species exhibiting the strongest expression. In addition, this isoform has been linked to poor prognosis in patients suffering from those tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parkkila et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haapasalo et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, CAII has been suggested to mediate the malignant behavior of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments on breast cancer cells demonstrated that CAII is upregulated in the highly tumorigenic MDA-MB-231 cell line when the cells are exposed to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mallory et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, a reduction in CAII expression was proposed to promote tumor cell motility and to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li X-J et al., 2012</xref>). CAII expression was also found to be associated with tumor differentiation and poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheng et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting a differential function of CAII in different tumor types.</p><p>Catalysis by CA involves two distinct and separate stages: the interconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> followed by the transfer of an H<sup>+</sup> to the bulk solution to regenerate the zinc-bound hydroxide, the latter being the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tu et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindskog, 1997</xref>). In CAII, the fastest of the α-CAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steiner et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boone et al., 2014</xref>), H<sup>+</sup> transfer between the zinc-bound water and the solvent surrounding the enzyme is facilitated by the side chain of His64, which shuttles H<sup>+</sup> between the bulk solvent and a network of well-ordered hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the enzyme’s active-site cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fisher et al., 2007a</xref>). Furthermore, the H<sup>+</sup> transfer efficiency of His64 is fine-tuned by several hydrophilic residues (Tyr7, Asn62 and Asn67), which contribute to the stabilization of the intervening water molecules within the active-site cavity and which influence the orientation and the pK<sub>a</sub> value of His64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher et al., 2007b</xref>). These activities mean that the His64 residue is essential for CAII to reach full enzymatic activity. On the basis of work using an algorithm for mapping proton wires in proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shinobu and Agmon (2009</xref>) proposed that the active site H<sup>+</sup> wire exits to the protein surface, and leads to Glu69 and Asp72 residues that are located on an electronegative patch on the rim of the active site cavity. On the basis of that observation, these authors proposed that positively charged, protonated buffer molecules dock in that area, from which a proton is delivered to the active site when the enzyme works in the dehydration direction.</p><p>Cytosolic CAII has been found to facilitate the transport function of various acid/base transporters including the Cl<sup>–</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> exchangers AE1 and AE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vince and Reithmeier, 1998</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sterling et al., 2001</xref>), the Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> cotransporters NBCe1 and NBCn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loiselle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becker and Deitmer, 2007</xref>), and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2006</xref>). Augmentation of acid/base transport by CAII requires both direct binding between transporter and enzyme and CAII catalytic activity, and the complex involved has been coined ‘transport metabolon’. The first evidence for a transport metabolon, formed between CAII and an acid/base transporter, was presented in 1993 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kifor et al. (1993</xref>) for the Cl<sup>–</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> exchanger AE1. CAII could be immunoprecipitated with AE1 when antiserum against the N-terminal of AE1 was used, whereas serum directed against the C-terminal of the transporter failed to immunoprecipitate CAII, suggesting that CAII physically binds to the C-terminal tail of AE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vince and Reithmeier, 1998</xref>). These findings were confirmed by affinity blotting and by a solid-phase binding assay with CAII and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the AE1 C-terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vince and Reithmeier, 1998</xref>). Single-site mutations identified the acidic cluster D<sup>887</sup>ADD in the C-terminal tail of AE1 as the binding site for CAII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vince and Reithmeier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vince et al., 2000</xref>). Binding of CAII to this cluster would tether the enzyme close to the transporter pore of AE1 near the inner cell surface. This location has been suggested to position CAII ideally to hydrate incoming CO<sub>2</sub> and to supply the AE1 transporter directly with a localized substrate pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vince and Reithmeier, 2000</xref>). Indeed, inhibition of CAII catalytic activity decreased the transport activity of AE1, which is heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, by up to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sterling et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>First evidence for a direct interaction between the Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter NBCe1 and CAII was presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gross et al. (2002)</xref>, based on isothermal titration calorimetry. In analogy to the CAII-binding cluster D<sup>887</sup>ADD found in AE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vince and Reithmeier, 2000</xref>), the cluster D<sup>986</sup>NDD within the C-terminal of NBCe1 was suggested as the putative CAII binding site. Functional interaction between NBCe1 and CAII was further shown by heterologous protein expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becker and Deitmer, 2007</xref>). Both injection and co-expression of CAII increased NBCe1-mediated membrane current, membrane conductance and Na<sup>+</sup> influx when CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> is applied in an ethoxzolamide-sensitive manner.</p><p>Evidence for an interaction between NHE1 and intracellular CAII was obtained by measuring the recovery from a CO<sub>2</sub>-induced acid load in AP1 cells transfected with NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Cotransfection of NHE1 with CAII almost doubled the rate of pH recovery as compared to that in cells expressing NHE1 alone, whereas cotransfection with the catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y even decreased the rate of pH recovery, indicating a physical interaction between NHE1 and catalytically active CAII. Physical interaction between the two proteins was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of heterologously expressed NHE1 and CAII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2002</xref>). A micro titer plate binding assay with a GST fusion protein of the NHE1 C-terminal tail revealed that CAII binds to the penultimate group of 13 amino acids of the C-terminal tail (R<sup>790</sup>IQRCLSDPGPHP), with the amino acids S<sup>796</sup> and D<sup>797</sup> playing an essential role in binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2006</xref>).</p><p>While a considerable amount of data indicates a physical and functional interaction between various acid/base transporters and carbonic anhydrases, several studies have also questioned such transport metabolons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al. (2006)</xref> did not observe a CAII-mediated increase in membrane conductance in NBCe1-expressing <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, even when fusing CAII to the C-terminal of NBCe1. In line with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamada et al. (2011)</xref> found no increase in the membrane current during application of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> when co-expressing wild-type NBCe1A or the mutant NBCe1-Δ65bp (lacking the putative CAII binding site D<sup>986</sup>NDD) with CAII. The concept of a physical interaction between HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> transporters and CAII has also been challenged by a binding study carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piermarini et al. (2007)</xref>. These authors were able to reproduce the findings of other groups by showing that sequences in the C-terminal tails of NBCe1, AE1 and NDCBE (SLC4A8) that are fused to GST can bind to immobilized CAII in a micro titer plate binding assay. However, when reversing the assay or using pure peptides, no increased binding of CAII to the immobilized GST fusion proteins could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piermarini et al., 2007</xref>). It was concluded that a bicarbonate transport metabolon may exist, but that CAII might not bind directly to the transporters. That CAII activity could improve substrate supply to bicarbonate transporters even without the requirement for a metabolon, or the involvement of direct physical interaction, was also pointed out in a study on AE1 transport activity by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Samir et al. (2013)</xref>. By using Förster resonance energy transfer measurements and immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged proteins, the authors showed no binding or close co-localization of AE1 and CAII. Functional measurements in red blood cells and theoretical modeling suggested that the transport activity of AE1 can be best supported by CAII, when the enzyme is equally distributed within the cell’s cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Samir et al., 2013</xref>). For detailed reviews on transport metabolons see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McMurtrie et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moraes and Reithmeier (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deitmer and Becker (2013)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Becker et al. (2014)</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that transport activity of MCT1 and MCT4 is enhanced by CAII, when the two proteins are heterologously co-expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becker et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker and Deitmer, 2008</xref>). In contrast to the transport metabolons described before, enhancement of MCT1/4 transport function is independent of the enzyme’s catalytic activity. Both, inhibition of CA catalytic activity with 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazolesulfonamide (EZA) and co-expression of MCT1/4 with the catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y failed to suppress the CAII-induced facilitation of MCT1/4 transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker and Deitmer, 2008</xref>). The first evidence that this non-catalytic interaction between MCT1/4 and CAII requires direct binding between the two proteins was provided by injection of CAII that was bound to an antibody prior to the injection. In this experiment, CAII was not able to enhance the transport activity of MCT1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, suggesting a sterical suppression of the interaction by the antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker and Deitmer, 2008</xref>). In the same study, truncation of the MCT1 C-terminal tail led to loss of the interaction between MCT1 and CAII in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker and Deitmer, 2008</xref>). By introduction of single site mutations in MCT1 and MCT4, the glutamic acidic clusters E<sup>489</sup>EE and E<sup>431</sup>EE within the C-terminal tail of MCT1 and MCT4, respectively, could be identified as binding sites for CAII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stridh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noor et al., 2015</xref>). In both studies, binding was confirmed both on the functional level by measuring MCT transport activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and by pull-down assays using GST-fusion proteins. Direct interaction between MCT1 and CAII was shown not only in vitro and by heterologous protein expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, but also in an in situ proximity ligation assay in mouse astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stridh et al., 2012</xref>). As CA catalytic activity is not required to facilitate MCT transport function, it was hypothesized that CAII might utilize parts of its intramolecular proton pathway to function as a proton antenna for the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almquist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). Protonatable residues with overlapping Coulomb cages could form proton-attractive domains and could share a proton at a very fast rate, exceeding the upper limit of diffusion-controlled reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ädelroth and Brzezinski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedman et al., 2005</xref>). When these residues are located in proteins or lipid head groups at the plasma membrane, they can collect protons from the solution and direct them to the entrance of a proton-transfer pathway of a membrane-anchored protein, a phenomenon termed a ‘proton-collecting antenna’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ädelroth and Brzezinski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brändén et al., 2006</xref>). The need for such a proton antenna is based on the observation that H<sup>+</sup> co-transporters, such as MCTs, extract H<sup>+</sup> from the surrounding area at rates well above the capacity of simple diffusion to replenish their immediate vicinity. Therefore, the transporter must exchange H<sup>+</sup> with protonatable sites at the plasma membrane, which could function as proton collectors for the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al., 2010</xref>). The finding that the mutant CAII-H64A, which is missing the central residue of the enzyme’s intramolecular proton shuttle, fails to facilitate MCT transport activity, led to the notion that CAII may function as a proton antenna for the MCT. In doing so, it would provide protons to or or subtract protons from the transporter via its intramolecular H<sup>+</sup> shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). In line with this, we showed recently that integration of a proton antenna, in the form of six histidine residues, into the C-terminal tail of MCT4 could facilitate MCT4 transport activity even in the absence of carbonic anhydrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noor et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The transport activity of MCTs was shown to be facilitated not only by intracellular CAII but also by the extracellular CA isoforms CAIV and CAIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klier et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). Hypoxia-regulated CAIX is considered to be a key protein in tumor acid/base regulation. CAIX, the expression of which is usually linked to poor prognosis, is tethered to the membrane by a transmembrane domain, with its catalytic center facing the extracellular site. Like other fast carbonic anhydrases, CAIX is equipped with an intramolecular proton shuttle for rapid exchange of H<sup>+</sup> between the catalytic center and the surrounding bulk solution. We were able to demonstrate that knockdown of CAIX with short interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced MCT1-mediated lactate transport in hypoxic MCF-7 cells, whereas inhibition of CA catalytic activity with EZA had no effect on MCT1 transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). Co-expression of MCT1/4 with CAIX in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes revealed that CAIX-mediated facilitation of MCT transport activity requires the enzyme's intramolecular proton shuttle, His200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of CAIX, but not inhibition of CA catalytic activity, reduced the proliferation of hypoxic MCF-7 cells, indicating that the CAIX-driven increase in lactate efflux is crucial for the proper functioning of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we investigated whether CAII can facilitate proton-driven lactate transport in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Knockdown of CAII, which is closely co-localized with MCT1 in MCF-7 cells, resulted in a significant reduction of MCT transport activity in both normoxic and hypoxic cells. We then further analyzed the molecular mechanism underlying the CAII-mediated facilitation of MCT transport activity. Our results showed that CAII features a moiety (Glu69 + Asp72) that exclusively mediates proton exchange with the transporter, while the central residue of its intramolecular proton shuttle (His64) mediates the binding of CAII to MCT1 and MCT4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intracellular CAII facilitates lactate transport in MCF-7 breast cancer cells</title><p>We have recently shown that extracellular CAIX facilitates lactate transport in hypoxic cancer cells by acting as a proton antenna for MCT1/4 at the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). As proton-driven lactate transport would also benefit from a proton antenna at the cytosolic face of the cell membrane, this work investigated whether proton–lactate co-transport in cancer cells is facilitated by intracellular CAII. We knocked down CAII in normoxic (20% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>) MCF-7 breast cancer cells using siRNA and determined MCT-mediated proton–lactate co-transport by measuring changes in intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) during the application and the removal of 3 and 10 mM lactate in the nominal absence of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Indeed, knockdown of CAII resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of change in pH<sub>i</sub> (ΔpH<sub>i</sub>/Δt) both during the application and the removal of lactate, indicating a decrease in the lactate transport rate with reduced CAII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Interestingly, reduction in transport activity was more pronounced in hypoxic cells than under normoxic conditions (25%–33% reduced in normoxic cells, 47–57% reduced in hypoxic cells), even though the expression of CAII, in contrast to CAIX, is not upregulated under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). A possible reason for this effect might be that the increase in proton–lactate transport, mediated by extracellular CAIX under hypoxia, challenges the need for a faster proton supply at the intracellular site. The knockdown efficiency of CAII was checked by qRT-PCR and by western blot analysis, showing a 60% reduction in normoxic and hypoxic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate whether the CAII-induced augmentation in MCT1 transport activity requires the catalytic activity of the enzyme, lactate transport in MCF-7 cells can be determined in the presence of the CA inhibitor EZA. We used this experiment in a recent study on MCF-7 cells with the same settings as those used in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). In that study, application of 30 µM EZA had no effect on lactate transport, as measured with the lactate-sensitive FRET nanosensor Laconic in normoxic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">San Martín et al., 2013</xref>) and by determining the rate of change in intracellular pH in hypoxic MCF-7 cells.

As EZA did not alter lactate transport in MCF-7 cells under any condition, it can be concluded that the observed reduction in lactate transport by knockdown of CAII is independent of the enzyme’s catalytic activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35176.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CAII facilitates lactate-induced proton flux in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Original recordings of lactate-induced changes in intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in normoxic (<bold>A</bold>) and hypoxic (<bold>B</bold>) MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with either negative control siRNA (control, black traces) or CAII-siRNA (CAII knockdown, blue traces).

To check whether chemical rescue of the H<sup>+</sup> shuttle in CAII-E69Q and CAII-D72N can also restore the functional interaction between these mutants and MCT1, we injected 4-methylimidazole (4-MI) into oocytes co-expressing MCT1 and CAII-E69Q/CAII-D72N.

From this model, the authors proposed that positively charged, protonated buffer molecules could dock in that area, from which a proton is delivered to the active site to facilitate catalytic activity. To investigate whether Glu69 and Asp72 play a role in CAII catalytic function, we determined CAII catalytic activity in oocyte lysates by gas analysis mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). CA catalytic activity is determined by the ‘log enrichment’ (LE), which is influenced by the rates of both the hydration and dehydration of CO<sub>2</sub> (see Materials and methods). Therefore a change in LE indicates changes of CA catalytic activity in both the hydration and the dehydration reaction. Mutation of CAII-Glu69, Asp71, or Asp72 did not alter CAII catalytic activity, whereas mutation of CAII-His64 (the central residue of the CAII intramolecular H<sup>+</sup> shuttle) resulted in a 78% reduction in CA activity as compared to that of CAII-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Even when both Glu69 and Asp72 were mutated together (CAII-E69Q/D72N), no alterations in CAII catalytic activity could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The results from the mass spectrometry were confirmed my measuring Δ[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/Δt in CAII-expressing oocytes during the application and removal of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>. Expression of CAII resulted in a significant increase in Δ[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/Δt, as compared to that of native oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Mutation of CAII-Glu69, Asp71, Asp72, or double mutation of Glu69/Asp72, resulted in no significant change in CA activity, neither during the application nor during the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>. Only mutation of CAII-His64 induced a significant decrease in catalytic activity. These data indicate that neither Glu69 nor Asp72 are required for full catalytic activity in CAII. Interestingly, mutation of His64 to Ala reduced CAII catalytic activity to 25%, when measured by gas analysis mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but only to 50%, when measured by Δ[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/Δt in intact oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).

As CA catalytic activity is not required to facilitate MCT transport function, we hypothesized that CAII might utilize parts of its intramolecular proton pathway to function as a proton antenna for the transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almquist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). The proton pathway of CAII consists of a water wire, coordinated by Asn62 and Asn67, which extends from the active site to the histidine residue at position 64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fisher et al., 2007a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">, 2007b</xref>). From there, the proton is passed on between the imidazole ring in His64 and exogenous buffer molecules surrounding the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fisher et al., 2007a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">, 2007b</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shinobu and Agmon (2009</xref>) presented a model in which the active site H<sup>+</sup> wire exits to the protein surface and leads to Glu69 and Asp72, which are located in an electronegative patch on the rim of the active-site cavity. On the basis of this model, the authors proposed that positively charged, protonated buffer molecules could dock in that area, from which a proton is delivered to the active site when the enzyme works in the dehydration direction. However, this assumption is based purely on mathematical modelling and has, to our knowledge, not yet been evaluated experimentally. In the present study, we were able to show that both Glu69 and Asp72 are essential for CAII-mediated facilitation of MCT1/4 transport activity, in both the influx and the efflux direction. Mutation of Glu69 and Asp72 did not, however, alter CAII catalytic activity, as demonstrated in vitro by gas analysis mass spectrometry and in vivo by determining the rate of change in intracellular H<sup>+</sup> concentration in oocytes during the application and removal of CO<sub>2</sub>. These results suggest that this proton-collecting moiety is not involved in the facilitation of CAII catalytic activity, but rather mediates a second, independent function, which is the rapid supply and removal of protons from the pore of the adjacent transporter, rendering CAII a <italic>bona fide</italic> proton antenna. Whether this kind of interaction only exists between CAII and MCTs, or whether CAII could also function as proton antenna for other proton-coupled membrane transporters, such as proton-coupled amino acid transporters or Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers, remains to be shown.</p><p>Our previous studies had shown that CAII-mediated facilitation of MCT transport activity requires CAII-His64, which mediates the exchange of protons between the catalytic center and the surrounding bulk solution during the CAII catalytic cycle. Our structural models suggested, however, that His64 mediates binding of CAII to Glu489/Glu491 in MCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stridh et al., 2012</xref>) and to Glu431/Glu433 in MCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Noor et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate whether His64 mediates binding or proton shuttling between MCT and CAII, or both, we exchanged the histidine at position 64 to either alanine or lysine. Mutation of His to Ala should disable both intramolecular H<sup>+</sup> shuttling in CAII and binding of the enzyme to the glutamate residues in MCT1/4. Mutation of His to Lys also disables H<sup>+</sup> shuttling, as lysine has a considerably higher pK<sub>a</sub> than the imidazole ring in histidine, which does not allow fast protonation/deprotonation reactions at physiological pH. However, lysine should still be able to form hydrogen bonds with the glutamate residues in the C-terminal tail of MCT1 and MCT4, and should therefore still enable CAII to bind to the transporter. Although MCT transport activity was not enhanced by CAII-H64A, CAII-H64K facilitated MCT transport activity to the same extent as CAII-WT. These results allowed us to conclude that His64 may not be involved in proton transfer between MCT and CAII, but instead mediates binding of the enzyme to the transporter's C-terminal tail. However, as CAII-H64K still displayed a higher catalytic activity than CAII-H64A, we cannot rule out the possibility that CAII-H64K retains some proton shuttling activity. Indeed, it has been shown that lysine residues that are buried in the protein interior could display considerably lower pK<sub>a</sub> values than in those that are exposed to water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isom et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it might be possible that CAII-H64K can retain enough shuttling activity to facilitate MCT-mediated lactate transport.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that CAII facilitates MCT transport activity by a mechanism that is completely different from the catalytic activity. Catalytic activity of CAII is facilitated by proton shuttling via His64, whereas Glu69 and Asp72 are ineffective in supporting CA activity. When interacting with MCT1/4, His64 does function as binding site, whereas proton transfer between transporter and enzyme seems to be mediated by Glu69 and Asp72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35176.029</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Carbonic anhydrases function as proton antennae for MCTs in glycolytic cancer cells.</title><p>Intracellular CAII (blue circle) is anchored to the C-terminal tail of MCT1/4 (purple structure) via CAII-His64 (yellow spot). This binding brings CAII close enough to the transporter pore to allow the shuttling of protons between the transporter and the surrounding protonatable residues (orange circles). Proton shuttling is mediated by CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72 (red and green dots). Under hypoxic conditions, CAIX (green circle) binds to MCT1 and MCT4 via their chaperon CD147 (ochre structure) to facilitate the exchange of protons between transporter and extracellular protonatable residues (orange circles) via its proteoglycan-like (PG) domain in a fashion similar to that involving Glu69 and Asp72 in CAII. The necessity for this proton antenna derives from the slow diffusion of H<sup>+</sup> within the highly buffered cytosol. Lactate, which is produced from glucose (entering the cell by facilitated diffusion via glucose transporters (light blue structure)) by glycolysis and subsequent conversion of pyruvate, quickly reaches the MCT by simple diffusion. Protons, which are produced during the hydrolysis of ATP, by contrast, diffuse very slowly within the cell. To allow fast extrusion of protons and lactate from the cell, the MCT does not extract H<sup>+</sup> directly from the bulk cytosol but rather from an intermediate harvesting compartment made up of protonatable residues in the cell membrane and CAII. As in the cytoplasm, the diffusion of ions in the extracellular space is restricted. Therefore protons have to be removed from the extracellular side of the transporter by CAIX and shuttled to protonatable residues on the extracellular face of the cell membrane, from where they can be released to the extracellular space. By this non-catalytic mechanism, intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrases could cooperate non-enzymatically to facilitate proton-driven lactate flux across the cell membrane of cancer cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35176-fig10-v2"/></fig><p>The physiological need for CAII's role as a proton antenna for MCTs might derive from the low apparent diffusion rate of protons in a strongly buffered solutionsuch as the cytosol. By applying a mathematical model of Brownian diffusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al. (2010</xref>) determined the maximum supply capacity of substrates to various transporters and enzymes. For MCT1, they calculated that the diffusion rate of lactate, which is present in the cell at concentrations within the millimolar range, exceeds the turnover rate of the transporter by several magnitudes. This supports the notion that, for this molecule, the cytosol is a well-mixed compartment. For protons, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al. (2010</xref>) calculated that the maximum supply rate is approximately 15 times lower than the apparent turnover rate of MCT1, as calculated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ovens et al. (2010a</xref>). In other words, the model demonstrates that MCT1 extracts H<sup>+</sup> from the cytosol at rates well above the capacity for simple diffusion to replenish its immediate vicinity. This paradoxical result implies that the transporter does not extract H<sup>+</sup> substrates directly from the bulk cytosol, but from an intermediate ‘harvesting’ compartment located between the aqueous phase and the transport site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al., 2010</xref>). The findings of the present study suggest that CAII could serve as such a harvester, which captures protons from protonatable residues at the plasma membrane and funnels them to the transporter pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). If this is the case, then CAII would counteract the local depletion of protons in the direct vicinity of the transporter and thus would support transport activity. As the direction of proton movement depends on the ion gradient, this principle can be applied both in the influx and in the efflux direction. In the case of proton/lactate efflux, CAII would harvest H<sup>+</sup> from protonatable residues near the plasma membrane and shuttle them to the transporter. In the case of proton/lactate influx, CAII would capture the protons from the transporter pore and distribute them to protonatable residues near the plasma membrane, following the electrochemical H<sup>+</sup> gradient. Indeed, we have previously been able to show that protons that are focally applied to MCT1-expressing oocytes moved faster along the inner face of the plasma membrane when CAII was injected, suggesting that CAII could allocate H<sup>+</sup> along the plasma membrane and thereby increase the area in which H<sup>+</sup> can be released from the membrane into the bulk solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becker and Deitmer, 2008</xref>). In this case, CAII would counteract the accumulation of protons at the transporter pore, which would result in a reduction in transport activity in the influx direction.</p><p>Even though the mathematical model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martínez et al. (2010</xref>) suggests a 15-fold lower supply rate of H<sup>+</sup>, our measurements in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes have shown that CAII enhances the transport activity of MCT1 and MCT4 by ‘only’ around two fold. This implies that, in the absence of CAII, MCT transport activity is either facilitated by other proton-collecting molecules or — more likely — that MCTs are already able to extract protons from adjacent protonatable sites, even though not as efficiently as when cooperating with CAII.</p><p>The relevance of this proton antenna for proper cell function becomes evident from our physiological experiments on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. First, evidence for a functional interaction between MCT and CAII comes from the finding that knockdown of CAII reduces lactate transport in MCF-7 cells. We can rule out the possibility that this decrease in transport activity is due to a loss of CAII catalytic activity as, in a recent study, we were able to show that inhibition of CA activity by application of EZA did not alter lactate flux in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it can be assumed that CAII facilitates lactate flux in cancer cells by a non-catalytic, direct interaction. Indeed, CAII is in close co-localization with MCT1 in MCF-7 cells, as shown by an in situ proximity ligation assay. Thus, it appears likely that CAII can form a protein complex with MCT1 in these cells to facilitate lactate flux by functioning as a proton antenna for the transporter. In line with these findings, we previously showed that CAII also facilitates lactate transport in mouse cerebellar and white matter astrocytes, independent of the enzyme’s catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stridh et al., 2012</xref>). As in the cancer cells, MCT1 and CAII are in close proximity in astrocytes, as shown by in situ PLA. Interestingly, colocalization could only be detected when an antibody directed against the intracellular loop between TM 6 and 7 of MCT1 was used. When the PLA was carried out using an antibody against the C-terminal of MCT1, which carries the CAII binding site, no proximity between MCT1 and CAII could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stridh et al., 2012</xref>). Astrocytes are highly glycolytic cells, which are widely believed to export lactate as an energy fuel for adjacent neurons, a phenomenon coined an ‘Astrocyte-to-Neuron Lactate Shuttle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Magistretti, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barros and Deitmer, 2010</xref>). These findings infer that CA-mediated facilitation of MCT1/4 transport activity might be a more general, or at least common, phenomenon in glycolytic cells that have to extrude large amounts of lactate.</p><p>In the present study, knockdown of CAII resulted in a more pronounced reduction in MCT1 transport activity in hypoxic than in normoxic cancer cells, but even so, the expression of CAII was not increased under hypoxia. This effect might be attributed to extracellular CAIX, which functions as a proton antenna for MCT1 in MCF-7 cells under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>). CAIX operates only on the extracellular side of the membrane, which might lead to the formation of a proton micro-domain on the cytosolic side of the membrane in the absence of intracellular CAII because the supply or removal of H<sup>+</sup> is enhanced on the extracellular side, leading to an increase in MCT transport activity. This would result in increased accumulation or depletion of H<sup>+</sup> at the cytosolic side, depending on transport direction, which would impair MCT transport rate. With a proton antenna on both sides of the membrane, formation of H<sup>+</sup> microdomains would be suppressed both at the cis- and at the trans-side. In such a scenario, extracellular CAIX and intracellular CAII would cooperate by a ‘push and pull principle’, providing protons to the transporter on one side and removing them on the other side of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Through this mechanism, intracellular CAII and extracellular CAIX could cooperate to enhance lactate transport in cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. As CAIX is already expressed in normoxic MCF-7 cells at a low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>), this push and pull principle could also occur in normoxic cells, though to a lower extent. The lower, yet robust, expression of extracellular CAIX under normoxia could also explain the reduced effect of CAII knockdown on lactate transport in normoxic MCF-7 cells. In line with this notion, we previously found in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes that intracellular CAII can also work in concert with another extracellular carbonic anhydrase, CAIV, to ensure rapid shuttling of protons and lactate across the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In CAII, H<sup>+</sup> shuttling between enzyme and transporter is mediated by Glu69 and Asp72. CAIX seems to lack an analogue moiety within its catalytic domain. However, it features a 59-amino-acid long proteoglycan-like (PG) domain that is unique to CAIX among the CA family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pastorek and Pastorekova, 2015</xref>). The PG domain of human CAIX contains 18 glutamate and eight aspartate residues that have been suggested to function as an intramolecular proton buffer, which could support CAIX catalytic activity when operating in an acidic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innocenti et al., 2009</xref>). We were recently able to show that both the truncation of the CAIX PG domain and the application of a PG-binding antibody (M75) decreased CAIX-induced facilitation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 2018</xref>). Those findings led us to the conclusion that the CAIX PG domain could function as an extracellular proton antenna for monocarboxylate transporters within the acidic environment of a solid tumor.</p><p>The importance of CAII for cell viability was demonstrated by a cell proliferation assay. Knockdown of CAII reduced the proliferation of MCF-7 cells to the same extent as did full inhibition of lactate transport with AR-C155858, whereas inhibition of CA catalytic activity with EZA had no effect on proliferation. These results correspond to previous findings that knockdown of CAIX or interference with the CAIX PG domain by an antibody, but not inhibition of CA catalytic activity, decreases cell proliferation in hypoxic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jamali et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 2018</xref>). Apparently, removal of the proton antenna on one side of the membrane is sufficient to reduce MCT-mediated proton/lactate efflux from the cell. This in turn could lead to intracellular lactacidosis and impairment of metabolism, which will ultimately result in a decrease in cell proliferation.</p><p>Knockdown of CAII decreased, but did not abolish, lactate transport in MCF-7 cells. However, knockdown of CAII decreased cell proliferation to the same extend as did inhibition of MCT1 transport activity with AR-C155858. This striking effect of CAII knockdown on normoxic and hypoxic cells suggests that the CAII protein might have another role in cell proliferation, which is beyond its function as a facilitator of lactate efflux. As cell proliferation is not decreased by the inhibition of CA activity with EZA, the supporting effect of CAII seems to be independent of the enzyme’s catalytic activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al. (2015</xref>) showed that knockdown of CAII in NCI-H727 and A549 cancer cell lines resulted in significant reduction in clonogenicity in vitro, and in marked suppression of tumor growth in vivo. By using an apoptosis gene array, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al. (2015</xref>) found a novel association of CAII-mediated apoptosis with specific mitochondrial apoptosis–associated proteins. These findings suggest that the CAII protein has multiple functions within the cell, including cellular acid/base regulation, facilitation of lactate transport, and regulation of apoptosis.</p><p>In summary, our results show that CAII supports lactate flux in cancer cells, presumably by functioning as a proton antenna for MCTs. Therefore, CAII features a molecular moiety that exclusively mediates proton exchange with the transporter, while parts of its intramolecular proton shuttle, which is pivotal for catalytic activity, mediates binding to the MCT.

SNARF-5F is a ratiometric pH indicator that exhibits a significant pH-dependent emission shift from yellow-orange to deep red fluorescence when switching from acidic to alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han and Burgess, 2010</xref>). With a pK<sub>a</sub> of 7.2, SNARF-5 is recommended for measuring cytosolic pH<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han and Burgess, 2010</xref>). The fluorescence emission spectrum of SNARF-5 has an isosbestic point at ~590 nm. The isosbestic point is the wavelength at which the fluorescence emission of SNARF-5 does not change under varying pH values, which provides the possibility of ratiometric imaging. For ratiometric imaging, SNARF-5 was excited at 555 nm with a scanning frequency of 0.4 Hz. The emitted light was separated with a variable dichroic mirror at 590 nm in a &lt; 590 nm and a &gt; 590 nm fraction, and the signals of the &lt;590 nm fraction were divided by the signals of the &gt;590 nm fraction.</p><p>MCF-7 cells were loaded with 10 µM of the acetoxymethyl ester of SNARF 5 for 10–15 min at room temperature in a 35 × 10 mm tissue culture dish, which was also used as the bath chamber. Loading efficiency was checked by taking snapshots from time to time in the setup. After loading, cells were constantly perfused with medium at room temperature at a rate of 2 ml/min using a tubing system. The medium had the following composition: 143 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)−1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.2. In lactate-containing media, NaCl was substituted by Na-L-lactate in equimolar amounts. To measure the rate of lactate-induced acidification reproducibly, cells were depleted of lactate for at least 15 min prior to lactate application. For application of lactate, the application tube was switched between different beakers containing the desired solutions.</p><p>Data analysis was carried out with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA). For analysis, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3 A3</xref>).

After calibration of the pH-sensitive electrode, the bath perfusion was stopped and a single oocyte was placed into the bath. The reference and current clamp electrodes were first impaled into the oocyte. Then the pH-sensitive electrode was impaled and positioned onto the ‘front’ of the oocyte membrane, directly into the direction of flow of the bath perfusion. As the diffusion of protons within the cell is very slow, it is very important to position the pH-sensitive microelectrode as close as possible to the inner face of the plasma membrane, in order to measure fast changes in intracellular H<sup>+</sup>-concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bröer et al., 1998</xref>). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25°C). During the whole experiment, the oocyte was superfused with oocyte saline at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a tubing system. For application of lactate and CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> the application tube was switched between different beakers containing the desired solutions. The measurements were stored digitally using custom-made PC software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neumann, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/General-Zoology/iClamp">https://github.com/General-Zoology/iClamp</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/iClamp">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/iClamp</ext-link>) based on the program LabView (National Instruments).

Afterwards, the pH values for every recorded data point were calculated using the formula pH = intercept + slope * V<sub>e</sub>.</p><p>Since pH is defined as –log ([H<sup>+</sup>]), the change in [H<sup>+</sup>] at a given change in pH depends on the baseline pH, which could lead to misinterpretation of the real change in proton concentration. For this reason, proton concentration was calculated using the formula:</p><p>[H<sup>+</sup>] = 10<sup>–pH</sup> x 10<sup>9</sup> (nM) for every recorded data point.</p><p>Transport activity of the MCT was then determined by measuring the rate of change in [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (Δ[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/Δt) during the application or removal of substrate by linear fitting.</p><p>To make sure that the change in [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during the application of lactate is the result of MCT transport activity and does not depend on the passive diffusion of lactic acid or on endogenous lactate transporters, we previously determined Δ[H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>/Δt during the application of lactate to <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes injected with H<sub>2</sub>O instead of cRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2004</xref>).

In brief, the C-termini of MCT1 and MCT4 were cloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare Europe GmbH) and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.8 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG). 3 hr after induction, the cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in lysis buffer (PBS, supplemented with 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets from Roche). Bacterial lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C and 12,000 x g, and the supernatant containing the GST-fusion protein (bait protein) was collected for further use. CAII-WT or mutants of CAII were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. For each experiment, 25 oocytes were lysed in lysis buffer.

Briefly, for immobilization of GST-fusion protein, bacterial lysate was added to glutathione agarose and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. fter incubation, the excess bait protein was removed by centrifugation and the beads were washed five times with wash buffer (1 PBS: one lysis buffer). 400 µl of oocyte lysate, containing CAII, was added to the column and incubated for 2 hr at 4°C with end-over-end mixing. After incubation, the excess prey protein was removed by centrifugation and the beads were washed five times with wash buffer. Protein was eluted from the beads with 250 μl of elution buffer (10 mM glutathione in PBS, pH 8.0).</p><p>To determine the relative amount of GST and CAII, an equal volume of the samples was analyzed by western blotting. GST was detected using a primary anti-GST antibody (dilution 1:400; anti-GST tag mouse monoclonal IgG, no. 05–782, Millipore) and a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:2000; sc-2031, Santa Cruz). CAII was detected using primary anti-CAII antibody (dilution 1:400; rabbit anti-carbonic anhydrase II polyclonal antibody, AB1828, Millipore) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:2000; Santa Cruz). Quantification of the band intensity was carried out with the software ImageJ. To overcome variations in the signal intensity between different blots, the signal intensity of each band for CAII was normalized to the signal intensity of the band from the pull-down of CAII-WT with the GST-fusion protein of the C-terminal tail. To account for variations in the amount of GST-fusion protein, each normalized signal for CAII was divided by the corresponding normalized signal for GST.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Determination of CA catalytic activity via mass spectrometry</title><p>The catalytic activity of CAII in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes was determined by monitoring the <sup>18</sup>O depletion of doubly labelled <sup>13</sup>C<sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub> through several hydration and dehydration steps of CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> at 24°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silverman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sültemeyer et al., 1990</xref>).

The relative <sup>18</sup>O enrichment was calculated from the measured 45, 47, and 49 abundance as a function of time according to: log enrichment = log (49 × 100/[49 + 47 + 45]). For the calculation of CA activity, the rate of <sup>18</sup>O degradation was obtained from the linear slope of the log enrichment over the time, using OriginPro 8.6. The rate was compared with the corresponding rate of the non-catalyzed reaction. Enzyme activity in units (U) was calculated from these two values as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badger and Price (1989)</xref>. From this definition, one unit corresponds to 100% stimulation of the non-catalyzed <sup>18</sup>O depletion of doubly labelled <sup>13</sup>C<sup>18</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. For each experiment, a batch of 20 native oocytes or 20 oocytes expressing CAII-WT or a mutant of CAIIwas lysed in 80 µl oocyte saline and pipetted into the cuvette.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matthew Vander Heiden as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jacques Pouyssegur (Reviewer #1); Robert Gillies (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors build on a large collection of past work related to the functional interactions between CAII, CAIV, CAIX and the reversible Lactate/H<sup>+</sup> transporters MCT1 and MCT4. They show that a physical interaction between intracellular CAII and MCT1 or MCT4 can enhance lactate transport across the cell membrane. This effect is independent of CAII catalytic activity, and mutagenesis studies argue that the protons resulting from the catalysis of the CA drive the transport of lactate. This allows them to generalize the concept of 'proton antenna' playing a facilitating role for lactate transport.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the study was well done, and noted that this built on a number of past studies. In light of this, it would be appropriate to more thoroughly discuss how these findings relate to past work and present a coherent model for how the CAs and MCTs function together.</p><p>The reviewers also noted that important controls were missing from some experiments, critically verification of CAII knockdown where appropriate.</p><p>While it was suggested that extending these studies to additional cell lines might be informative, this was not deemed to be essential. However, the reviewers agreed that assessing how CAII knockdown in MCF7 cells affects cell pH and proliferation would be appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This article completes a large collection of manuscripts published for almost fifteen years by Becker and Deitmer on the functional interactions between CAII, CAIV, CAIX and the reversible transporters Lactate/H<sup>+</sup> (MCT1 and MCT4). These authors have highlighted a positive cooperation exerted by the protons resulting from the catalysis of the CAs on the drive of the export or importation of lactate. Nevertheless this activation could take place independently of the active site of the CAs. This led them to propose and generalize the concept of 'proton antenna' playing a facilitating role of CAs for Lactic acid transport.</p><p>What is the novelty brought here by the authors between the already well explored CAII cytoplasmic form and the MCTs?</p><p>Firstly the authors demonstrate within breast cancer cells (MCF7) that CAII is co-localized with MCT1 by the Proximity Ligation Technique, PLA. Secondly they confirm that knockdown of CAII in these cells reduces the transport activity of MCT1. Then the authors focused on studying the molecular mechanisms of CAII and MCT1 interaction and of activation by exploiting Shinobu and Agmon algorithm for mapping H<sup>+</sup> wires in proteins.</p><p>They demonstrated that the His64 residue is not involved in the activation of MCTs by H<sup>+</sup> shuttling but in the molecular interaction with MCT. Moreover, they establish that the acidic residues Glu69 and Asp72 are neither involved in the interaction with MCT nor in the enzymatic activity of CAII but in contrast they play a key role in the dissipation of H<sup>+</sup> and the activation of MCTs.</p><p>In Conclusion, this work is remarkably well done with exemplary rigor and appropriate controls. These findings provide an insightful molecular and functional mechanistic model of CAs/MCTs cooperation supporting the criticized concept of 'metabolon'.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript investigates the physical interaction between intracellular CAII and Lactate transport via MCTs 1 and 4. The most impressive parts of this work is that they show convincingly that enhancement of lactate transport required physical interactions between CAII and the MCTs and was independent of CAII catalytic activity. This was shown by clever point mutagenesis of the catalytically active H64 to catalytically inactive H64A, which inhibits binding, and H64K, which does not (Figure 7). Proximity ligation assays (Figure 2) showed close apposition of CAII to MCF1 in MCF7 cells.</p><p>However, there are two major concerns:</p><p>1) The breast cancer story was limited to two figures with missing controls, and was inadequate. To be relevant to cancer, more cell lines could be investigated, along with the controls. Some impact on phenotype would also be required such as, &quot;What impact does CAII knockdown have on resting pH or pH control?&quot; &quot;What impact does stable knockdown or knockout of CAII have on cell or tumor growth?&quot; &quot;Are there breast cancer cells that do not express CAII?&quot;</p><p>2) The oocyte work, which technically elegant, appears to be somewhat incremental with respect to other work by this group. They have shown CAII and CAIX interactions with NBC and MCTs in the past using this approach. How does it all fit together? In the absence of other groups working on the CA-MCT-NBC proton wire, it is incumbent for this group, who are the world leaders in this, to synthesize a coherent message and quantitatively discuss the relevance and importance of these proton wires in physiology. For example, &quot;How do all of these MCTs, NBCs, and CAs fit and work together?&quot; &quot;Under what conditions would a deficiency in this behavior affect a cells' fitness and survivability?&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Noor et al. build on past work to show that intracellular CAII binding to MCT1 or MCT4 can enhance lactate transport across the cell membrane. They had previously shown that this effect was independent of the catalytic activity of CAII, and similar to what they had shown for extracellular CAIX binding to MCT1/4, they hypothesized that CAII acted as proton &quot;antenna&quot; to facilitate lactate/H<sup>+</sup> co-transport. This idea, and the residues involved, had also been supported by modeling efforts. Via analysis of various CAII mutants they provide evidence in support of this model, and identify specific residues on CAII that are important for proton transfer but are not involved in the catalytic activity of CAII. They also identify residues important for binding of CAII to MCT, and are not involved in proton shuttling.</p><p>Many of the ideas presented are based in prior work, and so there is some question of novelty here for a top journal. With that said, this is a very well done and interesting study and should be of interest.</p><p>The following should also be addressed:</p><p>A control is needed to confirm knockdown efficiency of CAII with siRNA. CAII expression is referred to in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, but I do not understand the data presentation to evaluate how CAII changes in hypoxia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35176.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the study was well done, and noted that this built on a number of past studies.

[…] Furthermore, knockdown of CAIX, but not inhibition of CA catalytic activity, reduced proliferation of hypoxic MCF-7 cells, indicating that the CAIX-driven increase in lactate efflux is crucial for proper function of cancer cells (Jamali et al., 2015).”</p><p>Furthermore we discussed how the findings in this study relate to our previous findings: “Our previous studies had shown that CAII-mediated facilitation of MCT transport activity requires CAII-His64, which mediates the exchange of protons between catalytic center and surrounding bulk solution during the CAII catalytic cycle. […] Those findings let us to the conclusion that the CAIX PG domain could function as extracellular proton antenna for monocarboxylate transporters within the acidic environment of a solid tumor.”</p><p>Finally we altered the model shown in Figure 10 to provide a more general description of how CAs can facilitate lactate flux in cancer cells: “Figure 10. Carbonic anhydrases function as proton antennae for MCTs in glycolytic cancer cells. Intracellular CAII (blue circle) is anchored to the C-terminal tail of MCT1/4 (raspberry structure) via CAII-His64 (yellow spot). […] By this non-catalytic mechanism intracellular and extracellular carbonic anhydrases could cooperate non-enzymatically to facilitate proton-driven lactate flux across the cell membrane of cancer cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also noted that important controls were missing from some experiments, critically verification of CAII knockdown where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We now checked expression of CAII in MCF-7 cells by western blot analysis. Quantification of the blots showed that application of siRNA decreased expression of CAII by approximately 60% in normoxic and hypoxic cells. These findings are now shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D and are described in the Results subsection “Intracellular CAII facilitates lactate transport in MCF-7 breast cancer cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it was suggested that extending these studies to additional cell lines might be informative, this was not deemed to be essential. However, the reviewers agreed that assessing how CAII knockdown in MCF7 cells affects cell pH and proliferation would be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We calculated the initial pH values and discussed the results in the Results section: “Knockdown of CAII decreased the basal pH<sub>i</sub>, as measured at the beginning of the experiment, by approximately 0.1 pH units, both in normoxic and in hypoxic MCF-7 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). […] From these results it can be concluded that the decrease in pH<sub>i</sub>, as induced by knockdown of CAII, seems to play only a minor role in the observed reduction in lactate transport.”</p><p>We also determined how CAII influences proliferation of MCF-7 cells (new Figure 3). Knockdown of CAII significantly decreased cell proliferation both under normoxia and hypoxia, while transfection with non-targeting negative control siRNA had no significant effects on cell proliferation. Interestingly, total inhibition of lactate transport with 300 nM of AR-C155858 decreased cell proliferation by the same degree as did knockdown of CAII. Inhibition of CAII catalytic activity with 30 µM EZA, however, had no effect on cell proliferation. We describe these findings in the Results subsection “CAII supports proliferation of cancer cells” and in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] However, there are two major concerns:</p><p>1) The breast cancer story was limited to two figures with missing controls, and was inadequate.

From these results it can be concluded that the decrease in pH<sub>i</sub>, as induced by knockdown of CAII, seems to play only a minor role in the observed reduction in lactate transport.”</p><p>We now determined how CAII influences proliferation of MCF-7 cells (new Figure 3). Indeed, knockdown of CAII significantly decreased cell proliferation both under normoxia and hypoxia, while transfection with non-targeting negative control siRNA had no significant effects on cell proliferation. Interestingly, total inhibition of lactate transport with 300 nM of AR-C155858 decreased cell proliferation by the same degree as did knockdown of CAII. Inhibition of CAII catalytic activity with 30 µM EZA, however, had no effect on cell proliferation. We describe these findings in the Results section: “To investigate whether the CAII-mediated augmentation in lactate flux facilitates cancer cell proliferation, we determined the number of MCF-7 cells kept under different conditions for up to three days (Figure 3A-D). […] The striking effect of CAII knockdown on normoxic and hypoxic cells suggests the possibility that the CAII protein might have yet another role in cell proliferation, in addition to its function as a facilitator of lactate efflux and its catalytic function in cellular pH regulation.”</p><p>The findings are further discussed in the Discussion section: “The importance of CAII for cell viability was demonstrated by a cell proliferation assay. Knockdown of CAII reduced proliferation of MCF-7 cells to the same extent as did full inhibition of lactate transport with AR-C155858, while inhibition of CA catalytic activity with EZA had no effect on proliferation. […] These findings suggest that the CAII protein features multiple functions within the cell, including cellular acid/base regulation, facilitation of lactate transport, and regulation of apoptosis.”</p><p>To our knowledge there is no study that explicitly demonstrated absence of CAII in a breast cancer cell line. Mallory et al. (2005) showed that CAII is upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of doxorubicin (as mentioned in the second paragraph of the Introduction section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The oocyte work, which technically elegant, appears to be somewhat incremental with respect to other work by this group.
