peptide ligands and cognate receptors are evolutionarily ancient regulators of physiology and behaviour. However, there are challenges associated with determination of orthology between neuropeptides in different taxa. Orthologs of vertebrate neuropeptide-Y (NPY) known as neuropeptide-F (NPF) have been identified in protostome invertebrates, whilst prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) and short neuropeptide-F (sNPF) have been identified as paralogs of NPY/NPF in vertebrates and protostomes, respectively. Here we investigated the occurrence of NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-related signalling systems in a deuterostome invertebrate phylum – the Echinodermata. Analysis of transcriptome/genome sequence data revealed loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling, but orthologs of PrRP-type neuropeptides and sNPF/PrRP-type receptors were identified in echinoderms. Furthermore, experimental studies revealed that the PrRP-type neuropeptide pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH<sub>2</sub> is a potent ligand for a sNPF/PrRP-type receptor in the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic>. Our findings indicate that PrRP-type and sNPF-type signalling systems are orthologous and originated as a paralog of NPY/NPF-type signalling in Urbilateria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>echinoderm</kwd><kwd>starfish</kwd><kwd>prolactin releaasing peptide</kwd><kwd>short neuropeptide-f</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M001644/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elphick</surname><given-names>Maurice R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M001032/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Alexandra M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>CONACyT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONACyT studentship no. 418612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yañez-Guerra</surname><given-names>Luis Alfonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2016-353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elphick</surname><given-names>Maurice R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Xingxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discovery of a novel neuropeptide signalling system in a deuterostome invertebrate reveals the evolutionary origin of prolactin-releasing peptide and its relationship with neuropeptides in protostome invertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropeptides are neuronally secreted signalling molecules that regulate many physiological processes and behaviours in animals, including feeding, digestion, reproduction and social behaviour. They typically exert effects by binding to cognate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on target cells, which leads to changes in the activity of downstream effectors (e.g. ion channels, enzymes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jékely et al., 2018</xref>). Investigation of the evolution of neuropeptide signalling has revealed that many of the neuropeptide systems found in vertebrates have orthologs in invertebrate deuterostomes (urochordates, cephalochordates, hemichordates, echinoderms) and protostomes (e.g. arthropods, nematodes, molluscs, annelids, platyhelminthes). Thus, the evolutionary origin of over thirty neuropeptide signalling systems has been traced back to the common ancestor of the Bilateria (Urbilateria) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elphick et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the neuropeptide systems that originated in Urbilateria is neuropeptide Y (NPY)-type signalling. NPY is a 36-residue peptide that was first isolated from the porcine hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tatemoto et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tatemoto, 1982</xref>) but which is also expressed by neurons in many other regions of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morris, 1989</xref>) and in peripheral organs such as the gut and cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farzi et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, NPY is pleiotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pedrazzini et al., 2003</xref>), although it is most widely known as a potent stimulant of food intake in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). NPY belongs to a family of related signalling molecules in vertebrates, including peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), which evolved from a common ancestral peptide by gene/genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larhammar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larhammar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elphick et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the sequences of NPY-type peptides are highly conserved across the vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Larhammar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larhammar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerdá-Reverter et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A neuropeptide in vertebrates that is related to NPY/PYY/PP-type peptides is prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), which was first discovered as a ligand for the orphan receptor hGR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hinuma et al., 1998</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that PrRP-type receptors are paralogs of NPY/PYY/PP-type receptors and it has been proposed that PrRP-type signalling originated in the vertebrate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lagerström et al., 2005</xref>). However, more recently, orthologs of vertebrate PrRP-type receptors have been identified in invertebrate deuterostomes - the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic> and the hemichordate <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic> - indicating that PrRP-type signalling may have originated in a common ancestor of the deuterostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>).</p><p>An important insight into the evolutionary history of NPY-related peptides was obtained with identification of a PP-like immunoreactive peptide in a protostome invertebrate, the platyhelminth <italic>Moniezia expansa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maule et al., 1991</xref>). Sequencing revealed a 39-residue peptide with a similar structure to NPY, but with the C-terminal tyrosine (Y) substituted with a phenylalanine (F). Hence, this invertebrate NPY homolog was named neuropeptide F (NPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maule et al., 1991</xref>). Subsequently, NPF-type neuropeptides have been identified in other protostome invertebrates, including other platyhelminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Curry et al., 1992</xref>), molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajpara et al., 1992</xref>), annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veenstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauknecht and Jékely, 2015</xref>) and arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1999</xref>), and these peptides typically have a conserved C-terminal RPRFamide motif and range in length from 36 to 40 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fadda et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Following the discovery of <italic>M. expansa</italic> NPF, antibodies to this peptide were generated and used to assay for related peptides in other invertebrates. Interestingly, this resulted in the discovery of two novel neuropeptides, ARGPQLRLRFamide and APSLRLRFamide, in the Colorado potato beetle <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spittaels et al., 1996</xref>). As these peptides were isolated using antibodies to <italic>M. expansa</italic> NPF, they were originally referred to as NPF-related peptides. However, because they are much shorter in length than NPF, they were later renamed as short neuropeptide F (sNPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vanden Broeck, 2001</xref>) and homologs were identified in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schoofs et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, alignment of NPY-type peptides and precursors from vertebrates with NPF-type and sNPF-type peptides and precursors from protostomes revealed that whilst NPF-type peptides are clearly orthologs of vertebrate NPY-type peptides, sNPF-type peptides and precursors exhibit too many differences to be considered orthologs of NPY/NPF-type peptides and precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nässel and Wegener, 2011</xref>). Further evidence that chordate NPY-type and invertebrate NPF-type neuropeptides are orthologous has been provided by similarity-based clustering methods, showing that the NPY-type and NPF-type precursors form a pan-bilaterian cluster, whereas sNPF-type precursors form a separate cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>). Thus, sNPF-type peptides are considered to be a family of neuropeptides that is distinct from the NPY/NPF-type family of neuropeptides.</p><p>A receptor for sNPF-type peptides was first identified in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> with the deorphanisation of the GPCR CG7395 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mertens et al., 2002</xref>), which was previously annotated as a homolog of mammalian NPY-type receptors. Subsequently, sNPF receptors have been identified in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Pietrantonio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garczynski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dillen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dillen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christ et al., 2018</xref>). A variety of physiological roles have been attributed to sNPF-type peptides in insects, with the most consistent being actions related to the regulation of feeding behaviour. For example, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> overexpression of sNPF increases food intake both in larvae and adults, whilst loss-of-function sNPF-mutants exhibited reduced food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). It was initially thought that the sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling system may be unique to arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nässel and Wegener, 2011</xref>); however, a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptors revealed that sNPF-type signalling is also present in other protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Thus, an expanded family of neuropeptide receptors in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> that had originally been annotated as NPY/NPF-type receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>) were found to be orthologs of insect sNPF-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, whilst NPY/NPF-type peptides and their receptors were identified as a bilaterian neuropeptide signalling system, it was proposed that sNPF-type signalling may be restricted to protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Subsequently, sNPF-type peptides and a cognate receptor have been characterised in the bivalve mollusc <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic>, confirming the occurrence of this signalling system in the lophotrochozoan branch of the protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigot et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the physiological roles of sNPF-type neuropeptides have been characterised in <italic>C. gigas</italic> and in other molluscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zatylny-Gaudin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigot et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Important insights into neuropeptide evolution have been obtained recently by pharmacological characterisation of G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptors in invertebrate deuterostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauknecht and Jékely, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Semmens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yañez-Guerra et al., 2018</xref>). However, currently little is known about the occurrence and characteristics of NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-related signalling systems in invertebrate deuterostomes. Phylogenetic analysis of bilaterian G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptors has demonstrated the occurrence of NPY/NPF receptor-related proteins in ambulacrarians – the echinoderm <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> and the hemichordate <italic>Saccoglossus kowalevskii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the precursor of a putative NPY/NPF-type peptide was identified in <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elphick and Mirabeau, 2014</xref>). A candidate NPY/NPF-type precursor has also been identified in the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic>, but an NPY/NPF-type receptor has yet to be identified in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elphick and Mirabeau, 2014</xref>). A more recent finding was the discovery of a family neuropeptide precursor-type proteins in echinoderms that contain a peptide that shares sequence similarity with NPY/NPF-type peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is not known if these proteins are orthologs of vertebrate NPY-type precursors and protostome NPF-type precursors. To address this issue, detailed analysis of the sequences of the echinoderm NPY/NPF-like peptides and precursors and the genes encoding these peptides/proteins is needed. Furthermore, the receptors for echinoderm NPY/NPF-like peptides need to be identified. Accordingly, here we show that NPY/NPF-type signalling has in fact been lost in echinoderms and report the discovery and pharmacological characterisation of a PrRP/sNPF-type signalling system in an echinoderm - the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic>. These findings provide important new insights into the evolution of neuropeptide signalling in the Bilateria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NPY-like neuropeptides in echinoderms share sequence similarity with PrRP-type neuropeptides</title><p>The sequence of a transcript (contig 1060225; GenBank accession number MK033631.1) encoding the precursor of an NPY-like neuropeptide has been reported previously based on analysis of neural transcriptome sequence data from the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>). Here, a cDNA encoding this precursor was cloned and sequenced, revealing that the open reading frame encodes a 108-residue protein comprising a predicted 19-residue signal peptide, a 23-residue NPY-like peptide sequence with an N-terminal glutamine residue and a C-terminal glycine residue, followed by a putative monobasic cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of radial nerve cord extracts using mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) revealed the presence of a peptide with the structure pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH<sub>2</sub>, showing that the N-terminal glutamine and C-terminal glycine in the precursor peptide are post-translationally converted to a pyroglutamate residue and an amide group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Alignment of the sequences of the <italic>A. rubens</italic> neuropeptide and orthologs from other echinoderms with related peptides in other taxa revealed that they share sequence similarity with both PrRP-type neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and with NPY/NPF-type neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the echinoderm peptides comprise 22–25 residues and are similar in length to vertebrate PrRPs, which are 20–31 residues as full-length peptides and in some species can occur as N-terminally truncated peptides due the presence of a monobasic cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hinuma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tachibana and Sakamoto, 2014</xref>). This contrasts with NPY/NPF-type neuropeptides, which are longer peptides ranging in length from 36 to 40 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fadda et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, by analysing sequence data from the hemichordate <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic> and the cephalochordate <italic>B. floridae</italic>, here we identified novel neuropeptides that share sequence similarity with the echinoderm neuropeptides and with vertebrate PrRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, sequence alignment reveals that, in addition to a shared characteristic of a C-terminal RFamide or a RYamide (Y and F being conservative substitutions), there are other residues in the echinoderm peptides that are identical or structurally similar to equivalently positioned residues in chordate PrRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Contrastingly, the echinoderm peptides lack two proline (P) residues that are a conserved feature of the N-terminal region of many NPY/NPF-type peptides, with the exception of some peptides that have only one of these proline residues and a peptide in the cephalochordate <italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic> that has neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, there are four other residues that are highly conserved in bilaterian NPY/NPF-type peptides - tyrosine (Y), leucine (L), tyrosine (Y), and isoleucine (I) residues, which are marked with arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. These residues have been shown to be important for the formation of the three-dimensional structure in vertebrate NPY-type peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blundell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glover et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glover et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 1987</xref>), so these residues may likewise be important for NPF receptor activation and bioactivity.

Previous studies have reported that a conserved feature of NPY/NPF genes is an intron that interrupts the coding sequence for NPY/NPF-type peptides, with the intron located between the second and third nucleotide of the codon for the arginine residue of the C-terminal RF or RY dipeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mair et al., 2000</xref>). Here we show this conserved feature in NPY/NPF genes in species from several animal phyla, including a hemichordate (sister phylum to the echinoderms), chordates, molluscs, an annelid, a priapulid, an arthropod and a nematode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In echinoderm PrRP-like peptide genes, the exon encoding the neuropeptide is likewise interrupted by an intron but it is located in a different position to the intron that interrupts the coding sequence for NPY/NPF-type peptides. Thus, it does not interrupt the codon for the arginine of the C-terminal RF or RY motif, but instead it is located between the first and second nucleotide of the codon for a residue located in the N-terminal or central regions of echinoderm PrRP-like peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another difference is that typically in NPY/NPF genes there is another intron that interrupts the coding sequence in the C-terminal region of the precursor protein, whereas in the echinoderm PrRP-like peptide precursor genes the coding sequence for the C-terminal region of the precursor protein is not interrupted by an intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To investigate relationships of the novel echinoderm receptors with other bilaterian neuropeptide receptors, we generated a sequence database including bilaterian NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-type receptors and other closely related receptors (tachykinin-type, luqin-type receptors) as outgroups. These receptor sequences were then analysed using two different methodologies.</p><p>Firstly, we performed a cluster-based analysis of the receptor sequences using CLANS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This analysis revealed three main clusters: 1. a cluster comprising the outgroup receptors (tachykinin/luqin), 2. a cluster comprising NPY/NPF-type receptors and 3. a cluster comprising sNPF-type receptors and PrRP-type receptors. Interestingly, the echinoderm receptors showed stronger connections with the sNPF/PrRP receptor cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, black square) than with the NPY/NPF receptor cluster. These findings indicate that sNPF-type receptors and PrRP-type receptors are orthologous, as has been proposed previously based on cluster-based analysis of receptor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these findings indicate that NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-type receptors in echinoderms are not orthologs of NPY/NPF-type receptors but are orthologs of sNPF/PrRP-type receptors. However, it is noteworthy that the lines linking the echinoderm receptors and nematode sNPF-type receptors with other sNPF/PrRP-type receptors in CLANS are quite long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is indicative of sequence divergence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>BLOSUM62 cluster map of NPY/NPF/PrPR/sNPF-type receptors and closely related tachykinin-type receptors (TKR) and luqin/RYamide-type receptors (LQ/RYaR).</title><p>Nodes are labelled with phylum-specific colours, as shown in the key, and connections represent BLAST relationships with a <italic>P</italic> value &gt; 1e-65.

This revealed that ArPrRP at a concentration of 10<sup>−5</sup> M triggers luminescence responses (defined as 100%) in CHO-Ar-sNPF/PrRPR cells that were approximately five times the background luminescence detected with the assay media used to dissolve the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), demonstrating that ArPrRP acts as a ligand for the receptor. Furthermore, ArPrRP induced dose-dependent luminescence in CHO-Ar-sNPF/PrRPR cells with a half-maximal response concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 1.5 × 10<sup>−10</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Importantly, no response to ArPrRP was observed in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the vector alone, demonstrating that the signal observed in CHO-Ar-sNPF/PrRPR cells exposed to ArPrRP can be attributed to activation of the transfected receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because ArPrRP contains a potential dibasic cleavage site (see underlined arginine residues in its sequence: pQDRSKAMQAERTGQL<underline>RR</underline>LNPRF-NH<sub>2</sub>), we hypothesised that the C-terminal pentapeptide of ArPrRP (LNPRFamide) may also be generated from ArPrRPP in vivo.

Consistent with this finding, orthologs of NPY/NPF-type receptors were also not found in echinoderms. Therefore, we conclude that NPY/NPF-type neuropeptide signalling has been lost in the phylum Echinodermata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is a noteworthy because, to the best of our knowledge, the only other taxon in which loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling has been reported are the urochordates, a sub-phylum of the phylum Chordata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The evolutionary and functional significance of loss of NPY/NPF-type signalling in echinoderms and urochordates is unknown. However, insights into this issue may emerge from functional characterisation of NPY/NPF-type signalling in other invertebrates.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic diagram showing the occurrence of NPY/NPF-type, sNPF-type and PrRP-type neuropeptide signalling in the Bilateria.</title><p>The tree shows the phylogenetic relationships of selected bilaterian phyla. A gene duplication event giving rise to the paralogous NPY/NPF-type (green) and PrRP/sNPF (purple) signalling systems is shown at a position in the tree corresponding to the common ancestor of the Bilateria.

The inclusion of an asterisk in filled squares indicates that activation of a receptor by a peptide ligand has been demonstrated experimentally. Note that in the starfish <italic>Asterias rubens</italic> (this study) a PrRP-type peptide (blue triangle) is the ligand for receptor that has been found to be an ortholog sNPF/PrRP-type receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or an ortholog of sNPF-type receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); hence this receptor is represented here as a red triangle. Note also the mutually exclusive patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sNPF-type signalling and PrRP-type signalling, with the former found in protostomes and the latter found in vertebrates, cephalochordates and hemichordates, which is supportive of the hypothesis that these signalling systems are orthologous. Our discovery of a PrRP/sNPF-type signalling system in echinoderms provides a missing link in the evolution of this neuropeptide signalling system. NPY/NPF-type signalling occurs in most phyla, but it has been lost in echinoderms and urochordates.

The grey square for sNPF in <italic>M. expansa</italic>, for which only transcriptome sequence data are available, indicates that sNPF-type peptides and sNPF-type receptor(s) are likely to be present in this species because sNPF-type peptides and sNPF-type receptors have been identified in another platyhelminth species, <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, for which a genome sequence is available.

However, NPY/NPF-type signalling has thus far only been partially characterised in this species. Here, our phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) indicates that there are two <italic>C. elegans</italic> receptors that are orthologs of NPY/NPF-type receptors: NPR-12, which is an orphan receptor, and NPR-11, which has been shown to be activated by the peptide MDANAFRMSFamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>). However, this peptide shares little sequence similarity with NPY/NPF-type peptides from other bilaterians. Furthermore, receptor assays only showed activation at peptide concentrations of 10 and 30 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>), which are high when compared to other NPY/NPF-type receptors that are typically activated by ligands in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lundell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garczynski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saberi et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, based on similarity-based sequence alignments, it has been suggested that the mature peptide derived from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein FLP-27 may be an ortholog of NPY/NPF-type peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fadda et al., 2019</xref>). Here, our analysis of the structure of the gene encoding the FLP-27 precursor has revealed that it has the characteristic structure of NPY/NPF-type genes, with an intron interrupting the codon for the C-terminal arginine of the NPF-type peptide sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, based on our analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sequence data, we conclude that the NPY/NPF-type peptide derived from the FLP-27 precursor protein is likely to act as a ligand for the NPR-11 and/or NPR-12 receptors. This finding provides a basis for functional characterisation of NPY/NPF-type signalling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Discovery of a PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling system in echinoderms</title><p>If the echinoderm NPY-like peptides are not orthologs of NPY/NPF-type neuropeptides, then what are they? Here we show that these peptides share sequence similarity with vertebrate PrRP-type neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the structure of the genes encoding the echinoderm neuropeptides revealed that the coding sequence for the neuropeptides is interrupted by an intron in the phase one frame, a feature that is also a characteristic of genes encoding vertebrate PrRP-type neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings indicate that the echinoderm neuropeptides are orthologs of vertebrate PrRP-type neuropeptides. To further address this issue we analysed echinoderm genome/transcriptome sequence data to identify candidate cognate receptors for the echinoderm PrRP-like peptides. A cluster-based analysis of receptor sequence data using CLANS revealed the presence in echinoderms of receptor proteins that show strong connections with a receptor cluster comprising vertebrate PrRP-type receptors and protostome sNPF-type receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Accordingly, a previous cluster-based analysis of receptor sequence data has reported that vertebrate PrRP-type receptors cluster with protostome sNPF-type receptors, indicating that these receptors may be orthologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>). A novelty of our analysis is the inclusion of several echinoderm receptor sequences. It is noteworthy, however, that whilst strong connections between the echinoderm receptors and PrRP/sNPF-type receptors in other taxa can be seen using CLANS, the lines linking to the echinoderm receptors are quite long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the echinoderm receptors are orthologs of PrRP/sNPF-type receptors but have undergone sequence divergence. Interestingly, a group of sNPF-type receptors in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> appears to be similarly divergent with respect to other sNPF/PrRP-type receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the relationship of the echinoderm receptors with sNPF/PrRP-type receptors, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of sequence data using the maximum likelihood method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In this analysis, the echinoderm receptors are positioned in a clade comprising protostome sNPF-type receptors. However, sNPF-type receptors and PrRP-type receptors do not form a monophyletic clade in the tree. Interestingly, this finding has been reported previously as part of a wider analysis of neuropeptide receptor relationships in the Bilateria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Thus, there is inconsistency in the findings from cluster-based analysis (CLANS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and phylogenetic tree-based analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) of receptor relationships. One possible explanation for this inconsistency would be that gene duplication in a common ancestor of the Bilateria gave rise to two sNPF/PrRP-type signalling systems, which were then differentially lost/retained in bilaterian lineages, but in such a scenario gene loss in several lineages would have to be invoked. Alternatively, the inconsistency may, at least in part, be a consequence of sequence divergence in echinoderm and nematode sNPF/PrRP-type receptors with respect sNPF/PrRP-type receptors in other taxa, which is reflected in their position peripheral to the main cluster of sNPF/PrRP-type receptors in the CLANS. Accordingly, it is noteworthy that in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) there is a long branch leading to the echinoderm receptor clade and likewise nematode sNPF-type receptors also have long branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Nevertheless, collectively our sequence analysis indicates that the echinoderm receptors are orthologs of sNPF/PrRP-type receptors. Therefore, it was of interest to determine if echinoderm PrRP-type neuropeptides act as ligands for sNPF/PrRP-type receptors in this phylum.</p><p>Here we show that the <italic>A. rubens</italic> PrRP-type neuropeptide ArPrRP (pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH<sub>2</sub>) is a potent ligand for the <italic>A. rubens</italic> sNPF/PrRP–type receptor Ar-sNPF/PrRPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings demonstrate for the first time the existence and molecular identity of a PrRP-type signalling system in an echinoderm. Furthermore, our identification of orthologs of ArPrRP and Ar-sNPF/PrRPR in other echinoderms, including for example the sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, demonstrates the conservation of this signalling system in this phylum. In addition, our comparative analysis of sequence data has also enabled identification of genes/transcripts encoding PrRP-type neuropeptides in the hemichordate <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic> and the cephalochordate <italic>B. floridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reconstructing the evolutionary history of PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling</title><p>Previous studies have concluded that sNPF-type signalling is paralogous to NPY/NPF-type signalling in protostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nässel and Wegener, 2011</xref>) and that PrRP-type signalling is paralogous to NPY/NPF-type signalling in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lagerström et al., 2005</xref>). Evidence that the PrRP-type and sNPF-type signalling systems may be orthologous has also been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jékely, 2013</xref>), but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Our discovery of a starfish PrRP-type neuropeptide that acts as a ligand for a starfish ortholog of sNPF-type receptors is important because it provides a missing link for reconstruction of the evolutionary history of PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the sequences of vertebrate PrRP-type neuropeptides and protostome sNPF-type neuropeptides reveals low levels of sequence similarity, which no doubt in part explains why PrRP-type and sNPF-type neuropeptides have not been recognised as orthologs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> we illustrate this in an alignment of the echinoderm PrRP-type neuropeptides and protostome sNPF-type neuropeptides, with sequence identity restricted to a few residues in the C-terminal regions of these peptides. This contrasts with the higher levels of sequence similarity shared between echinoderm PrRP-type neuropeptides and vertebrate PrRP-type neuropeptides, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Furthermore, echinoderm PrRP-type precursors are similar to chordate PrRP-type precursors in containing a single long neuropeptide, whereas protostome sNPF-type precursors typically contain multiple smaller neuropeptides. Thus, there is little evidence of orthology from comparison of echinoderm PrRP-type and protostome sNPF-type neuropeptide, precursor and gene sequences. Consequently, our conclusion that the echinoderm PrRP-type peptides are orthologs of protostome sNPF-type peptides is principally based on the orthology of their receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and our experimental demonstration that a PrRP-like peptide (ArPrRP) acts as a ligand for a sNPF/PrRP-type receptor (Ar-sNPF/PrRPR) in the starfish <italic>A. rubens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is important to note, however, that this is not unprecedented in investigations of the evolution of neuropeptide signalling. Thus, whilst the sequences of some neuropeptides and neuropeptide precursors are highly conserved throughout the Bilateria, others are so divergent that they can be unrecognisable as orthologs. An example of the former are vasopressin/oxytocin (VP/OT)-type neuropeptides and precursors. An example of the latter are neuropeptide-S (NPS)/crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP)-type neuropeptides and precursors, which are paralogs of VP/OT-type neuropeptides and precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Semmens et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, by way of comparison, NPY/NPF-type neuropeptides are similar to VP/OT-type neuropeptides in exhibiting a high level of sequence conservation throughout the Bilateria. Conversely, PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptides are similar to NPS/CCAP-type neuropeptides in being highly divergent, with neuropeptides in protostomes and deuterostomes exhibiting modest sequence similarity.</p><p>The discovery of PrRP/sNPF-type signalling in echinoderms has provided a unique opportunity to speculate on the ancestral characteristics of this signalling system in Urbilateria. It is noteworthy that, by comparison with the protostome sNPF-type peptides, the echinoderm PrRP-type peptides have more features in common with the paralogous NPY/NPF-type peptides. PrRP-type peptides are not as long as NPY/NPF-type peptides but they are nevertheless much longer than protostome sNPF-type peptides. Furthermore, it was the sequence similarity that echinoderm PrRP-type peptides share with NPY/NPF-type peptides that originally facilitated their discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zandawala et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the structure of the PrRP-type precursors is similar to NPY/NPF-type precursors because the neuropeptide is located immediately after the signal peptide, whereas this is not a feature of protostome sNPF-type precursors. Based on these observations, we propose that PrRP-type peptides and precursors may more closely resemble the ancestral characteristics of the PrRP/sNPF type signalling system in Urbilateria. Furthermore, we speculate that the common ancestor of the paralogous NPY/NPF-type and PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide precursors may have been similar to NPY/NPF-type precursors with respect peptide, precursor and gene structure. Then, following gene duplication, these ancestral characteristics were retained in the paralog that gave rise to the bilaterian NPY/NPF-type peptides/precursors. In contrast, the paralog that gave rise to PrRP/sNPF-type signalling diverged from the ancestral condition. However, the extent of divergence varies in the deuterostome and protostome lineages. In deuterostomes, the PrRP-type peptides/precursors have many NPY/NPF-type characteristics and we conclude that this reflects less divergence from the proposed ancestral condition. Conversely, in the protostomes, the sNPF-type peptides/precursors exhibit little similarity with NPY/NPF-type peptides/precursors and we conclude that this reflects more divergence from the proposed ancestral condition.</p><p>In conclusion, our discovery of a PrRP/sNPF-type signalling system in echinoderms has provided a missing link that unites PrRP-type peptides in vertebrates and sNPF-type peptides in protostomes as members of a bilaterian family of neuropeptides, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. This represents an important advance in our knowledge of neuropeptide signalling systems in the Bilateria and illustrates the value of insights from echinoderms in enabling reconstruction of the evolutionary history of neuropeptides.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pBluescript II KS (+) plasmid (cloning vector)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# K280002</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA3.1(+) with neomycin selectable marker (mammalian expression vector)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# V790-20</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Lipofectamine 3000</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# L3000015</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Asterias rubens</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Asterias rubens</italic> sNPF/PrPR receptor cDNA cloned into an expression vector</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Genbank: <break/>MH807444</td><td valign="top">Cloned in the plasmid pcDNA3.1+ from Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Aequorea victoria</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Chimeric green fluorescent protein-aequorin fusion protein (G5A)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baubet et al., 2000</xref></td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">Cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 15 (16) (Gq class)</td><td valign="top">cDNA resource center</td><td valign="top">Cat# GNA1500000</td><td valign="top">HGNC ID:4383 <break/>Human GNA15 cloned into the plasmid pcDNA3.1+.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0214">CVCL_0214</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat.

rubens</italic> and the genomes of three other echinoderms to identify a neuropeptide signaling system related to NPF/NPY/sNPF/PrRP in Echinoderms. They use various approaches, including sequence alignments, intron-exon structures, cluster analysis, phylogenetic approaches and pharmacology to show that echinoderms seem not to have NPY/NPF signaling systems, and instead have a single sNPF/PrRP type receptor and a corresponding PrRP like ligand. Their results suggest that there has been a loss of the NPY/NPF system in echinoderms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Urbilaterian origin and evolution of sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate a family of peptide signalling systems – the Neuropeptide Y/F (NPF/Y), and the related short Neuropeptide (sNPF) – in the Echinoderm, <italic>Asteria rubens</italic>, which is a deuterostome.</p><p>Although the genome of <italic>A. rubens</italic> has not been sequenced, a transcriptome of the radial nerve cord is available. Using reference sequences, the authors query this transcriptome for NPY-like ligands and receptors to identify a single putative candidate for each.</p><p>For the receptor, they perform phylogenetic analysis (with receptor sequences from Echinoderm species that have been sequenced). Surprisingly, the Echinoderm candidate receptor did not cluster with the NPY/F. Instead it clustered with the sNPF type receptor family. This is interesting because it's been proposed that sNPF type signalling systems are restricted to protostomes and is absent from deuterostomes.</p><p>Presumably due to the complexity of the peptides and precursors of peptides, such phylogenetic analysis is not possible for the ligands. So, the authors rely on peptide sequence alignments and structure of introns and exons of the precursor genes to draw inferences about evolutionary conservancy. Based on this, they find that their putative ligand is most similar to a third family of peptide signalling systems – the chordate PrRPs. This is also interesting, because PrRPs have, until now, been thought to be a chordate-specific signalling system. Interestingly, their putative receptor, had not clustered with the PrRP type receptors.</p><p>The authors also show that the PrRP-like ligand is capable of binding to and activating the sNPF-like receptor in a heterologous cell system.</p><p>Based on this these findings (and other considerations), the authors propose that the Echinoderm sNPF system is an ancestral signalling system that was lost in the chordates.</p><p>There are many substantial concerns given below. As the authors can see, addressing these will make this a very different work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Since the manuscript is entitled “Urbilaterian origin and evolution of sNPF-type neuropeptide signaling”, I expected that the authors would have explored the available echinoderm genomes for NPY/F, sNPF and PrRP type receptors in an unsupervised manner. As I understand it, the authors have picked a single receptor candidate based on a query of the transcriptome against Human and Fly NPY and sNPF receptors. Does this targeted approach miss important relationships of signaling systems in Echinoderms?</p><p>Despite this, I do agree that their data indicates that the sNPF signaling system might have existed prior to the protostome/deuterostome split. I also find it very interesting that the authors show a seemingly hybrid peptide signaling system – a PrRP-type ligand binding an sNPF-type receptor. This could suggest that the two systems were present before the deuterostome split, and while the PrRP system flourished in most deuterostome lineages, sNPF was lost. So, it would really be very interested to know what other receptors (and ligands) of the NPY/F, sNPF and PrRP families are present in the genomes of other Ambulacrarians.</p><p>If the authors feel that such analysis is beyond the scope of this manuscript, maybe they could consider changing to title to reflect that they have described an sNPF-PrRP hybrid peptidergic signaling system in <italic>A. rubens</italic>. And in this scenario they could maybe describe the evolutionary implications of their findings in the Discussion section.</p><p>Finally, may I please request the authors revisit their writing? While their findings are very interesting, the manuscript is difficult to read: take, for example, the sentence “Furthermore, alignment of NPY-type peptides and precursors from vertebrates with</p><p>NPF-type and sNPF-type peptides and precursors from protostomes revealed that whilst NPF peptides are clearly closely related (orthologous) to vertebrate NPY peptides, sNPF peptides and precursors exhibit too many differences to be considered orthologs of NPY/NPF-type peptides and precursors (Nässel and Wegener, 2011).”. The story is also presented as a back-and-forth between receptor and ligand, which adds to the difficulty. And finally, the Discussion contains large pieces of writing that belong to the Results section – some of which is discussed in the Results section, but some that are not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I would be more inclined to this work if it were in the short communications category. Also, I am not qualified to assess the details of their methods, but I was not convinced by their arguments that echinoderms have a sNPF system. In my view, the ligands and the receptors lead to opposite conclusions. They have not convinced me why they should favor one over the other. My comments are:</p><p>The manuscript by Dr. Yanez Guera et al., describes the discovery of a novel sNPF-like signaling system in echinoderms and uses this information to devise a scheme for the evolution of the NPY/NPF versus sNPF signaling in the bilateria. I found the paper to be difficult to read because it was a hybrid between a research report and a review. Also, it took a historical approach to presenting the data, which made it difficult to follow and to understand why certain topics were being covered.</p><p>One example is their focus in the beginning on the NPY/NPF system. This was obviously relevant when the authors first thought that their peptide was an echinoderm member of this family and they referred to it as ArNPYLP. However, neither the gene structure nor the peptide sequence supported placement in this family. A strong point to the paper is that to better understand their starfish peptide they sought its receptor. They could not find NPY/NPF-like receptors in starfish but they did find a receptor related to protostome sNPF receptor that did bind the peptide with sub-nanomolar affinity. At this point they then changed the name of the peptide to Ar-sNPF. I found this name switch in mid-paper to be quite confusing!</p><p>The main point of the paper is that the sNPF system is not confined to the protostomes as previously thought. However, I think that the data supporting that echinoderms have a sNPF signaling system is weak. They show that the gene structure of their Ar-sNPF has no resemblance to known sNPF genes from protostomes (Figure ). In comparing Ar-sNPF to other sNPF's the authors speak of &quot;modest&quot; similarity, but most of the similarity is in the C-terminal RFamide which is shared by many other peptide families. Indeed, as they then show, the better sequence match is with PrRP-like peptides of hemicordates and the PrRP-type peptides of chordates. They would be on firmer ground calling the starfish molecule a PrRP-like peptide. The reason for concluding that the starfish peptide is used in a sNPF-like system then rested with the receptor. Jekely (2013) concludes that the receptors for the PrRP and sNPF peptides cluster together. This differs from Figure 3 of this paper, and it is not clear to me which interpretation is better supported. In their Figure, the echinoderm receptors are an out group to the rest of the sNPF-type receptors. I do not know the level of confidence in placing them with the sNPF type receptors rather than being over with the hemicordates and the PrRP-type receptors. As it stands right now, the hemicordates and the echinoderms have similar peptides but they work through two different types of receptors.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Echinoderms provide missing link in the evolution of PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signalling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In its revised form, the work warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after revision. The work uses both genomic and experimental approaches to resolve the evolutionary history and relationships of an ancient and diverse group of neuropeptides – the NPF/NPY/sNPF/PrRP peptides. Sequence alignments, intron-exon structures, cluster analysis, phylogenetic approaches and pharmacology are used to show that echinoderms seem not to have NPY/NPF signalling systems, and instead have a single sNPF/PrRP type receptor and a corresponding PrRP like ligand.</p><p>The relationship of the NPF and NPY neuropeptides is well established, but a presumed neuropeptide of this group from Echinoderms seemed problematic. The authors provide evidence that this peptide is actually more related to the chordate PrRP neuropeptides but its possible receptor seems to come from the sNPF family. They then show that the starfish peptide (ArPrRP) is a potent ligand for this putative sNPF receptor. This provides a way of reconstructing the evolutionary history of PrRP/sNPF signaling. Their results suggest that there has been a loss of the NPY/NPF system in echinoderms.</p><p>We appreciate the effort the authors have taken to address many of the concerns we raised earlier. The manuscript is well written, and the data clearly presented.</p><p>Substantive Concerns:</p><p>The inconsistency in receptor identification between the two methods and the long branches in the phylogenetic analysis are of concern. We wonder if the authors have looked at the intron-exon structure of the receptors?</p><p>The paper does not require and more experiments or analysis but there are a couple of points that the authors might address.</p><p>1) In the Discussion, the section &quot;Discovery of a PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signaling system in echinoderms&quot; is long and simply repeats the data that are presented in the Results. It is not really Discussion material and it could be dropped or greatly condensed without affecting the paper.</p><p>2) In comparing the echinoderm peptides to PrRP-type or NPY/NPF type peptides, the authors point out that there are &quot;thirteen other residues in the echinoderm peptides that are identical to equivalently positioned residues in at least one of the chordate or hemicordate PrRPs, as highlighted by the asterisks&quot; In part B of Figure 1, using the same criteria for comparing the starfish peptide to known NPY/NPF type peptides, almost every residue is denoted by an asterisk. It is important to point out highly conserved residues, but the significance of the co-occurrence of a particular residue in a single other species is questionable. We suggest dropping that part of the analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57640.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In fact our analysis of sequence data included echinoderm species for which genome sequences are available, the starfish Acanthaster planci, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the sea cuumber Apostichopus japoncus , and we found that in these species only a single NPY/NPF/PrRP/sNPF-type receptor is present, consistent with our analysis of <italic>A. rubens</italic> transcriptome sequence data.

Based on our analysis of genome sequence data we conclude that in the ambulacrarian branch of the deuterostomes, sNPF/PrRP-type signalling has been retained in echinoderms and hemichordates. In contrast, the paralogous NPY/NPF-type signalling system has been lost in echinoderms but retained in hemichordates.

A previous study using this methodology (Jekely, 2013) provided important evidence that PrRP-type receptors and sNPFtype receptors are orthologous. A novelty of our analysis is the inclusion of several echinoderm receptor sequences and, interestingly, the echinoderm receptors showed stronger connections with the sNPF/PrRP receptor cluster (Figure 3) than with the NPY/NPF receptor cluster. It is noteworthy, however, that whilst strong connections between the echinoderm receptors and PrRP/sNPF-type receptors in other taxa can be seen using CLANS, the lines linking to the echinoderm receptors are quite long (Figure 3). This suggests that the echinoderm receptors are orthologs of PrRP/sNPF-type receptors but have undergone sequence divergence.</p><p>The reviewer’s excellent suggestion that we change the title of the paper to reflect our discovery of a “sNPF-PrRP hybrid peptidergic signaling system” in echinoderms is entirely consistent with the findings of the revised paper and accordingly we have changed the title of the paper to:</p><p>“Echinoderms provide missing link in the evolution of PrRP/sNPFtype neuropeptide signalling”</p><p>Accordingly, we have also produced a revised summary figure (new Figure 6) that illustrates the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of the sNPF/PrRP-type and NPY/NPF-type signalling systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, may I please request the authors revisit their writing?

An alternative explanation would be that gene duplication in a common ancestor of the Bilateria gave rise to two sNPF/PrRP-type signalling systems, which were then differentially lost/retained in bilaterian lineages. However, in this non-parsimonious scenario gene loss would have to be invoked in multiple lineages, including protostomes, echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates. To show that we are aware of this alternative explanation, we added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“One possible explanation for this inconsistency would be that gene duplication in a common ancestor of the Bilateria gave rise to two sNPF/PrRP-type signalling systems, which were then differentially lost/retained in bilaterian lineages, but in such a scenario gene loss in several lineages would have to be invoked.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We wonder if the authors have looked at the intron-exon structure of the receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes we did investigate the intron-exon structure of the receptor genes but, unlike the precursor genes (Figure 2), this was unhelpful for investigation of orthology. This is because there are no introns in the protein-coding region of the echinoderm receptor genes and this is also a feature of sNPF-type, PrRP-type and NPY/NPF-type receptor genes in the majority of other bilaterian taxa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper does not require and more experiments or analysis but there are a couple of points that the authors might address.</p><p>1) In the Discussion, the section &quot;Discovery of a PrRP/sNPF-type neuropeptide signaling system in echinoderms&quot; is long and simply repeats the data that are presented in the Results. It is not really Discussion material and it could be dropped or greatly condensed without affecting the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this section of the Discussion was too long and have removed text that describes specific details of the results, which were not necessary for this section of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In comparing the echinoderm peptides to PrRP-type or NPY/NPF type peptides, the authors point out that there are &quot;thirteen other residues in the echinoderm peptides that are identical to equivalently positioned residues in at least one of the chordate or hemicordate PrRPs, as highlighted by the asterisks&quot; In part B of Figure 1, using the same criteria for comparing the starfish peptide to known NPY/NPF type peptides, almost every residue is denoted by an asterisk. It is important to point out highly conserved residues, but the significance of the co-occurrence of a particular residue in a single other species is questionable. We suggest dropping that part of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the comparisons highlighted with asterisks in Figure 1A and 1B are not very informative with respect to neuropeptide relatedness and therefore we have removed the asterisks and changed the text accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
