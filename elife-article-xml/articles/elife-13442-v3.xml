interactions impact the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, but the relative contributions are unclear. Here, we identify gut microbiota as sufficient to induce depressive-like behaviors in genetically distinct mouse strains. Daily gavage of vehicle (dH2O) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice induced a social avoidance behavior that was not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This was not observed in NOD animals with depleted microbiota via oral administration of antibiotics. Transfer of intestinal microbiota, including members of the Clostridiales, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to microbiota-depleted C57BL/6 recipients was sufficient to induce social avoidance and change gene expression and myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomic analysis identified increased cresol levels in these mice, and exposure of cultured oligodendrocytes to this metabolite prevented myelin gene expression and differentiation. Our results thus demonstrate that the gut microbiota modifies the synthesis of key metabolites affecting gene expression in the prefrontal cortex, thereby modulating social behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13442.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13442.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13442.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A combination of genes and environmental factors underlie an individualâs risk of developing a mental illness. Among the environmental factors, it is becoming clear that communication between the gut and the brain is involved, but we do not understand how these two organs communicate. Our gut contains a variety of bacteria that help us to digest food and there is some evidence that changes in these bacterial communities can influence our mental health.</p><p>Transplanting feces from one individual to the gut of another is one way to alter the communities of bacteria in the gut. Here, Gacias et al. investigated whether fecal transplants are sufficient to induce social avoidance behavior â a symptom of depression â in mice. The experiments show that introducing specific combinations of bacteria into the gut is indeed able to cause healthy adult mice to avoid social interactions. This effect was caused by changes in the âmyelinâ sheath that surrounds many nerve fibers and could be prevented by giving the mice antibiotics, which decreased the number of bacteria in the gut.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that the mice that became depressed after fecal transplants had higher levels of a molecule called cresol, which is produced by certain gut bacteria. Gacias et al. found that cresol is able to reduce the amount of myelin produced by brain cells. Therefore, these findings show that changing the communities of bacteria in the gut can result in the accumulation of molecules that influence social behavior. Future work will aim to identify bacteria that can reduce the amount of cresol produced in the gut, which may have the potential to treat depression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13442.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13442.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>psychiatry</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>gut</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 4890 A10/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casaccia</surname><given-names>Patrizia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS42925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casaccia</surname><given-names>Patrizia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 NS047463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupree</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA016059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dupree</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS52738</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casaccia</surname><given-names>Patrizia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS086444-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zachariou</surname><given-names>Venetia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>other</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GCO14-0560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clemente</surname><given-names>Jose C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gut microbiota can influence mPFC transcriptional profiles and myelin content, overriding the impact of genetic background in the development of social avoidance behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite the diffuse prevalence of mental illness and the large efforts spent in identifying genetic elements of susceptibility, there is a need to define the role of environmentâgene interactions. In addition to genetic predisposition, there is extensive epidemiologic literature emphasizing the role of environmental exposure in the development of mild to severe mood disorders. The aftermath of traumatic life events, for instance, is often characterized by the onset of severe depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shalev et al., 1998</xref>). The interplay between genes and environmental variables has gained recent attention, and several immunologic and lifestyle contributors have been proposed to modulate depressive symptoms.

Deficiency of specific nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids has been reported in subsets of patients with mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patrick and Ames, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poudel-Tandukar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panagiotakos et al., 2010</xref>), highlighting the link between mood disorders and the bioavailability of metabolites.</p><p>There is evidence that bioactive metabolites act as mediators of gutâbrain communication, as shifts in gut microbial composition impact brain neurochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bercik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>). Indeed, psychiatric comorbidities often accompany conditions characterized by an aberrant gut microbiota composition, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastrointestinal disorder, and inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gevers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haberman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addolorato et al., 1997</xref>). Conversely, altered gut microbiota composition and function have been reported in patients with major depressive disorders and children with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Angelis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Angelis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parracho et al., 2005</xref>). The gut microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem that rapidly responds to environmental changes and can modulate brain development, function, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desbonnet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bercik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lax et al., 2014</xref>). These studies suggest that social behavior may be affected by abnormal interactions between gut microbiota and the brain, though the underlying mechanisms remain only partially understood.</p><p>One hypothesis for the pathogenesis of depressive-like behaviors has been suggested through studies on social isolation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>), which revealed a reduction of myelinated fibers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), associated with changes in the oligodendrocyte transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2016</xref>). Myelination is a dynamic process that continues into adulthood and contributes to physiologic brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">SÃ¡nchez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>). Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and neuropathologic and transcriptomic studies have reported downregulated oligodendroglial transcripts and reduced myelin thickness in the brains of patients with schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tkachev et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsel et al., 2005</xref>). These data highlight the role of myelin in mental illness and depressive-like behaviors, though it remains to be established whether myelination in the adult PFC and social behavior are affected by alterations in gut microbiota composition. This study characterizes the gut microbiota in mice with social avoidance behavior and demonstrates that transfer of specific bacterial taxa is sufficient to alter adult PFC myelination and results in behavioral changes consistent with a depressive-like phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-obese diabetic (NOD) and C57BL/6 mice display differential susceptibility to develop depressive-like symptoms in response to daily gavage</title><p>Although gastric gavage and subcutaneous injections are routine, daily procedures used to administer drugs or special diet to rodents, the potential behavioral effects they may induce in mice have not been investigated. Daily gastric gavage with vehicle for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was sufficient to induce social avoidance behavior in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), without affecting their overall locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This depressive-like behavior induced by daily gavage was dependent on the specific mouse strain, as C57BL/6 mice were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moy et al., 2008</xref>). Subcutaneous injection of vehicle did not elicit any behavioral effect in either strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Daily gastric gavage with an antibiotic cocktail proven to deplete the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reikvam et al., 2011</xref>) failed to induce the social avoidance behavior in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and similarly had no effect on the C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The antibiotic regimen was well tolerated by both NOD and C57BL/6 mice, did not impact body weight or glucose levels, and did not result in any gastric hemorrhage or visible stomach damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, only chronic oral antibiotic treatment (but not subcutaneous delivery) induced enlargement of the large intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), a macroscopic sign associated with microbiota depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reikvam et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, daily gavage also induced an anxiety-like behavior in both NOD and C57BL/6 mice, as revealed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). However, the anxiety-like behavioral change displayed in response to daily gavage was not affected by oral antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>), suggesting that only the depressive-like behavior is mediated by alterations in gut microbiota. To further validate this hypothesis, we conducted the forced swim test (FST), which is considered a measure of despair-like behavior, in NOD and C57BL/6 mice after daily gavage with either vehicle or antibiotics. The despair-like behavior was induced by vehicle gavage in the NOD strain, and was prevented by oral antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but was not detected in the C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that daily gavage of vehicle induces social avoidance and despair-like behaviors in NOD mice, but not in C57BL/6 mice, and that this effect is not observed when gavaging antibiotics orally and not subcutaneously.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13442.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The strain-specific social avoidance behavioral response to daily gavage is affected by oral antibiotic treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline: vehicle or antibiotic mix were administered daily by gastric gavage (g.g.) for 14 days.

Unweighted UniFrac distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lozupone and Knight, 2005</xref>) were calculated between all pairs of fecal samples based on their microbiota composition. Based on these distances, Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), an ordination method conceptually similar to principal component analysis, revealed a clear separation between vehicle-gavaged and baseline NOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and between vehicle and antibiotic treated NOD and C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

As expected, after transplantation Group II mice still exhibited a significantly depleted diversity compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; p&lt;0.01 ANOVA with Tukeyâs HSD), while bacterial diversity in Group I had recovered to levels similar to baseline and was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; p=0.09, ANOVA with Tukeyâs HSD). These results suggested that transfer of behavioral traits was associated with restoration of bacterial diversity to baseline levels. In order to determine the differences in microbiota compositions associated with the behavioral phenotype, we conducted PCoA analysis based on unweighted UniFrac analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Although all pooled fecal samples from NOD donors and C57BL/6 recipients clustered together at baseline (samples on the right side of the plot), treatment with antibiotics resulted in a drastic reshaping of the bacterial communities of both NOD (middle of the plot) and C57BL/6 (bottom-left side) mice. The microbiota composition of Group II mice after transplant (which did not display social avoidance behavior) was distinct from baseline, similar to antibiotic-treated animals pre-transplant (top-left side). However, Group I recipients which displayed social avoidance behavior (#19 and #18 on the plot), had compositions that were close to those of their vehicle-treated NOD donors. In contrast, Group I recipients which did not display social avoidance behavior (#17 on the plot), clustered with Group II recipients. This result suggests that the transplant procedure was not equally effective in all Group I mice. The distance in microbiota composition between vehicle-gavaged donors and recipients was significantly correlated with the social avoidance behavior, as measured by social interaction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>; p=0.01). This result suggests that the ability to successfully transfer the gut microbiota from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors was significantly correlated with the transmission of the depressive-like behavior. LEfSe analysis revealed a number of taxa that were significantly different between Group I and Group II C57BL/6 recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>). We further refined this analysis, by identifying the specific OTUs transferred from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to Group I recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>). Members of the Clostridiales order, including <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, were among those present in equal proportions both in the donors and the recipients in Group I recipients displaying a depressive-like behavior (i.e. samples #18 and #19), while absent in Group I recipients that did not exhibit such behavior (i.e. sample#17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>). We further confirmed these taxa as potentially responsible for this phenotype by qPCR using primers specific to these bacterial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). In order to identify differences undetectable at the OTU level, we performed oligotype analysis in those OTUs established as potentially responsible for the depressive-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Segata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eren et al., 2014</xref>). Oligotype analysis is an entropy-based method to identify single nucleotide differences in sequences from closely related organisms. We found that most OTUs were composed of a single high-abundance oligotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3AâC,E,GâO</xref>) and therefore support the conclusions from the OTU-level analysis. However, we identified three OTUs that had two oligotypes with similar abundances and distribution across samples: OTU 183849 (<italic>Blautia producta</italic>, a member of the Lachnospiraceae, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3D</xref>), 188840 (unidentified member within <italic>Lachnospiraceae,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3F</xref>), and 4418586 (unidentified member within Clostridiales, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3P</xref>). Additional inspection of these sequences revealed the oligotypes GTT and TTT from the <italic>Blautia producta</italic> OTU, as well as the TG and TT oligotypes from the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> OTU, had <italic>B. producta</italic> JCM 1471 as the closest reference sequence in NCBI; the oligotypes from Clostridiales had no close reference sequence. Overall, these results show that either a single oligotype or a combination of two oligotypes with similar abundance distributions were dominant within the analyzed OTUs, which suggested they might drive the observed social phenotypes.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13442.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effect of fecal transplantation on bacterial mass and biodiversity in microbiota depleted C57BL/6 recipients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental timeline for donors (NOD) and transplanted recipients (C57BL/6).

A total of 382 metabolites were detected in the guts of C57BL/6 transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>) A first pathway impact analysis provided a visual representation of the most dramatically affected pathways between the two groups, and identified the linoleic/linolenic acid and phenylalanine/tryptophan synthetic pathways as differentially represented in the two sets of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gacias et al., 2016</xref>).

The observation that behavioral traits were only detected in transplant recipients with effective colonization of these taxa highlights the potential molecular mechanisms by which gut microbiota impacts CNS homeostasis.</p><p>To date, several studies have focused on the relationship between microbiota composition and the development of anxiety-like behaviors. Dysbiotic microbiota induced by either pathogenic infections or antibiotic treatment has been shown to increase anxiety-like behavior in conventionally raised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bercik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyte et al., 2006</xref>), while germ-free mice show reduced levels of anxiety-like behaviors compared to normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neufeld et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, anxiety-like behaviors were also shown to be affected by daily gastric manipulations affecting microbiota composition. However, social avoidance and despair-like behaviors were differentially induced by gavage in two genetically distinct strains of mice, which could be prevented by the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail. Daily gavage of NOD mice induced significant changes of gut bacterial communities and depressive-like behavior (social and despair-like behaviors), which was associated with enrichment of bacteria within the Clostridiales. Antibiotic treatment decreased the overall bacterial diversity and prevented the behavioral effects. Subcutaneous administration of the same antibiotic treatment failed to induce significant changes either in the microbiota composition or behavior, further highlighting the importance of a local effect of oral antibiotic treatment on these intestinal microbial communities.</p><p>To prove causality and understand whether behavioral changes observed in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice were in fact modulated by the intestinal microbiota, we transferred the cecal content of these mice (displaying a social avoidance behavior) or antibiotic-treated (with normal social behavior) NOD donors into the microbiota-depleted guts of C57BL/6 recipients. Our results demonstrate that only recipients with successful recolonization of the taxa enriched in the vehicle-treated NOD mice (e.g. Clostridiales, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>) exhibited the social avoidance and despair-like behaviors, as well as the myelin gene expression in the mPFC of the donors. These transcriptional changes resulted in decreased adult PFC myelination in mice with transferred behavior. The microbiota of these C57BL/6 recipients showed significant differences in the abundance of several of the bacterial populations identified in the donors. Interestingly, alterations of some <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> spp. have been associated with behavioral deficits in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce-Keller et al., 2015</xref>).

Community-driven effects have also been reported in the induction of colonic regulatory T cells by specific mixtures of Clostridia strains in models of colitis or in cognitive and stereotypic behavioral changes induced by high-fat diet microbiota in non-obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce-Keller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atarashi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results also show that alterations of the microbial composition modified gut-produced metabolites and transcriptomic profiles in the mPFC, subsequently affecting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>).

Importantly, adoptive transfer of gut microbiota from NOD mice was able to recapitulate the mPFC transcriptional changes detected in recipient mice, thereby directly implicating gut microbiota as a causal factor for the induced behavioral and transcriptional changes.</p><p>One mechanism by which the gut microbiota may regulate such alterations is through the production of selective metabolites. Several recent studies have shown that a dysbiotic gut microbiota can produce neurotoxic metabolites directly impacting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaw, 2010</xref>). For instance, in a mouse model for autism spectrum disorders during development, characterized by dysregulation of <italic>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</italic> the anxiety-like phenotype correlated with the levels of the metabolite 4-ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, social avoidance behavior in adult mice was significantly associated with enrichment in <italic>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</italic> and Clostridiales and thedetection of high levels of cresol. This highly permeable metabolite was detected only in the gut of mice with social avoidance behavior, and was capable of preventing myelin gene expression and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into myelin-forming cells. These results suggest a potential mechanism linking CNS transcriptional changes to gut microbial homeostasis. Thereby increased intestinal production of cresol could be responsible for the behavioral changes observed in Group I transplant recipients by impacting adult myelination in the mPFC, possibly because this brain region is still capable of generating myelin after development. Several species of Clostridia have been shown to be producers of 4-EPS and cresol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with our findings that the microbiota of transplant recipients displaying an altered behavior (social avoidance and increased despair-like behavior) was enriched with members of the <italic>Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae</italic>, and other unidentified families within the Clostridiales order. We also detected a disruption in gut biosynthesis of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylanine in recipient mice with behavioral changes after transplantation. This might result in changes in the systemic/CNS levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters, as almost 90% of serotonin production occurs within the gastrointestinal tract from its precursor tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yano et al., 2015</xref>). Intestinal serotonin could cross through the blood brain barrier into the brain to regulate the observed social and despair-like behaviors. Additionally, accumulating evidence suggests that alterations in the glutamatergic system impact the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tokita et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, another metabolite that was significantly downregulated in affected transplant recipients was hexanedioic acid, also known as adipic acid, which can impact glutamate signaling by inhibiting the L-glutamate decarboxylase in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu and Roberts, 1974</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated that epsilon toxin produced by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> Type B is able to bind CNS endothelial cells and white matter tracts, inducing blood brain barrier disruption and oligodendrocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rumah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2015</xref>). Although in our studies we could detect <italic>C. perfringens,</italic> its low abundance and the lack of demyelination at the ultrastructural level suggests that other members of the Clostridiales might be driving the behavioral outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, our data support the concept that myelinating oligodendrocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenic process underlying social avoidance, and define the intestinal microbiota as a potential regulator of such behavioral alterations in adult mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Seven-week-old male C57BL/6 and NOD mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in specific pathogen-free facilities at Mount Sinai.

Your article has been reviewed by five peer reviewers, one of whom, Peggy Mason, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed this paper extensively with each another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity; Jack Gilbert (peer reviewer).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There was strong enthusiasm for this work which attempts to tie changes in the gut microbiota to changes in behavior and also changes in myelin-related genes, studied in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ab-gg changes the biota of both strains but only changes NOD's behavior. The authors claim that these data support the idea that a change in gut biota alters behavior only in NODs, so in a strain specific way. An equally plausible interpretation is that a change in gut biota has nothing to do with the change in behavior. So the data are consistent with multiple interpretations.</p><p>2) &quot;Throughout the manuscript naming the direction of changes and defining what is normal&quot;/baseline is actively avoided and this causes major confusion. Only differences between treatment groups are reported. This leaves the data floating somewhere in space, completely un-calibrated. Control groups of unmanipulated -in any way â NODs and C57s are needed.</p><p>3) The FMT transplant to the ABx-treated C57 rats is reported in such a backhanded way as to completely confuse the reviewers who spent a great deal of time trying to decipher it. This experiment also suffers from a lack of a control â ABx-C57 untreated with gavage (the baseline for this expt).</p><p>4) Changes in myelin genes are not changes in myelin. To make the claims that the authors make, some measure of myelination is needed and some degree of specificity to the frontal cortex. And it is not clear why myelin rather than clock genes are highlighted.</p><p>Overall there is enthusiasm for the experiments and data and skepticism that the conclusions are as solid as they are presented. Acknowledgement of alternate possibilities is absolutely needed along with some softening of the conclusions.</p><p>Additional points:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Why use NOD mice? It think you should be clearer about this when you first mention it at the beginning of the results.</p><p>The statement that &quot;ruling out the possibility that the observed behavioralalterations in NOD mice were consequent to a systemic effect of antibiotics.&quot; Is not necessarily true right? Maybe I am wrong, but what is gavaged antibiotics interacted with the host cells in the gut, or the immune regulation â to control for this you would need to run germ free models.</p><p>It would be nice to run oligotyping on the 16S rRNA analysis of the key Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiales strains anyway to explore if there were any strain specific effects that might contribute to the variance in behavioral response. Also comparison of the strain specificity between donor and recipient for the FMT, would significantly advance the case that these were transferred strains, rather than existing strains whose presence was augmented by the FMT community.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>While the NOD-derived microbiotal were associated with a number of prokaryotic genotypes and an altered metabolic profile of the gut (e.g. by mass spectroscopy and gas chromotography), no single &quot;responsible&quot; microbe or neurotoxic metabolite was identified. Here, the authors speculate that it may be a &quot;community&quot; effect, but they later discuss also specific metabolite changes (such as 4-EPS/cresol, altered tryptophan/serotonin levels, or hexanedioic acid/ altered glutamate signaling) as possible underlying causes.</p><p>While this is not the first study linking gut microbiota in mice with anxiety-like traits (the authors cite five papers and a quick search in Google Scholar adds many more papers), it is the first study to point out secondary changes of myelin gene transcripts in the CNS of antibiotica-treated mice. The same group has previously shown (Nature Neuroscience 2012) that myelination of the cortex can change as a result of social withdrawal, presumably reflecting altered neuronal activity.</p><p>I find this work very interesting and conceptually novel in the field. My only concern is that the altered expression of genes implicated in adult myelination should be more carefully discussed. We do not know whether the altered gut microbiom (or any of the metabolites derived) is &quot;directly&quot; causal in changing myelin gene expression of oligodendrocytes, or only &quot;indirectly&quot;, i.e. by affecting behaviour first. Indeed, the latter had been shown by the authors' lab to be an important aspect of myelination control.</p><p>A decisive experiment would be to compare the RNA profile of oligodendrocytes in prefrontal cortex and white matter tracts, which are less likely to be affected by behavioural changes (e.g. spinal cord).</p><p>The authors should also show their immunostainings of myelinated fibers after the transplant. Does it match the strain difference observed before? A nearly 2-fold difference would be visible on Western blots.</p><p>The authors should avoid writing &quot;it is not possible to draw a direct link between gut microbial metabolism and mPFC transcriptome&quot;. The necessary experiments have just not been carried out.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The sc and gg vehicles produce different baseline behaviors. Is this an effect of the relative stress of the two procedures?</p><p>My one big concern is the enormous gastric damage done by the abs. From the first expt it is not clear that the causative agent is the change in microbiota or the stomach inflammation. The one expt that could be used to point to microbiota is the final one where ab-treated C57 mice get either veh or ab-treated NOD mice microbiota. But to get this we need to see the stomachs of the C57 mice in each group. While of course, fashion would have us believe that it is the microbiota, it is formally possible that the cause of the changes is metabolites from the very extreme inflammation. And that the reactions differ in NOD and C57 mice (just as the microbiota differ in these two strains).</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The premise of the paper is fascinating and the authors have done an admirable job in synthesizing a connection between gut microbiome and cortical myelin related genes. However, their hypothesis comes undone when making a direct link to behavior.</p><p>â¢ I grappled hard and failed to follow the author's logic of the fact that antibiotic administration significantly decreased bacterial diversity of both NOD and C57BL/6 mice and yet the behavioral alterations occurred only in the NOD mice leads to the conclusion that &quot;These findings suggest that NOD treated with vehicle might have a particular microbiota community, sensitive to antibiotic treatment, which could modulate the social and despair-like behaviors&quot;. Wouldn't the more parsimonious explanation that the behavior and microbiome be unrelated?</p><p>â¢ Indeed the authors prove the opposite of their hypothesis is true in the next few sentences. It looks as rather that C57 mice have some strains enriched that appear to be preventive of enhanced social behavior and mood through antibiotics compared to NOD.</p><p>â¢ The authors hypothesis also falls apart at the fecal transplantation stage â when they transplant fecal microbiota from NOD mice, which have decreased despair &amp; increased social activity, it induces the opposite phenotype in antibiotic depleted C57 mice. This is fascinating data but difficult to explain easily. The authors somewhat try to distract the reader from this fact by now calling these groups Group 1 and Group 2.</p><p>â¢ Overall, the authors take a rather unexpected point-of-view to interpret the data, which is highlighted by the following statement (among others throughout the manuscript): &quot;Collectively, these findings suggest that the gut microbiota of NOD mice is sufficient to induce a reduction of the social behavior and increase the despair-like behavior independent of the genetic background and mediated through changes in the transcriptomic profile of the mPFC.&quot;</p><p>In fact, the microbiota of the NOD mice is the baseline and hence cannot be viewed as to &quot;induce&quot; a phenotype. The alternative interpretation, that immediately emerges from the presented data would be: âCollectively, these findings suggest that the ANTIBIOTICALLY-DEPLETED(/MODIFIED) gut microbiota of NOD mice is sufficient to induce an INCREASE of the social behavior and DECREASE in the despair-like behavior independent of the genetic background and mediated through changes in the transcriptomic profile of the mPFC.&quot;</p><p>And this finding needs to be discussed and explained by the data, i.e. the differences in microbiota and metabolome before and after antibiotic treatment and/or transplantation.</p><p>â¢ In their analysis of microbiota in NOD vs. C57Bl6J (under control conditions) it should be made clear, which bacteria are more abundant in NOD mice because it would be important to know which bacteria are depleted in NOD mice that lead to the behavioral performance increase. And this finding needs to be discussed and explained by the data, i.e. the differences in microbiota and metabolome before and after antibiotic treatment and/or transplantation.</p><p>â¢ It may be helpful to state what would be expected and then look for deviations from the expectation: Microbe-depleted C57 mice are expected to show a similar microbial profile to the respective donor, i.e. NOD vehicle-treated or NOD antibiotic treated. The authors should provide and discuss evidence that is or isn't the case. Unexpected interpretation happens from this point onwards. Interpretation of this data very much depends on what the baseline is, what is viewed as &quot;normal&quot; and what as &quot;altered&quot;.</p><p>â¢ It would benefit readability of the manuscript a lot if the author would describe the direction of the change they mean rather than say that behavior was &quot;altered&quot; in many sentences. The same is true for &quot;differences&quot; in the microbiota composition. The use of such terms without mentioning the direction of the change make the findings sound very vague and make it more difficult to interpret the data</p><p>â¢ How are the mouse strains different genetically? How could this affect the microbiota present in each strain and subsequently the reaction to the antibiotic? This study needs to take gene-environment interactions into account.</p><p>â¢ Why use NOD mice at all, it is a strange choice for behavioral genetic studies; does their diabetes interfere with the interpretation of phenotype?</p><p>â¢ The authorsâ assertion that social &amp; despair-related behavior is &quot;mediated through changes in the transcriptomic profile of the mPFC&quot; is not proven at all. Correlation dos not mean causation.</p><p>â¢ Regarding the myelination data itself the authors show an increase in mRNA and increased intensity of myelin staining. Is intensity staining the best method, does this mean there is more myelination, as in more axons, or are the fibers that are myelinated more heavily myelinated. Looking at structure using electron microscopy would provide an answer. What is the alteration at the level of oligodendrocytes? Have any of the myelin related changes any functional relevance to demyelination-related disorders or to functional myelin responses.</p><p>â¢ The Introduction is lacking a coherent flow and would benefit from significant editing. I found the first paragraph of Introduction, whilst interesting, overlong and not really pertinent to study at hand.</p><p>â¢ The relevance of current study to schizophrenia &amp; bipolar is not clear and the authors are perhaps conflating this relevance in Introduction. This is further expanded in the Discussion that compares the data with that from an autism model. If this is focused on social behavior, as title but not introduction indicate, then itâs easy to bring all of this together, but currently it is a number of 'characters' in search of a coherent story.</p><p>â¢ An example of the lack of flow is going from the statement &quot;Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that mouse models of depression were characterized by down-regulation of oligodendroglial transcripts and myelin thickness in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), thereby supporting a role for myelin in the pathogenesis of depressive disordersâ to &quot;Indeed, manipulations of intestinal microbiota have recently emerged as a novel approach to influence brain function and behavioral outcomes&quot; â this is a strange transition.</p><p>â¢ The authors state that &quot;Antibiotic regimen was well tolerated&quot; other than bodyweight, which is a relatively crude measure, was there any other change in secretomotor function, defecation rates etc.</p><p>â¢ Motor activity needs to be shown at individual time-bins as the overall effect seems to be different in NOD mice if not reaching statistical significant when collapsed overall.</p><p>â¢ Is the myelination effects specific to the cortex; Other brain areas such as the amygdala and hippocampus would be equally worthy of investigation and at least addressed.</p><p>â¢ The myelination data is intriguing but itâs somewhat strange that the authors chose to follow up on the least-significantly enriched functional category (myelination) in their transcriptome analysis; further scientific justification is needed.</p><p>â¢ Were antibiotic treatments continued during the 1.5 weeks behavioral testing?</p><p>â¢ y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref> unclear â what is MBP+ fibers mean pixel intensity? How is this measured?</p><p>â¢ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: it would be worthwile to graphically show the NOD vehicle treated mice for gene expression.</p><p>â¢ Results section needs to be cleared up to enhance readability.</p><p>â¢ When describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, the authors state &quot;characterized by lower levels of myelin gene transcripts [â¦] in Group I and higher in Group II&quot;, which is confusing as this was not compared to baseline in C57Bl6. They should state that transcription of these genes was increased in Group II compared to Group I as shown in the figure.</p><p>â¢ The color legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> needs to show the Group names (Group I or Group II), to avoid confusion about the interpretation of the data. Also the description of this figure panel states, &quot;significantly distinct clustering of C57BL/6 transplanted mice displaying social avoidance and an increase in despair-like behaviors compared to normal behaving controls&quot; although, according to the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>, the &quot;normal&quot; behaving animals show more social behavior and less despair-like behavior.</p><p>â¢ A list of the differentially expressed genes should be added to supplemental material, together with a list of terms from functional enrichment analysis.</p><p>â¢ The Discussion focuses mainly on the metabolomics data, but does not help explaining how the observed phenotypes are connected to a depleted microbiota. Here the authors show that it is the bacteria that remain after antibiotics (and are therefore overtaking/-growing) are necessary for the myelin increase â that's what the fecal transfer shows. if it was the bacteria that are gone who are important for the myelin changes than you would also see the effects in antibiotic C57Bl6 mice. This however, very much depends on the genetic background of the two strains and it's interaction with the microbiome â which is not discussed in this manuscript at all.</p><p>â¢ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref> in the last sentence of the Results section should be 7e and this sentence is again misleading, or at least again a rather surprising conclusion similar to the above.</p><p>â¢ Not clear why the outcome of the increased myelin gene expression in transplantation of NOD microbiota to C57BL/6 is not shown at the protein level.</p><p>â¢ Why are they using two different reference genes in the qPCR data?</p><p>â¢ Images don't elude to which part of the medial PFC they imaged. It should be easy enough with the staining to highlight that. What layer of the PFC has more myelin?</p><p>Reviewer #5:</p><p>1) The notion that the antibiotic treatments alter myelinating cells in the PFC is based on gene expression analysis RT-PCR and histological data showing changes on MBP+ fibers. While RNA levels provides strong evidence for changes in transcription or RNA stability in oligodendrocytes, to conclude that the antibiotic treatment affects myelin, immunostaining for MBP+ fibers is not sufficient. Morphological analysis like the ones the Casaccia group has done in prior studies (e.g. electron microscopy of myelin thickness, quantification of oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density) will be necessary.</p><p>2) It would be very important to determine if the changes in myelin gene expression are unique to the PFC or this phenomenon is widespread throughout the brain. The authors should evaluate the expression of the myelin genes affected by antibiotic treatment in a brain region not linked to social/emotional regulation. The interpretation of the findings would be very different if this is a specific or a general phenomenon.</p><p>3) There are some confusing aspects regarding the effects of treatments on behavior. For example, in the immobility tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, it seems that the only group with altered behavior is the oral-vehicle group. The behavior of mice treated with oral antibiotics is the same as the one with SI or SI-vehicle (and similar to all C57BL/6). Furthermore, in the measurements of social interactions, it seems that the oral vehicle reduces and the oral-antibiotic increases the time in the interaction zone compared to both groups treated by SI. Difference in behaviors between mice treated by SI vs oral, such as those in the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) leaves me wondering if in some cases lack or presence of effects of antibiotics could be due to a particular susceptibility of a mouse strain to a manipulation such as gavage or injections, and not really to a difference in the changes in microbiota. This issue would be clarified by presenting data on control mice (not treated at all).</p><p>4) Did the authors monitor for onset of diabetes in NOD mice (i.e by detecting evidence of glycosuria)? This strain spontaneously develops diabetes in approximately 20-30% of males and the incidence of disease has been linked to changes in the microbiome (See Wen et al. Nature 2008; PMID 18806780). It would be important to know if the behavioral changes with antibiotic treatment in the NOD mice coincide with metabolic disease to determine if there is an interaction among these variables.</p><p>5) The authors speculate that neurotoxic metabolites produced by a combination of gut microbia may affect PFC function. This interpretation would be strengthened if these metabolites were measured and detected in the CNS in vehicle and antibiotic treatment mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13442.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) Ab-gg changes the biota of both strains but only changes NOD's behavior.

We have now modified all the figures to include those data and revised the text accordingly. In order to summarize the overall experimental results, we would like to summarize the results.</p><p>We present evidence that untreated NOD (NOD baseline = no phenotype) had no depressive-like phenotype, while NOD mice gavaged with vehicle vehicle showed the behavioral phenotype (NOD vehicle = phenotype), which was not observed when the animals were gavaged with antibiotics (NOD antibiotic gavage = no phenotype). This suggested that the behavioral effect of gavage requires the microbiota of the NOD mice, since it was not observed when it was depleted by the chronic antibiotic treatment. The behavioural effect of daily gavaging observed in NOD was not detected in C57Bl mice, which showed no depressive-like phenotype either untreated or gavaged with vehicle or antibiotic. This indicated that the behavioral effects induced by daily gavaging were dependent both on the specific mouse strain and its microbiota.</p><p>We then asked the question of whether transplanting the microbiota from one strain responsive to gavaging (i.e. NOD) to a non-responsive one (i.e. C57) would be sufficient to transfer the behavioural response to daily gavaging. In order to do so, we depleted (using an antibiotic regimen) the microbiota of unmanipulated baseline C57Bl mice and then transplanted them with the microbiota from NOD mice with a depressive-like phenotype (which had been previously induced by vehicle-gavaging). This transplantation was sufficient to induce in the C57Bl recipients the same social avoidance behavior detected in the vehiclegavaged NOD donors. This phenomenon was not observed in C57Bl recipients that received the microbiota of antibiotic-gavaged NOD donors. Overall, these results suggest that the microbiota of vehicle-gavaged NOD mice was sufficient to elicit a depressive-like phenotype when transferred to a different strain of mice with a normal baseline behavior and antibiotically depleted microbiota.</p><p>Finally, we sought to identify the bacterial taxa that were associated with this behavioral phenotype. We therefore performed two types of analyses: the first one (presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and associated table of OTUs) focused on differences between vehicle-gavaged NOD (with behavioral phenotype) and untreated NOD baseline mice. This analysis demonstrated the presence of specific taxa in vehicle-gavaged NOD (displaying a phenotype), that were not found at baseline (= no phenotype), and we identify as potential candidates to explain the depressive-like phenotype in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice. In addition, we reasoned that if this behavior was transferable through the microbiota, then the same relevant bacteria present in the NOD donors with the behavioral phenotype should be detected in C57Bl recipients that showed the social avoidance behavior after transplantation. For this reason, we focused on the similarities between the microbiota of vehicle-gavaged NOD donors (which exhibited a depressive phenotype) and C57Bl recipients transplanted with the microbiota of such NOD donors (which showed the depressive-like symptoms after transplantation, but not before). This analysis is presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which identifies members of the Clostridiales, Ruminococcacea and Lachnospiraceae as the main bacterial taxa related to the depressive-like behavior transferred from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to C57bl recipients. We further validated the enrichment of these taxa in the samples by RT-PCR, confirming the relation of these bacteria with the phenotype.</p><p><italic>4) Changes in myelin genes are not changes in myelin. To make the claims that the authors make, some measure of myelination is needed and some degree of specificity to the frontal cortex. And it is not clear why myelin rather than clock genes are highlighted.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct in his/her determination. In the original submission we had included not only transcript levels but also immunohistochemical data. In response to the comment related to regional specificity, we now show that the transcriptional and ultrastructural changes occur in the PFC and not in other related brain regions. The reason we focused on myelin is because our group (Liu et al., Nature Neuroscience 2012; Liu et al., J, Neurosci., 2016) and others (Matinaken, Science, 2012) had previously reported the importance of PFC myelination in mice with depressive-like symptoms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>Why use NOD mice? It think you should be clearer about this when you first mention it at the beginning of the results.</italic> </p><p>Gene-environment interactions are known to affect the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, however the relative impact of these two variables and the potential underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis remain elusive. We simply wanted to use two genetically distinct strains with clear behavioral differences to evaluate the gut microbiota as environmental variable modulating behavior.</p><p><italic>The statement that &quot;ruling out the possibility that the observed behavioralalterations in NOD mice were consequent to a systemic effect of antibiotics.&quot; Is not necessarily true right?

Also comparison of the strain specificity between donor and recipient for the FMT, would significantly advance the case that these were transferred strains, rather than existing strains whose presence was augmented by the FMT community.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. It is indeed possible that some of the differences were attributable to effects at the strain level rather than at the OTU level, and we performed this analysis on all OTUs found to be transferred from the vehicle-gavaged NOD mice to the C57Bl that were not found in the recipients before transplantation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> for a description of this analysis). Results of the oligotyping analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>. Most of the OTUs associated with the behavioural phenotype were composed of a single oligotype at high abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>, panels A to C and G to O). Three OTUs had two oligotypes with similar distribution of abundance across samples: Blautia producta, an unidentified member of the Lachnospiraceae, and an unidentified member of the Clostridiales. Further inspection of the sequences associated with these oligotypes revealed Blautia producta JCM 1471 as the closest reference sequence in NCBI, while the Clostridiales oligotypes had no close reference sequence. Overall, these results suggest that either a single oligotype or a combination of two oligotypes are dominant within the analyzed OTUs and might drive the observed depressive-like phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p><italic>While the NOD-derived microbiotal were associated with a number of prokaryotic genotypes and an altered metabolic profile of the gut (e.g. by mass spectroscopy and gas chromotography), no single &quot;responsible&quot; microbe or neurotoxic metabolite was identified. Here, the authors speculate that it may be a &quot;community&quot; effect, but they later discuss also specific metabolite changes (such as 4-EPS/cresol, altered tryptophan/serotonin levels, or hexanedioic acid/ altered glutamate signaling) as possible underlying causes.</italic></p><p><italic>While this is not the first study linking gut microbiota in mice with anxiety-like traits (the authors cite five papers and a quick search in Google Scholar adds many more papers), it is the first study to point out secondary changes of myelin gene transcripts in the CNS of antibiotica-treated mice. The same group has previously shown (Nature Neuroscience 2012) that myelination of the cortex can change as a result of social withdrawal, presumably reflecting altered neuronal activity.</italic></p><p><italic>I find this work very interesting and conceptually novel in the field. My only concern is that the altered expression of genes implicated in adult myelination should be more carefully discussed. We do not know whether the altered gut microbiom (or any of the metabolites derived) is &quot;directly&quot; causal in changing myelin gene expression of oligodendrocytes, or only &quot;indirectly&quot;, i.e. by affecting behaviour first. Indeed, the latter had been shown by the authors' lab to be an important aspect of myelination control.</italic> </p><p>This is a legitimate comment and for this reason, in this resubmission, we have focused on a careful and detailed analysis of one of the metabolites which was found to be increased in the gut of mice with the behavioral phenotype. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we identify cresol as an important metabolite which was detected at higher levels in the gut of C57Bl recipients transplanted with the microbiota of vehicle-gavaged NOD than in C57Bl transplanted with the microbiota of antibiotic-gavaged NOD and therefore asked whether this metabolite could directly modulate myelin gene expression in cultured oligodendrocytes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> we show that cresol treatment of cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors reduced myelin gene transcripts as it impaired their ability to differentiate. These results are of high relevance and provide a molecular explanation also for the effect of the microbiota on the ultrastructural data in the PFC. Our group and others have previously shown that social avoidance behavior is associated with defective adult myelination in the PFC and the data in this manuscript identify a metabolite, cresol, as a metabolic intermediate with the ability to pass the blood brain barrier and modulate myelin gene expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</p><p><italic>A decisive experiment would be to compare the RNA profile of oligodendrocytes in prefrontal cortex and white matter tracts, which are less likely to be affected by behavioural changes (e.g. spinal cord).</italic> </p><p>We did perform this analysis and show that the changes in myelin genes are detected in the prefrontal cortex, but not in other brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and supplemental). This suggests that the effect of the microbiota on behavior is consequent to molecular changes occurring in brain regions affecting social behavior, rather than to non-specific changes throughout the brain.</p><p><italic>The authors should also show their immunostainings of myelinated fibers after the transplant.

A nearly 2-fold difference would be visible on Western blots.</italic> </p><p>In order to provide a clear evaluation of the effect of transplantation of NOD microbiota to C57Bl recipient mice, we conducted a blinded ultrastructural assessment of the PFC myelination. The new data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> which reveal changes in myelination in the PFC and not in the NAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

From the first expt it is not clear that the causative agent is the change in microbiota or the stomach inflammation.

But to get this we need to see the stomachs of the c57 mice in each group.</italic> </p><p>We have now included the gross anatomy of the stomachs of these mice to address the reviewerâs concern on gastric damage. While the size of the large intestine was affected by the antibiotic treatment, we did not detect changes in weight, size or presence of any substantial macroscopic damage in the gavaged mice. We also would like to mention that neither the weight nor the blood glucose levels were altered by the procedure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p><italic>The premise of the paper is fascinating and the authors have done an admirable job in synthesizing a connection between gut microbiome and cortical myelin related genes.

The authors should provide and discuss evidence that is or isn't the case. Unexpected interpretation happens from this point onwards. Interpretation of this data very much depends on what the baseline is, what is viewed as &quot;normal&quot; and what as &quot;altered&quot;.</italic> </p><p>As discussed above, we believe that the reviewerâs concerns are legitimate since we had not previously explicitly shown the data at baseline. We have now entirely modified the figures, reorganized the text and we hope that the new data and presentation of the manuscript will allow the message to come across clear, solid and consistent. To start with, we would like to clarify the general conclusions drawn from of our results:</p><p>(1) NOD baseline = no phenotype</p><p>(2) NOD vehicle gavage = behavioral phenotype</p><p>(3) NOD antibiotic gavage = no phenotype</p><p>(4) C57 baseline = no phenotype</p><p>(5) C57 vehicle gavage = no phenotype</p><p>(6) C57 antibiotic gavage = no phenotype</p><p>At baseline, neither NOD nor C57 animals exhibited a depressive-like behavior (1,4). Gavaging with vehicle induced a phenotype in NOD (2) but not in C57 (5). Gavaging with antibiotics did not result in a phenotype in NOD nor in C57 (3,6). From these findings, we reason that the behavioral phenotype must be related to differences in the microbiota of vehicle-gavaged NOD compared to untreated baseline NOD. Treatment with antibiotics was used as a control to demonstrate that the depressive-like behavior observed in NOD mice requires not only gavaging but also a specific microbiota, as its depletion through antibiotics does not lead to a phenotype. By analyzing bacteria found in vehicle-gavaged NOD mice not present at baseline we identified a first set of taxa potentially responsible for inducing the behavioral changes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We then ask the question of whether this microbiota associated with a social avoidance behavior in NOD mice could be transferred to C57 mice. Our results in this second experiment are as follows:</p><p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) C57 transplanted with the NOD vehicle gavage = behavioral phenotype</p><p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) C57 transplanted with the NOD antibiotic gavage = no phenotype</p><p>From these results, we examined the OTUs found in vehicle-gavaged animals (phenotype) that were not found at baseline (no phenotype) and that were also found in transplanted C57 animals (7, which also exhibit the behavioral phenotype) but not before transplantation (no phenotype), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. We argue that these OTUs are responsible for the depressive-like symptoms observed in donor NOD and recipient C57 mice. Again, we use antibiotics as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) to demonstrate that transplantation from antibiotic-gavaged NOD into C57 does not result in a phenotype. Analysis of the specific OTUs inducing a phenotype identified members of the Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae as candidates for the depressive-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p> <italic>â¢ It would benefit readability of the manuscript a lot if the author would describe the direction of the change they mean rather than say that behavior was &quot;altered&quot; in many sentences. The same is true for &quot;differences&quot; in the microbiota composition. The use of such terms without mentioning the direction of the change make the findings sound very vague and make it more difficult to interpret the data.</italic></p><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the initial omission of the baseline data might have resulted in a description of the data that appeared quite convoluted and perhaps not easily accessible. In this revised version, however, the description of the data is accurately depicted in terms of enrichment or depletion relative to baseline levels or by comparing levels before and after transplantation. We sincerely hope that the extensive text and figure revisions have adequately addressed the Reviewerâs concerns.</p><p><italic>â¢ How are the mouse strains different genetically? How could this affect the microbiota present in each strain and subsequently the reaction to the antibiotic? This study needs to take gene-environment interactions into account.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer highlights, the main point of this study is to address gene-environment interactions, not to define the genetic differences between strains, which might entail an entirely different approach and the use of congenic lines. While we cannot exclude the possibility that the genetic information, which is clearly distinct in the two strains, could affect the differences in the microbiota composition, the main message of our study is that microbiota can transfer behavioral and transcriptional traits, regardless of the genotype of the recipient mice.</p><p><italic>â¢ Why use NOD mice at all, it is a strange choice for behavioral genetic studies; does their diabetes interfere with the interpretation of phenotype?</italic> </p><p>We would respectfully note that the emphasis of the manuscript was not to study the genetic effect on behavior. As such the selection of two mouse strains that had previously been reported to exhibit behavioural differences (Moy et al., 2008) does not seem âstrangeâ to us, but rather adequate to address the effect of environment/gene interaction. Diabetes develops very late in NOD and to exclude any potential confounder related to metabolic alterations we have included monitoring of blood glucose levels throughout the experimental paradigm. Since no changes in blood glucose levels were detected, we conclude that the NOD were not diabetic and as such is not likely that diabetes could interfere with interpretation of our results.</p><p><italic>â¢ The author's assertion that social &amp; despair-related behavior is &quot;mediated through changes in the transcriptomic profile of the mPFC&quot; is not proven at all. Correlation dos not mean causation.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have modified this statement in the text.</p><p><italic>â¢ Regarding the myelination data itself the authors show an increase in mRNA and increased intensity of myelin staining. Is intensity staining the best method, does this mean there is more myelination, as in more axons, or are the fibers that are myelinated more heavily myelinated. Looking at structure using electron microscopy would provide an answer. What is the alteration at the level of oligodendrocytes? Have any of the myelin related changes any functional relevance to demyelination-related disorders or to functional myelin responses.</italic></p><p>We now include not only transcript levels (measured by RT-PCR), and protein (measured by immunohistochemistry), but also a quantitative ultrastructural analysis and evidence of regional differences in myelination. It is worth mentioning that the selective effect of microbiota in the PFC is not surprising if we consider that this is one region characterized by adult ongoing myelination, and thereby the more likely region to respond to changes in active metabolites like cresol, which have the ability to decrease myelin gene expression in oligodendrocyte progenitors.</p><p><italic>â¢ The Introduction is lacking a coherent flow and would benefit from significant editing. I found the first paragraph of Introduction, whilst interesting, overlong and not really pertinent to study at hand.</italic> </p><p><italic>[â¦]</italic></p><p><italic>â¢ An example of the lack of flow is going from the statement &quot;Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that mouse models of depression were characterized by down-regulation of oligodendroglial transcripts and myelin thickness in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), thereby supporting a role for myelin in the pathogenesis of depressive disordersâ to &quot;Indeed, manipulations of intestinal microbiota have recently emerged as a novel approach to influence brain function and behavioral outcomes&quot; â this is a strange transition.</italic></p><p>The three comments above have been addressed by entirely re-writing the Introduction. We sincerely hope that the revised text will address the reviewerâs comments. In addition, we believe the overall readability of the manuscript has dramatically improved.</p><p><italic>â¢ The authors state that &quot;Antibiotic regimen was well tolerated&quot; other than bodyweight, which is a relatively crude measure, was there any other change in secretomotor function, defecation rates etc.</italic> </p><p>We disagree with the reviewer regarding this comment as, even though we have not measured the secremotor function or defection rate, the careful assessment of body weight, body condition (including dehydration), overall stomach appearance and weight, collectively indicate an overall healthy state which would not have been detected in case of severe diarrhea or strong intolerance to the antibiotic regimen.</p><p><italic>â¢ Motor activity needs to be shown at individual time-bins as the overall effect seems to be different in NOD mice if not reaching statistical significant when collapsed overall.</italic></p><p>We have now included in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the measurement of the locomotor activity in NOD and C57BL/6 during the SI test.</p><p><italic>â¢ Is the myelination effects specific to the cortex; Other brain areas such as the amygdala and hippocampus would be equally worthy of investigation and at least addressed.</italic></p><p>We provide evidence for regional specificity in the PFC. Social behavior is known to be affected by changes in myelination in this area. We have now also included also a detailed comparative transcriptional and ultrastructural analysis at the level of the nucleus accumbens, which was not affected by the manipulation of the microbiota. The issue of regional specificity has been linked to the fact that the PFC is one of the very few regions that displays ongoing active myelination in the adult brain and, therefore, we believe more deeply affected by increased levels of microbiota-produced metabolites, like cresol.</p><p><italic>â¢ The myelination data is intriguing but its somewhat strange that the authors chose to follow up on the least-significantly enriched functional category (myelination) in their transcriptome analysis; further scientific justification is needed.</italic> </p><p>We believe that in this revised version we have provided a very convincing argument for the rational behind our interest in the characterization of myelination. We and others had previously described behavioural changes associated with myelination deficits in the PFC. We have also recently shown that enhancement of adult myelination counteracts the effect of social isolation in the induction of social avoidance behavior. All these data and additional rationale is now provided in the Introduction and Discussion of the revised text.</p><p><italic>â¢ Were antibiotic treatments continued during the 1.5 weeks behavioral testing?</italic> </p><p>Yes, the antibiotic regimen was continued throughout the behavioral testing period. To clarify this point we have updated the Materials and methods for this section.</p><p><italic>â¢ y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref> unclear â what is MBP+ fibers mean pixel intensity?

They should state that transcription of these genes was increased in Group II compared to Group I as shown in the figure.</italic> </p><p>We believe there might be some confusion in the data interpretation. Group I and Group II refer to microbiota depleted C57BL/6 recipients that received either the microbiota of the vehicle-gavaged NOD (which displayed the social avoidance phenotype, compared to baseline, as shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or that of the antibioticgavaged NOD (which did not display behavioral changes compared to baseline, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The results are now clearly explained in the Result section of the text.</p><p><italic>â¢ The color legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> needs to show the Group names (Group I or Group II), to avoid confusion about the interpretation of the data. Also the description of this figure panel states, &quot;significantly distinct clustering of C57BL/6 transplanted mice displaying social avoidance and an increase in despair-like behaviors compared to normal behaving controls&quot; although, according to the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>, the &quot;normal&quot; behaving animals show more social behavior and less despair-like behavior.</italic> </p><p>We sincerely hope that the extensive revisions have eliminated these points of contention.</p><p><italic>â¢ A list of the differentially expressed genes should be added to supplemental material, together with a list of terms from functional enrichment analysis</italic> </p><p>The above mentioned data have been uploaded in Dryad as supplemental table.</p><p><italic>â¢ The Discussion focuses mainly on the metabolomics data, but does not help explaining how the observed phenotypes are connected to a depleted microbiota. Here the authors show that it is the bacteria that remain after antibiotics (and are therefore overtaking/-growing) are necessary for the myelin increase â that's what the fecal transfer shows. if it was the bacteria that are gone who are important for the myelin changes than you would also see the effects in antibiotic C57Bl6 mice. This however, very much depends on the genetic background of the two strains and it's interaction with the microbiome â which is not discussed in this manuscript at all.</italic> </p><p>There are two points that are made by the Reviewer. The first one relates to the potential mechanisms linking metabolomics to microbiota and observed phenotype and the second one refers to the possibility that the behavioral changes might be caused by âdepletion ârather than âenrichmentâ for specific taxa. In response to this comment, we now show that cresol, one of the metabolite that we find enriched in the gut of mice with a behavioral phenotype, is capable of impairing myelin gene expression in cultured oligodendrocytes. The transcriptional changes in myelin genes and ultrastructural differences in PFC myelination were only detected in mice with high cresol, which were also characterized by social avoidance behavior and the presence of high levels of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae. The second concept which relates to depletion versus enrichment of specific bacterial taxa has been addressed experimentally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and associated supplement, which clearly shows that the behavioral changes induced by fecal transplantation were detected only in recipients with a high level of bacterial diversity and enrichment in Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae.</p><p><italic>â¢ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref> in the last sentence of the Results sections should be 7e and this sentence is again misleading, or at least again a rather surprising conclusion similar to the above.</italic> </p><p>The text has been entirely reworded to describe the new changes</p><p><italic>â¢ Not clear why the outcome of the increased myelin gene expression in transplantation of NOD microbiota to C57BL/6 is not shown at the protein level.</italic> </p><p>We provide ultrastructural data that allow a much more detailed level of resolution. Since the changes are regional, we do not believe that myelin preparations obtained from the whole brain would have allowed us to detect these regional specific differences.</p><p><italic>â¢ Why are they using two different reference genes in the qPCR data?</italic> </p><p>This was a typographical error. We only used the 36b4 as reference gene throughout the analysis, as now clearly indicated in the text.</p><p><italic>â¢ Images don't elude to which part of the medial PFC they imaged. It should be easy enough with the staining to highlight that. What layer of the PFC has more myelin?</italic> </p><p>We have now provided a schematic of the region that we have analyzed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The notion that the antibiotic treatments alter myelinating cells in the PFC is based on gene expression analysis RT-PCR and histological data showing changes on MBP+ fibers. While RNA levels provides strong evidence for changes in transcription or RNA stability in oligodendrocytes, to conclude that the antibiotic treatment affects myelin, immunostaining for MBP+ fibers is not sufficient. Morphological analysis like the ones the Casaccia group has done in prior studies (e.g. electron microscopy of myelin thickness, quantification of oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell density) will be necessary.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the Reviewerâs request we have now included electron microscopy of the prefronatal cortex of mice after transplantation.</p><p><italic>2) It would be very important to determine if the changes in myelin gene expression are unique to the PFC or this phenomenon is widespread throughout the brain. The authors should evaluate the expression of the myelin genes affected by antibiotic treatment in a brain region not linked to social/emotional regulation. The interpretation of the findings would be very different if this is a specific or a general phenomenon.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with the Reviewerâs request we have now included images and transcriptional analysis of the Nucleus Accumbens and we show that no changes can be detected in this brain region.</p><p><italic>3) There are some confusing aspects regarding the effects of treatments on behavior. For example, in the immobility tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, it seems that the only group with altered behavior is the oral-vehicle group. The behavior of mice treated with oral antibiotics is the same as the one with SI or SI-vehicle (and similar to all C57BL/6). Furthermore, in the measurements of social interactions, it seems that the oral vehicle reduces and the oral-antibiotic increases the time in the interaction zone compared to both groups treated by SI. Difference in behaviors between mice treated by SI vs oral, such as those in the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) leaves me wondering if in some cases lack or presence of effects of antibiotics could be due to a particular susceptibility of a mouse strain to a manipulation such as gavage or injections, and not really to a difference in the changes in microbiota. This issue would be clarified by presenting data on control mice (not treated at all).</italic> </p><p>As described before, we agree entirely with the Reviewer. There was confusion that originated from the omission of the control mice, and hope the reviewed manuscript clearly presents our results and conclusions.</p><p><italic>4) Did the authors monitor for onset of diabetes in NOD mice (i.e by detecting evidence of glycosuria)? This strain spontaneously develops diabetes in approximately 20-30% of males and the incidence of disease has been linked to changes in the microbiome (See Wen</italic> et al. <italic>Nature 2008; PMID 18806780). It would be important to know if the behavioral changes with antibiotic treatment in the NOD mice coincide with metabolic disease to determine if there is an interaction among these variables.</italic> </p><p>We have monitored glucose levels and body weight in NOD mice and did not detect any changes during the time of our experimentation. The presence of normoglycemia (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) indicates the absence of diabetes.</p><p><italic>5) The authors speculate that neurotoxic metabolites produced by a combination of gut microbia may affect PFC function. This interpretation would be strengthened if these metabolites were measured and detected in the CNS in vehicle and antibiotic treatment mice.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. However, to perform this experiment would require a substantial financial and time investment that the lab cannot afford at this moment. In order to address the potential direct effect of the highly cell permeable metabolite cresol on the cell of interest (i.e. myelinating cells), we have directly treated cultured oligodendrocytes with cresol and showed that this metabolite has the ability to impair oligodendrocyte differentiation and decrease myelin gene expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
