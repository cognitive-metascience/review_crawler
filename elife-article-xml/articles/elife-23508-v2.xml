Yet, little is known regarding the physiological consequences of morphological variability. We quantify animal-to-animal variability in cable lengths (CV = 0.4) and branching patterns in the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron, an identified neuron type with highly-conserved physiological properties in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of <italic>Cancer borealis.</italic> We examined passive GM electrotonic structure by measuring the amplitudes and apparent reversal potentials (E<sub>rev</sub>s) of inhibitory responses evoked with focal glutamate photo-uncaging in the presence of TTX. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were relatively invariant across sites (mean CV ± SD = 0.04 ± 0.01; 7–20 sites in each of 10 neurons), which ranged between 100–800 µm from the somatic recording site. Thus, GM neurons are remarkably electrotonically compact (estimated λ &gt; 1.5 mm). Electrotonically compact structures, in consort with graded transmission, provide an elegant solution to observed morphological variability in the STG.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23508.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23508.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Cancer borealis</italic></kwd><kwd>electrotonus</kwd><kwd>morphology</kwd><kwd>variability</kwd><kwd>stomatogastric ganglion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS092126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otopalik</surname><given-names>Adriane G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS017813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marder</surname><given-names>Eve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal-to-animal variability in neuronal geometry may be compensated for by compact electrotonic structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal circuits can generate stable output despite variable underlying parameters across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Marder, 2011</xref>).

In this way, ion channel expression, when superimposed on morphology, gives rise to neuronal physiology, input-output computations, and circuit-level function (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koch and Segev, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the physiological consequences of animal-to-animal variability in neuronal morphology in the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), a central pattern-generating circuit composed of 26–27 neurons.

STG neurons display large somata (50–100 µm in diameter) and primary neurites that ramify throughout the STG neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Selverston et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Graubard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilman and Marder, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic transmission between neurons is predominantly graded, inhibitory cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marder and Eisen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maynard and Walton, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">1999</xref>). Synaptic sites are sparsely distributed throughout finer processes in the neuropil region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>). There are no synapses on somata in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>) and spike initiation zones are located in the periphery where axons exit the ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller, 1980</xref>). Thus, synaptic integration and release occurs predominantly in the neuropil. In individual STG neurons, pre- and post-synaptic sites are often tightly apposed on the same neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>). This juxtaposition of synaptic input and output suggests that current will flow in all directions across the neurite tree, centripetally and centrifugally, in the intact circuit, and allow for integration of voltage signals arising from disparate loci on the neurite tree, should the neuron be sufficiently electrotonically compact.</p><p>Previous investigation of electrotonic structure in STG neurons employed simultaneous electrophysiological recordings at the soma and primary neurite, wherein electrodes were separated by several hundred microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Golowasch and Marder, 1992</xref>). These recordings showed low-pass filtering of high-frequency voltage events across the primary neurite, as is typically imposed by the membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rall, 1977</xref>). In contrast, slow voltage oscillations were subject to less electrotonic decrement. This frequency-dependent decay of electrical signals was consistent with the findings of contemporary theoretical and experimental works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rall, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnston and Brown, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spruston et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999</xref>). This early characterization of electrotonic structure in the STG may have been a satisfactory description at the time, given that STG circuit function is mediated predominantly by graded transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marder and Eisen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maynard and Walton, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">1999</xref>) and slow oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graubard and Ross, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ross and Graubard, 1989</xref>), and continues to oscillate in the absence of spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graubard, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graubard et al., 1983</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Barker, 1981</xref>). However, these early experiments left the electrotonic properties of more distal sites and higher-order branches to the imagination.</p><p>Relevant voltage events must arise at more distal, finer processes, where pre- and post-synaptic connections are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilman and Marder, 1996</xref>). Thus, a full experimental characterization of the electrotonic structure of STG neurons requires electrophysiologically sampling numerous sites across the dendritic tree. Of course, recording at many sites, let alone on the tiniest of neurite processes, presents technical challenges that few have overcome in situ. In one STG neuron type, the gastric mill (GM) neuron, we have utilized focal photo-uncaging techniques in tandem with electrophysiology to examine propagation of voltage events evoked at processes that vary in size and distance from the somatic recording site. We present a surprising case wherein geometrical complexity and variability appear not to constrain passive physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> is composed of 26–27 neurons situated around a dense neuropil region, wherein each of the neurons branches extensively. This central-pattern-generating circuit mediates the coordinated rhythmic contractions of the animal’s foregut. The gastric mill (GM) neuron is one of fourteen identified neuron types in the STG.

GM neurons participate in the episodic gastric mill rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartline and Maynard, 1975</xref>).

This is due to the lower resolution used for reconstruction of this large set of neurons, resulting in loss of some of the smallest profiles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Otopalik et al. (2017)</xref>, reported similar animal-to-animal variability in these metrics across a smaller sample size.</p><p>We also measured all soma-to-tip paths within each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These path length distributions varied within and across neurons, with distances ranging between 200–1000 µm and a mean coefficient of variation of 0.81. The mean soma-to-tip path length was 450 ± 80 µm. Thus, if synaptic voltage events arising at the neurite tip are measured electrophysiologically at the soma, such signals would travel this distance, on average.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, it is visually evident that GM neurons display tortuous three-dimensional structures. This is quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, which shows the tortuosities of soma-to-tip paths (path length/Euclidean distance from soma to tip location). For a given soma-to-tip path, a tortuosity of one suggests a minimal, Euclidean path from soma to tip, whereas tortuosities greater than one suggest winding paths that deviate from the minimal Euclidian distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right). Across GM neurons, tortuosity distributions vary. But, each neuron presents a broad tortuosity distribution and has a mean tortuosity that is modestly greater than one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; the mean across all neurons is 2.1 ± 0.5). Taken together, these data suggest that GM neurons are tortuous and expansive, and somewhat variable in their macroscopic morphology.</p><p>The functional consequences of morphological complexity and variability are best considered in light of how voltage signals arising from presynaptic inputs are integrated and transformed into spike patterns. Previous work suggests that pre- and post-synaptic connections are distributed throughout the finer process within the STG neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">King, 1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kilman and Marder, 1996</xref>) and that spike initiation zones are located in the periphery, where the axons exit the neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller, 1980</xref>). Thus, axon number, location, and branching patterns relative to each neuron’s neurite tree may speak to how voltage signals arising from presynaptic inputs are integrated. GM neurons typically have between 3–5 axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with at least one projection to the <italic>aln</italic> and one projection to the <italic>dvn</italic> (this is consistent with previous findings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maynard and Dando, 1974</xref>). In 2/14 neurons, only two axons were identified. This is likely due to an incomplete dye-fill or atypical branching of axonal projections beyond the microscope’s field of view. Branch order distributions varied across neurons, as did axonal branch point orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>, in some GM neurons all axons projected from the same branch point (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas in other GM neurons each axon projected from a distinct subtree (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken together, variable axon numbers, locations, and branching patterns suggest that each GM neuron differentially integrates voltage signals arising from varying proportions of lower and higher branch orders.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23508.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Variable axon location and branching patterns in GM neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram shows the number of distinguishable axonal projections for 14 GM neurons.

To quantify the dependence of response amplitude on each neuron’s cable properties, we generated ‘lolliplots’ of response amplitude, measured at the soma, to each photo-stimulated site, as a function of their distance from the somatic recording site, branch order, and neurite size (measured in terms of neurite diameter in the x-y plane; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The lolliplots show that the greatest response amplitudes can occur from photo-stimulation at sites with any distance from the soma, of any branch order, and of any size.

This approach distinguishes the degree to which the passive cable properties cause electrotonic decrement of voltage signals in their path of propagation to the somatic recording site, independent of the maximal conductance or receptor density at the photo-stimulation site. To demonstrate this logic, we built a library of passive cable models in the NEURON simulation platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>; see Materials and methods) and simulated activation of local inhibitory chloride currents (actual E<sub>rev</sub> = −70 mV) at varying distances from the recording site. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured by manipulating the membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) with current injections between −8 and +2 nA at the recording site. First, we demonstrate that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> of an inhibitory event evoked 200 µm away from the recording site (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is independent of its maximal conductance (or receptor density; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). The apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured with four maximal conductance (g<sub>max</sub>) values: 1, 5, 10, and 50 nS. Although the response amplitudes measured at the recording site vary with g<sub>max</sub>, all voltage responses flip their sign at −77 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ci</xref>, where response amplitude (deltaV) is plotted as a function of V<sub>m</sub> (as measured at the recording site at 0 µm). For each g<sub>max</sub> value, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> was calculated as the x-intercept of the linear regression of the deltaV versus V<sub>m</sub> curve (R &gt; 0.9 and p&lt;0.01 in each case). The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ci</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Cii</xref> clearly show that the x-intercepts are the same for all four g<sub>max</sub> values.

The apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured for inhibitory currents of the same g<sub>max</sub> (5 nS) but with increasing distance from the recording site: 0 to 1000 µm, at increments of 200 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). It is evident from the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub>, or membrane potential at which the responses change sign, occurs at increasingly hyperpolarized membrane potentials as a function of increasing distance from the recording site. This hyperpolarizing shift in apparent E<sub>rev</sub> is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Fi</xref>, where the x-intercepts for the deltaV versus membrane potential curves (as measured at the recording site at 0 µm) shift leftward with increasing activation site distance (shown clearly in the inset, a magnification of the x-intercepts). The apparent E<sub>rev</sub> shifts from an accurate measure of the actual E<sub>rev</sub> of −70 mV when activated at the recording site (0 µm) to −110 mV when activated 1000 µm away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Fii</xref>). Thus, from considering one cable model with one set of passive properties, we can deduce that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> of a locally-activated inhibitory current is independent of its maximal conductance (or receptor density) and is dependent on the site’s distance from the recording site.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> demonstrates that the dependence of the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> on distance is contingent upon the effective electrotonic structure of the voltage signal’s path of propagation, from activation site to recording site. With a similar set-up to the simulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>, apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were measured for responses arising from activation of the inhibitory current at sites with increasing distance from the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We conducted this simulation in a library of cable models with uniform diameters (5 µm) and lengths (1000 µm), but varying passive properties. Specifically, this set of 20 cable models varied in their combinations of passive leak conductances (g<sub>pas</sub>): 5, 10, 20, or 50 nS/cm<sup>2</sup> and axial resistances (R<sub>a</sub>): 1, 5, 10, 30, or 50 (Ω·cm). Thus, each cable model is distinguished by its electrotonic length constant (λ), determined by the expression: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. λ, in µm or mm, is equivalent to the distance at which a propagating voltage signal decrements to 37% of the maximal voltage signal (as would be measured at the site of activation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows inhibitory voltage events evoked at increasing distances from the recording site (at 0 µm) in three cable models with different λ values (200, 460, and 800 µm). With distance, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> undergoes a hyperpolarizing shift (as was the case <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, the rate at which this apparent E<sub>rev</sub> hyperpolarizes, as a function of distance, is dependent on the electrotonic length constant of the cable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). When λ = 800 µm, all apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s are −70 mV, regardless of activation site distance. When λ = 460 µm, apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s shift from −70 mV at the recording site (0 µm) to −88 mV at 1000 µm. When λ = 200 µm, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> shifts from −70 mV at 0 µm to well below −100 mV when the activation site is 1000 µm away. It is evident that the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> undergoes a greater hyperpolarizing shift with distance with decreasing λ values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows the dependence of apparent E<sub>rev</sub> as a function of activation site location for all 20 cable models with λ values ranging between 200–5000 µm. Considering a subset of these cable models, with λ values between 300–1700 µm, the apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s measured at different activation site distances diverge as λ decreases to 300 µm and converge as λ increases beyond 1000 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23508.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The shift in apparent E<sub>rev</sub> with activation site distance is contingent upon the electrotonic length constant, λ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For each of the 20 cable models, with varying passive properties and, consequently, λ values (see Materials and methods), an inhibitory current (actual E<sub>rev</sub> = −70 mV) was evoked at varying distances from the recording site 0 µm.

Invariant apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s suggest a relatively high electrotonic length constant, whereas heterogeneous E<sub>rev</sub>s suggest a lower electrotonic length constant. As is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, this approach to characterizing the electrotonic structure, or passive cable properties, of a neuron is independent of differential g<sub>max</sub> values, or receptor densities, across the neuronal structure.</p><p>In this simulation paradigm, current was injected at the recording site and flowed from the recording site to the stimulation site, changing the membrane potential at the distal site. The difference between the apparent E<sub>rev</sub> and the actual E<sub>rev</sub> is indicative of the ease of current flow in this direction and ability to manipulate the membrane potential at this distal site. Thus, there will always be a discrepancy between the voltage at the soma and the voltage at the photo-uncaging site and this discrepancy will depend on the effective electrotonic length constant of the neurite path. Therefore, this assay tests the passive cable properties of the path of propagation as is most relevant to current flow from recording site to stimulation site. Even so, the observations of sizeable voltage events at the recording site and reasonable reversal potentials are suggestive of a level of electrotonic compactness that is relevant to voltage signal propagation in either direction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distributed reversal potentials in GM neurons are nearly invariant</title><p>Using two-electrode current clamp at the soma, we measured apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s of local inhibitory responses evoked by focal photo-uncaging of glutamate at positions varying in distance from the somatic recording site.

These data were fit with linear regression analyses (R &gt; 0.9 in all cases) and the reversal potentials were determined by calculating the x-intercepts of the linear fits. The linear fits for each position show little variation in the reversal potential across all positions within each preparation, with a within-neuron coefficient of variation of 0.04 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were nearly invariant within each neuron, mean reversal potentials across neurons did vary, with a pooled mean of –78.6 ± 7 mV (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This could be attributed to real differences in the ionic current, which could be carried by potassium, chloride, or a combination of the two ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Marder and Paupardin-Tritsch, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisen and Marder, 1982</xref>).

Given that neuronal physiology also depends on the passive cable properties arising from geometry, we examined the physiological consequences of animal-to-animal variability in neuronal morphology. Despite their expansive and complex morphologies, GM neurons have electrotonically compact structures. This effectively compensates for morphological variability and contributes to consistent neuronal and circuit-level function across animals.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Complex yet compact</title><p>Here, we present the ostensible conundrum wherein an identifiable neuron type, despite its complex, highly-branched, neurite tree, is surprisingly electrotonically compact. This result differs from studies in a variety of neuron types that attribute specific physiological computations and plasticity rules to compartmentalized electrotonic structures. Early work in insect identified neurons with stereotyped dendritic branching patterns showed that electrotonically distinct dendritic subtrees result in the weighted integration of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murphey et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacon and Murphey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller and Jacobs, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacobs and Miller, 1985</xref>). Studies in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Spruston and Johnston, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carnevale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jaffe and Carnevale, 1999</xref>), have attributed Hebbian plasticity in part to the passive normalization of postsynaptic potentials arising from the electrotonically distant apical and basal dendritic tufts. Work in medium spiny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacAskill et al., 2012</xref>) and thalamocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Connelly et al., 2016</xref>) have demonstrated that the activation pattern of spatially-distributed, electrotonically distant, synaptic inputs produces different neuronal and circuit-level computations. The present work differs from these other studies of neuronal electrotonus and enriches our framework for understanding how morphology maps (or does not map) to physiological function. Otherwise stated: structural complexity does not necessarily yield compartmentalized computations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological implications</title><p>In GM neurons, synaptic voltage events may propagate tortuous neurite paths that extend beyond half a millimeter in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Yet, current can be injected at the somatic recording site and effectively alter the membrane potential at such distal and distant sites allowing for reasonable apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s (approximately −80 mV). Likewise, the amplitude of the voltage response at the photo-uncaging site must be larger than what we observe at the soma. Because distally evoked events, initiated as far as 1 mm away, can be observed at the somatic recording site, the electrotonic decrement of these distal events must be small enough so that apparent reversal potentials can be recorded. Lastly, the invariance in apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s across sites (a measure independent of receptor density) suggests relatively little variance in the electrotonic decrement of signals coming from disparate sites across the neurite tree. In this sense, these neurons function almost like a single compartment, despite their complex structures.</p><p>The geometric and/or passive cable properties provide the most plausible explanation for this electrotonically compact structure. Recent work has quantified the fine anatomical properties of GM neurons and other STG neuron types, showing that the primary neurite can be as large as 15–20 µm in diameter and that the most distal neurite branches may taper to diameters between <underline>&lt;</underline>1 and 10 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Otopalik et al., 2017</xref>). GM neurites may have relatively low axial resistances as a consequence of large neurite diameters. It is possible that voltage signal decrement may also be minimized by high membrane resistances across neurite branches. Given that these neurons are electrotonically compact, the input resistance as measured at the soma is likely a reflection of the resistance of the membrane surface area of much of the entire neuron. Thus, it is not surprising that input resistances measured at the soma are relatively low (mean of approximately 10 MΩ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), consistent with many years of recordings from STG neurons). If the neuron were less electrotonically compact, the input resistance measured at the soma would be higher, as the measurement would be restricted to the surface area of the local, somatic membrane.</p><p>Other neuron types compensate for passive attenuation of voltage responses with distance-dependent scaling of synaptic receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). Our experiments showed heterogeneous maximal response amplitudes across the neuronal structure. Due to the uniformity of their apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s, it is likely that these variable response amplitudes arise from local variations in receptor densities. Because the response amplitudes across sites vary in a manner that is independent of distance from the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), it is unlikely that receptor densities are scaling with distance in a systematic way.</p><p>These experiments provide an ‘upper bound’ on the effective electrotonic length constant and, therefore, the compactness of GM neurons. These experiments were done in TTX, wherein TTX-sensitive, voltage-gated sodium channels are blocked and circuit activity is silenced. While the overall membrane conductance may be higher in the absence of TTX (although, no change in input resistance as measured at the soma was detected before and after TTX addition), we would not expect these TTX-sensitive currents to substantially alter inhibitory voltage signal propagation at the range of membrane potentials probed here (−120 to −40 mV). Furthermore, spike initiation zones, where TTX-sensitive channels are most likely to reside, are located in the periphery, where the axons exit the neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller, 1980</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that TTX-sensitive voltage-gated channels would shunt the current arising from these evoked events in the same way as has been seen in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laurent, 1990</xref>). In STG neurons, it is an intriguing possibility that separation of synaptic integration and slow waves from spike initiation zones may be a morphological strategy established to avoid shunting of synaptic currents. Future experiments in varying pharmacological and modulatory conditions could shed light on how different voltage-gated currents, modulatory currents, and ongoing synaptic input during rhythmic activity, may effectively compartmentalize these otherwise compact passive neuronal structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Electrotonic structure in circuit context</title><p>GM electrotonic structure is best understood in light of STG circuit architecture. The identified neurons of the STG exhibit complex morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilensky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Graubard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bucher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goeritz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Otopalik et al., 2017</xref>). Like the GM neuron, all STG neurons display large somata (50–150 µm in diameter) and primary neurites that ramify throughout the STG neuropil, wherein synaptic partners form numerous, sparse synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Graubard, 1995</xref>). If each neuron type were highly electrotonically compartmentalized, yet variable across animals, wiring this circuit would be a puzzling developmental task. The fact that these neurons present electrotonically compact structures simplifies our understanding of the developmental wiring rules that may be required and how such a circuit can be relatively immune to structural differences.</p><p>The neurons of the STG rely on graded transmission and slow oscillations, rather than fast spikes, to maintain phase relationships at the circuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graubard, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Barker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2014</xref>). Given the relatively slow temporal precision of this circuit, an electrotonically compact structure is sufficient for integrating activity of many, yet sparsely distributed, synaptic inputs from each presynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King, 1976a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1976b</xref>), independent of synaptic site locations. In this way, electrotonic compactness both masks the observed heterogeneity in glutamate sensitivity across the neuronal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and diminishes the consequences of presumed variability in synaptic site location arising from observed animal-to-animal variability in GM morphology (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Otopalik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this scenario, presynaptic inputs may influence GM neuron activity with equivalent efficacy regardless of synaptic site location. This synaptic democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Häusser, 2001</xref>) is achieved by combining an electrotonically compact structure with graded transmission resilient to electrotonic decrement across sparsely distributed, synchronous presynaptic sites. This strategy is in stark contrast to the tight tuning of receptor or ion channel distributions employed by some neuron types. For example, CA1 pyramidal neurons compensate for passive attenuation of voltage responses with distance-dependent scaling of synaptic receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). It is feasible that strategies for achieving synaptic democracy vary across circuit contexts. The input-output computations of pyramidal neurons are typically dependent on spikes and fast voltage transients, whereas the neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion rely more heavily on graded transmission and slow oscillations to serve their circuit-level function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graubard, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Raper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graubard et al., 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Barker, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manor et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2014</xref>).

In this way, such rules hinge on a somewhat circular premise that specific neuronal functions arise from specialized geometries. As is evident in the present work, not all neuron types exhibit conserved morphologies across animals, yet show stereotyped physiological properties and circuit-level functions.

In the STG, neurons rely predominantly on slow oscillations for circuit function, and electrotonically compact structures elegantly compensate for a high degree of animal-to-animal variability in morphology. The degree of animal-to-animal variability in neuronal morphology, and whether it is compensated for, may depend on the system and the precision of the neuronal and circuit-level computation(s) to be performed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and dissections</title><p>Adult male Jonah Crabs (<italic>Cancer borealis)</italic> were purchased from Commercial Lobster (Boston, MA) and maintained in artificial seawater at 10–13°C on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle without food. On average, animals were acclimated at this temperature for one week before use. Prior to dissection, animals were anesthetized for 30 min on ice. Dissections were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gutierrez and Grashow, 2009</xref>) in saline solution (440 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 26 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 13 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 mM Trizma base, 5 mM maleic acid, pH 7.45). In brief, the stomach was dissected from the animal.

Extracellular nerve recordings were amplified using model 3500 extracellular amplifiers (A-M Systems). Data were acquired using a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Axon Instruments) and pClamp data acquisition software (Axon Instruments, version 10.5). For GM identification, one of two electrodes was impaled into the soma and spiking activity was matched with GM spike units on the <italic>dgn.</italic> GM identity was verified with positive and negative current injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Following unambiguous identification, the GM soma was impaled with a second electrode containing dilute alexa488 dye (2 mM Alexa Fluor 488-hyrazide sodium salt (ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog no. A-10436, dissolved in internal solution)). The GM neuron was iontophoretically dye-filled with negative current pulses (−4 nA, 500 ms at 0.5 Hz) for 15–25 min. For two-electrode current clamp, the electrode containing alexa488 was typically used for recording and amplified with a 0.1xHS headstage. The electrode used for cell identification was used for current injection and amplified with a 1xHS headstage. Resting membrane potential and input resistance were monitored throughout the experiment to ensure the integrity of the preparation (neurons with input resistances &lt;5 MΩ were discarded). In TTX, the mean input resistance, as measured at the somata and in the linear range of the current-voltage curve, was 9.9 ± 2.9 MΩ across preparations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Input resistances did not change significantly before and after addition of TTX to the bath (data not shown). Reversal potentials for the glutamate response were determined by evoking at least three responses at <underline>&gt;</underline>6 membrane potentials spanning −110 mV to −40 mV. In three preparations, an offset in the membrane voltage recording occurred during the dye-fill. This offset remained unchanged for the remainder of the experiment. This offset was corrected post-hoc during analysis of the recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Focal glutamate uncaging</title><p>For photo-uncaging experiments, preparations were superfused with a multi-channel Ecoline re-circulating pump (Ismatec/Harvard Apparatus, catalog no. PY2 72–6432) to maintain a stable bath volume and superfusion rate. 250 µM MNI-caged-L-glutamate (dissolved in saline; Tocris Bioscience, catalog no. 1490) was bath applied. 10<sup>−7</sup> M teterodotoxin (TTX) was also superfused to minimize spike-driven synaptic activity. Alexa488-filled GM neurons were visualized with a custom-built epifluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) equipped with a 40x water-immersion UV fluorescence objective (Olympus, LUMPLFLN 40XW) and a 470 nm LED (Thor Labs, M470L2). The emitted fluorescence was imaged with a monochrome CCD camera (Scientifica, SciCam). Focal photo-activation of MNI-glutamate was achieved with a small ultraviolet (UV) spot (~10 µm in diameter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) projected through this same 40x objective lens. By situating the custom microscope on a micromanipulator (Sutter MPC-200), this UV spot could be lased at different positions on the GM neuronal structure. Three-dimensional coordinates for each photo-uncaging site were tabulated during the experiment. Glutamate responses were evoked with 30 mW (as measured at the back aperture of the objective), 1 ms UV pulses with inter-pulse periods no less than 30 s to minimize photo-damage and desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To achieve this small UV spot, the UV laser beam (DPSS Lasers, model no. 35-07–100, 0.96 W, 100 kHz repetition rate) was coupled to a 50 µm diameter fiber optic cable (Thor Labs, M50L02S-A) with a UV lens (Thor Labs) and collimated with a 50 mm focal length plano-convex lens (Thor Labs, LA4148-UV). This collimated UV beam was delivered into the 40x objective lens to produce a focused spot of UV light on the preparation. A neutral density filter wheel was situated in the beam path for manipulation of the beam intensity (Thor Labs, NDM2). To ensure consistent beam intensities across experiments, the intensity was monitored in real-time using a photodiode (Thor Labs, PDA25K) previously calibrated with a power meter (Thor Labs, S302C). For precise temporal control of UV stimuli, a shutter (Thor Labs, SH1) was situated in the beam path. Both the laser Q-Switch and shutter were triggered by a set of coupled model 2100 isolated pulse stimulators (A-M Systems). The effective photo-uncaging radius in the x-y plane (15 µm) was determined by photo-uncaging at peripheral, distal neurites and moving away at 5 µm increments in the x-y plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) in a number of neuron types: pyloric dilater (PD), lateral pyloric (LP), and GM neurons.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23508.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Microscope schematic showing laser (purple), fluorescence excitation (blue), and fluorescence emission (green) paths.</title><p>A 1 Watt 355 nm laser (1) is focused by a plano-convex lens (2) and coupled to a 50-micron fiber optic cable (3) situated on an x-y translating fiber adaptor (4).

The beam intensity can be manually adjusted with a neutral density filter wheel (6) and passes through a 40x UV water immersion objective (7) onto the STNS preparation (8). The UV beam intensity is measured in real-time with a calibrated photo-diode (9) measuring a signal proportional to the power administered to the preparation. A 470 nm blue LED (10) is collimated by a plano-convex lens (11) and passes through a 466/40 nm band-pass filter (12) and field diaphragm (13). This light is re-directed by a 495 nm dichroic beamsplitter (14) and passes through a tube lens (15) and 405 nm low-pass dichroic beamsplitter (16). This is directed through the same 40x objective (7) and excites the alexa488 dye-filled preparation. This fluorescence passes through the 405 nm low-pass dichroic beamsplitter (16), tube lens (15), and 495 nm dichroic beamsplitter (14) and is subsequently captured by the CCD array of a firewire monochrome camera (Scientifica).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23508.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23508.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23508-fig10-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Dye-fill amplification and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Following photo-uncaging experiments, GM neurons were secondarily dye-filled with 2% Lucifer Yellow CH dipotassium salt (LY; Sigma, catalog no.

Once fine neurites of the cell could be visualized with a fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica MF165 F), a preliminary image was acquired at 11.5x magnification with an attached monochrome digital camera (Leica DFC365 FC). LY-filled preparations were fixed for 40 min at 21°C or overnight at 4°C in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 440 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4). Preparations were washed with 0.1 M PBS-T ((0.1–0.3%% Triton X-100 in PBS) and stored in PBS for 0–3 days prior to immunohistochemistry. The LY signal was amplified by 16 hr incubation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-LY antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes). After washing 5 × 15 min in PBS-T at room temperature, preparations were incubated in a secondary Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes) for 1.5 hr at room temperature.

For each skeleton, branch points, lengths, and orders were measured in reference to the soma and used to generate dendrogram representations with normalized path lengths. Branch, or path, lengths were measured as the most direct neurite path from the soma to each branch tip. Tortuosities were calculated for each path length, as the ratio of the path length over the Euclidean distance from soma to branch tip. Axon locations were identified as the last branch points without terminating branch tips. Photo-uncaging positions were re-located on preliminary fluorescence images of the Lucifer yellow dye-fill (as situated during experiment, at 11.5x magnification) using a custom alignment script written in MATLAB (Mathworks, version 2015b) by AO, and then manually re-located in the 3D skeleton using KNOSSOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>-Uncaging Coordinates Hoc files).

To determine reversal potentials at a given photo-uncaging position, raw response amplitudes were plotted as a function of membrane potential. These data were fit with a linear function (with an R value &gt; 0.9 in all cases). In some cases, response amplitudes saturated and the linear regression analyses were performed only in the linear range of these data. The x-intercept of the resulting linear function indicated the reversal potential at that position.

The cables were uniform in their geometric properties: 1000 µm in length and 5 µm in diameter. All cables had a membrane capacitance of 1 µF·cm<sup>−2</sup>.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;When complex neuronal structures may not matter&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gilles Laurent (Reviewer #3). Our decision has been reached after extensive consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> because we think addressing the issues will take longer than the allotted two months for revision. However, if you wish to undertake an extensive revision, we would be glad to reconsider the manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers all found the topic interesting and commented on the quality of the experiments and the intriguing nature of the result. Nevertheless, they were mixed in their assessment of the manuscript. The strongest concerns were, specifically, that in the absence of a more detailed investigation of cable properties, the reported electrical compactness is not well or easily reconciled with the low input resistances, and generally, that some of the approaches might not be ideal (somatic recordings to infer dendritic properties, effects of glutamate uncaging with possibly non-uniform receptor density, synaptic reversal potentials to test compartmentalization, simplified model to explore dendritic complexity) and some key parameters might be inadequately constrained (electrical attributes of the dendrites, and effect of TTX on the measurements). The reviewers also expressed concern that without a resolution of the apparent conflict between the compactness and low input resistance, it is not be possible to judge whether or under what conditions the observations might apply to any other kinds of neurons. Addressing these concerns would involve (1) validating and/or justifying the uncaging approach, (2) providing information about passive cable properties, (3) reconsidering and/or discussing limits on synaptic reversal potentials, (4) extending modeling, e.g., to test whether passive cable properties might normalize PSP amplitude with distance; to more fully consider dendritic complexity; to explore the phenomenon with numerical simulation experiments that add plausibility arguments to the results. These points are explained in more detail in the reviewers' comments, which are included in full below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study examines how variation in dendritic morphology influences synaptic integration in Gastric Mill (GM) neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The authors combine somatic 2-electrode voltage-clamp recordings with focal glutamate uncaging experiments to show that the amplitudes of glutamate responses appear not to depend strongly on distance or variations in local dendritic geometry. These are interesting, experiments, and the questions addressed are of broad general interest. However, the paper suffers from the fact that the authors are constrained to infer dendritic properties from somatic recordings without any direct measurements, and there are assumptions about the nature of the glutamate uncaging that are not adequately justified. Also, the computer models do not explore the very dendritic complexity that the study purports to address. In the end, I don't think readers will be convinced that the current data set provides sufficient mechanistic insight into the nature of dendritic integration in GM neurons. My major comments are detailed below.</p><p>1) The premise of this study rests on the use of uncaged glutamate responses as a means to elicit uniform currents at many spatial locations in the dendrites. However, for this approach to be valid, the density of (presumably mostly extra-synaptic) glutamate receptors must be uniform across the dendritic arbor. While the uncaged responses appear quite reliable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> at a given location, responses at adjacent locations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are highly variable, possibly reflecting variations in receptor density along the dendrites. There seems to be no systematic changes in response amplitude with local dendrite diameter or branch order, but it is not known what the amplitude of the responses are at the site of uncaging. With so many unknown free parameters (receptor density, surface area, local input resistance) it is not clear how these data can be interpreted cleanly. It is also not clear how these responses relate to the function of actual synapses, which according to the authors are located on the finer distal branches.</p><p>2) Considering how important passive cable properties are to the interpretation of the data, it is perhaps surprising how little information is provided about the actual passive electrical properties of GM cells. The only hint at these properties is the statement in the Methods that recorded GM cells had input resistances greater than 5 MΩ. This rather low value for input resistance (though perhaps not for invertebrate neurons) seems at odds with the authors' conclusion that GM neurons are electrically tight. There are modeling parameters reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, but it is not clear whether these values are based on real measurements or just reasonable guesses. Some more detailed information about GM cell electrical properties would be helpful and important.</p><p>3) In general, synaptic reversal potentials are not sensitive predictors of the extent of dendritic compartmentalization. The manner in which reversal potentials are measured produces conditions that reduce the influence of dendritic filtering (since voltages during long command stimuli have reached a steady state). Also, voltages show less attenuation in the centrifugal vs. centripetal direction due to decreasing diameter and surface area of more distal dendritic branches. Williams and Mitchell (2008) elegantly explored these and other issues of dendritic filtering in neocortical pyramidal neurons…and yet these neurons show compartmentalized responses and significant attenuation of synaptic events propagating from the dendrites to the soma. The ability of a voltage clamp circuit to measure reversal potentials of distal synapses with reasonable accuracy does not necessarily mean that local and propagated synaptic responses do not depend on dendritic morphology.</p><p>4) The discussion in the last paragraph of the subsection “Electrotonic Structure in Circuit Context&quot; contrasts the authors' present results and interpretations with results from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, where distance dependent attenuation of synaptic potentials is compensated via an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors (not voltage-gated conductances, as stated in the manuscript). In neocortical pyramidal neurons, though, distance dependent compensation for much of the dendritic voltage attenuation of synaptic events arises from the passive electrotonic structure of the dendritic arbor (e.g. Williams and Stuart 2002). It seems to me that either or both of these mechanisms could potentially explain the current findings.

The GM neurons have varied morphology and dendritic branching patterns, yet all respond similarly during the motor pattern they participate in.

The experiments to show this are well done and convincing, including an interesting failure to detect a distance dependence of the apparent reversal potential of the synaptic responses.

The authors find that the morphological features of this neuron are variable across animals, but that the responses, as measured from the soma, of the same neurons to uncaged Glu at various locations on its neuritic tree, vary little (across sites for a given neuron). Because most synaptic interactions are slow, and in a mostly passive regime, this leads to the conclusion that the electronic structure of GM is compact and its morphological architecture not relevant for integration/computation.</p><p>The paper is beautifully written, the figures limpid, the work quite extensive, the literature well researched and integrated.

Two essential points remain:</p><p>1) The first, extensively discussed by the reviewers, has to do with whether the conclusion that morphology has relatively little effect on voltage responses is adequately supported by the modeling, given that the specific parameters of neurite morphology were not considered. Reviewers recognized that the main point may not be to rule out the idea that any dendritic computations took place, but rather that the slow graded signals characteristic of these cells are not greatly affected by morphology; nevertheless, it was acknowledged that this distinction could be emphasized further. As stated in the consultation, &quot;The main thesis of the paper is that a long length constant of the neurite allows voltages from anywhere in the dendritic tree to propagate throughout the cell with minimal voltage attenuation, so the passive properties of their specific cell morphology is a central concern.&quot; One way to address this point, would be to import a real GM cell morphology into NEURON and express their passive properties uniformly in all compartments to test (a) whether the voltage attenuation or amplitude at the soma similar for long currents injected in distal neurites and (b) whether the length constant depends significantly on direction of propagation. The outcomes could serve either to support the results or place appropriate constraints on the conclusions. However, the reviewers agreed to leave the specific way of allaying these concerns to you, i.e., such a model is not required if you find alternative ways to clarify and/or limit the conclusions. The original &quot;major comments&quot; on this matter are included below for your reference, to guide and inform your revision.</p><p>2) The second point has to do with the placing constraints on the basis for electrotonic compactness. The Discussion mentions two possible explanations for how neurons with very low input resistance can be so electrotonically compact: very low internal resistance due to large diameter of initial processes (though this would not apply to the fine processes where the input-output synapses are located) and possibly high membrane resistance at branch points (though this would not block the passive spread of current along the internal resistance of the branches). The reviewers pointed out that it would be informative for the estimates of the length constant (1.5 mm) to be integrated with measurements of the input resistance (~ 10 MΩ) to come up with boundaries of Ri and Rm (given that Rin = (2/π)(RmRi)1/2(d)3/2 for a semi-infinite cylinder, and λ= ((RmRi)(d/4))1/2 (from Rall, 1977).</p><p>Comments related to Essential revision 1:</p><p>1) My main concern, before and now, has to do with whether the authors have truly shown that dendritic morphology plays little role in shaping voltage responses. The authors' argument is that the dendrites and soma are nearly equipotential, and that as a result inputs on any part of the structure have similar voltage contributions throughout the arbor. I don't see that this hypothesis has been adequately supported because the modeling does not take into account the actual neurite morphology the authors have quantified. The simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> show that under conditions favorable for voltage propagation (a moderately large, constant diameter neurite exhibiting a long 800 µm length constant), there is still &gt;50% attenuation of PSPs along its length despite the fact that the Erev can be accurately measured at these same distances. But the authors show in several figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that there are striking reductions in diameter in the more distal regions, which will impart a directional asymmetry in the efficacy of voltage propagation. In a passive neuron, centrifugal propagation will be more effective in a tapering structure such as the one exhibited by GM neurons, which help explain why Erev can be measured so effectively even at distal uncaging sites in experiments. However, propagation toward the larger diameter neurites and soma will be comparatively unfavorable. The simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> may thus underestimate the attenuation of voltages during propagation toward larger neurites.</p><p>I think the authors need to examine voltage propagation in a realistic morphological structure. If a conductance is introduced in neurites of differing orders, diameters and distances from the soma in a model neuron with realistic morphology, would these events yield comparable voltages at the soma? I do not expect that the authors must necessarily provide a full mechanistic explanation for their results, but I think such an examination would provide a better understanding of how spatially compact GM neurons are under more realistic conditions, and whether passive properties are sufficient to explain their uncaging results.</p><p>[In the words of another reviewer:] The other issue to discuss (also from Rall) is the large difference in voltage attenuation depending on the direction of the current flow (from a single dendritic point to the soma vs. from the soma to the dendrites). Your measurements of ipsp amplitude after stimulation at a single point are examples of the first, while your measurements of the Vrev from the soma are examples of the second. I think this will not be a problem for your analysis, but it should be explicitly discussed in the Discussion. The integration of spatially distributed synaptic inputs by the neuron would be an example of current flow from the periphery to the center, and from basic principles might show more attenuation.</p><p>2) There were some misunderstandings concerning my previous comments regarding the diversity of responses at adjacent locations and the lack of diversity of responses from neurites of different diameters. Put a different way, if a similar response is obtained from uncaging a 10 µm spot over a 1 vs. 10 µm diameter neurite (for example), does this not imply that there must be some other mechanism(s) in place to boost the amplitudes despite the 10-fold reduction in surface area and receptor density? A higher local input resistance might raise the local PSP amplitude, but such a mechanism might be limited due to the proximity of the reversal potential to rest. The authors have stated in their rebuttal that their concern is with voltage propagation and not local integration, but it seems to me that both issues are interrelated and central to understanding the results of their uncaging experiments.</p><p>3) In their rebuttal, the authors state that it is unlikely that receptor densities change along the dendrites because the &quot;response amplitudes across sites within each neuron show no quantitative dependence on distance from the recording site.&quot; This assumes there is no significant centripetal attenuation of voltage, but as detailed earlier, there is some uncertainty in this premise. If there is even moderate voltage attenuation between the small diameter, distal neurites and the soma, would not another mechanism be needed to restore the amplitude of the response?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23508.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers all found the topic interesting and commented on the quality of the experiments and the intriguing nature of the result. Nevertheless, they were mixed in their assessment of the manuscript. The strongest concerns were, specifically, that in the absence of a more detailed investigation of cable properties, the reported electrical compactness is not well or easily reconciled with the low input resistances, and generally, that some of the approaches might not be ideal (somatic recordings to infer dendritic properties, effects of glutamate uncaging with possibly non-uniform receptor density, synaptic reversal potentials to test compartmentalization, simplified model to explore dendritic complexity) and some key parameters might be inadequately constrained (electrical attributes of the dendrites, and effect of TTX on the measurements). The reviewers also expressed concern that without a resolution of the apparent conflict between the compactness and low input resistance, it is not be possible to judge whether or under what conditions the observations might apply to any other kinds of neurons. Addressing these concerns would involve (1) validating and/or justifying the uncaging approach, (2) providing information about passive cable properties, (3) reconsidering and/or discussing limits on synaptic reversal potentials, (4) extending modeling, e.g., to test whether passive cable properties might normalize PSP amplitude with distance; to more fully consider dendritic complexity; to explore the phenomenon with numerical simulation experiments that add plausibility arguments to the results. These points are explained in more detail in the reviewers' comments, which are included in full below.</italic> </p><p>The low input resistances measured in these neurons was cause for concern by reviewers 1 and 2. We address this issue in the revised manuscript in several locations. We have listed the input resistances measured at the soma in TTX in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; these measurements are described in the Methods subsection “Electrophysiology and Dye-Fills”, presented in the Results subsection “Distributed reversal potentials in GM neurons are nearly invariant”, and interpreted in the Discussion subsection “Physiological Implications”. Reconciling the low input resistances (as measured at the soma) with the electrotonic compactness of these structures may not be intuitive. In the Discussion, we write: “Given that these neurons are electrotonically compact, the input resistance as measured at the soma is likely a reflection of the resistance across the membrane surface area of much of the entire neuron. Thus, it is not surprising that input resistances measured at the soma are relatively low (mean of approximately 10 MΩ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), consistent with many years of recordings from STG neurons). If the neuron were more electrotonically compact, the input resistance measured at the soma would be higher, as the measurement would be restricted to the surface area of the local, somatic membrane.”</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we sought to clarify that the goal of this work is to assess how the passive cable properties of these neurons may influence voltage signal propagation. Thus, the term “compartmentalization,” is used very carefully and in reference to that which may be imposed by the passive cable properties of these neurons. It is true that there are different mechanisms (synaptic inputs, voltage-gated ion channels, modulatory receptors) that may superimpose on the passive cable structures and effectively compartmentalize these neurons in the intact circuit. But, probing these other mechanisms is not the objective of this work, but an intriguing phenomenon to address in future work. In the Discussion, we write: “These experiments were done in TTX, wherein TTX-sensitive, voltage-gated sodium channels are blocked and circuit activity is silenced. […] Future experiments in varying pharmacological and modulatory conditions could shed let on how different voltage- gated currents, modulatory currents, and ongoing synaptic input during rhythmic activity, may effectively compartmentalize these otherwise compact passive neuronal structures.”</p><p>In the new manuscript, we present an expanded passive cable model simulation (subsection “Probing electrotonic structure with reversal potential measurements”) that clearly shows:</p><p>i) the independence of apparent reversal potential measurements on receptor density (or maximal conductance).</p><p>ii) the dependence of apparent reversal potential measurements on activation site distance from the recording site</p><p>the contingency of this distance-dependency on the electrotonic length constant (λ) This simulation utilizes a library of cable models with varying membrane and axial resistances and electrotonic length constants varying between 200 µm and 5 mm. By expanding the parameter and stimulus spaces of the simulation, we believe we have shown these three above results and resolved much of the confusion expressed by reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>Courses of Action</p><p>In the general summary, we were asked to address these issues by taking the following courses of action:</p><p>Validating and/or justifying the uncaging approach. In the Introduction, we write that previous work had used dual recordings in the soma and primary neurite to probe passive filtering of high and low frequency voltage signals. However, “relevant voltage events must arise at more distal, finer processes, where pre- and post-synaptic connections are located (King 1976a, b; Kilman and Marder, 1996). […] We present a surprising case wherein geometrical complexity and variability appear not to constrain passive physiology”. We feel that this is justification for use of this methodology, which provides a means of activating voltage events at sites varying in distance from the recording site. Given the unmistakable relationship between the apparent reversal potentials for responses evoked across the neuronal structure and the electrotonic length constant (as described in subsection “Probing electrotonic structure with reversal potential measurements”), this methodology is an adequate approach to address our scientific objective.</p><p>Providing information about passive cable properties. As described above, the input resistance measurements are now listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, described in the Methods and Results, and interpreted in the Discussion. The geometrical properties are also described: neurite lengths are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, diameters are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and neurite taper in diameter is discussed in the subsection “Physiological Implications”.</p><p><italic>Reconsidering and/or discussing limits on synaptic reversal potentials and extending modeling.</italic> Both of these points are addressed with the expanded passive cable simulations and are sufficient for addressing the clarified objective of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This study examines how variation in dendritic morphology influences synaptic integration in Gastric Mill (GM) neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG). The authors combine somatic 2-electrode voltage-clamp recordings with focal glutamate uncaging experiments to show that the amplitudes of glutamate responses appear not to depend strongly on distance or variations in local dendritic geometry. These are interesting, experiments, and the questions addressed are of broad general interest. However, the paper suffers from the fact that the authors are constrained to infer dendritic properties from somatic recordings without any direct measurements, and there are assumptions about the nature of the glutamate uncaging that are not adequately justified. Also, the computer models do not explore the very dendritic complexity that the study purports to address. In the end, I don't think readers will be convinced that the current data set provides sufficient mechanistic insight into the nature of dendritic integration in GM neurons. My major comments are detailed below.</italic> </p><p>These experiments utilized two-electrode current clamp, not voltage clamp, at the soma to measure voltage responses evoked at varying distances from the somatic recording site. The objective of this work was not to address local dendritic integration; in the revised manuscript, we sought to clarify that the goal of this work is to assess how the passive cable properties of these neurons may influence voltage signal propagation. This concern has been addressed in response to the Summary above.</p><p><italic>1) The premise of this study rests on the use of uncaged glutamate responses as a means to elicit uniform currents at many spatial locations in the dendrites. However, for this approach to be valid, the density of (presumably mostly extra-synaptic) glutamate receptors must be uniform across the dendritic arbor. While the uncaged responses appear quite reliable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> at a given location, responses at adjacent locations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are highly variable, possibly reflecting variations in receptor density along the dendrites. There seems to be no systematic changes in response amplitude with local dendrite diameter or branch order, but it is not known what the amplitude of the responses are at the site of uncaging. With so many unknown free parameters (receptor density, surface area, local input resistance) it is not clear how these data can be interpreted cleanly. It is also not clear how these responses relate to the function of actual synapses, which according to the authors are located on the finer distal branches.</italic> </p><p>There were no efforts made to uniformly activate currents. The laser power, pulse duration, and glutamate concentrations were kept constant throughout the duration of the experiment (as described in the Results (subsection “Variable Glutamate Responses Across the Neuronal Structure”) and Methods (subsection “Focal Glutamate Uncaging”). This approach allowed us to measure the endogenous and heterogeneous glutamate sensitivities across different sites on a single neuron. The possibility of heterogeneous glutamate receptor densities as an explanation for the variable response amplitudes was discussed in the subsection “Variable Glutamate Responses Across the Neuronal Structure”, last paragraph, subsection “Distributed reversal potentials in GM neurons are nearly invariant”, first paragraph and subsection “Physiological Implications”, second paragraph. In the Discussion, we write: “Other neuron types compensate for passive attenuation of voltage responses with distance- dependent scaling of synaptic receptor density (Andrásfalvy and Magee, 2001; Magee and Cook, 2001; Smith et al., 1990). […] Because the response amplitudes across sites within each neuron show no quantitative dependence on distance from the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; Supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), it is unlikely that receptor densities are scaling with distance in a systematic way.” It is true that we cannot be certain of receptor densities without measuring responses at the photo-uncaging sites. Here, we wished to express that receptor densities appear not to scale so as to result in similar amplitudes after passive propagation to the somatic recording site (as has been shown in these other cited cases).</p><p><italic>2) Considering how important passive cable properties are to the interpretation of the data, it is perhaps surprising how little information is provided about the actual passive electrical properties of GM cells. The only hint at these properties is the statement in the Methods that recorded GM cells had input resistances greater than 5 MΩ. This rather low value for input resistance (though perhaps not for invertebrate neurons) seems at odds with the authors' conclusion that GM neurons are electrically tight. There are modeling parameters reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, but it is not clear whether these values are based on real measurements or just reasonable guesses. Some more detailed information about GM cell electrical properties would be helpful and important.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern in response to the Summary above.</p><p><italic>3) In general, synaptic reversal potentials are not sensitive predictors of the extent of dendritic compartmentalization. The manner in which reversal potentials are measured produces conditions that reduce the influence of dendritic filtering (since voltages during long command stimuli have reached a steady state). Also, voltages show less attenuation in the centrifugal vs. centripetal direction due to decreasing diameter and surface area of more distal dendritic branches. Williams and Mitchell (2008) elegantly explored these and other issues of dendritic filtering in neocortical pyramidal neurons…and yet these neurons show compartmentalized responses and significant attenuation of synaptic events propagating from the dendrites to the soma. The ability of a voltage clamp circuit to measure reversal potentials of distal synapses with reasonable accuracy does not necessarily mean that local and propagated synaptic responses do not depend on dendritic morphology.</italic> </p><p>Much of these concerns are addressed in response to the Summary above. It is true that voltage propagation may face different degrees of electrotonic decrement, depending on propagation direction. This question was not addressed in this work. Here, we measured voltage propagation in what might be considered the “centripetal” direction, although it is important to note that these neurons are not bipolar in structure, and that neurites serve as sites of both input and output (King 1976a, b). Our investigation of voltage propagation from neurite sites to the soma is relevant to the function of these neurons, given that synaptic events arise at secondary and higher-order neurites and must eventually propagate ‘centripetally’ toward the primary neurite and out to axonal projections to evoke spikes. As reviewer #1 stated, substantial decrement of voltage signals is seen in the centripetal direction in hippocampal neurons (Williams &amp; Stuart, 2008). Our results are, indeed, a counter-example to what is seen in pyramidal neurons. We hope that readers will appreciate this result as a demonstration that not all neurons utilize the same strategies to produce reliable physiology, and that pyramidal neurons present one case in neuronal physiology, not the rule.</p><p><italic>4) The discussion in the last paragraph of the subsection “Electrotonic Structure in Circuit Context&quot; contrasts the authors' present results and interpretations with results from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, where distance dependent attenuation of synaptic potentials is compensated via an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors (not voltage-gated conductances, as stated in the manuscript). In neocortical pyramidal neurons, though, distance dependent compensation for much of the dendritic voltage attenuation of synaptic events arises from the passive electrotonic structure of the dendritic arbor (e.g. Williams and Stuart 2002). It seems to me that either or both of these mechanisms could potentially explain the current findings. Given that neither of these mechanisms is explored directly in the current study, I don't know that the authors are in a strong position to argue that GM neurons operate differently.</italic> </p><p>Our reference to distance-dependence scaling of AMPARs has been corrected for this error. We’ve addressed the remaining concerns in this comment in response to reviewer #1, point #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript reports an unusual electrotonic compactness in one neuron type in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion.

The original &quot;major comments&quot; on this matter are included below for your reference, to guide and inform your revision.</italic> </p><p>We have chosen not to pursue additional modeling of a realistic GM morphology in NEURON for three predominant reasons:</p><p>i) The first reason is scientific. One take-home message of this work is that similar physiology can arise from variable morphologies. Thus, it is not scientifically sound to upload one GM neuronal structure into NEURON as a means of elucidating ubiquitous biophysical mechanisms underlying their compact electrotonic structures, when it is evident that there are many solutions.</p><p>The purpose of the reduced cable model in this manuscript (as in the present and original submissions) is to provide a theoretical but intuitive explanation for the experimental approach. On the other hand, a model of a fully reconstructed neuron would strive to provide a mechanistic explanation of the result. Due the issue of multiple solutions, a model of one fully reconstructed neuron would not yield more insight than that of the discussion regarding biophysical mechanisms provided in the Discussion of the manuscript.</p><p>ii) The second reason is practical. We are not equipped to accurately model the full neuronal structure in NEURON due to three issues pertaining to the cross- sectional areas of STG neurites being ovular, rather than circular. (1) We do not have the data for the cross-sectional areas of all the neurites composing any one neuronal structure. This is partially because no reconstruction software, to our knowledge, allows manual tracers to assign non-circular cross-sections. And, the collection of these data, even if possible, would take months. To date, this is why we have chosen skeletal reconstructions for interrogation of STG neuronal morphology. (3) NEURON assumes circular cross-sections, making it impossible to accurately model these neurons. (3) We would have to “make up” data about the ion channel distributions over the extended cable.</p><p>iii) The final reason is of a philosophical nature. In the present study, the data provide an interesting story in their own right: GM morphology is complex and variable; this variability may be masked by compact electrotonic structures. The data stand on their own.</p><p>However, we have addressed the reviewers’ concerns by clarifying the text of the manuscript with the following:</p><p>i) In the Introduction we emphasize the arrangement of pre- and postsynaptic sites and spike initiation zones on the neurite tree and explain the physiological relevance of current flow direction in these neurons. This is important because it provides a rationale for our assay of electrotonic structure. We write:</p><p>“Synaptic transmission between neurons is predominantly graded, inhibitory cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission (Eisen and Marder, 1982; Marder and Eisen, 1984; Maynard and Walton, 1975; Graubard, et al., 1980; Manor et al., 1997, 1999). […] This juxtaposition of synaptic input and output suggests that current will flow in all directions across the neurite tree, centripetally and centrifugally, in the intact circuit, and allow for integration of voltage signals arising from disparate loci on the neurite tree, should the neuron be sufficiently electrotonically compact.”</p><p>ii) In the Results section, we specify the direction of current flow in both the cable model simulations and the physiological experiments. We write:</p><p>“In this simulation paradigm, current was injected at the recording site and flowed from the recording site to the stimulation site, changing the membrane potential at the distal site. […] Even so, the observations of sizeable voltage events at the recording site and reasonable reversal potentials are suggestive of a level of electrotonic compactness that is relevant to voltage signal propagation in either direction”</p><p>“Using two-electrode current clamp at the soma, we measured apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s of local inhibitory responses evoked by focal photo-uncaging of glutamate at positions varying in distance from the somatic recording site. In these experiments, current was injected at the somatic recording site and flowed centrifugally from the recording site to the photo- uncaging site, changing the membrane potential at this distal site.”</p><p>iii) In the Discussion, we revised our interpretation of the data and discuss how the result relates to the direction of the current injection and direction of initiated voltage signal propagation. We write:</p><p>“In GM neurons, synaptic voltage events may propagate tortuous neurite paths that extend beyond half a millimeter in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). […] In this sense, these neurons function almost like a single compartment, despite their complex structures.”</p><p><italic>2) The second point has to do with the placing constraints on the basis for electrotonic compactness. The Discussion mentions two possible explanations for how neurons with very low input resistance can be so electrotonically compact: very low internal resistance due to large diameter of initial processes (though this would not apply to the fine processes where the input-output synapses are located) and possibly high membrane resistance at branch points (though this would not block the passive spread of current along the internal resistance of the branches). The reviewers pointed out that it would be informative for the estimates of the length constant (1.5 mm) to be integrated with measurements of the input resistance (~ 10 MΩ) to come up with boundaries of Ri and Rm (given that Rin = (2/π)(RmRi)1/2(d)3/2 for a semi-infinite cylinder, and λ= ((RmRi)(d/4))1/2 (from Rall, 1977).</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we did a series of calculations yielding values of R<sub>i</sub> (Ω · cm) and R<sub>m</sub> (Ω · cm<sup>2</sup>) for specified diameters (d), the observed average Rinput (10 MΩ), and predicted upper bound for λ (1.5 mm). For example, if d = 0.5 µm, R<sub>i</sub> = 30 µΩ · cm and Rm = 550 µΩ · cm<sup>2</sup>. If d = 20 µm, R<sub>i</sub> = 1.97 Ω · cm and R<sub>m</sub>= 0.88 Ω · cm<sup>2</sup>. We have chosen not to include these calculations because exact values for R<sub>m</sub>or R<sub>i</sub>would not do justice to the complex and variable structures observed across animals.</p><p>As a conceptual point, we estimated an effective λ (which is an upper bound) for the entirety of the neuronal structure. Presumably, the λ of specific segments of neurite may vary, depending on their biophysical and geometrical properties. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, neurite diameters (at the photo-uncaging sites) can range between 0.5 µm <underline>&lt;</underline> d <underline>&lt;</underline> 20 µm. In another anatomical study (Otopalik, et al., in review), we find that diameters of primary, secondary, tertiary, and terminating neurites can vary widely. While there is a trend of decreasing diameter from primary neurite to tip, a given neurite path does not necessarily taper linearly or exponentially with distance. In fact, diameters can increase and decrease non-systematically with distance (this can be observed visually in the confocal micrographs).</p><p>Given the wide range of diameters and λ values expected to arise across these neurite trees, one is left with an infinite matrix of possible combinations of resistivities and diameters that would yield the range of λ values sufficient for producing the compact neuronal physiology demonstrated in these experiments.</p><p><italic>Comments related to Essential revision 1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) My main concern, before and now, has to do with whether the authors have truly shown that dendritic morphology plays little role in shaping voltage responses. The authors' argument is that the dendrites and soma are nearly equipotential, and that as a result inputs on any part of the structure have similar voltage contributions throughout the arbor. I don't see that this hypothesis has been adequately supported because the modeling does not take into account the actual neurite morphology the authors have quantified. The simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> show that under conditions favorable for voltage propagation (a moderately large, constant diameter neurite exhibiting a long 800 µm length constant), there is still &gt;50% attenuation of PSPs along its length despite the fact that the Erev can be accurately measured at these same distances. But the authors show in several figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that there are striking reductions in diameter in the more distal regions, which will impart a directional asymmetry in the efficacy of voltage propagation. In a passive neuron, centrifugal propagation will be more effective in a tapering structure such as the one exhibited by GM neurons, which help explain why Erev can be measured so effectively even at distal uncaging sites in experiments. However, propagation toward the larger diameter neurites and soma will be comparatively unfavorable. The simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> may thus underestimate the attenuation of voltages during propagation toward larger neurites.</italic> </p><p><italic>I think the authors need to examine voltage propagation in a realistic morphological structure. If a conductance is introduced in neurites of differing orders, diameters and distances from the soma in a model neuron with realistic morphology, would these events yield comparable voltages at the soma? I do not expect that the authors must necessarily provide a full mechanistic explanation for their results, but I think such an examination would provide a better understanding of how spatially compact GM neurons are under more realistic conditions, and whether passive properties are sufficient to explain their uncaging results.</italic> </p><p><italic>[In the words of another reviewer:] The other issue to discuss (also from Rall) is the large difference in voltage attenuation depending on the direction of the current flow (from a single dendritic point to the soma vs. from the soma to the dendrites). Your measurements of ipsp amplitude after stimulation at a single point are examples of the first, while your measurements of the Vrev from the soma are examples of the second. I think this will not be a problem for your analysis, but it should be explicitly discussed in the Discussion. The integration of spatially distributed synaptic inputs by the neuron would be an example of current flow from the periphery to the center, and from basic principles might show more attenuation.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) There were some misunderstandings concerning my previous comments regarding the diversity of responses at adjacent locations and the lack of diversity of responses from neurites of different diameters. Put a different way, if a similar response is obtained from uncaging a 10 µm spot over a 1 vs. 10 µm diameter neurite (for example), does this not imply that there must be some other mechanism(s) in place to boost the amplitudes despite the 10-fold reduction in surface area and receptor density? A higher local input resistance might raise the local PSP amplitude, but such a mechanism might be limited due to the proximity of the reversal potential to rest. The authors have stated in their rebuttal that their concern is with voltage propagation and not local integration, but it seems to me that both issues are interrelated and central to understanding the results of their uncaging experiments.</italic> </p><p>These above concerns are addressed above in response to Essential revisions 1 and 2.</p><p><italic>3) In their rebuttal, the authors state that it is unlikely that receptor densities change along the dendrites because the &quot;response amplitudes across sites within each neuron show no quantitative dependence on distance from the recording site.&quot; This assumes there is no significant centripetal attenuation of voltage, but as detailed earlier, there is some uncertainty in this premise. If there is even moderate voltage attenuation between the small diameter, distal neurites and the soma, would not another mechanism be needed to restore the amplitude of the response?</italic> </p><p>In fact, we state that receptor densities across neurite sites likely do vary. But, our data suggests that they do not vary in a manner that is distance- or diameter-dependent. Because the reversal potentials are relatively constant across sites, we can rule out that the cable properties give rise to these variable response amplitudes. Thus, we are left with receptor density as the main determinant in voltage response amplitude heterogeneity. If receptor density scaled with distance or diameter (in such a way that compensated for these geometric properties) we might see a zero-slope in the linear fits, suggesting that voltage signal decrement is normalized by increasing receptor densities; or perhaps we would see increasing amplitude with distance, which might suggest over-compensation of receptor density; regardless, we would see some quantitative trend. To clarify our interpretation, we have re-written a section to read:</p><p>“Because the response amplitudes across sites vary in a manner that is independent of distance from the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), it is unlikely that receptor densities are scaling with distance in a systematic way.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
