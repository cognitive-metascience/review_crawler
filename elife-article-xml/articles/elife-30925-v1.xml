crucial for developing sustainable crop production systems. We coupled ecological sampling and genome sequencing to characterize the population genetic history of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> and the distribution patterns of virulence plasmids in isolates from nurseries. Analysis of chromosome sequences shows that plants host multiple lineages of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, and suggested that these bacteria are transmitted due to independent introductions, reservoir populations, and point source outbreaks. We demonstrate that isolates lacking virulence genes promote beneficial plant growth, and that the acquisition of a virulence plasmid is sufficient to transition beneficial symbionts to phytopathogens. This evolutionary transition, along with the distribution patterns of plasmids, reveals the impact of horizontal gene transfer in rapidly generating new pathogenic lineages and provides an alternative explanation for pathogen transmission patterns. Results also uncovered a misdiagnosed epidemic that implicated beneficial <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> bacteria as pathogens of pistachio. The misdiagnosis perpetuated the unnecessary removal of trees and exacerbated economic losses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30925.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All organisms live in a world teeming with bacteria. Some bacteria are beneficial and, for example, provide their hosts with nutrients. Others cause harm, for example, by stealing nutrients and causing disease. Many bacteria can also gain DNA from other bacteria, and the genes encoded within the new DNA can help them to live with other organisms. This can start the bacteria on an evolutionary path to becoming beneficial or harmful.</p><p><italic>Rhodococcus</italic> are bacteria that live in association with many species of plants, including trees. Most are harmless but some cause disease. Plants infected with harmful <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> can show deformed growth, which causes major losses to the nursery industry.</p><p>Savory, Fuller, Weisberg et al. set out to understand how disease-causing <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> are introduced into nurseries, if they are transferred between nurseries, whether they persist in nurseries, and how to limit their spread. It turns out that harmless <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> are beneficial to plants. However, if these harmless bacteria gain a certain DNA molecule – called a virulence plasmid – they can convert into harmful bacteria. Further analysis showed that some nurseries repeatedly acquired the harmful bacteria. The pattern of affected nurseries suggested that some might have purchased diseased plants from a common provider. In other cases, the sources remained a mystery.</p><p>Savory et al. also report that, contrary to previous findings, there is no evidence to support the diagnosis that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> without a virulence plasmid are responsible for an unusual growth problem that has plagued the pistachio industry. In recent years, this incorrect diagnosis led to trees being unnecessarily destroyed, worsening the economic losses.</p><p>These findings suggest that genes moving between bacteria can dramatically change how those bacteria interact with the organisms in which they live. It needs to be shown whether this is an exceptional process, unique to only certain groups of bacteria, or if it is more widespread in nature. These findings could inform future disease management strategies to better protect agricultural systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mutualism</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>evolutionary transition</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>Rhodococcus</kwd><kwd>plant growth promoting bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-51181-22384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grünwald</surname><given-names>Niklaus J</given-names></name><name><surname>Putnam</surname><given-names>Melodie L</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Jeff H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013-67012-21139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savory</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-67012-26126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisberg</surname><given-names>Alexandra J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The horizontal acquisition of virulence plasmids is potentiated by production practices in plant nurseries and is sufficient to transition <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> from being beneficial to being pathogenic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Symbioses are persistent and intimate interactions between organisms. In pathogenic interactions, one partner benefits at the expense of the other. In mutualistic symbioses, specific partners interact and reciprocally benefit. Associative symbioses are a variation of mutualism in which there is lower specificity between interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drogue et al., 2012</xref>). In agricultural systems, practices are employed to limit pathogens, to introduce nitrogen-fixing mutualistic rhizobia and to restore associative symbionts such as plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). PGPB can directly promote the growth of plants and protect against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pieterse et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The beneficial or parasitic outcomes of symbioses, especially those involving environmentally acquired partners, are often not guaranteed. The health of the host, location of the symbiont on the host, or unregulated proliferation of the symbiont can lead to alternative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin and Koskella, 2015</xref>). The genotype of the symbiont is also a critical factor, as horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can lead to the acquisition of new genes that innovate genomes, driving evolutionary transitions and establishing new lineages of beneficial or pathogenic symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soucy et al., 2015</xref>). In some pathogenic symbionts, however, HGT does not bestow the genome with innovative functions, nor do these genomes exhibit substantive changes. Rather, the few horizontally acquired genes encode products that reprogram core genes, thereby co-opting the genome for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Letek et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>Rhodococcus</italic> is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria with members that persist in a variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Larkin et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> includes taxonomic groups with members that have been repeatedly recovered from leaf and root tissues of various species of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodenhausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lebeis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qin et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salam et al., 2017</xref>). It has been suggested that hosts enrich for members of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> because of the beneficial traits of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Plant-associated <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> species are better known as pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam and Miller, 2007</xref>). Two clades of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> include members that can cause disease in over 100 genera of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Creason et al., 2014a2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam and Miller, 2007</xref>). Herbaceous plants are the most commonly affected whereas woody plants are less frequently infected. Disease symptoms include leafy galls, witches’-brooms, and other disfiguring growths. Pathogenic isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, typified by the most-studied isolate D188, require three virulence loci that are most frequently found clustered on virulence plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crespi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stes et al., 2011</xref>). These plasmids are approximately 200 kb in length and are linear replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creason et al., 2014b</xref>). Some of the <italic>fas</italic> (<italic>fasciation</italic>) genes are necessary for disease and encode proteins that synthesize and modify cytokinins, which are predicted to be secreted effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crespi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pertry et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>fasR</italic> gene, predicted to be a transcriptional regulator, is also necessary for pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Temmerman et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>att</italic> (<italic>attenuation</italic>) mutants are reportedly attenuated in disease and thus implicated in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crespi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maes et al., 2001</xref>). The <italic>vicA</italic> gene, which encodes malate synthasean enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, is the only locus encoded on the chromosome implicated in virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vereecke et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> are particularly problematic in agricultural settings that produce plants for their aesthetic value. A variety of biotic and abiotic stresses, some induced by anthropogenic practices, cause symptoms that are confused with those caused by <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam and Miller, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> that lack virulence genes are often cultured from symptomatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creason et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nikolaeva et al., 2009</xref>). Multiple tests are used to confirm that a plant is infected by pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. Bacteria must exhibit the proper morphology on selective media and be taxonomically assigned to <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. The bacteria must have virulence genes and must cause disease symptoms in susceptible indicator plants. Because the <italic>fasR</italic> gene and some of the <italic>fas</italic> genes are necessary for pathogenicity of the bacteria, their detection is sufficient to confirm pathogenicity of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates.</p><p>In 2011, populations of micropropagated pistachio UCB-1 (<italic>Pistacia atlantica</italic> × <italic>Pistacia integerrima</italic>) rootstocks planted in commercial fields began showing an unusual phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2015b</xref>). Aerial phenotypes of ‘pistachio bushy top syndrome’ include shortened internodes, loss of apical dominance, stem galls, and reduced grafting success. Estimates suggest that more than 1 million trees grown on 25,000–30,000 acres were affected. <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates were cultured from symptomatic plants, and when inoculated onto UCB-1, they caused morphological changes to the hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>). This was the first report of pistachio being susceptible to <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. Subsequent release of the genome sequences for PBTS1 and PBTS2, the reported outbreak strains, indicated they lack virulence loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stamler et al., 2016</xref>). The detection of <italic>vicA</italic> was used as evidence for pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> bacteria and to guide management practices, the most extreme and costly being the removal of entire orchards. A second incidence of pistachio bushy top syndrome occurred in 2016, resulting in the destruction of 1.5 million nursery trees.</p><p>We determined and analyzed genome sequences from over 80 isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, mostly collected from symptomatic herbaceous plants grown in production settings. Analysis of chromosomal sequences shows that plants host multiple lineages of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. Isolates that lack virulence plasmids can promote changes to the architecture of roots, but if a virulence plasmid is acquired, the isolates transition to being pathogenic. The analysis of chromosomal sequences of pathogens revealed the potential for multiple infections and reservoir populations at nursery sites, as well as for point source outbreaks. However, the distribution patterns of virulence plasmids suggested that agricultural systems can be locations that promote evolutionary transitions and the rapid generation of new lineages of pathogens, providing an alternative route for the spread of pathogens. Last, our results challenge previous conclusions that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates lacking virulence genes are causative agents of pistachio bushy top syndrome, suggesting that the pistachio syndrome was likely misdiagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2015b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epidemiological links in nurseries</title><p>We used a genomic epidemiological approach to study the transmission patterns of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> in a plant agricultural system. Sixty isolates were collected hierarchically across space and time.

Ours is a case study for using genomic epidemiology to uncover and explain the transmission patterns of phytopathogens in agricultural systems. The investigation of plasmid distribution highlighted the significant role of HGT in shaping the population structure of pathogenic bacteria and revealed challenges in modeling their transmission. Our analysis of chromosomal SNPs suggested that nurseries experience multiple and independent introductions of pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, exemplified by ‘a’ isolates observed in nurseries N15 and N8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The link between isolates collected across time (‘b’) is indicative of a reservoir population that has a pathogenic genotype. The epidemiological links (‘c1’ and ‘c2’) of isolates from different nurseries support the possibility of point source outbreaks and suggest that the sources have reservoir populations.</p><p>However, the distribution of plasmids also indicated that alternative processes may be occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). First, two different plasmid types are associated with ‘c2’. This is not expected from an outbreak and is more consistent with different members of a lineage acquiring plasmids separately. Second, different plasmid variants are carried by isolates that are defined by genotypes associated with ‘a1’, ‘b’, and ‘c1’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These are not expected patterns and probably reflect separate acquisitions of plasmids by different members of a lineage or the rapid and independent evolution of plasmids. Third, genetically distinct lineages of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> at nursery N15 carry the same variant of plasmid. This is best explained by multiple lineages' acquiring plasmids from a common donor population. Nurseries often produce a large variety of perennials and clonally propagated plants that are frequently handled and intensely managed in multiple production settings, and are often in regions that produce many different agricultural commodities. These are prime locations for different genotypes of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> to interact and for plasmids to be transferred, switched, and evolved.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30925.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the evolutionary transition in <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> and effects on agricultural sectors.</title><p>The presence or absence of the virulence plasmid in eight species of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>determines whether the bacterium is beneficial (right), and promotes growth in root architecture, or pathogenic (left), and causes leafy galls and inhibits primary growth.

Virulence-gene-lacking isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> were diagnosed as outbreak strains and the probable misdiagnosis could have had detrimental impacts on the pistachio industry (as indicated on the right of the figure).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30925-fig9-v1"/></fig><p>We also demonstrated that plants in agricultural systems are hosts to isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> that are probably beneficial associative symbionts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vacheron et al., 2013</xref>). Root hairs are extensions that increase the surface area of roots, forming an extensive interface between plant and soil. Virulence-gene-lacking isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> caused significant increases in the number and length of root hairs, which may enable plants to be more efficient in the uptake of water and dissolved nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This potentially beneficial growth-promoting phenotype is consistent with the finding of a number of reports identifying <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> within endophytic compartments and the rhizosphere of plants, and with the suggestions that the bacteria are enriched for by plants because of their beneficial traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodenhausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2015</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Qin et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salam et al., 2017</xref>).

The mechanism by which isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> cause growth changes to plants is unknown, as genome mining efforts suggest that these traits are potentially novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Acquisition of a virulence plasmid by isolates representing eight species of Clades I and II is sufficient to drive an evolutionary transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Loss of the plasmid reverted <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> to being beneficial, consistent with the hypothesis that virulence genes function irrespective of genomic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we could not identify any chromosome-located genes that are enriched in pathogenic isolates, in comparison to non-pathogenic isolates, that could be potential candidate virulence genes. Evolutionary transitions, such as the switch from being a free-living, non-pathogenic lineage to being a pathogenic lineage, have beendetected frequently (for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruto et al., 2017</xref>). The transition described for <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> is seamless and the mutualist to pathogen transition has beendescribed only rarely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sachs et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that focus on characterizing binary outcomes in symbioses have obscured the true fluidity of symbioses. Similar transitions may have occurred in <italic>Agrobacterium/Rhizobium</italic>, a group of bacteria that express plasmid-mediated traits of significance to plant agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Lajudie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glaeser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacroix and Citovsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Transitions and the rapid generation of new lineages of pathogens could occur in agricultural systems, where plants are frequently host to multiple <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates of different genotypes. Pathogenic isolate 05-2254-6, which is associated with ‘a2’, is most similar to virulence-gene-lacking isolate, 14-1411-2a, also collected from N8. The 220 pairwise SNPs that differ between these two isolates exceeded the threshold used to define genotypes, but the two isolates are nonetheless closely related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). This is not unique, as several pathogenic genotypes are related to virulence-gene-lacking genotypes, as indicated by their intermingling in the phylogeny and their connectivity in the network. The patterns involving distinct genotypes or plasmid types, such as ‘a1’ and ‘c2’, respectively, are also consistent with evolutionary transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). An example that is similar to ‘a1’ is the genotype of D188 and LMG3605, both of which have different plasmid variants.</p><p>The limited genetic diversity in virulence plasmids within our dataset was unexpected and suggests that their common ancestor evolved recently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in dramatic contrast to the virulence plasmids of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> species of bacteria, where the Ti and Ri plasmids form different types that can be easily distinguished on the basis of the phylogeny of a single, conserved virulence gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuller et al., 2017</xref>). It is also remarkable that the virulence plasmid, which carries only three virulence loci, is sufficient for pathogenicity across eight genetically diverse species of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creason et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Letek et al., 2010</xref>). FasR is a predicted transcriptional regulator, and is probably key for reprogramming the genome to transition bacteria to pathogens. The roles of the other two loci are still unclear. Results presented here suggest that <italic>att</italic> contributes to the maintenance of disease symptoms, but the mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The Fas-produced mix of cytokinins are predicted to be secreted into plants and necessary to cause disease symptoms, but the existing data are not consistent with this hypothesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63"> (Pertry et al., 2009</xref>). Exceedingly low amounts of cytokinins are detected in culture-grown bacteria and plants have a variety of cytokinin-buffering mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creason et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kieber and Schaller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pertry et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">, 2010</xref>). A miniscule amount of starting bacterial inoculum is sufficient to provoke disease symptoms, and exogenous applications of cytokinins fail to phenocopy the effects of pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Last, the cytokinin mixture model is challenged by the revelation that the fitness of D188-5, a key isolate used to develop the model, is severely compromised by a 25-kb deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Desomer et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pertry et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Temmerman et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>This study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of an organism and the consequences of prematurely drawing conclusions from incomplete data. There is no evidence to suggest that HGT or evolutionary transitions confounded the diagnosis of pistachio, and we could not detect pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> from symptomatic tissues of pistachio. We were unsuccessful in repeating results showing that PBTS1 and PBTS2, or other isolates cultured from pistachio, cause disease symptoms on plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We could not amplify virulence genes from PBTS1 or PBTS2, but when a virulence plasmid was introduced into PBTS2, it was sufficient to transition PBTS2 to a pathogen of a plant species that is demonstrably susceptible to <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). Whether pistachio is even a host for pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> is unresolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we recognize the insurmountable challenge in showing that there is no possibility that pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> causes pistachio bushy top syndrome.</p><p>The results from this work prompted us to examine previous studies retrospectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">[Stamler et al., 2015a</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">, 2015b</xref>]). There was a targeted search for <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, the justification for which is unfounded because the symptoms on pistachio are unlike any produced by pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> in any of the 100+ known hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam and Miller, 2007</xref>). Bacteria were inexplicably cultured from asymptomatic leaves distal to symptomatic stem tissues. The key study did not include control strains or reproduce galling and graft failure, the most defining disease symptoms observed in field settings. A high inoculum of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> was used and high doses of even beneficial bacteria can have costs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, some human diseases are caused by dysbiosis in which an imbalance of gut microbiotia causes disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloom et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, hosts often employ mechanisms to regulate or ensure nonpersistent interactions with beneficial bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gutjahr and Parniske, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Magori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wopereis et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Results based on molecular detection were similarly tenuous. The use of the <italic>vicA</italic> locus was misleading and led to conclusions regarding the pathogenicity of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The reported amplification of fragments of <italic>fasA</italic> and <italic>fasD</italic> (GenBank accession numbers KP274062 and KP274064) from PBTS1 as well as <italic>fasD</italic> (KP274067) from PBTS2 cannot be reconciled with the absence of the genes from the genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2016</xref>). We used a different technology to re-sequence independently prepared DNA from PBTS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). The assembly is co-linear with the publically available sequence and lacks the virulence plasmid and virulence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stamler et al., 2016</xref>). The possibility that virulence plasmids are unstable in populations grown outside of plant environments is not supported by the data. DNA extracted from bacteria grown in culture was used as a template in both PCR and whole-genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2016</xref>). We successfully sequenced plasmids from 64 culture-grown pathogenic isolates, which had undergone multiple transfers, and repeatedly and successfully detected pathogenic isolates cultured from symptomatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Creason et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Some of the results of molecular detection were clearly artifacts. The two fragments reported to correspond to <italic>fasD</italic> are identical in sequence, each consisting of two short fragments of 147 and 194 nucleotides long that are artificially joined together by 280 ‘Ns’. In our dataset, A21d2 is the only sequenced pathogenic isolate that lacks <italic>fasA</italic>, but it also lacks a homolog of <italic>fasD</italic>. It is thus not expected that PBTS2 should have only <italic>fasD</italic> but no <italic>fasA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>). The most egregious artifact was the reported amplification of <italic>vicA</italic> from PBTS1 (GenBank accession number KP274063), which we could not reproduce (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When the sequence of the reportedly amplified fragment was used as a query to BLAST search the PBTS1 genome sequence directly, we failed to identify a homologous region. When used in searches against publically available databases, the top hits other than KP274063 were NM-J PBTS (KR153287; 100% identity), DMS3-9 (KJ677035; 97% identity), D188 complete genome (CP015235; 96% identity), and PBTS2 complete genome (CP015220; 96% identity).</p><p>Another study posited that the virulence plasmids are unstable in populations persisting within plant environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nikolaeva et al., 2009</xref>). Genome sequences showed instead that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates are from genetically distinct lineages. This observation further emphasizes the need to use appropriate molecular diagnostic tools that discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic bacteria. LAMP to detect <italic>fasR</italic> or RPA nfo to detect <italic>attE</italic> or <italic>attG</italic> are both sensitive methods that have the additional benefit of being rapid and less dependent on specialized equipment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serdani et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The data are consistent with the possibility that previous conclusions rest on a misdiagnosis of pistachio bushy top syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2015b</xref>). If so, <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> was implicated as pathogenic, irrespective of genotype and in disregard of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the genus. This mindset conflates all bacteria as causative agents of disease and demotes the importance of bacteria in promoting the health of their hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This potential misdiagnosis of pistachio bushy top syndrome could be responsible for catastrophic effects. An estimated 2.5 million trees have been destroyed, resulting in tremendous economic loss. Efforts to identify the true cause were decelerated. Accusations regarding the source of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> have introduced conflict into an industry struggling with a considerable and unfamiliar problem. Considering the data described here, previous conclusions should, at the very least, be tempered and recommendations for managing plants in which <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> bacteria have been detected, reexamined. Ideally, these findings will renew efforts to identify the true nature of the syndrome afflicting UCB-1 pistachio rootstocks.</p><p>Actinobacteria are prominent members of plant-associated communities, but the mechanisms and evolution of traits that are important for Gram-positive bacteria to reside in microbial communities and influence plant health are not well understood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Germinated seeds were soaked in suspension of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2) or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> buffer for 45 min. Ten seeds per treatment were included in each experiment. Inoculated seeds were placed in sterile test tubes containing 5 ml of Hoagland’s nutrient agar. Samples were incubated for 14 days at 23°C with a 16/8 light/dark cycle. Stem number and length were quantified at 14 dpi.</p><p>Infection of UCB-1 pistachio was done, with minor modifications, according to previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>). Briefly, control isolates, PBTS1, PBTS2, and a 1:1 mixture of PBTS1 and PBTS2 were suspended in 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (final OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.7). Treatment groups consisting of 15 seedlings were spray-inoculated with 200 ml of bacterial suspension. A mock-inoculated control group was sprayed with 200 ml of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Inoculated seedlings were placed in humidity chambers for 14 days and the plants were maintained in a greenhouse for seven months. Tree height and internode length were measured at 30 day intervals, and the final measurements were recorded at 210 dpi.</p><p>Unless indicated, all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. For all data sets, outliers were identified using the ROUT method (Q = 1%) and removed. Data were analyzed using One-way or Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (GraphPad Prism v.7, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Box and whisker plots were generated using the Tukey method; colored dots indicate outliers. Means are indicated by +.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Nucleic acid manipulations</title><p>The <italic>attR</italic> gene was PCR-amplified from D188 genomic DNA and subcloned downstream to the L5 bacteriophage promoter in vector pJDC165 (Jeff Cirillo, Texas A and M). The L5::<italic>attR</italic> construct was verified via Sanger sequencing. <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> competent cells were prepared from overnight-grown 3 ml cultures. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with sterile, cold dH<sub>2</sub>O, followed by one wash with sterile, cold 10% glycerol. Cells were resuspended in 50 µl 10% glycerol. Plasmid DNA (0.5–1 µg) was added to the cells. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cells were electroporated in 1 mm gap cuvettes at 2.2 kV. Cells were resuspended in 250 µl SOC medium and incubated at 28°C with shaking for 16 hr prior to plating on LB medium with appropriate antibiotics.</p><p>For PCR, the following were used: 1x ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA, USA), 200 μM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer, 50 ng genomic DNA template, 0.625 units <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA, USA), in a final volume of 25 μl. PCR conditions were 95°C, 3 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min; 72°C for 10 min; 16°C hold. Reactions with water, instead of a DNA template, were used as a negative control.</p><p>For LAMP, the reaction mixture was as follows: 0.5 ng DNA template, 1x ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA, USA), 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 140 µM dNTPs, 146 µM hydoxynaphthol blue (HNB), 1.6 µM each 16FIP and 16BIP primers, 0.2 µM each 16F3 and 16B3 primers, and 12 U Bst polymerase in a final volume of 25 µl. Reactions were incubated at 64°C for 60 min and then cooled to 4°C. Tubes were centrifuged briefly at 8000 rpm.</p><p>RPA was done per the manufacturer’s instructions (TwistAmp Basic, TwistDx Limited, Cambridge, UK). Reactions consist of 0.48 μM per primer, 29.5 μl rehydration buffer, 12.2 μl water, and 1.0 μl genomic DNA. A volume of 2.5 μl 280 mM magnesium acetate (MgAc) was added to initiate the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuller et al., 2017</xref>). Products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany), run out on a 2.0% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. Products were verified via Sanger sequencing.</p><p>RPA reactions coupled to lateral flow detection were comprised of 0.42 μM forward primer, 0.42 μM biotin-labeled reverse primer, 0.12 μM probe, 29.5 μM rehydration buffer, 12.2 μl water, and 1.0 μl of 25 ng/μl genomic DNA. Reactions were added to a freeze-dried pellet provided by the manufacturer (TwistAmp nfo, TwistDx Limited, Cambridge, UK) with the subsequent addition of 2.5 μl of 280 mM MgAc to initiate the reaction. Following subsequent incubation at 37°C for 30 min, the dual-labelled amplicon was visualized using a lateral flow dipstick (Milenia Biotec GMbH, Germany). One microliter of the RPA product was diluted in 49 μl 1.0x PBST and 10 μl of the dilution were applied to the base of the dipstick, which was subsequently submerged in 100 μl 1.0 PBST at room temperature until the visualization of the positive control band, typically lasting two minutes.</p><p>Sequences of primers and probes, and their modifications, are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work would not have been possible without the contribution of plants from multiple nurseries, for which we are appreciative.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolutionary transitions between beneficial and phytopathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> challenge disease management&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Cara H Haney (Reviewer #1); Boris Vinatzer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work explored the evolution of virulence in Rhodococcus sp. through an ecological survey, they sequence genomes and look for bacterial loci that correlate with symbiosis versus pathogenesis. This work provides molecular evidence for the evolutionary transition from symbiont to pathogen, and shows that a single plasmid/gene cluster is necessary and sufficient to turn a symbiont into a pathogen. This work has implications for evolutionary biology, commensalism versus pathogenesis and is directly useful for agriculture. The study is well done and well controlled and the data are in general quite convincing. All the reviewers were quite positive about this study. They agree that most of the conclusions are justified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several issues came up that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Data analysis and presentation should be improved:</p><p>A) It’s not clear whether virulence genes are always carried on a plasmid in Rhodococcus. Most of the genomes present in this study are in 10-100 contigs, thus the bulk of the genomic data is in contigs, not circularized chromosomes or plasmids. Based on the data presented alone, it is possible that the virulence genes are present in genomic island configurations in some strains rather than on plasmids. While D188 clearly has a virulence plasmid mobilizable to Clade 1 organisms, this may not be the case for all of the draft genomes.</p><p>This could be resolved either by the authors showing that the sequences containing virulence genes can always be assembled into circular plasmids, providing evidence the virulence genes are higher copy (which would suggest they're on plasmids) OR by rewriting the text and remaking the figure legends to indicate that the focus is on presence/absence of virulence genes rather than the presence/absence of a plasmid.</p><p>B) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is difficult to interpret. The authors should reconsider how they present these data. One possibility is a scatterplot showing pairwise SNP divergences for the chromosome on one axis and some metric for virulence plasmid relatedness on the other (e.g. correlation coefficient of gene presence/absence). Then, symbols and colors could be used to add additional information about the spatial and temporal &quot;patterns&quot; of interest.</p><p>C) Some details in the graphs were not warranted (and indeed not used by the authors as well). For example, the authors only commented on the relationship between Chromosome (Clade ID) and Plasmid (Type ID) without referring to fine details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. It was difficult to comprehend the figures with so many broken lines crossing each other. Why not just present a cross-table [two factors] to present number of strains in each category – this should be able to clearly show non-congruence?</p><p>D) The authors presented the statistical results early in figures. Please also include the p-value in the text as well.</p><p>2) The writing and data presentation needs to be improved.</p><p>The introduction should be more specific about the research objectives. These were only obvious upon reading the Discussion section when the authors point-by-point demonstrated misdiagnosis of the disease causal agent in previous work. Please work on the Results and Discussion sections about &quot;patterns&quot; in the population structure. Please tone down the conclusions in regard to the pistachio decline. The authors provide convincing information that the two isolates were not pathogenic and that this is most likely not due to a loss of the virulence plasmid during growth in the laboratory after the original isolation. However, the authors make a point how pathogenic and non-pathogenic strain of Rhodococcus can co-exist on plants. Therefore, isn't it possible that other pathogenic Rhodococcus strains were present on pistachio plants and did in fact cause the decline? Although this is unlikely based on all the circumstantial evidence that argues against Rhodococcus as pathogenic agent of the pistachio decline, but the authors could still mention this as a possibility.</p><p>3) Claims of benefit:</p><p>While plant growth promotion is often beneficial, the authors should limit claims of benefit to the discussion and limit the description in the results to be more objective. It seems possible the observed morphological changes in response to non-pathogenic Rhodococcus are not in fact beneficial, but rather an intermediate pathogenic phenotype. The authors do not show benefit directly, but rather morphological changes to root hair density and length, which could be beneficial under certain circumstances.</p><p>4) Suggestion for removing some data:</p><p>Subsection “Isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> lacking the functional set of virulence genes are beneficial bacteria” – We suggest removing this section and corresponding data from the manuscript. There isn't clear evidence (that the reviewers knew of) where callose deposition by heat killed bacteria has been shown to be a good readout or proxy for microbial effects on systemic plant immunity, or priming. The authors definitely cannot conclude from this result that microbial antagonism is a more likely to be the cause of biocontrol. It could be that live bacteria are required for modulation of systemic immunity, or that the Rhodococcus suppresses local defense responses but induces systemic defenses. (Indeed, the bacterial ISR strain <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> simiae WCS417 induces systemic defenses but suppresses local defenses; see Millet et al., 2010).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30925.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several issues came up that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Data analysis and presentation should be improved:</p><p>A) It’s not clear whether virulence genes are always carried on a plasmid in Rhodococcus.

In 62 of the 66 assemblies (virulence gene-carrying isolates; past and current efforts), the virulence genes are present on a single large contig that have strong evidence supporting it corresponds to the linear virulence plasmid. These contigs have plasmid features (pFi_009 was used as a representative marker gene; telomere-associated protein) and are colinear to the reference virulence plasmid of D188. Two assemblies had the virulence loci and pFi_009 on separate contigs, but the contigs are similar in composition to the reference plasmid sequence, are co-linear to the reference, and carry features unique to plasmids. These 64 are distinctly different from A21d2 and A25f, which appears to have virulence loci in the chromosome. BLAST using virulence genes as queries only identified contigs that corresponded to the linear virulence plasmid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This could be resolved either by the authors showing that the sequences containing virulence genes can always be assembled into circular plasmids, providing evidence the virulence genes are higher copy (which would suggest they're on plasmids) OR by rewriting the text and remaking the figure legends to indicate that the focus is on presence/absence of virulence genes rather than the presence/absence of a plasmid.</p></disp-quote><p>The average relative coverage (linear plasmid:chromosome) of sequencing was 1.89 ± 0.56. Only three assemblies had a relative coverage &lt; 1.0 but each of these three had the virulence genes and pFi_009 on the same contig. The virulence plasmid is not a typical plasmid. It is ~200 kb in length and linear. It is clear we did a poor job communicating these details so we added a sentence to the introduction that conveys this information.</p><p>We hope the newly added data communicate the confidence in our conclusions regarding the virulence plasmids.

Previously in the introduction, we had a sentence that informed readers that we would examine the previous experiments that led to the conclusion that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> is the causative agent of pistachio bushy top syndrome. We removed that sentence and replaced it with a phrase that clearly states one objective of this manuscript is to reexamine previous conclusions.</p><p>We understand the need to exercise caution and toned down the language regarding our claim of a misdiagnosis. It may be helpful to describe the depth to which we have investigated this problem and the process we followed. We feel it is important to show that the reported data represent a fraction of our efforts, and to impress upon the reviewers that we understand the gravity of the situation, and prior to submitting our work, attempted to preemptively limit potential harm to all involved parties. We are concerned with the effects of the results from previous studies on US agriculture and the potential effects on public trust in science. We are also concerned with the potential repercussions of our study on colleagues.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the hypothesis that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> is not a pathogen of pistachio is untestable. There is a possibility that pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> can cause disease to pistachio. But it would more likely be leafy galls or witches’ brooms, as has been documented for all previous woody hosts infected with pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, and opposed to the phenotypically distinct “pistachio bushy top syndrome”. To test previous conclusions, we can only uncover and support possible alternative explanations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), challenge the reproducibility of results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>; discussion), and question experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; DDiscussion section). Based on results from the approaches that are available to us, we concluded “pistachio bushy top syndrome” was misdiagnosed.</p><p>We were first made aware of the problem in April of 2014. Multiple attempts to reproduce the detection of virulence genes and demonstrate causation of disease were done independently by different researchers in both the Putnam and Chang groups. From June 2014 to December 2015, we had nine email communications to inform the corresponding author of Stamler et al., (2015) that we were unable to reproduce the findings that: (1) virulence genes are encoded by pistachio-associated <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, (2) pathogenic (those that encode virulence genes) <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> could be cultured from pistachio (110 plants were assayed, including those in tissue culture, from nurseries, and from fields), or (3) the pistachio-associated isolates cultured from pistachio cause disease to plants. We also cautioned against the use of <italic>vicA</italic> for molecular detection of pathogenic isolates because it does not discriminate pathogenic from non-pathogenic isolates. The email communications included official reports, prepared by the Oregon State University Plant Clinic, directed by a co-author of our study. In total, at least 22 people, including authors of the original publications, extension agents, stakeholders, and members of the California Pistachio Research Board, have been informed of our results. Most of the data were shared in 2014, prior to publication of Stamler et al., (2015), and some are in this submitted manuscript.</p><p>Reproducibility is one of the central tenants of the scientific method. In most instances, the research community has the luxury of moving past irreproducible results, and the publications reporting such results receive little attention. However, the diagnosis of “pistachio bushy top syndrome” is not academic. The results that members of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> cause “pistachio bushy top syndrome”, which we were unable to reproduce, are being used to guide the action of stakeholders, actions that have not only severe economic consequences, but also legal consequences. This compelled us to be firmer in our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Claims of benefit:</p><p>While plant growth promotion is often beneficial, the authors should limit claims of benefit to the discussion and limit the description in the results to be more objective.
