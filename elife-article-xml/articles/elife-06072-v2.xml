It varies systematically with spatial direction and is generally modeled as a pure time delay, independent of frequency. In acoustical recordings, we found that interaural delay varies with frequency at a fine scale. In physiological recordings of midbrain neurons sensitive to interaural delay, we found that preferred delay also varies with sound frequency. Similar observations reported earlier were not incorporated in a functional framework. We find that the frequency dependence of acoustical and physiological interaural delays are matched in key respects. This suggests that binaural neurons are tuned to acoustical features of ecological environments, rather than to fixed interaural delays. Using recordings from the nerve and brainstem we show that this tuning may emerge from neurons detecting coincidences between input fibers that are mistuned in frequency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06072.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06072.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06072.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When you hear a sound, such as someone calling your name, it is often possible to make a good estimate of where that sound came from. If the sound came from the left, it would reach your left ear before your right ear, and vice versa if the sound originated from your right. The time that passes between the sound reaching each ear is known as the ‘interaural time difference’. Previous research has suggested that specific neurons in the brain respond to specific interaural time differences, and the brain then uses this interaural time difference to locate the sound.</p><p>Sounds come in various frequencies from high-pitched alarms to low bass tones, and how a neuron responds to interaural time differences appears to change according to the frequency of the sound being played. For example, a given neuron may respond to a 200- microsecond interaural time difference when a tone is played at a high frequency, but show no response to this time difference when the tone is played at a low frequency. To date, researchers had been unable to explain why this occurs.</p><p>Here, Benichoux et al. investigated this topic by playing a variety of sounds to anaesthetized cats. Electrodes were used to record the responses of individual neurons in the cats' brains, and the properties of the sound waves that reached the cats' ears were also recorded. These experiments revealed that the time it took a sound to travel from a location to each of the cats' ears, and consequently the interaural time difference, depended on whether it was a high-pitched or a low-pitched sound. This happened because different properties of the environment, such as the angle of the cat's head, affected specific frequencies in different ways.</p><p>As expected, the neurons' responses were also affected by sound frequency. Indeed, the neurons' behaviour mirrored that of the sound waves themselves. This shows that neurons do not, as previously thought, simply react to specific interaural differences. Instead, these neurons use both sound frequency and interaural time differences to produce a thorough approximation of the sound's location. The precise mechanisms that generate this brain adaptation to the animal's environment remain to be determined.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06072.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06072.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>auditory brainstem</kwd><kwd>cat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC StG 240132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brette</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-0001-02 PSL*</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brette</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0961.11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds OT/09/50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-0087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brette</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0A11.13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds OT/14/118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joris</surname><given-names>Philip X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Tom P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complex properties of space-sensitive auditory neurons in cats mirror the complexity of acoustical environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acoustical waves produced by a sound source reach the two ears at slightly different times depending on its spatial position. Interaural time differences (ITDs) are used by many species to localize sounds in the horizontal plane. In mammals, neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO), just three synapses away from the cochlear receptors, are sensitive to both ITD and sound frequency. It is thought that their activity encodes ITD in a frequency band, and is then interpreted in terms of spatial position. They project to neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC), which inherit these properties.</p><p>The firing rate of these neurons is strongly modulated by the ITD of a tone presented binaurally through earphones. For a 600 Hz tone, the neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, recorded in the IC of a cat, responds maximally at a ‘best ITD’ of 345 μs, close to the maximum natural ITD reported for cat (about 350 μs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth et al., 1980</xref>). In the Jeffress model, the textbook model of ITD processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeffress, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joris and Yin, 2007</xref>), ITD tuning arises from the detection of coincidences between spikes relayed from auditory nerve fibers tuned to the same frequency at the two ears, and the neuron responds maximally when the sound's ITD equals the mismatch in axonal conduction delay between inputs from the two cochleae. This model predicts that, for a given neuron, ITD tuning is independent of the sound's frequency. However, at 900 Hz, the neuron of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is tuned to an ITD of 158 μs and barely responds to an ITD of 345 μs, while at 400 Hz the neuron responds maximally at 500 μs and is much less responsive at 345 μs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In fact, the range of best ITDs that this neuron shows at different stimulus frequencies spans several hundred μs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is large considering that the maximum natural ITD in cats is ∼350 μs. Thus, the ITD tuning of this neuron varies broadly with sound frequency. This property has been observed in binaural neurons of many species, including cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin and Kuwada, 1983</xref>), guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAlpine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer and Kuwada, 2005</xref>), rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuwada et al., 1987</xref>), chinchilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bremen and Joris, 2013</xref>), gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>) and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldberg and Brown, 1969</xref>), but no functional significance has been associated with it. Readers should note that this property is observed <italic>within</italic> neurons as a function of frequency, and differs from the <italic>population</italic> property that has also been widely observed, where neurons tuned to low frequencies tend to have larger best ITDs than high-frequency neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAlpine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hancock and Delgutte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bremen and Joris, 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06072.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Frequency-dependence of best delays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Firing rate vs ITD for one neuron, to tones between 400 Hz (blue) and 1200 Hz (orange).

Finally, we show that slight mismatches in the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibers projecting to binaural neurons are a plausible mechanism to explain tuning to complex binaural features of ecological environments, and we show the existence of asymmetries in the spectral properties of MSO inputs using intracellular recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Frequency dependence of neural tuning</title><p>We examined ITD tuning in 186 IC neurons of cats tuned at a characteristic frequency (CF, frequency of lowest rate threshold) between 100 and 3300 Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The best ITD can be expressed relative to the period of the tone's frequency f, and is then called the best phase (BP): BP = best ITD × f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For a neuron with a fixed best ITD that does not depend on frequency, BP is a linear function of frequency with 0 y-intercept. But the neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> does not fit this simple relationship: a better fit is a linear relationship with an offset at 0 Hz, called the characteristic phase (CP), measured between −0.5 and 0.5 cycle. We computed circular-linear regressions for all 186 neurons, which were highly significant in most cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also other examples on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found that CP was broadly distributed across an entire cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the best ITD of many neurons is not fixed but depends on frequency. The slopes of linear regressions are called characteristic delays (CD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin and Kuwada, 1983</xref>). If neurons were tuned to fixed ITDs in the contralateral field, we would expect CDs to be distributed between approximately 0 μs and 350 μs. In our neurons, the CDs are mainly positive (corresponding to contralateral leading sounds) and mostly within the natural range of 350 μs, but a minority of cells have negative CDs (38%) and a smaller minority have CDs larger than 350 μs (19%, grey area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Most intriguingly, CDs are negatively correlated with CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We checked with bootstrap analysis that this negative correlation is not due to measurement artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these observations are consistent with previous findings in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin and Kuwada, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAlpine et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer and Kuwada, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Frequency dependence of ITD</title><p>We looked in the acoustics for a functional rationale for the frequency-dependence of neural tuning to ITD within single neurons. It is known that the acoustic ITD itself varies not only with spatial position but also with frequency, due to sound diffraction by head and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth et al., 1980</xref>). This variation can be quantified by analyzing head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), which measure the acoustical filtering of the head and body for sources at various positions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the variation of phase ITD with frequency for different source directions in an anaesthetized cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tollin and Koka, 2009</xref>). The ‘phase’ ITD reported here is the value of the ITD of a pure tone stimulus at a given frequency (see ‘Materials and methods’ for additional ITD definitions). These patterns are consistent with previous acoustical measurements in cats using tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth et al., 1980</xref>). We also found similar patterns in high-resolution recordings on a taxidermist model of a cat with a natural posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We checked that these patterns were not due to possible limitations of acoustical recordings by comparing them with numerical simulations of HRTF obtained on a 3D model of the same cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rébillat et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). The global structure of these patterns is consistent with a spherical model of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn, 1977</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, their fine structure depends on posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, cat's head in a different position), on the presence of a ground (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, spherical head model without and with a ground plane), and on whether the source is in the front or in the back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, solid vs dashed curves)—because of reflections on the body of the cat. We remark that reflections on the ground or on the body of the cat come too early to be separated from the direct signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourévitch and Brette, 2012</xref>) and they must be considered as an integral part of the binaural signal received by the animal.

In view of the dependence of the acoustical binaural cue (ITD) on frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the next question becomes how this compares to the neural dependence of best ITD on frequency. We tested whether the features seen in the electrophysiological data could be explained by the hypothesis that neurons are tuned to frequency-dependent ITDs as found in ecological environments. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> which shows frequency-dependent ITDs and zooms in on the frequency band 600–1000 Hz for 3 azimuths. If a neuron were tuned to a fixed ITD (e.g., 325 μs, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top), then it would be most responsive to different azimuths at different frequencies. On the other hand, if the neuron were tuned to a fixed spatial azimuth, then its best ITD would vary with frequency to match the variation of ITD with frequency at that position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom).

For each azimuth and center frequency, we extracted a CD and CP from the acoustical data. For example, for a 70° azimuth and center frequency of 800 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom), we approximate the interaural phase difference (IPD = ITD × f) for that location by a linear function of frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, purple line). The acoustical CD and CP are the slope and intercept of the linear regression. Other examples are shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Physically, the acoustical CD is the envelope ITD and the acoustical CP is the difference between envelope and fine structure ITD, expressed in cycles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then produced statistics by sampling center frequencies according to the CF distribution in the recorded neurons, and azimuths according to a uniform distribution in the contralateral hemifield (including front and back).</p><p>In agreement with the physiological data, the acoustic measurements show a unimodal and broad CP distribution, with a small but significant positive bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

While some large neural CDs (&gt;500 μs) lie outside the range of ITDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), all remain inside the range of acoustical CD. Finally, the acoustic data also show an inverse correlation between CD and CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In a simple spherical head model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), ITDs are larger at low frequency than at high frequency, but these variations are small on a local scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhn, 1977</xref>]). However, variations appear on a local frequency scale as soon as features of ecological environments are introduced, such as diffraction on the complex shape of head and body of real animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), or early reflections off the ground (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourévitch and Brette, 2012</xref>]). As a result of these variations, the IPD vs frequency curve is non-linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). When a tangent is moved along this curve (dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the slope decreases at the same time as the intercept increases. Because slope and intercept correspond to acoustical CD and CP, this means that for neurons tuned to the same spatial configuration but different frequencies, CD and CP should be inversely correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). These variations in CD and CP across frequency are small for a simple spherical head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), but they become large as soon as a ground plane is included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We note that reflections off the ground cannot be temporally separated from the direct signal because delays are very short (about 150 μs for a source 1.5 m away from the cat's head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourévitch and Brette, 2012</xref>]) and must thus be considered as part of the signal reaching the two ears. Thus the acoustical space encountered by the animal cannot be adequately described by fixed ITDs.

Note that the CP distribution is centered on 0 because we symmetrized the distribution by representing each fiber pair twice to simulate random mismatches between the inputs from the two sides, where sometimes the ipsilateral fiber is higher in CF and sometimes the contralateral fiber (i.e., reflecting both positive and negative CF mismatches).

It can also be obtained by considering mismatches in axonal conduction delays, in addition to CF mismatches: axonal delays add to the CD without changing the CP.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that these neurons are tuned to binaural features of ecological acoustic space rather than to a fixed ITD. Moreover, we find that the binaural tuning observed does not need complex wiring but could be based in a rather straightforward way on properties of the auditory periphery.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ecological interaural time disparities, and constraints on binaural sensitivity</title><p>The binaural tuning in our sample of IC neurons, quantified with traditional measures of CD and CP, matches that of many previous physiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmer and Kuwada, 2005</xref>). However, we go further by making an explicit comparison with distributions of the same metrics applied to acoustical measurements. This leads to two new insights. First, we provide evidence that the distribution of neural CDs and CPs and acoustical CDs and CPs are similarly constrained. Second, large CDs are present acoustically. Taken together our results suggest that the binaural tuning of IC cells is constrained by the range of delays that the animal experiences.</p><p>Our findings and interpretation relate to two points that have been much discussed in the literature. Non-zero CPs in the neural data have puzzled investigators since the first reports of ITD-sensitivity, both in terms of their physiological origin and their functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rose et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin and Kuwada, 1983</xref>). Perhaps even more puzzling has been the discrepancy observed between the distribution of physiological CDs and acoustical (phase) ITDs, for example, as reported in HRTF measurements (for cat: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tollin and Koka, 2009</xref>], and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As was pointed out since the first physiological data became available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McFadden, 1973</xref>), neuronal CDs seem to cover an ‘unnecessarily’ wide range including ITDs that animals will not naturally encounter. Various interpretations have been given to this discrepancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McAlpine et al., 2001</xref>). However, the appropriate comparison is not between physiological CDs and acoustical phase ITDs, but with acoustical CDs (i.e., envelope ITDs). As shown here for acoustical measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), due to the frequency dependence of the phase ITD, CDs have a wide distribution and actually exceed the range of physiological CDs. The range of acoustical CDs that drives a given cell can therefore exceed the range of phase ITDs computed from HRTF data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Complexity of ecological acoustical environments</title><p>Because the frequency-dependence of ITD reported here reflects the physical interaction of the sound with the ears, head, body, and ground plane, it should also apply to other species.

We have focused here on the contribution of sound diffraction by the head and body, a phenomenon that is always present, even in anechoic environments. Because the effect depends on the detailed morphology of the animal, it varies with posture in a systematic way (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rébillat et al., 2014</xref>]). Early reflections, in particular from the ground (again a constant element in ecological environments of terrestrial animals), produce interferences with the direct sound that result in large frequency-dependent variations of ITD, especially at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourévitch and Brette, 2012</xref>). Ground reflections typically arrive very shortly after the direct sound and are therefore an integral part of the binaural signal received by the animal. The interferences they produce are determined primarily by the delay of the reflection (related to the distance) and secondarily by the nature of the reflecting object (grass, sand, snow, etc). There are many other sources of complexity in ecological environments. For example, natural sound sources are rarely point sources producing spherical wavefronts, as assumed in most studies. Many are large (a river) and directional (human speech), some are partially occluded by objects (a prey hiding in a bush). The sound of one's own footstep travels through air but also through the body, which produces different acoustical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hood, 1962</xref>). We suggest that the binaural system of animals is adapted to these complex natural acoustical cues.</p><p>This complexity must be addressed by any sound localization theory and imposes particular difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodman and Brette, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>). For example, if ITD depends on the position of the pinnae, or posture, as is the case for the cat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tollin and Koka, 2009</xref>]), then proprioceptive information must be taken into account to interpret binaural cues. Unarguably, this property makes the task more difficult for the animal, but not more difficult than taking into account other known causes of ITD variation—such as source distance and elevation—when mapping ITD to source direction.</p><p>The fact that ITD depends on factors other than azimuthal position implies that binaural neurons in the MSO are not tuned to source direction per se, but rather to temporal binaural features of acoustical spaces—a notion that generalizes frequency-independent ITD. If binaural tuning develops from exposure to natural sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seidl and Grothe, 2005</xref>), then it would be expected that its properties reflect those of ecological acoustical environments, especially given that very small cochlear disparities give rise to significant frequency-dependence of ITD tuning in binaural neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We can think of two ways of testing the hypothesis that binaural neurons are tuned to properties of ecological acoustical spaces. One is to raise animals in environments with structured but manipulated acoustical cues (as opposed to unstructured noise as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seidl and Grothe, 2005</xref>]), for example using earplugs, and observe the changes in ITD tuning of binaural neurons. Another one is to measure spatial receptive fields of binaural neurons (instead of ITD selectivity curves) and test whether they depend on spectral properties of sounds.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of ITD tuning</title><p>In previous work, nonlinear phase-frequency relationships (i.e., where the best ITD is not constant) are typically considered to be ‘biological noise’. Thus, even though frequency-dependent best ITDs are clearly an important characteristic of the physiological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), there are to our knowledge no functional interpretations of this characteristic. The observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that CF mismatches can generate nonlinear phase-frequency relationships (CP ≠ 0), combined with the presence of such relationships in the binaural and acoustic data, suggest a rather simple new view on neural binaural properties. The view is that limitations in the accuracy of wiring in the binaural system produce a property that benefits binaural hearing. Refinements of this wiring in combination with mismatches in axonal delays produce a range of binaural sensitivities well-matched to the acoustic scenes that the system is faced with. It was previously shown that random CF mismatches in the wiring to the contralateral and ipsilateral pathways to IC could account for the negative correlation between CF and range of best ITDs measured with delayed noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joris et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that appropriate CF and axonal delay mismatches can account for the dependence of best ITD on tone frequency within single cells, matching acoustical properties.</p><p>Besides cochlear disparities, a range of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the best delays of ITD-sensitive neurons: axonal length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeffress, 1948</xref>), phase-locked inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand et al., 2002</xref>), asymmetric placement of the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>), asymmetry in synaptic kinetics between contra- and ipsilateral inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jercog et al., 2010</xref>), differences in axonal conduction time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>), and phase delays generated by the interaction of intrinsic properties with input spike patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franken et al., 2015</xref>). All of these proposals face difficulties to explain all the data available, and it is at present unclear which of these mechanisms, or perhaps mix of mechanisms, is in place, or whether perhaps the main mechanism has not been identified yet. Moreover, discussions of these various mechanisms usually focus on CD, leaving it unclear whether and how they would affect CP. Axonal length and conduction time are expected to generate pure time delays and would therefore not generate CPs different from 0. The report first proposing phase-locked inhibition as a source of internal delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand et al., 2002</xref>) provided model results illustrating how best ITD at different frequencies was little affected by stimulus frequency, that is, also predicted that inhibition would be equivalent to a pure time delay (CP = 0). Later, more extensive modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>) showed that adjustment of model inhibitory parameters allows creation of a wide range of non-zero CP values, but that CP remained within 0.1 cycle when more realistic inhibitory synaptic time constants were used. To our knowledge, asymmetrical axonal placement and asymmetry in synaptic kinetics have not been examined regarding a possible contribution to CP. However, these two proposals, as well as phase-locked inhibition, received little experimental support from a recent in vivo intracellular MSO study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franken et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cochlear disparities have been proposed before as a mechanism for generating internal delays, in place of axonal delay mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroeder, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shamma et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonham and Lewis, 1999</xref>). The original form of that hypothesis, where such disparities are the sole source of internal delays, has been rejected in the barn owl: CF mismatches are observed but they are relatively small and do not correlate with ITD tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pena et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer and Peña, 2009</xref>). They are nonetheless significant as they contribute predicted delays of up to 50 μs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pena et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, in contrast with the original cochlear disparity hypothesis, our proposed mechanism combines small CF mismatches (just 40 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and axonal delay mismatches. A mix of cochlear disparities and pure time delays was also proposed to account for non-linear phase-frequency relationships observed in gerbil MSO responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>). In cat MSO, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yin and Chan, 1990</xref>) reported that monaural best frequencies differed by 0.2 octaves or less for 13 of the 18 cells (and more for 5 cells). As we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, this order of magnitude is sufficient to produce the observed frequency-dependence of best ITD. Intracellular recordings from MSO neurons allowed us to directly measure the monaural inputs and confirm that they can differ in spectral properties. Additional experiments are needed to compare frequency-dependent properties of ITD tuning with the mismatched frequency tuning of monaural inputs.</p><p>Our data are from the IC, one synapse removed from the sites of binaural interaction. In our mechanistic explanation, we have assumed that frequency-dependent properties of ITD tuning observed in IC neurons are inherited from the MSO. This is in agreement with electrophysiological data in the MSO of cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yin and Chan, 1990</xref>) and gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Heijden et al., 2013</xref>), which also show frequency-dependent ITD tuning (broad distributions of CP). Alternatively, nonlinearities at the level of the IC could reflect convergence of inputs, for example, from binaural neurons in MSO, LSO, and DNLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McAlpine et al., 1998</xref>). For example, LSO neurons have CP close to 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joris, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tollin and Yin, 2005</xref>). Neurons with CP close to 0 have been categorized as ‘peakers’, because peaks of their ITD selectivity curves align across frequency, while neurons with CP close to 0.5 have been categorized as ‘troughers’, because troughs align across frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batra et al., 1997</xref>). These two categories are traditionally considered as predominantly reflecting MSO or LSO input, respectively. Neurons with intermediate CP are then categorized as ‘tweeners’, presumably reflecting a combination of MSO and LSO inputs. However, our electrophysiological data showed no clear categories in the distribution of CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Instead, the distribution was broad and unimodal around CP = 0, which argues against the categorization of cells as peaker, trougher, and tweener. In addition, electrophysiological studies in the MSO of cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yin and Chan, 1990</xref>) and gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>) also show cells with non-zero CP. Our auditory nerve data shows that very small mismatches in CF of inputs to binaural cells are sufficient to produce significantly non-zero CP, without postulating any additional mechanism than coincidence detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In summary, while the mechanisms of ITD tuning remain unclear, one attractive feature of cochlear disparities is that they provide a simple mechanism to generate non-zero CPs, which we show here are a likely desirable property of the binaural system as they match the acoustics that animals face, when combined with a physiological source of pure time delays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>Our methods for single unit recording have been described before: in the cat IC and auditory nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joris et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>), and in the gerbil MSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Franken et al., 2015</xref>).

We want to reject the null hypothesis that the cells have uniformly distributed BP between −0.5 and 0.5 cycles, using the residual error as a statistic. We generate surrogate data under the null hypothesis, the only parameter of interest being the number of measured frequency points. We then perform the circular linear fit and measure the residual error. We obtain the probability distribution of observing a given residual error under the null hypothesis, for every possible number of frequency points. The cumulative of that distribution gives the linearity significance measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Correlated noise is then added to each datapoint, according to the distribution previously measured in bootstrap samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Correlation is then measured across all data points using Spearman's rank correlation ρ (which does not require linearity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The procedure is repeated 10<sup>6</sup> times so as to obtain a distribution of ρ, which is slightly biased towards negative values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>), reflecting the negative correlation in the added noise. Comparing the measured correlation in the original data to the cumulative of the distribution on the surrogate data provides us with a p-value of 10<sup>−6</sup>, thus we can safely reject the hypothesis that the observed CP-CD correlation is due to the co-variation of linear regression estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acoustical measurements</title><p>HRTFs of an anesthetized cat were obtained from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tollin and Koka, 2009</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers, one of whom, Catherine Carr, has agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript is written well and figures are organized clearly. The authors make the case that environmental factors pose challenges to understand sound localization as simple mapping of azimuth through ITDs. While neither the HRTF or ITD results are new, the interpretation of them is, and calls into question the simplest interpretation of the currently dominant two-channel model. Thus, a major strength of this paper is the connection between the features seen in the electrophysiological data and the hypothesis that neurons are tuned to frequency-dependent ITDs as found in ecological environments. By analogy, incorporating statistics of natural stimuli have changed our understanding of early vision.</p><p>The concerns raised by the two reviewers are substantial and largely complementary to one another. Some of the concerns relate to clarifying what is new in the present study versus ground that has been covered in other publications noted by the reviewers.</p><p>1) A similar model and similar conclusions for the IC were previously published by Joris (PNAS, 2006). Please clarify whether the current analysis was based on the same data, and whether the main new finding is the tie to the ecologically appropriate HRTFs.</p><p>2) The concept of frequency mismatches and cochlear delays (stereausis), first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shamma (1989)</xref> has been tested and rejected many times. To be more convincing, please thoroughly discuss results that show there are frequency differences in ipsi- and contralateral inputs into MSO.</p><p>3) With respect to testing the model, please discuss recently published data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Heijden et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Day and Semple, 2011</xref>, that cover some of the same ground as in this paper, with fewer neurons but with the more difficult recordings from MSO. Could some of your findings reflect processing in the MSO as opposed to in the IC?</p><p>4) The frequency-dependence of ITD at a particular azimuth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would be better presented with more detail. Fits to frequency vs ITD or IPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B, C</xref>) for constant azimuth are presented for a bandwidth limited to a linear portion of the frequency vs. ITD plot. How were these bandwidths selected for frequencies lying near maxima or minima of these plots?</p><p>5) A few more examples of neural best phase (BP) vs frequency plots would convey the range of data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1D</xref>, and appearing in published studies, deviation from linearity is greatest at high frequency. In the acoustic data, the greatest deviation shown from Tollin and Koka is at low frequency. Are the neural data shown here not representative, or is the suggestion made from using taxidermy or spherical models that the Tollin and Koka data may not be so representative of a more typical environmental situation?</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, distributions of CP and CD are provided, based upon the distribution of neural CFs. It would be useful to know the distribution of neural CFs in the sample and also which features of the ITD vs frequency at constant azimuth plots yield the varying values of CD and CP (at least positive vs negative values). That is, do particular features of these graphs depend upon the neural sample of CF, noting that the sample may not reflect the actual distribution of CF in the inferior colliculus?</p><p>7) Predictions of the inverse relationship between CD and CP are shown for acoustic measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but negative CDs seem not to be as prevalent as in the neural data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data are collected for a spherical head model. If feasible, please consider exploring this idea using data measured by Tollin and Koka from living cats, to determine if a broader range of CPs and more negative CDs are achieved.</p><p>8) The general discussion would be more directed if you consider relative contributions of CF mismatch, acoustic environment and inhibition in generating BP vs frequency plots. Essentially, this discussion may help explain why there are relatively fewer non-physiological ITDs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>.</p><p>9) You apparently aim toward a test of your ideas whereby awake animals would listen to a range of frequencies emanating from a closely spaced set of azimuthal locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) during single unit recordings.

Please clarify whether the current analysis was based on the same data, and whether the main new finding is the tie to the ecologically appropriate HRTFs</italic>.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joris et al. (2006)</xref> study was in fact quite different from this study. The focus in that study was on the problem of the dependence of best ITD on CF across populations of IC neurons. Best ITD was measured with delayed noise (not tones). Specifically, it was shown that 1) cochlear disparity can create significant delays; 2) a fixed distance mismatch along the cochleae can create an inverse correlation between best ITD and CF in binaural neurons.</p><p>The question we address is different. We ask what is the origin of the dependence of best ITD on <italic>stimulus</italic> frequency (not characteristic frequency), where this dependence is measured for each cell (not across cells). We show that this dependence measured in cells matches the acoustic dependence of ITD on frequency measured in HRTFs, which suggests that cells are tuned to acoustical properties of natural environments (rather than measuring fixed ITDs). Accordingly, our analysis of data has focused on characteristic phase (CP) and characteristic delay (CD), which are measures of the dependence of best ITD on stimulus frequency, and those were not addressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joris et al. (2006)</xref>.</p><p>In the same way, we showed here that the cochlear disparity model can produce significant frequency-dependence of best ITD (not CF-dependence) within a given binaural cell, as measured by CP. As discussed below, we also propose that a combination of cochlear mismatches and axonal delay mismatches can explain the variety of CP and CD observed in cells.</p><p>Finally, regarding the data, data shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joris et al. (2006)</xref> are responses to noise, not to tones. In the experimental data we report, the frequency of the tonal stimulus is varied, in contrast with the previous study where the stimulus was a broadband noise that was identical for all fibers studied. This allowed us to compute pseudo-binaural curves for different frequencies, and in turn extract CP and CD measures for each cell.</p><p>We clarified these points in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The concept of frequency mismatches and cochlear delays (stereausis), first proposed by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43"><italic>Shamma (1989)</italic></xref> <italic>has been tested and rejected many times. To be more convincing, please thoroughly discuss results that show there are frequency differences in ipsi- and contralateral inputs into MSO</italic>.</p><p>The stereausis model (first advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroeder, 1977</xref>) proposes that cochlear mismatches are used instead of axonal delay mismatches, to generate internal delays. We propose that cochlear mismatches are used in addition to axonal delay mismatches, to generate appropriate frequency-dependence of internal delays.</p><p>The stereausis model in its original form (not the one we propose) has been rejected in the barn owl nucleus laminaris, not in mammals. Our proposition addresses ITD tuning in mammals, but we can briefly comment on findings in the barn owl. It has been found in NL that CF mismatches between monaural inputs to a binaural cell are small but significant and asymmetrical (Peña et al., J Neurosci 2001; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer and Peña, Biol Cybern 2009</xref>). However there was no correlation with ITD tuning, which contradicts the stereausis model (i.e. that the cochlear mismatch is the main determinant of best ITD). But this does not mean that CF mismatches did not contribute to ITD tuning at all. On the contrary, Peña et al. (J Neurosci 2001) report that the CF mismatches were large enough to create predicted delays of up to 50 µs, which is quite substantial for barn owls. Thus the available data in barn owls contradict the original stereausis model, but not ours. The CF mismatches that we show are necessary to obtain the required frequency-dependence of best ITD are small (40 Hz in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), unlike the large differences required in the original stereausis model.</p><p>In mammals, there is unfortunately little data on CF mismatches in the monaural inputs to MSO neurons. In cats, Yin and Chan (J Neurophy 1990) report (p 480) that BFs (not CFs) were generally similar for both ears: they differed by 0.2 octaves or less for 13 of the 18 cells. As we show on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, this order of magnitude is sufficient to produce the observed frequency-dependence of best ITD. In gerbils, Day and Semple (J Neurophy, 2011) also found frequency-dependent best ITDs in MSO neurons. They showed that those relationships could be explained using a periphery model by a combination of cochlear mismatches and axonal delays (i.e., similar to our proposition, not original stereausis), but unfortunately there was no direct physiological evidence in that study.</p><p>Thus, while the original stereausis model does not appear consistent with earlier data, our proposition is to strengthen the hypothesis, we show in the revised manuscript an analysis of in vivo intracellular recordings in gerbil MSO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It shows in 6 cells the monaural EPSP rate as a function of tone frequency for both sides. It appears that there can indeed be differences in frequency tuning between ipsi- and contralateral inputs. Additional experiments would be needed to relate those differences with the frequency-dependence of ITD tuning.</p><p>We added a paragraph in the Discussion to address these points.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to testing the model, please discuss recently published data by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46"><italic>van der Heijden et al., 2013</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><italic>Day and Semple, 2011</italic></xref><italic>, that cover some of the same ground as in this paper, with fewer neurons but with the more difficult recordings from MSO. Could some of your findings reflect processing in the MSO as opposed to in the IC?</italic></p><p>We agree that the questions we address would be ideally addressed in the MSO. As pointed out, MSO recordings are more challenging and this study required a large number of cells and stimulus conditions to be able to make statistical comparisons with acoustics. The mechanism we propose indeed applies primarily to the MSO, and it is assumed that ITD tuning in IC is inherited from MSO. This is to be contrasted with the proposition that complex ITD tuning in IC results from the integration of MSO cells with different center frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McAlpine et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In both papers mentioned above, it was shown that MSO neurons do have frequency-dependent ITD tuning, as we observed in our IC recordings. They also both suggest that those properties are primarily due to coincidences between excitatory inputs, as opposed to, for example, delays induced by inhibition. A recent intracellular in vivo study in MSO neurons shows that inhibition does not produce internal delays (Franken et al., Nat Neurosci 2015), contrary to previous claims (Brand et al., Nature 2002). This set of studies suggests indeed that our model and findings should primarily apply to the MSO. We added a paragraph in the Discussion. Finally, we added our own MSO data which address frequency tuning more directly than the MSO studies mentioned, and with intracellular recordings so a clean assessment could be made of the frequency tuning of the monaural inputs (point 3, above).</p><p><italic>4) The frequency-dependence of ITD at a particular azimuth (Figurr 3) would be better presented with more detail. Fits to frequency vs ITD or IPD (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figures 3B, C</italic></xref><italic>) for constant azimuth are presented for a bandwidth limited to a linear portion of the frequency vs. ITD plot</italic>. <italic>How were these bandwidths selected for frequencies lying near maxima or minima of these plots?</italic></p><p>In the revised text, we inserted an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) with more fits to frequency vs. IPD, which should clarify this point. The choice of bandwidth is explained in the Methods (roughly proportional to center frequency, reflecting cochlear filter bandwidths). Note that the linear regression is done not on the frequency-ITD plots, but on the frequency-IPD plots.</p><p><italic>5) A few more examples of neural best phase (BP) vs frequency plots would convey the range of data. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>, and appearing in published studies, deviation from linearity is greatest at high frequency. In the acoustic data, the greatest deviation shown from Tollin and Koka is at low frequency. Are the neural data shown here not representative, or is the suggestion made from using taxidermy or spherical models that the Tollin and Koka data may not be so representative of a more typical environmental situation?</italic></p><p>As suggested, we inserted an additional figure in the revised text showing more examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>). The high frequency points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, which deviate from the linear regression, contributes very little to the response of the cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, sync-rate) and therefore to the values of CP and CD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> shows that linear regressions are in fact quite accurate for most cells. We address the acoustical question in response to the next remark below.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, distributions of CP and CD are provided, based upon the distribution of neural CFs. It would be useful to know the distribution of neural CFs in the sample and also which features of the ITD vs frequency at constant azimuth plots yield the varying values of CD and CP (at least positive vs negative values). That is, do particular features of these graphs depend upon the neural sample of CF</italic>, <italic>noting that the sample may not reflect the actual distribution of CF in the inferior colliculus?</italic></p><p>We now show the distribution of CF and BF in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>). To address the question of dependence on CF, we performed the same analysis of acoustical CP and CD for low CF (&lt;1 kHz) and high CF (&gt;1 kHz), shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>. The features are qualitatively similar.</p><p><italic>7) Predictions of the inverse relationship between CD and CP are shown for acoustic measurements (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>), but negative CDs seem not to be as prevalent as in the neural data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>). These data are collected for a spherical head model. If feasible, please consider exploring this idea using data measured by Tollin and Koka from living cats, to determine if a broader range of CPs and more negative CDs are achieved</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> actually was based on Tollin and Koka’s data, not the spherical model. Indeed negative CDs are not as prevalent as in neural data. The proportion of negative CDs actually depends on the choice of distribution of azimuths, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> (we added percentages on the figure). In general, there tend to be more negative CDs when the azimuth is close to 0° or 180° (i.e. when ITDs are small). We discuss this point in more detail in the revised text, and added a figure showing the proportion of negative acoustical CDs as a function of azimuth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The general discussion would be more directed if you consider relative contributions of CF mismatch, acoustic environment and inhibition in generating BP vs frequency plots. Essentially, this discussion may help explain why there are relatively fewer non-physiological ITDs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6E</italic></xref> <italic>than in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref>.</p><p>We added a discussion of these different mechanisms. Note that CF mismatch and inhibition are two possible mechanisms; acoustic environment is not a mechanism, it is the target match for those two candidate mechanisms.</p><p>Note also that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> only includes CF mismatches, not axonal delay mismatches—this figure was meant to show that positive CPs can be obtained with CF mismatches, but we also postulate additional axonal delay mismatches.</p><p><italic>9) You apparently aim toward a test of your ideas whereby awake animals would listen to a range of frequencies emanating from a closely spaced set of azimuthal locations (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) during single unit recordings. Some suggestion of how, experimentally, to dissect acoustic and several neural mechanisms would help conclude this story</italic>.</p><p>We added some text in the revised discussion at the two relevant places. Indeed there are two distinct aspects to be tested. One is that binaural neurons are tuned to complex binaural invariants rather than fixed ITDs, and testing this hypothesis would involve measuring spatial receptive fields with sounds that differ in spectrum of spectrotemporal envelope. Another possibility is to raise animals with manipulated acoustical cues (for example with an earplug), and observe how properties of ITD tuning are changed. The other aspect is that such tuning might be produced by a combination of CF and axonal delay mismatch. This is only a proposed mechanism, which we find plausible. It could perhaps be tested with binaural reverse correlation and/or retrograde tracing in MSO neurons, but of course this is quite challenging, especially if it has to be done in many cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
