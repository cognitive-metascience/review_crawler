nuclei that contribute to action selection and reinforcement learning. The principal neurons of the striatum, spiny projection neurons of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways, maintain low intrinsic excitability, requiring convergent excitatory inputs to fire. Here, we examined the role of autophagy in mouse SPN physiology and animal behavior by generating conditional knockouts of Atg7 in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Loss of autophagy in either SPN population led to changes in motor learning but distinct effects on cellular physiology. dSPNs, but not iSPNs, required autophagy for normal dendritic structure and synaptic input. In contrast, iSPNs, but not dSPNs, were intrinsically hyperexcitable due to reduced function of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2. These findings define a novel mechanism by which autophagy regulates neuronal activity: control of intrinsic excitability via the regulation of potassium channel function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>intrinsic excitability</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>neuronal activity</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F30MH114390-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>Ori J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieberman</surname><given-names>Ori J</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffey</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA007418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>514813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS087112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santini</surname><given-names>Emanuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS063973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Ai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In addition to its classic role in synaptic function and plasticity, macroautophagy regulates neuronal intrinsic excitability via degradation of acetylated Kir2 channels to control neurotransmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although classically studied in the context of neurodegeneration, macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy, has recently been identified as a critical regulator of neuronal activity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nikoletopoulou and Tavernarakis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nixon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamamoto and Yue, 2014</xref>). Autophagy is a process in which proteins or organelles are enclosed in a double membrane organelle, known as an autophagosome, which then traffics to the lysosome for degradation of its cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klionsky, 2007</xref>). Autophagosomes also fuse with recycling endosomes, to form amphisomes that act as key intermediates for the degradation of endosomal cargo including plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eskelinen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamamoto and Yue, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy plays evolutionarily conserved roles in the regulation of synapse formation, structure and function. In early development, autophagic function is required presynaptically for axon pathfinding and circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stavoe et al., 2016</xref>) and, in mature neural circuits, the absence of presynaptic autophagy leads to deficits in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle recycling due to the accumulation of damaged synaptic vesicles or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vijayan and Verstreken, 2017</xref>). In excitatory projection neurons of the hippocampus and cortex, autophagy controls neurotransmission postsynaptically via the degradation of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors and synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD95 and Arc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rowland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sumitomo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Developmental synaptic pruning in the cortex is dependent on both neuronal and microglial autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lieberman et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>) and autophagic degradation of unidentified neuronal proteins contributes to hippocampal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glatigny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular process critical to proper synaptic function in the central nervous system.</p><p>The brain is, however, composed of heterogenous populations of neurons with distinctive patterns of activity determined by the interplay of a complement of ion channels and synaptic inputs. Whether autophagy regulates neurotransmission via distinct processes in specific classes of neurons remains unknown.</p><p>The striatum is the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, a collection of subcortical brain structures required for learning and executing goal-directed behaviors. In contrast to hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons where the contribution of autophagy to neurotransmission has been most studied, the striatum is composed of two intermixed and morphologically indistinguishable classes of GABAergic projection neurons: direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) spiny projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). SPNs receive convergent excitatory inputs from cortical and thalamic projection neurons, inhibitory input from local interneurons, and a variety of modulatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). SPN activity in response to these inputs is governed by their low intrinsic excitability and high latency to fire, necessitating coordinated excitatory synaptic inputs on dendritic spines and shafts to elicit an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>). The disruption of normal SPN activity produces deficits in motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durieux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>); motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carvalho Poyraz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kellendonk et al., 2006</xref>); and responses to drugs of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2006</xref>). Striatal dysfunction has also been linked to autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>), a disease in which autophagic dysfunction has been reported in mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poultney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). How autophagy contributes to striatal function and SPN physiology, however, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we generated conditional knockouts of Atg7, a protein required for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>), in dSPNs and iSPNs and find that loss of Atg7 in either SPN subtype led to behavioral abnormalities in the absence of neurodegeneration. Loss of Atg7 in dSPNs led to alterations in their dendritic arbor, dendritic spines and synaptic inputs, similar to that reported in pyramidal neurons. In contrast, dendritic arborization, spine density and synaptic inputs were not changed in iSPNs lacking Atg7. Instead, Atg7 in iSPNs was required for the function of the inwardly rectifying Kir2 channel, which maintains the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and low input resistance that are characteristic of SPNs. We found that ongoing Atg5- and Atg7-dependent autophagy contributes to the lysosomal delivery of endocytosed Kir2 channels and, in its absence, Kir2 channel abundance was <italic>elevated</italic> on the plasma membrane but exhibited <italic>reduced</italic> activity. We further found that the excess channels are inactivated by acetylation, explaining the intrinsic hyperexcitability of Atg7-deficient iSPNs. These results introduce the regulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability by autophagy, indicate how this occurs at a specific molecular target, and demonstrate a role for this pathway in normal behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of conditional knockout mice lacking autophagy in dSPNs or iSPNs</title><p>To address the role of autophagy in SPN physiology and striatal function, we generated separate lines of mice lacking Atg7 in dSPNs or iSPNs using Cre driver lines (CreDrd1aey262 for dSPNs and CreAdora2aKG139 for iSPNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>).

In a subset of cells, we confirmed that inward currents at V<sub>Hold</sub> = â70 mV were glutamatergic in origin by bath applying the AMPAR antagonist, CNQX (5 ÂµM) and outward currents at V<sub>Hold</sub>Â =Â 0 mV were GABAergic by bath application of picrotoxin (25 ÂµM; data not shown). We found a reduction in both mEPSC frequency and amplitude in dSPNs lacking Atg7 without a change in mIPSC frequency or amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâK</xref>). In iSPNs lacking Atg7, in contrast, neither mEPSC frequency and amplitude nor mIPSC frequency and amplitude were different than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâK</xref>), consistent with the absence of a change in dendritic length or spine density.

To address this, we virally overexpressed Kir2.1 in dSPNs or iSPNs from control, dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> or iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice. We hypothesized that if reduced Kir2 currents were driven by reduced expression of Kir2 channels, viral overexpression would normalize Kir2 currents in cells lacking Atg7.

To do this, we expressed a Kir2.1 fusion with a C-terminal FLAG and SNAP-tag (Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup>) in a well-validated, and transfectable line of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Atg5, a protein required for autophagosome biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuma et al., 2004</xref>). We chose to use a well-validated transformed MEF cell line lacking Atg5 in contrast to primary striatal culture for two reasons: (1) the maturation of SPN intrinsic excitability occurs postnatally, suggesting that the intrinsic excitability of dissociated SPNs in culture may depend on processes distinct from those <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuo and Liu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>); (2) almost all SPNs in primary culture express markers of dSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falk et al., 2006</xref>), and this population does not display Kir2 regulation by autophagy <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Transformed MEFs lacking Atg5 (Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs) transiently transfected with Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> demonstrated a higher steady-state level of Kir2.1 expressionÂ but reduced LC3B-ii/LC3B-i, a measurement of autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B-C</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated colocalization of Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> with YFP-LC3 puncta, a marker of autophagosomes, in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5IâJ</xref>). The colocalization of Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> with YFP-LC3 increased following incubation with bafilomycin to collapse the lysosomal pH gradient and block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5IâJ</xref>). We observed that the Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> colocalization with YFP-LC3 was dependent on Atg5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5IâJ</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of Atg5, we found a reduced number of Kir2.1<sup>+</sup>Lamp1<sup>+</sup> late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5KâL</xref>), supporting the conclusion that autophagy plays a role in the lysosomal degradation of Kir2.1.</p><p>To address whether Kir2.1 degradation itself was dependent on autophagy, we pulse-labeled transfected Atg5<sup>WT</sup> and Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs with SNAPcell ligand and fixed cells following a chase interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). We found that the half-life of labeled Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> was greatly extended in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> compared to Atg5<sup>WT</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). We further confirmed that the Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> half-life was extended in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs using a cycloheximide pulse-chase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2DâE</xref>). This demonstrates that autophagy is required for Kir2.1 degradation.</p><p>Thus, multiple independent approaches indicate that autophagy is required for Kir2.1 degradation. Previous reports have suggested that Kir2.1 is endocytosed and trafficked to the lysosome for degradation in an ESCRT-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolb et al., 2014</xref>). Autophagy could contribute to lysosomal degradation of Kir2.1 by affecting internalization and endocytosis, or the transport of endocytosed Kir2.1 to the lysosome. To address this, we engineered a hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Kir2.1<sup>extHA-FlagSNAP</sup>) into an extracellular loop of Kir2.1, at a site which has previously been used to tag the extracellular face of Kir2.1 without affecting channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). We labeled live Atg5<sup>WT</sup> or Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs transfected with Kir2.1<sup>extHA-FlagSNAP</sup> with anti-HA antibodies and measured the remaining surface resident-labeled channels after a chase period. We found no difference in the internalization of Kir2.1<sup>extHA-FlagSNAP</sup> in the absence of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>), suggesting that autophagy is required for Kir2.1 degradation at a post-endocytic step.</p><p>We generated primary Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs to confirm that Atg7, in addition to Atg5, was required for Kir2.1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We pulse labeled primary Atg7<sup>WT</sup> and Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs transfected with Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> and found an elevated level of SNAPcell-labeled Kir2.1<sup>FlagSNAP</sup> after a 120 min chase in Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that autophagy is required for the lysosomal delivery and degradation of endocytosed Kir2.1 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Lack of autophagy leads to increased surface levels of Kir2 channels despite reduced channel function</title><p>If autophagy is required for Kir2.1 degradation, but Kir2 channel abundance is elevated in the absence of autophagy, why are Kir2 currents decreased in cells lacking autophagy?

Kir2.1 K334R underwent significantly less degradation than Kir2.1 WT, K338R or K346R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that K334 is required for degradation of Kir2.1.</p><p>We assessed whether the Kir2.1 K334R channel was less acetylated in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs that WT channel. We transfected Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs with WT Kir2.1<sup>extHA-FlagSNAP</sup> or Kir2.1<sup>extHA-FlagSNAP</sup> K334R and immunoprecipitated lysates with an anti-HA antibody.

Emphasizing the need to understand autophagic function at the synapse, autophagic dysfunction has been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders that are thought to arise from synaptic deficits. Here, we investigated the role of autophagy in the function of both classes of GABAergic projection neurons in the striatum, a region implicated in the pathophysiology of several neurodevelopmental disorders. We found that, in dSPNs, the required autophagy gene, Atg7, is required for dendritic structure and spine density and the function of excitatory inputs onto dSPNs. In iSPNs, we did not detect changes in dendritic arborization, spine density or excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the absence of Atg7. In contrast, however, loss of Atg7 in iSPNs led to intrinsic hyperexcitability, due to reduced Kir2 function. We then demonstrated that Kir2 channels are degraded by autophagy and have decreased activity in the absence of autophagy. Furthermore, loss of Atg7 in either dSPNs or iSPNs led to deficits in behavioral tasks considered to depend at least in part on the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durieux et al., 2012</xref>). These results demonstrate that autophagy contributes to striatal function via distinct molecular pathways in dSPNs and iSPNs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Autophagic control of synaptic function in dSPNs</title><p>Autophagy is required for normal synaptic structure and function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, and excitatory neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glatigny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shen and Ganetzky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stavoe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vanhauwaert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). We report that, in dSPNs, loss of autophagy led to reduced complexity of the dendritic tree, lower dendritic spine density, and functional deficits in excitatory inputs. The mechanism through which autophagy may regulate dendritic structure and function in dSPNs remains unknown. Dendritic complexity and spine density can be controlled by neurotrophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2012</xref>), mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2004</xref>), neuromodulatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Villalba and Smith, 2013</xref>), and synaptic inputs and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez and Sabatini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lambot et al., 2016</xref>). Each of these cellular pathways is modulated by autophagy and therefore could lead to altered dSPN dendritic arborization and excitatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kononenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). A key unanswered question is whether these synaptic pathologies arise during early dSPN development or as a degenerative process and could be addressed via a longitudinal analysis of these parameters in dSPNAtg7cKO mice. We hypothesize that, given the dynamic changes in autophagic flux that occur in SPNs during early postnatal development (P10-P18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lieberman et al., 2019a</xref>), autophagy may play a role in dendritic growth and excitatory synaptogenesis on dSPNs.</p><p>Although we did not observe a difference between the dendritic morphology of dSPNs and iSPNs, there are conflicting reports on morphological differences between dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cepeda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">SuÃ¡rez et al., 2014</xref>).

Mechanistic studies aimed at defining how autophagy regulates synapse formation or maintenance would provide insight into how loss of the same cellular pathway could also yield reduced spine density in dSPNs.</p><p>Perhaps, most surprising is the fact that iSPNs that lack Atg7 do not show changes in dendritic complexity, spine density or excitatory inputs. One possible explanation would be a difference in the timing of Cre expression and Atg7 knockout between dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice. However, Cre-mediated recombination has been reported in both driver lines before postnatal day 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>), which is before excitatory synaptogenesis occurs in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hattori and McGeer, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tepper et al., 1998</xref>). An additional confounding factor may be Cre-mediated recombination that occurs in the cortex ofÂ dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice, which could synergize with dSPN loss of Atg7 to affect synaptic inputs (data not shown). iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice do not demonstrate Cre-mediated recombination outside of the striatum (data not shown). Future efforts to define the underlying mechanisms that contribute to cell-type-specific roles for autophagy in the striatum could include Cre-driver lines in which both dSPNs and iSPNs are targeted to rule out a contribution of different expression time courses between the Cre lines used in this study.</p><p>Alternatively, excitatory synaptogenesis onto iSPNs may occur in an autophagy-independent manner. Once the mechanism through which autophagy regulates dendritic complexity and synaptogenesis in dSPNs is identified, future studies could compare this process with iSPNs and define why loss of autophagy in iSPNs does not affect iSPN synaptogenesis.</p><p>Atg7 is also involved in non-autophagic processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis and secretion of lysosomal contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Subramani and Malhotra, 2013</xref>). It is possible that Atg7 contributes to dSPN dendritic morphology and synaptic inputs via these processes as opposed to âclassicalâ autophagic degradation. Future studies comparing loss of other autophagy-associated genes that do not contribute to LC3-associated phagocytosis or lysosomal exocytosis may provide further insight.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Autophagy regulates iSPN intrinsic excitability via Kir2 currents</title><p>In contrast to dSPNs, Atg7 was not required for excitatory or inhibitory transmission onto iSPNs. Rather, whole cell recordings revealed an intrinsic hyperexcitability in iSPNs lacking Atg7 that was characterized by a depolarized RMP, elevated input resistance, decreased rheobase and left-shifted current response curve.</p><p>SPN intrinsic excitability is tightly regulated by a complement of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nisenbaum et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>). At hyperpolarized potentials, the RMP and input resistance of the cell is determined by Kir2 currents, mediated by the Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazorla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karschin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). SPNs are thought to be depolarized from their resting potential of around â80 mV by the coordinated activity of excitatory inputs and once the cell reaches ~ â60 mV, the Kir2 current inactivates, and other potassium currents, such as I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>D</sub>, and I<sub>M</sub> regulate the number of action potentials fired and the spike frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kreitzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>). The depolarized RMP and increased input resistance around the RMP strongly support a primary role for reduced Kir2 currents in the hyperexcitable phenotype of iSPNs lacking Atg7.</p><p>Autophagy has not been previously implicated in the regulation of potassium channels. To address the mechanism through which Atg7 may control Kir2 channels and, in turn, neuronal activity, we conducted experiments in heterologous cells and <italic>in vivo</italic> in iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice with largely congruent results. We found that ectopically expressed Kir2.1 was localized in an LC3<sup>+</sup> compartment in MEFs in an Atg5-dependent manner. Treatment with Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the lysosomal proton pump which prevents fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and degradation of autophagic cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>), increased the number of Kir2.1<sup>+</sup> LC3<sup>+</sup> puncta. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Kir2.1 undergoes lysosomal degradation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolb et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, using the SNAPtag system and a cycloheximide pulse chase assay, we found that the half-life of Kir2.1 was greatly extended in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> and Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs. These data were supported by the finding that Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 protein levels were higher in the striatum of iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice without a change in mRNA expression. Together, these data indicate that Atg7-dependent autophagy is required for Kir2 function and degradation.</p><p>We further used a viral overexpression strategy to confirm that the decreased Kir2 activity in iSPNs lacking Atg7 did not arise from reduced Kir2 mRNA expression. Viral overexpression of Kir2.1 failed to increase Kir2 currents in iSPNs lacking Atg7, demonstrating that Atg7 is required for newly synthesized channels to become functional. This experiment also permitted us to acquire additional support for differences in Kir2 handling between dSPNs and iSPNs. Although Kir2.1 overexpression failed to increase Kir2 currents in iSPNs lacking Atg7, it did increase Kir2 currents in dSPNs lacking Atg7. These experiments support our conclusions that Atg7 is required for Kir2 channel function but not synthesis, and that dSPNs and iSPNs have different requirements for Atg7 in Kir2.1 activity. We hypothesize that newly synthesized Kir2.1 in iSPNs lacking Atg7 is acetylated and does not undergo autophagic degradation, preventing functional increases in Kir2.1 current.</p><p>Autophagy associated genes, such as Atg5 and Atg7, have been proposed to play a role in other cellular processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis, lysosomal exocytosis and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Subramani and Malhotra, 2013</xref>). Here, we argue that Kir2.1 is a direct substrate of autophagy for the following reasons. First, Kir2.1 degradation is deficient in <italic>both</italic> Atg5<sup>KO</sup> and Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs. Additional studies in cells lacking other required autophagy proteins such as Fip200 would further support this hypothesis. Second, we have demonstrated direct colocalization with LC3<sup>+</sup> vesicles and that the amount of Kir2.1 in LC3<sup>+</sup> vesicles increases in response to blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Finally, Kir2.1 internalization, measured with antibody feeding assays, is not affected in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs, arguing against a role of Atg5 in endocytosis of Kir2.1. Collectively, these data indicate that Kir2.1 must pass through an autophagy-dependent organelle, presumably an amphisome, before undergoing lysosomal degradation.</p><p>While autophagic degradation is classically initiated when cytosolic proteins are sequestered in newly formed autophagosomes or autophagic membranes surround membrane-bound organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klionsky, 2007</xref>), autophagy may be required for Kir2.1 degradation via a distinct mechanism. We found that autophagy is not required for Kir2.1 internalization, suggesting that autophagy acts at a post-endocytic step. Endosomes fuse with autophagosomes to form amphisomes, and this step is required for the degradation of some proteins and the overall function of the autophagosomal and endosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollenbeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rabinowitz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanchez-Wandelmer and Reggiori, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that Kir2.1<sup>+</sup> endosomes require fusion with an autophagic intermediate for lysosomal delivery. Alternatively, autophagic membranes may form de novo on the surface of Kir2.1<sup>+</sup> endosomes, leading to the lysosomal degradation of endosomal contents. We cannot exclude the possibility that Kir2 channels are endocytosed in early autophagic structures that mature into autophagosomes in an Atg5/7-dependent manner for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). These potential mechanisms are consistent with data demonstrating a role for autophagy in the degradation of other membrane proteins including Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), GluR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>), and the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Selectivity and cell-type specificity of the autophagic degradation of Kir2 channels</title><p>Recent work has highlighted a role for selective, as opposed to bulk, autophagy in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Here, we find that loss of autophagy does not lead to a global disruption of membrane or synaptic protein levels, but instead has relatively specific effects on Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 channels. For example, the protein level of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.2, which is expressed by both dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen et al., 2004</xref>) is not affected by loss of autophagy. Furthermore, components of the postsynaptic density, such as PSD95, which are degraded by autophagy in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2018</xref>), are not affected by loss of autophagy in dSPNs or iSPNs. Finally, AMPA receptors, which can be degraded by autophagy in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shehata et al., 2012</xref>), do not seem to be affected in iSPNs as mEPSC amplitude is unchanged in iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice. An unbiased proteomics approach in iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice would provide additional evidence for the relatively selective degradation of Kir2 channels in iSPNs.</p><p>How might this specificity be achieved? Other forms of selective autophagy depend on cargo adapter proteins which interact with autophagosomal proteins, such as LC3, and specific cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Svenning and Johansen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016</xref>). In some cases, autophagy cargo adapters select substrates depending on substrate post-translational modifications, providing an additional mechanism that could regulate selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, substrates can directly interact with autophagosome proteins via intrinsic LC3-interacting motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies should address possible cargo adapters that bind to Kir2 channels and are required for Kir2 channel degradation or whether Kir2 channels have intrinsic LC3-interacting motifs that could explain why Kir2 channels undergo autophagy-dependent degradation but other membrane proteins in iSPNs do not.</p><p>In contrast to iSPNs, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 abundance and Kir2 currents were unaffected by loss of autophagy in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice. As Kir2 channels are expressed in both populations of SPNs and play important roles in both dSPN and iSPN physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazorla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2007</xref>), these data suggest that the degradation of Kir2 channels by autophagy occurs via cell type-specific mechanisms. This cell-type specificity could arise from differential expression of cargo adapters, post-translational modification of Kir2 channels that target them for autophagic degradation, or increased activity of alternative endolysosomal protein degradation pathways that contribute to Kir2 degradation in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrosini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolb et al., 2014</xref>).

In iSPNs, however, loss of autophagy led to increased Kir2 abundance and decreased Kir2 current.</p><p>One possible explanation for the inverse correlation between Kir2 protein abundance and Kir2 current in iSPNs and MEFs lacking autophagy could be via changes in its trafficking or surface residence. However, we found that surface levels of heterologously expressed Kir2.1 were elevated in the absence of autophagy, and loss of autophagy was not associated with intracellular Kir2.1 inclusions or increased ER localization in MEFs. This was consistent with our subcellular fractionation results in striatal tissue from control and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice, which displayed no difference in the distribution of Kir2 channels but higher levels within each fraction. We thus conclude that autophagy is not required for Kir2 trafficking.</p><p>We, therefore, hypothesized that Kir2 channels were inhibited in the absence of autophagy via post-translational modification. We measured the relative levels of ubiquitination and acetylation, two PTMs that can target proteins for autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>), of Kir2.1 in autophagy-deficient cells. We found that acetylation but not ubiquitination of Kir2.1 increased in this condition. K334, a conserved lysine that is in the same intracellular loop as two other lysines that can be ubiquitinated in Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrosini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Ziv et al., 2011</xref>), was required for Kir2.1 degradation in Atg5<sup>WT</sup> cells. Mutation of K334 to arginine, which cannot be acetylated, rescued channel function in the absence of autophagy. Finally, changing K334 to an acetylation-mimic glutamine was sufficient to reduce channel function in Atg5<sup>WT</sup> cells. These results demonstrate that acetylation of Kir2.1 at K334 is required for proper channel degradation and function in the absence of autophagy.</p><p>While it is likely not the only acetylated residue on Kir2.1, we found that K334 acetylation plays a critical role in channel function and half-life. Although we were unable to biochemically isolate acetylated Kir2.1 in wild-type cells, the genetic evidence suggests that Kir2.1 acetylation at this residue is required for channel degradation. We hypothesize that acetylated Kir2.1 may represent a short-lived intermediate and that the channel is deacetylated when it reaches an Atg5-dependent organelle. Thus, in the absence of autophagy, acetylated Kir2.1 may never colocalize with its cognate deacetylase, explaining the elevated level of acetylated Kir2.1 in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs. Defining the specific acetyltransferase and deacetylase that control Kir2.1 acetylation would provide significant insight into how this process is regulated and whether this represents a response the physiological stimuli known to regulate Kir2.1 activity in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cazorla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although acetylation was initially described as a PTM for histones and other nuclear proteins, numerous examples suggest that acetylation may affect the function of non-nuclear proteins, including some proteins involved in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Narita et al., 2019</xref>). K334 is located within the Kir2 C-terminus, near regions that interact with obligate cofactors, suggesting a possible mechanism for how acetylation at this residue could affect channel function. Finally, it is attractive to speculate that Kir2 acetylation at K334 could act as a dynamic regulator of Kir2 currents over both long and short timescales: acetylation at K334 would not only reduce channel activity at the surface but also target Kir2 channels for autophagic degradation and affect long-term Kir2 activity.</p><p>Several alternative models could explain our data including decreased levels of a required cofactor for Kir2 in autophagy-deficient cells and changes in membrane localization that are below the detection limit of our approaches. Future examination of the Kir2 interactome in wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells could elucidate these mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for neuropsychiatric disorders with dysfunctional autophagy</title><p>We demonstrate here that the absence of autophagy in dSPNs or iSPNs results in deficits in striatal-based behaviors. Our data are consistent with reports of hyperactivity in the open-field and reduction of motor learning in multiple animal models with disrupted SPN function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durieux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">PeÃ§a et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). A disruption of striatal-based learning, hyperactivity and increased stereotypies, as seen in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice, is also observed in neurodevelopmental syndromes including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuccillo, 2016</xref>). Genetic variants in autophagy-associated genes are risk factors for the development of ASDs and reduced autophagic function is observed in human post-mortem tissue from ASD cases and in mouse models of the disease, suggesting that changes in autophagic function in the striatum in addition to other brain regions may contribute to the pathophysiology of ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lieberman et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poultney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Identifying the cell-type-specific effects of loss of autophagy in distinct neuronal subtypes may permit targeted development of therapeutics that act downstream of the autophagy machinery to correct neural circuit deficits and avoid undesired effects of non-specific autophagic activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (Mouse)</td><td>Atg7</td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/id/ENSMUSG00000030314">Ensembl:ENSMUSG00000030314</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Mouse)</td><td>Atg5</td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/id/ENSMUSG00000038160">Ensembl:ENSMUSG00000038160</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, Male and Female)</td><td>C57/Bl6J</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5Î±</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top">Cat #

Mice were backcrossed onto C57Bl6J mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> mice were a gift of Masaaki Komatsu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Komatsu et al., 2005</xref>) and backcrossed onto the C57Bl6 background. D1-tomato mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Drd1a-tdTomato)6Calak/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. iSPN<sup>Ctrl</sup> (Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>) and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> experimental mice were obtained as follows. A2Acre hemizygous mice were crossed with Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> mice. A2Acre Atg7<sup>Fl/wt</sup> offspring were crossed with Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> mice, yielding experimental offspring. For experiments with mice expressing the D1-tomato allele, either parent (A2Acre Atg7<sup>Fl/wt</sup> or Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>) harboring a single D1-tomato allele was used. The D1-tomato and the A2Acre alleles were always maintained in hemizygosity. The same strategy was used to generate dSPN<sup>Ctrl</sup> (Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>) and dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> (D1cre Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>) mice. For viral injections, some crosses included A2Acre Atg7<sup>Fl/wt</sup>, D1cre Atg7<sup>Fl/wt</sup> with Atg7<sup>Fl/wt</sup> to generate A2Acre Atg7<sup>wt/wt</sup> (or D1cre Atg7<sup>wt/wt</sup>) and A2Acre Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> (or D1cre Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>) littermates. Mice were housed on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. Mice were genotyped using Transnetyx genotyping services (Memphis, TN). Pups were weaned on postnatal day 18â21 into same sex groups of 3â5 mice. All subjects were randomly assigned to groups.

Two to four experimental mice are placed on the still rotarod (Ugo Basile) in one lane of the rotating drum (3 cm in diameter, textured to avoid slips) for two minutes. The mice are returned to the homecage for thirty minutes. Mice are then returned to the rotarod, rotating at a constant speed for 5 rpm, for 2 min, followed by return to the homecage for thirty minutes. For the first experimental session (Trial 1), experimental mice are placed on the rotating drum. The rotating speed of the Rotarod (Ugo Basile) is set at 5 rpm. Once all mice are steady, the rotation speed is gradually increase from 5 to 40 rpm over a 5-min period. Latency to fall is recorded automatically when the animal lands on the sensing platform below each lane or when the mouse grabbed on to the drum and executed a full revolution without running. To avoid injury, a cut-off latency of 300 s is applied to each trial. Animals were returned to the home cage for 30 min followed by two additional trials.

Cells in the dorsal striatum were identified using a 40X water immersion objective and IR/DIC optics. D1-tomato, mCherry or GFP fluorescence was observed as indicated. Liquid junction potential was not corrected. Data were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Signals were acquired on an Axon Instruments Axopatch 200B, digitized on a Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments). All recordings were made within 6 hr of slice preparation.</p><p>For synaptic recordings (in voltage clamp), whole cell recordings were established with glass pipettes (3â6 MÎ©) filled with internal solution of (in mM): 120 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 10 TEA, 1 mg/mL Qx314 Bromide, pH 7.25.

Median interevent interval was used to calculate the event frequency and median peak amplitude is presented. For mIPSC traces, a threshold of 3 standard deviations was set. Settings were determined following manual inspection of a subset of records (from both control and cKO neurons) and then kept the same for final analysis of all traces.</p><p>For current clamp recordings, glass pipets were filled with (in mM): 115 potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 20 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgATP, 0.2 NaGTP adjusted to pH 7.25 with KOH, osmolarity 285 mOsm.

Images were captured using an Orca Flash 4 V3 camera (Hamamatsu) and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). For all experiments, specified fluorescence (i.e. SNAPcell ligand, surface signal) was normalized to FLAG fluorescence intensity (total Kir2.1 protein) for each cell to control for variations in the level of Kir2.1 expression following transient transfection. Exposures were set to ensure that no pixels were saturated. The exposure times were constant for each fluorescence channel across condition. For each transfection (independent replicate) at least 20 cells from three to four fields were imaged. In all experiments, data was combined from at least three independent replicates, unless otherwise specified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Image analysis</title><sec id="s4-23-1"><title>Brain slice</title><p>NeuN, p62, or D1-tomato -positive cells were manually counted in single Z-planes of 500 Âµm<sup>2</sup> containing the dorsal striatum. Cells were counted from 4 to 8 images per animal. RNAScope puncta were manually counted in single Z-planes. The number of cells counted are listed in the Figure legend and arise from sections from at least four mice. All counting was conducted by an observer blind to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>For analysis of colocalization of Kir2.1 puncta with organelle markers (YFP-LC3, Lamp1, or EEA1), a mask was created using a multiple threshold analysis plugin on ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgkvist et al., 2015</xref>) over YFP-LC3, Lamp1, or EEA1 puncta in single, mid-nuclear Z-planes. Results were similar when data were combined from multiple Z-sections per cell. Puncta with Kir2.1 intensity greater than two standard deviations above the background were considered Kir2.1+.</p><p>Kir2.1-FLAG-SNAP degradation was analyzed using epifluorescent images (as described above) and ImageJ. ROIs were set over cells in the FLAG channel (total Kir2.1) and the mean intensity of this ROI was collected from the FLAG channel and the SNAPcell labeled channel (pulse-labeled Kir2.1). The ratio of SNAPcell intensity of FLAG intensity was determined for each ROI to normalize SNAPcell intensity to total Kir2.1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>). This ratio was collected form the specified number of cells and combined from three individual coverslips (separate transfections and labeling) per time point.</p><p>A similar approach was taken to analyze surface staining of Kir2.1-extHA-FLAG-SNAP or Kir2.1 internalization. An ROI was drawn over cells in the FLAG channel (total Kir2.1) and the mean intensity of the FLAG channel and the HA channel was collected. The intensity of the HA channel was normalized against the FLAG intensity for each cell/ROI.

Electrophysiology data was analyzed offline using Clampfit Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California). Statistical analysis was conducted in GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA). No explicit power analysis was used but group sizes were determined based on past work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lieberman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). Comparisons between two groups were made with a two-tailed, unpaired t-test. Comparisons between two or more groups were made with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. Comparisons with two variables were made with a two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests unless otherwise specified. For electrophysiology N is the number of cells recorded from and the number of mice is listed in parentheses. Data were not formally tested for being parametric. Some datasets were formally tests for outliers with the Grubbsâ test with a cutoff of p&lt;0.05. RNAScope data (puncta per cell) were analyzed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study succinctly demonstrates, through multiple orthogonal approaches and powerful conditional models, that macroautophagy can control neurotransmission and animal behavior with cell-type dependent mechanisms. The demonstration that hyperexcitability arises in iSPNs in the striatum due to loss of macroautophagy and Kir2-channel acetylation accumulation provides a mechanism to understand these observations. In other populations of striatal projection neurons, dSPNs, loss of macroautophagy led to more dramatic dendritic morphological changes. These are some of the first demonstrations of autophagy control of neuronal intrinsic excitability and highlights how strikingly different the effects of the same macroautophagy depletion can be on biochemically/morphologically similar cells. Many readers will be left with the important impression that one cannot a priori assume how different neuronal populations will respond to inhibition of autophagy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cell-type specific regulation of neuronal intrinsic excitability by macroautophagy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Andrew B West as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Austen J Milnerwood (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers and Editors have all discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a dense body of work that is overall compelling and comprehensive, focusing on mice that combine Drd1-Cre and Adora2A-Cre with Atg7-fl/fl. The report has many strengths â autophagy in both dPSN and iPSN with electrophysiology analysis; describing a novel autophagy substrate Kir2 and potential molecular basis for its degradation and inhibition; and cell type-specific degradation of Kir2 in the brain, etc. This is solid work from a lab that has published many interesting reports on the role of autophagy in neuronal function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers thought the manuscript was still in a draft format, with critical errors in cross-referencing figures, as well as sub-optimal organization for <italic>eLife</italic>. As described in the compendium of points made below, the manuscript is not ready for publication and was unnecessarily difficult to read through. A careful rewriting and re-editing is necessary.</p><p>2) Overall, reviewers thought that some experiments were underpowered (based on the proposed effect size, or say, a rodent experiment with few animals), and these should be distinguished better from central points (perhaps these data moved to supplement). In turn, some of the supplemental that presented critical data should be moved into the main figure set. Further, sex should be an included as a co-variable and mentioned in all legends, as well as additional clarity as to the total number of animals involved in each experiment. In general, all reviewers felt the strength of the conclusions did not always match the experimental rigor, so the text may need to be more conservatively modified in this regard.</p><p>3) The discourse is lacking elements of critical interpretation and alternative explanations, in general, which we think will lessen the impact of the work for some readers. Some relevant (specific) points to consider are listed below:</p><p>Reformatting: Figure 6 (confusingly referred to as Supplemental Figure 5 in the Results section?) should probably be a main figure with a broader discussion. Similarly, Figure 1 is very important and demonstrates functionally the success of the model in achieving autophagy deficiency in the majority of SPNs (with the D1-tomato being a very nice control here). There are no space requirements that should necessitate the constant flipping between supplement and main figure files for important experiment results. Along these lines, the abstract is overly tight and awkwardly crafted in flipping back and forth between the iSPN and dSPN data.</p><p>Interpretation: Does the timing of autophagy deficiency and p62 accumulation with respect to the developmental stage of outgrowth and synapse formation account for some of the phenotypic differences between iSPNs and dSPNs observed? (Does Drd1 and Adora2 expression activate in the exact same phase of SPN maturation, and even with that, could differential Cre strength (i.e., expression of Cre) exact a delay in recombination in iSPNs compared to dSPNs?)</p><p>Interpretation: the authors relatively ignore why the iSPNs are relatively resistant to the morphological changes caused by autophagy deficiency seen in other neurons, but more discussion here could help interpretation.</p><p>Interpretation: It is intriguing that accumulation of Kir2 occurs only in Atg7 specific deletion iPSN but not dPSN. If Kir2 is indeed a substrate of autophagy as the study indicated, it is puzzling that cKO of Atg7 in dPSN does not cause Kir2 accumulation. The authors could consider in the text the possibility that the phenotypes observed in Atg7 cKO mice are non-autophagy related, unless the authors also examined additional cKO mice in dPSN specific manner with another Atg deletion. Otherwise I suggest modifying the use of &quot;autophagy&quot; only throughout the manuscript in interpreting the data; at least for the conclusion &quot;Atg7-mediated autophagy&quot; could be better.</p><p>Interpretation: Reviewers were not satisfied by the stated explanation for the inhibition of Kir2 activity due to acetylation caused by lack of Atg7 or autophagy in iPSN. For example, the increased level of Kir2 and lack of Kir2-over-expression rescue seemingly necessitates a major fraction of Kir2 protein acetylated. But in theory those Kir2 that are destined for degradation only will be modified and inhibited. Therefore, additional mechanisms could be involved in the inhibition. How common is it for the Kir2 channel to be degraded by autophagy in CNS neurons in general? Would dPSN be an unusual cell type for Kir2 not being degraded by autophagy? Or autophagy is not essential for Kir2 degradation in dPSN? Speculate the mechanism?</p><p>Interpretation: In the second paragraph of the Introduction, the author should cite the previous work on dopamine neuron specific autophagy deficiency that causes reduced striatal dopamine transmission (Friedman LG, et al., 2012). In general, the Discussion section should be better focused.</p><p>Interpretation: No difference between D1 and D2 control morphology, unlike other reports e.g., Gertler 2006. Should be discussed? More of a concern, representative (best traces?) very choppy / noisy, especially for slice recording where baselines are usually very clean. This is a concern because the average mEPSC and mIPSC amplitudes are coming out at 5-7pA, I worry about what has been included in these data (what are the Ra and IRMS for these recordings?). Evoked currents in Figure S2 C, grouped data should be shown, not overlaid curves; moreover for this an n of 7 is not sufficient, such numbers can be achieved in single day / mouse preparation.</p><p>Interpretation: Figure 5 For the fractionation experiment I recommend they use the same terminology in the manuscript, the figure and the supplements. In the blot for Kir2.1 and 2.3, a close examination suggests either image handling issue or some weird stitching artefact. There are three white diagonal lines passing in kir2.1 KO P3, and for kir2.3 blot in ctrl S2 and ko SPNs. The reviewers must see (and the document must contain) high resolution original (uncropped) images of blots.</p><p>Interpretation: Figure 6 seems clear but where is the proof that the K334R is less acetylated (as in 6.A)? Related, what about the acetylation status of the Kir2.1 or 2.3 in the dSPN Atg7<sup>KO</sup>?</p><p>Interpretation: Figure 1) Effect size exaggerated by y axis starting above zero in two cases. Male and female mouse weights are different, good reason to split the data, but this should be maintained for all analyses (clear why it wasn't see below). Further, body weight should be taken into account, for rotarod especially, where weight and performance are tightly (negatively) correlated. Since this is a negative correlation, this may reveal differences between the two KO lines, however, see below. It is also of interest that the D1 mice, despite being bad, improve their performance (learn) over the three trials, as well as controls, whereas d2 do not.</p><p>Interpretation: how has the specificity of the Kir2.1 and 2.3 antibody been validated? There is very little info on the suppliers website and their antibody detected Kir2.1 in overexpressing cos cells, but not rat brain? is this a concern? Recommend some in house validation (with flag variants shown later in paper?),</p><p>The following areas suffer from &quot;low N&quot; problem. These experiments either need adequate sample size or should not be included in the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 1) Only 3 mice assessed for D1 dSPN and p62 ranging from only 50% and up. Justify?</p><p>Two of the clearest behavioral phenotypes (latency to fall and grooming bouts) are not even close to confidence at p=0.2 in males, and significance is only achieved by grouping the sexes. To support definitive claims about the effects of these deletions on behavior, the behavioral assessment must be more rigorous.</p><p>For slice data the number of cells and the number of animals from which these came should be given and at least 4 or 5 animals minimum; even in other more complete data sets in the main document sometimes the animal n=3, which is why I expect the information is buried in a table and not presented with the data. Recommend this would be at least 12-15 cells, animal n of 4 or 5 and presented throughout. Further, the evoked currents in S2.D appear to be emerging from the stimulus artefact, and more so in the dSPNcko, this will impact upon amplitude measures. The stimulating electrode is likely too close to the cell if there is no latency to the response. The current clamp data is much more clearly produced, the authors might consider removing the voltage clamp results, or increasing their observations a lot.</p><p>The three datum in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 are important but far too few against which to conclude there is no change (a strong trend exists) in Kir2.1 for dSPN atg7ko; especially given the huge range shown in figure 4G for iSPN with 9 data points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50843.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a dense body of work that is overall compelling and comprehensive, focusing on mice that combine Drd1-Cre and Adora2A-Cre with Atg7-fl/fl.

In turn, some of the supplemental that presented critical data should be moved into the main figure set. Further, sex should be an included as a co-variable and mentioned in all legends, as well as additional clarity as to the total number of animals involved in each experiment. In general, all reviewers felt the strength of the conclusions did not always match the experimental rigor, so the text may need to be more conservatively modified in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments and believe that the additional data in the revised manuscript strengthens its conclusions. We now include 7 additional mice in the analysis of the cell-type specificity of Cre-mediated recombination in Figure 1; 36 mice of both sexes in the behavioral analysis in Figure 2; 13 mice in electrophysiological experiments in Figure 3 and Figure 6; and 28 mice in biochemical experiments in Figure 5 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Please note that for many of the conclusions in this manuscript, we present data from multiple orthogonal approaches (for example, combining in vivo biochemistry with heterologous systems) that provide congruent findings.

We performed two-way ANOVAs for each behavioral task, with sex and genotype as factors, and did not find a significant interaction between sex and genotype in any behavioral task (see Table 1). We thus conclude that sex does not significantly modify the genotype effect in these experiments and use pooled data from both sexes in subsequent figures. Furthermore, as we did not initially design these experiments to detect sex-related differences, we are underpowered to make claims about any sex differences in the electrophysiology and biochemistry experiments. We have added a statement in the Results section clarifying this:</p><p>âNote that we have combined data from both sexes in this analysis. We did not design these experiments to detect sex differences, as there was no interaction between sex and genotype in the behavioral analysis.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discourse is lacking elements of critical interpretation and alternative explanations, in general, which we think will lessen the impact of the work for some readers.

Our responses and changes to the manuscript are detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Reformatting: Figure 6 (confusingly referred to as Supplemental Figure 5 in the Results section?) should probably be a main figure with a broader discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the incorrect reference to this figure in the original submission. We now include this figure as a main figure (Figure 6 in the revised manuscript) as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>In addition, we have extended our description of this experiment in the Results section and added a section about this figure in the Discussion section:</p><p>From the Results section:</p><p>âAlthough autophagy has previously been shown to regulate integral plasma membrane proteins by controlling membrane protein trafficking, interaction with partners, or degradation (Gao et al., 2018; Rowland et al., 2006; Shehata et al., 2012; Sumitomo et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018), the unexpected inverse relationship between total Kir2 protein and Kir2 current in iSPNs lacking Atg7 warranted further validation.

The principal neurons of the striatum, GABAergic spiny projection neurons of the direct (dSPN) and indirect (iSPN) pathways, maintain low intrinsic excitability and require convergent excitatory inputs to fire and thereby filter information before transmitting it to basal ganglia output nuclei. What cellular mechanisms ensure proper synaptic and intrinsic properties in SPNs? Recent findings indicate that macroautophagy regulates synaptic activity in excitatory neurons, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, and nematode neurons. Here, we examined the role of autophagy in SPN physiology and animal behavior by generating conditional knockouts of Atg7 in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Loss of autophagy in either SPN population led to changes in motor learning but distinct effects on cellular physiology. dSPNs, but not iSPNs, required autophagy for normal dendritic structure and synaptic input. In contrast, iSPNs, but not dSPNs, were intrinsically hyperexcitable. iSPN intrinsic hyperexcitability arose from reduced function of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2. In the absence of autophagy, total and surface levels of Kir2 protein were elevated but Kir2 activity was inhibited by acetylation. These findings define a novel mechanism by which autophagy regulates neuronal activity: control of intrinsic excitability via the regulation of potassium channel function.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Interpretation: Does the timing of autophagy deficiency and p62 accumulation with respect to the developmental stage of outgrowth and synapse formation account for some of the phenotypic differences between iSPNs and dSPNs observed? (Does Drd1 and Adora2 expression activate in the exact same phase of SPN maturation, and even with that, could differential Cre strength (i.e., expression of Cre) exact a delay in recombination in iSPNs compared to dSPNs?)</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps the most striking and surprising findings in our study are the divergent consequences that loss of autophagy has on dSPNs and iSPNs. While a possible explanation could be differences in the age at which Cre expression occurs between the D1cre and A2Acre driver lines, the deletions both occur well before the changes in excitability.</p><p>In detail, both Cre driver lines used in this study (D1cre ey262 and A2Acre KG139) demonstrate widespread expression in the appropriate cell type by postnatal day 7 (Kozorovitskiy et al., 2015, 2012), which is before the maturation of SPN intrinsic excitability and the main period of striatal synaptogenesis (Lieberman et al., 2018; Peixoto et al., 2016; Tepper et al., 1998). In addition, we confirmed that similar numbers of p62+ cells are present in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice at P28, the age at which the electrophysiological recordings in Figure 3 and Figure 4 were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Furthermore, similar fractions of dSPNs and iSPNs display p62 inclusions in the respective conditional knockouts during adulthood (Figure 1).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Similar numbers of p62+ cells in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> and iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> striatum at P28.</title><p>Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50843-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Please also note that the approach we have taken to compare the effect of loss of a particular protein in dSPNs or iSPNs (use Credriver lines) has been reported previously in the literature with these same specific Cre driver lines (Daigle et al., 2014; Hutton et al., 2017; Koranda et al., 2018; Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012; Lambot et al., 2016; Rothwell et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2013; Urs et al., 2016, 2012).</p><p>This evidence suggests to us that the difference in the timing of Cre expression does not affect the distinct phenotypes observed between conditional knockout lines in this study and emphasizes the validity of this approach in analyzing cell-type specific effects of loss of autophagy on dSPNs and iSPNs. We think that the data provide support for an important implication of this study: that autophagy may be required in distinct cell types at different developmental windows.</p><p>In further comparison between cre lines, in the ey262 D1cre driver line, cortical recombination occurs as previously described (Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012), but this is absent in the A2Acre line (data not shown). The loss of autophagy in some populations of cortical neurons may contribute to the synaptic changes in dSPNs and, at this time, we are unable to exclude this possibility; however, we have attempted to address this in two ways. First, if the synaptic deficits arise solely due to presynaptic loss of Atg7, we would expect that mEPSC frequency would be different in iSPNs from dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice because dSPNs and iSPNs share most cortical inputs (Guo et al., 2015). mEPSC frequency and amplitude was not different in iSPNs from dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> compared to dSPN<sup>Atg7ctrl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We have chosen not to include this data in the revised submission because we do not have corresponding data in dSPNs from iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice, but are happy to discuss this if the reviewers feel strongly.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>No change in mEPSC frequency or amplitude in iSPNs from dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice.</title><p>mEPSCs were recorded from iSPNs in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice and compared to control iSPNs.

This suggests that at the time of our recording, there is no difference in the paired pulse ratio of excitatory inputs onto dSPNs (and so no apparent change in release probability) and, therefore, the change in mEPSC frequency in dSPNS from dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice does not arise from ongoing dysfunction of presynaptic inputs. As per the reviewer suggestions below (see response to that point), we have not included this data in the revised submission.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the Results section mentioning that equal numbers of p62+ cells are present in the striatum at P28.

This is a particularly interesting question given that dSPNs do have these changes.</p><p>Unfortunately, little is known about how autophagy may control neuronal morphology (O. J. Lieberman et al., 2019; Nikoletopoulou and Tavernarakis, 2018). Possibilities include changes in mitochondrial function, response to neurotrophic factors, and differential response by the cytoskeleton to neuromodulatory signaling. Future efforts will focus on comparing the effect of loss of autophagy on these molecular pathways in dSPNs and iSPNs. These possibilities are addressed in additional paragraphs in the new Discussion section:</p><p>âExcitatory synaptogenesis onto iSPNs may occur in an autophagy-independent manner. Once the mechanism through which autophagy regulates dendritic complexity and synaptogenesis in dSPNs is identified, future studies could compare this process with iSPNs and define why loss of autophagy in iSPNs does not affect iSPN synaptogenesis.â</p><p>and</p><p>âAutophagy is required for normal synaptic structure and function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction, and excitatory neurons in the mouse cortex and hippocampus (Glatigny et al., 2019; Nikoletopoulou et al., 2017; Shehata et al., 2012; Shen and Ganetzky, 2009; Stavoe et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2014; Vanhauwaert et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2018). [â¦] We hypothesize that, given the dynamic changes in autophagic flux that occur in SPNs during early postnatal development (P10-P18; (O. Lieberman et al., 2019)), autophagy may play a role in dendritic growth and excitatory synaptogenesis on dSPNs.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interpretation: It is intriguing that accumulation of Kir2 occurs only in Atg7 specific deletion iPSN but not dPSN. If Kir2 is indeed a substrate of autophagy as the study indicated, it is puzzling that cKO of Atg7 in dPSN does not cause Kir2 accumulation. The authors could consider in the text the possibility that the phenotypes observed in Atg7 cKO mice are non-autophagy related, unless the authors also examined additional cKO mice in dPSN specific manner with another Atg deletion. Otherwise I suggest modifying the use of &quot;autophagy&quot; only throughout the manuscript in interpreting the data; at least for the conclusion &quot;Atg7-mediated autophagy&quot; could be better.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, Atg7, although initially identified as required gene for macroautophagy, plays roles in other cellular processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis and secretion of lysosomal contents (Subramani and Malhotra, 2013). Please note that while we only examined Atg7 conditional knockout mice, we found that Kir2.1 degradation was disrupted in both Atg7<sup>KO</sup> and Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs, suggesting additional autophagy-associated genes are required for the phenotype we observe. Nevertheless, the morphological and synaptic deficits observed in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> may arise from an autophagy-independent role of Atg7, and moreover, Kir2 degradation may occur through autophagy-independent but Atg5 and Atg7-dependent processes. As the reviewer suggests, we have modified the language in our manuscript to emphasize that we are addressing the role of Atg7 in these neuronal population, and that this may affect additional cellular processes besides autophagy. We have added three sections to the Discussion section that address this point as follows:</p><p>We have added a section to the Discussion raising the possibility that the observed phenotypes are not mediated by autophagy per se:</p><p>âAtg7 is also involved in non-autophagic processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis and secretion of lysosomal contents (Subramani and Malhotra, 2013). It is possible that Atg7 contributes to dSPN dendritic morphology and synaptic inputs via these processes as opposed to âclassicalâ autophagic degradation. Future studies comparing loss of other autophagy-associated genes that do not contribute to LC3-associated phagocytosis or lysosomal exocytosis may provide further insight.â</p><p>We have also included an expanded section in the Discussion section about the cell-type specific differences in Kir2 degradation observed in the striatum:</p><p>âIn contrast to iSPNs, Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 abundance and Kir2 currents were unaffected by loss of autophagy in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice. As Kir2 channels are expressed in both populations of SPNs and play important roles in both dSPN and iSPN physiology (Cazorla et al., 2012; Gertler et al., 2008; Lieberman et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2007), these data suggest that the degradation of Kir2 channels by autophagy occurs via cell type-specific mechanisms. This cell-type specificity could arise from differential expression of cargo adapters, post-translational modification of Kir2 channels that target them for autophagic degradation, or increased activity of alternative endolysosomal protein degradation pathways that contribute to Kir2 degradation in cardiomyocytes (Ambrosini et al., 2014; Jansen et al., 2008; Kolb et al., 2014). Future work will focus on the mechanism that confers cell-type specificity to the autophagic degradation of Kir2 channels.â</p><p>Finally, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion section outlining the evidence for our conclusion that Atg7 is required for autophagic degradation of Kir2 channels:</p><p>âAutophagy associated genes, such as Atg5 and Atg7, have been proposed to play a role in other cellular processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis, lysosomal exocytosis and endocytosis (Subramani and Malhotra, 2013). Here, we argue that Kir2.1 is a direct substrate of autophagy for the following reasons. First, Kir2.1 degradation is deficient in both Atg5<sup>KO</sup> and Atg7<sup>KO</sup> MEFs. Additional studies in cells lacking other required autophagy proteins such as Fip200 would further support this hypothesis. Second, we have demonstrated direct colocalization with LC3<sup>+</sup> vesicles and that the amount of Kir2.1 in LC3<sup>+</sup> vesicles increases in response to blockade of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Finally, Kir2.1 internalization, measured with antibody feeding assays, is not affected in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs, arguing against a role of Atg5 in endocytosis of Kir2.1. Collectively, these data indicate that Kir2.1 must pass through an autophagy-dependent organelle, presumably an amphisome, before undergoing lysosomal degradation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Interpretation: Reviewers were not satisfied by the stated explanation for the inhibition of Kir2 activity due to acetylation caused by lack of Atg7 or autophagy in iPSN. For example, the increased level of Kir2 and lack of Kir2-over-expression rescue seemingly necessitates a major fraction of Kir2 protein acetylated. But in theory those Kir2 that are destined for degradation only will be modified and inhibited. Therefore, additional mechanisms could be involved in the inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We agree that our data would suggest a model in which a large fraction of Kir2 channels would be acetylated in iSPNs or MEFs lacking autophagy. We propose that Kir2 channels must be acetylated to undergo autophagic degradation, and that this process proceeds unchecked in iSPNs or MEFs lacking autophagy as the acetylated channel is no longer degraded by autophagy or deacetylated in an autophagy-dependent organelle.</p><p>Although this model explains the data we present in this manuscript, alternative possibilities exist that we have not ruled out. For example, Kir2.1 may be unable to interact with a required cofactor in Atg5<sup>KO</sup> MEFs or iSPNs lacking Atg7. Alternatively, we cannot exclude changes in Kir2 localization that our techniques were not sensitive enough to detect.</p><p>To address these alternative mechanisms for Kir2.1 inhibition, we have conducted additional experiments and added a paragraph to the Discussion section.</p><p>First, we measured the effect of increasing PIP2 levels in iSPNs lacking autophagy. PIP2 is a required lipid cofactor for Kir2 activity. To address whether this interaction is reduced in iSPNs lacking autophagy, we included diC8-PIP2, a water soluble PIP2 analog, which is sufficient to rescue reduced Kir2 activity in other models of SPN hyperexcitability (Lieberman et al., 2018), to our internal solution but found no effect on Kir2 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). In WT cells, diC8-PIP2 does not have an effect on Kir2 currents as the PIP2 binding site on Kir2 channels are</p><p>saturated under baseline conditions (Logothetis et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2008). In contrast, if decreases in PIP2 binding to Kir2 were responsible for the Kir2 inhibition in autophagy-deficient cells, diC8-PIP2 should increase Kir2 currents. The absence of an effect of diC8-PIP2 in autophagy-deficient iSPNs suggests that the loss of autophagy does not affect Kir2 interaction with PIP2. We have chosen not to include this in the revised manuscript as this was not part of a comprehensive characterization of Kir2 interactors, but can include it if the reviewers feel strongly that it should be a part of</p><p>this manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Increasing cellular PIP<sub>2</sub> levels does not rescue Kir2 currents in Atg7-deficient iSPNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) diC8-PIP2 (50 Î¼M) was included in the intracellular solution.

We quantified the surface levels of WT, K334R and K334Q Kir2.1</p><p>in both Atg5WT and AtgKO MEFs. In this experiment, we reproduced the increased surface levels of Kir2.1 WT in Atg5KO compared to Atg5WT MEFs. However, the surface levels of the K334R and K334Q mutants were not different that WT Kir2.1 in either Atg5WT or Atg5KO MEFs. These data provide additional mechanistic insight into how acetylation status of Kir2.1 at K334 could affect Kir2 channel activity: it must do so by regulating function at the surface as opposed to controlling surface residence. Future studies aimed at defining the biophysical mechanism for Kir2 channel inhibition in this system are warranted.</p><p>We have added an additional section to the Discussion where we enumerate alternatives to the model we propose:</p><p>âSeveral alternative models could explain our data including decreased levels of a required cofactor for Kir2 in autophagy-deficient cells and changes in membrane localization that are below the detection limit of our approaches. Future examination of the Kir2 interactome in wild-type and autophagy-deficient cells could elucidate these mechanisms.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How common is it for the Kir2 channel to be degraded by autophagy in CNS neurons in general? Would dPSN be an unusual cell type for Kir2 not being degraded by autophagy? Or autophagy is not essential for Kir2 degradation in dPSN? Speculate the mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>Kir2 channel degradation has not been examined in any detail in other CNS neurons. However, in cardiomyocytes, strong evidence supports a role for lysosomal degradation, but it is unclear if this occurs downstream of autophagy per se and/or other endosomal degradation pathways. Additional experiments comparing Kir2 channel handling in other neuronal populations would provide insight into these processes.</p><p>With regard to the lack of Kir2 accumulation in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice, we do not believe that this affects our conclusion that in iSPNs (and in cultured MEFs) Kir2 is degraded via an Atg5/7-dependent process (referred to here as autophagy). The evidence for autophagic degradation of Kir2 is: (1) Kir2 degradation is dependent on Atg7 and Atg5 in MEFs, and Atg7 in iSPNs; (2) Kir2.1 localizes in an LC3+ compartment in an Atg5-dependent manner in MEFs; (3) raising the lysosomal pH by treating cells with bafilomycin increases localization of Kir2.1 to an LC3+ compartment.</p><p>In dSPNs, alternative mechanisms must be in place for Kir2 degradation. For example, in cardiomyocytes, Kir2 channels may be degraded via alternative endolysosomal mechanisms, although the interaction between Kir2 and autophagy has not been formally examined in the heart (Ambrosini et al., 2014; Jansen et al., 2008; Kolb et al., 2014). At a molecular level, differences in the localization, expression, or activity of the (yet unidentified) acetyltransferase required for Kir2 degradation in some cell types may not guide Kir2 towards autophagic degradation in dSPNs. Alternatively, the (yet unidentified) adapter protein that recruits Kir2 to the Atg7-dependent autophagic intermediate may also be differentially expressed in dSPNs. Finally, we note that the absence of Kir2 accumulation in dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> may not mean that Kir2 is not degraded by autophagy under basal conditions, but may instead suggest that dSPNs, but not iSPNs, possess a compensatory mechanism that is activated in the absence of autophagy and prevent Kir2 accumulation. Ongoing efforts in our lab are aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms that promote autophagic degradation of Kir2 and their identification will lead to new hypotheses about the difference between Kir2 trafficking in dSPNs and iSPNs.</p><p>We have included a new paragraph in the Discussion section speculating on possible mechanisms for the cell-type specific degradation of Kir2.1, as shown above in response to Intepretation point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Interpretation: In the second paragraph of the Introduction, the author should cite the previous work on dopamine neuron specific autophagy deficiency that causes reduced striatal dopamine transmission (Friedman LG, et al., 2012).

Although Gertler and Surmeier (Gertler et al., 2008) report differences in dendritic length between SPN subtypes, others do not find differences (Cepeda et al., 2008; SuÃ¡rez et al., 2014). In our data, we do not see a clear difference in total dendritic length or dendritic complexity between control dSPNs and iSPNs; however, we note that this was not a preplanned comparison. We have added a sentence to the Discussion section where we note this difference that exists in the literature:</p><p>âAlthough we did not observe a difference between the dendritic morphology of dSPNs and iSPNs, there are conflicting reports on morphological differences between dSPNs and iSPNs (Cepeda et al., 2008; Gertler et al., 2008; SuÃ¡rez et al., 2014).

We have replaced the corresponding sample traces in Figure 3 of the revised submission.</p><p>The root mean square noise on the rig in which this data was collected is consistently between 1.5-2.5 pA. The median mEPSC amplitudes in our recordings are ~ 10 pA, &gt;3x the rms noise. Series resistance was monitored online both before and after the recorded epochs in which mEPSCs or mIPSCs were measured. If series resistance was &gt;25 MOhms or changed by &gt;20%, the cells were excluded. These criteria are clearly stated in the Materials and methods section of the original and revised manuscripts.</p><p>In addition, we analyzed the data using a custom Igor script that has been published and used repeatedly by our lab and others (Mosharov and Sulzer, 2005). Peaks are detected using the first derivative of the trace and the amplitude of the called peaks must then exceed a user-defined number of standard deviations (SD) of the root mean square noise. The SD cutoffs were set as 4x for mEPSCs and 3x for mIPSCs as described in the methods section. We are thus confident that our mEPSC and mIPSC data contain appropriate information that endorses the conclusions from Figure 3 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the evoked EPSCs, as per the reviewersâ suggestion below, we have removed the input/output curves originally in Figure S2 of the original submission. Nevertheless, we emphasize that as stated in the Materials and methods section: all electrophysiology data arose from at least 3 mice (usually 4-5 mice) and all cell culture experiments were independently replicated in at least three separate experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation: Figure 5 For the fractionation experiment I recommend they use the same terminology in the manuscript, the figure and the supplements.

Further, body weight should be taken into account, for rotarod especially, where weight and performance are tightly (negatively) correlated. Since this is a negative correlation, this may reveal differences between the two KO lines, however, see below.

We agree that this may suggest that the dSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice may be performing worse on the rotarod than iSPN<sup>Atg7cKO</sup> mice because their latency to fall was similar, but they weighed significantly less.

To increase the confidence in our analysis, we performed immunohistochemistry on 3 additional control mice (Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup>D1T), 3 additional dSPNAtg7<sup>cKO</sup> mice (D1cre Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> D1T) and 1 additional iSPNAtg7<sup>cKO</sup> mouse(A2Acre Atg7<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> D1T). We have combined this data with data from the original submission in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 (see discussion above).

In addition, we find that approximately 15% of the p62+ cells are D1-tomato negative (putative iSPNs).
